We took a unique systems approach to relate patient survival to immune gene expression in &#x0003e;3,500 tumor RNAseq profiles from a dozen tumor types. We found significant links between immune gene expression and patient survival in 8/12 tumor types, with tumors partitioned by gene expression comprising distinct molecular subtypes. T/NK cell genes were most clearly survival-related for melanoma, head and neck, and bladder tumors, whereas myeloid cell genes were most clearly survival-related with kidney and breast tumors. T/NK or myeloid cell gene expression was linked to poor prognosis in bladder and kidney tumors, respectively, suggesting tumor-specific immunosuppressive checkpoints. Our results suggest new biomarkers for existing cancer immunotherapies and identify targets for new immunotherapies.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by contributions to the Benaroya Research Institute (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.benaroyaresearch.org/">https://www.benaroyaresearch.org/</ext-link>).

One particularly promising therapeutic approach, termed 'checkpoint blockade' [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], utilizes monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that block immune-inhibitory pathways switched on by cancer cells. Despite advances, cancer immunotherapy is not always effective and may be associated with significant safety issues [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], leading to intensive efforts to identify biomarkers for better patient selection [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It remains unclear why some tumors respond to immunotherapy and why others do not (i.e., why some tumors are more &#x0201c;immunogenic&#x0201d; than others).</p><p>One predictor of cancer patient prognosis is the presence and location of immune infiltrates within tumors. Immunohistochemical studies have shown that immune cell infiltrates in tumors at diagnosis can be linked to favorable clinical outcome [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Expression profiling has also provided evidence of immune cell infiltrates and their relationship to patient survival in cancer. Comparisons of multiple different molecular profiling studies have suggested common themes in immune cell infiltrates across different tumor types reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. More recent studies have suggested that a therapeutic response to anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) requires pre-existing PD-1/PD-L1-regulated T cells within tumors [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Despite abundant evidence linking tumor immune infiltrates with patient prognosis and response to therapy, most studies have focused on single tumor types and comparisons across different tumors largely have been based on literature comparisons [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Resolving the uncertainties and gaps in our knowledge would benefit from a direct, side-by-side comparison of immune mechanisms influencing patient survival across different tumor types. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a comprehensive effort to apply genome analysis technologies to accelerate understanding of the molecular basis of cancer [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In particular, the Pan-Cancer initiative involving the first 12 tumor types profiled by TCGA has been used to identify commonalities and differences across tumor lineages, including survival comparisons of patients with tumors of different molecular subtypes [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] We reasoned that TCGA RNAseq data from the Pan-Cancer initiative could be used for side-by-side testing to identify immune signatures linked to patient survival, both within and between different tumor types.</p><p>We recently described a novel approach, termed module analysis, to analyze melanoma RNA sequencing expression data (RNAseq) for immune cells and pathways linked to patient survival [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Our studies showed that levels of type I interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), and T cell genes in melanomas at the time of diagnosis significantly predicted patient survival. In the present study, we have used expanded modular gene expression analysis on combined data from the TCGA Pan-Cancer and melanoma profiling initiatives. We present for the first time a comparison of immune cells and pathways associated with patient survival across a dozen different tumor types. The results provide a richer look at immune cell infiltrates and patient survival than has been possible with previous studies focused on individual tumor types.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Different immune processes are associated with patient survival after tumor detection</title><p>We analyzed a combined set of &#x0003e;3,500 RNAseq profiles from the TCGA Pan-Cancer and melanoma profiling initiatives (Experimental Procedures).

Briefly, this involved testing whether levels of immune gene sets (modules) in tumors could predict patient survival. To minimize biases, we chose not to aggregate clinical data from disparate tumor types, but instead analyzed each tumor dataset separately, using the procedures that we validated in our previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For the current studies, we developed a custom set of transcript modules whose expression was most associated with selected marker genes (immune molecular modules, <xref rid="pone.0138726.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0138726.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> Tables).</p><p>We chose to use custom modules rather than previously described transcript modules [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] for several reasons. A major reason was that previously described transcript modules vary widely in the numbers of genes they comprise [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This introduces a complicating variable (set size differences) into survival comparisons of tumor subsets. Using custom modules of equivalent set size mitigates this problem. The use of custom modules also allowed us to preselect a set of markers to use as queries that are not well represented in previous module sets. Finally, our custom modules can be organized into groups or clusters by their degree of gene overlap (Experimental Procedures and [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]). These clusters of overlapping modules permit greater insight into the scope and depth of transcriptional programs in immune cell infiltrates, as well as specificity control. Our approach was validated by our previous demonstration of a strong ISG response in melanomas [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For the present studies, we used a more inclusive set of marker genes and a larger data set to identify modules.</p><p>In preliminary experiments, we compared survival of tumor subsets of varying size. In other experiments, we determined optimal grouping for survival comparisons by subjecting samples to hierarchical clustering according to module expression. We used this method previously to show that ISG expression levels were dose-dependent in their ability to predict melanoma patient survival [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In general, we found consistent results using sample subsets of different sizes, which justified the selection of an arbitrary standard for sample set size. For the experiments reported here, we used expression of module genes to partition each of the tumor data sets (module partitions) into subsets with greater or less than median expression of module genes (designated module hi and module lo subsets, respectively) [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>We then compared survival curves of the two patient subsets using a log-rank test [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We used this procedure to test all immune molecular modules (N = 526) for their ability to predict survival in each of 12 tumor types (<xref rid="pone.0138726.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>). Also shown in <xref rid="pone.0138726.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref> are the prognostic values of the immune molecular module signatures for different tumor types, as estimated using an implementation [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] of the Concordance index [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The Concordance index is a generalization of an area under the ROC curve measurement that indicates how well a model discriminates between responses. A Concordance index value = 0.5 implies no predictive ability, whereas values &#x0003e; 0.5&#x02013;1.0 imply positive predictive ability. The mean Concordance index value was 0.59 for immune molecular module signatures passing a stringent p-value cutoff of &#x0003c;1e-3, indicating positive predictive value.</p><p>To control false discovery rates, we randomly used random partitions of both samples and genes. As described below, we considered random sample partitions to more accurately describe the null distribution for comparison of gene sets. We partitioned samples from each tumor type into equal sized groups (random partitions). From 1,000 random partitions of each tumor samples into equally sized groups, we observed an average of ~1 partition for each tumor type that predicted patient survival at <italic>survdiff</italic> p-values &#x0003c;1e-3, and ~4 modules at p-values &#x0003c;5e-3. For partitions by immune molecular module (N = 526), we therefore expected &#x0003c;~1 and ~2 survival curve differences by chance at p-values &#x0003c;1e-3, and &#x0003c;5e-3, respectively. We then compared the number of times that module and random partitions predicted significant differences in survival for each tumor type. Graphical comparisons of results from module and random partitions at p-value &#x0003c;5e-3 are shown in <xref rid="pone.0138726.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0138726.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>.</p><fig id="pone.0138726.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0138726.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Immune gene expression in tumors predicts patient survival in some but not all tumor types.</title><p>A) Numbers of immune molecular modules predicting survival varies between tumor types. Tumors were partitioned into equal sized groups by median gene expression of each of 526 immune molecular modules (Experimental Procedures). Shown are numbers of modules that significantly predicted survival of patients with each of twelve different tumor types (p-value&#x0003c;5e-3). The numbers of random partitions that yielded significant survival curve differences for each tumor are shown for comparison (N = 526 permutations).

Clustering was performed in both the x and y dimensions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0138726.g001"/></fig><p>We found numerous significant patient survival differences between module hi and module lo subsets in certain tumor types (<xref rid="pone.0138726.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0138726.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Few random partitions yielded significant survival curve differences in any tumor type (<xref rid="pone.0138726.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). The highest numbers of significant survival differences were in kidney, melanoma, head and neck, bladder, and breast tumors. Strikingly, kidney, melanoma, head and neck, and bladder tumors are among the tumor types most treatable with therapies that depend upon engagement of the host immune system (i.e., immune-based therapies) [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Module partitions yielded fewer significant survival differences in patients with glioblastoma, colon, uterine, rectal, lung squamous, lung adenocarcinoma, and ovarian tumors, tumors that generally are not treatable with immune-based therapy.</p><p>It was important to exclude trivial technical factors as an explanation for the significant survival differences seen with module partitions. The number of modules significantly associated with survival differences was not clearly related to numbers of tumor samples analyzed. For instance, breast and bladder carcinomas showed similar survival differences, despite great variation in the numbers of tumor samples tested (<xref rid="pone.0138726.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0138726.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). It is well known that prognostic value of gene signatures depends on the length of follow-up [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Since the survival time varies for the different tumors in the PANCANCER set (<xref rid="pone.0138726.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), we were concerned about the possibility that differences in follow-up time could have biased our results.</p><p>Examination of our data did not reveal a clear relationship to median survival of different tumor types. For instance, both bladder and glioblastoma tumors were associated with the shortest median survival times (both &#x0003c;300 days) but only bladder carcinoma showed clear survival differences with module partitions. Moreover, ovarian tumors had among the highest median survival times (882 days), but did not show any modules associated with significant survival differences. To examine the effects of different follow-up times more directly, we attenuated the differences in follow-up length by truncated the data to a common, somewhat short follow-up length (&#x0003c;5 years). The truncated data set showed a loss of power expected for reduced sample numbers, but very similar overall trends in survival differences as the full data set (<xref rid="pone.0138726.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that differences in follow-up time did not greatly affect our overall results.</p><p>We further investigated the role of technical factors by determining whether the same or different biological processes were associated with modules showing significant survival differences (<xref rid="pone.0138726.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Technical factors affecting the ability to detect survival differences in certain tumors might be expected to result in similar immune processes linked to survival across multiple tumors. Alternatively, qualitatively different immune processes related to patient survival in different tumors would argue that survival differences are biologically based. To distinguish these possibilities, we performed a global comparison of survival-associated modules across all tumor types. We selected modules that were associated with significant survival differences in any tumor type (<xref rid="pone.0138726.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>, p-value &#x0003c;5e-3) and compared their performance across all other tumor types (<xref rid="pone.0138726.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). This analysis showed qualitatively distinct groups of modules most associated with survival differences in each tumor type. For instance, modules associated with Myeloid cells were most highly associated with survival of kidney tumor patients, whereas Interferon response and T/NK cell modules were most effective with melanoma [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Breast, head and neck and bladder tumors also showed distinct patterns, but the remaining tumor types did not clearly show clusters of modules yielding significant survival advantage, consistent with <xref rid="pone.0138726.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>.</p><p>To gain a more in depth view of immune processes associated with patient survival, we parsed the complete data set (<xref rid="pone.0138726.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>) for processes represented by modules associated with survival differences. Using both stringent and less-stringent p-value cuts (1e-3 and 5e-3, respectively), we determined numbers of modules yielding survival differences for each tumor type (<xref rid="pone.0138726.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In order to reduce the impact of tallying modules comprised of very similar genes (a form of double counting), we also determined the numbers of clusters represented by significant modules. For comparison, we also present the numbers of random sample and gene set partitions that yielded significant survival differences. In addition we mined the annotation terms representing each cluster to draw biological inferences. To minimize false positive detections, we focused only cases where we saw significant survival differences with multiple modules from the same cluster, or with modules from different clusters having similar biological annotation.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0138726.t002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0138726.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Distinct functional patterns in modules predicting survival in different tumor types.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0138726.t002g" xlink:href="pone.0138726.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tumor</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No. random samples</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No. random gene sets</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No. modules</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No. clusters</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Selected top modules</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Top modules annotation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Kidney</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0</bold>, 1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>18</bold>, 41</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>56</bold>, 101</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11, 14</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>INSL3.mod</bold>, <bold>CTSG.mod, BST2.mod, E2F1.mod</bold></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Myeloid cells, Myeloid cells, Interferon response, T/NK cells</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Melanoma</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>1</bold>, 2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>4</bold>, 14</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>33</bold>, 71</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>10</bold>, 16</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>STAT2.mod, SEMA3B.mod, FLT3LG.mod</bold></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Interferon response, Myeloid cells, T/NK cells</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Head &#x00026;

Consistent with <xref rid="pone.0138726.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, we observed significant survival differences in only a fraction of tumors (5/12 and 9/12 tumors at p-values &#x0003c;1e-3 and &#x0003c;5e-3, respectively). Kidney, melanoma, head and neck, bladder, and breast tumors were significantly associated with modules at the more stringent p-value (p &#x0003c;1e-3). Additional tumors (lung adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma, lung squamous and rectal tumors) were associated with specific modules at the less stringent p-value (p &#x0003c;5e-3). Survival of ovarian, uterine and colon patients was not significantly associated with any immunological theme or module in these tumors. With the random partitions, we generally found that more random gene set partitions than sample partitions yielded significant differences. Importantly, we did not find that most random gene sets were significantly associated with outcome as has been seen in other studies [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The higher number of positives with random gene partitions suggests that some genes possess prognostic value irrespective of the identities of other genes they are grouped with. We therefore considered using random sample partitions as a more reliable measure of the true null distribution for gene set comparisons. Irrespective of the method of random partitioning, numbers of modules yielding survival differences were higher than random sets for Kidney, Melanoma, Head and Neck and Bladder tumors. Consistent with <xref rid="pone.0138726.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>, the patterns of modules associated with survival differences were complex, both within and between tumor types. Multiple immune processes were associated with survival with several tumors. For example, with melanoma, Interferon response modules gave the most significant differences, followed by Myeloid and T/NK cell modules [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Across tumor types, we observed several patterns of modules associated with survival. T/NK cell genes were most prominently associated with survival in melanoma, head and neck and bladder tumors, and less prominently with kidney, glioblastoma and lung squamous tumors. Myeloid cell genes were most prominently associated with survival in kidney, bladder, breast, and glioblastoma tumors. The Interferon response signature was predominantly associated with survival in melanoma, less so with kidney tumors. Together, these findings suggest that immune processes contributing to survival differences between tumors are complex, and unique for each tumor type.</p><p>The data summarized in <xref rid="pone.0138726.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> also show relatively few tumor types where T/NK cell modules were associated with significant survival differences (most significantly, kidney, melanoma, head and neck, and bladder). This finding is in contrast to other studies showing T cell infiltrates in numerous tumor types [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. One potential explanation for the difference in our results is limited infiltration and expression of T/NK module genes in certain tumor types. To test this possibility, we identified four representative T/NK modules that tracked with survival differences in distinct tumor types (FOXP3.mod, PDCD1.mod, FLT3LG.mod and KLRB1.mod for bladder, head and neck, kidney and melanoma, respectively (<xref rid="pone.0138726.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>)). We then plotted median expression levels of genes in these modules across all individual tumor samples (<xref rid="pone.0138726.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). This analysis showed relatively consistent levels of module gene expression across all tumor types (<xref rid="pone.0138726.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). The range of median module gene expression within tumor types was greater than between tumor types (<xref rid="pone.0138726.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref> and data not shown). These findings suggest that overall levels of T/NK cell infiltrates and T/NK gene expression across different tumors are more similar than levels between individuals with the same tumor type. Thus, variation in total expression level of module genes between tumor types does not explain the relatively low number of tumors where T/NK cell module genes were associated with significant survival differences.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Distinct genetic alterations are associated with tumors having similar immune infiltrates but different prognoses</title><p>Another factor that may influence how T/NK cell infiltrates influence patient survival is differences in microenvironment induced by genetic alterations in the tumor itself [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Our previous studies showed that poor prognosis melanomas with reduced ISG and immune gene levels were associated with specific copy number loss of the interferon gene cluster located at chromosome 9p21.3 [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It was important to determine whether immune gene copy number variation was associated with prognosis in tumors partitioned by module gene expression differences. We focused on tumors where T/NK cell gene expression most clearly predicted survival (melanoma, head and neck, and bladder tumors, <xref rid="pone.0138726.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

Thus, at a group level, samples selected for differential expression of T cell genes exhibited distinct genetic alterations in different tumor types, and therefore comprised different molecular subtypes.</p><p>To explore in greater detail the extent of genetic alteration in melanoma samples selected for expression of FLT3LG.mod genes, we plotted p-values versus chromosomal location for all genes on chromosome 9p2 (<xref rid="pone.0138726.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). We found more extensive alterations in this region when compared with our previous studies on loss of the 9p21.3 locus in tumors expressing low ISG levels [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

Examination of these genes revealed the interferon gene cluster at 9p21.3, as well as additional immune modulatory genes, including CD274 (PD1-L1) and PDCD1LG2 (PD1-L2), ligands for the T cell inhibitory receptor, PDCD1 (PD-1) (<xref rid="pone.0138726.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>).

Taken together, these findings indicate that tumors stratified by expression of lymphocyte genes represent genetically distinct tumor subsets.

However, these data do not provide insight into whether high or low module gene expression is associated with better prognosis. To test these associations in different tumor types, we selected three T/NK cell modules (FLT3LG.mod, PDCD1.mod and FOXP3.mod that were associated with patient survival (in melanoma, head and neck and bladder tumors, respectively). We then plotted Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves for survival of T/NK module hi and module lo tumors. (<xref rid="pone.0138726.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with our previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], FLT3LG.mod hi melanoma patients had better prognosis than patients with FLT3LG.mod lo tumors (<xref rid="pone.0138726.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). To better understand the nature of the genes associated with this survival difference, we projected FLT3LG.mod genes onto a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network graph (<xref rid="pone.0138726.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). These genes formed an interconnected network of genes expressed in a wide variety of T cell types (<xref rid="pone.0138726.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). Likewise, head and neck tumors with elevated levels of PDCD1.mod genes were associated with better patient survival (<xref rid="pone.0138726.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Projection of PDCD1.mod genes onto a PPI also revealed an interconnected network of pan-T cell genes (<xref rid="pone.0138726.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>), overlapping with the FLT3.mod network (<xref rid="pone.0138726.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). In contrast, FOXP3.mod hi bladder tumors were associated with worse patient survival (<xref rid="pone.0138726.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). Projection of FOXP3.mod genes on to a PPI revealed an interconnected network that contained several genes in common with FLT3LG.mod and PDCD1.mod networks (CD5, CD6, CD28, IL7R, etc., <xref rid="pone.0138726.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). In addition, however, the FOXP3.mod network contained several genes important for the development and function of regulatory T cells (Treg): FOXP3 (forkhead box P3); IL2RA (IL2 receptor alpha subunit); and CTLA-4 (Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-asociated-4). These findings demonstrate that high levels of Treg genes, relative to genes found in other types of T cells, are associated with poor patient prognosis in bladder carcinoma. Tregs would be expected to reduce inflammation and potentially inactivate cytoxic T cells, preventing immune-mediated tumor destruction. The presence of Tregs within bladder tumors has been associated with poor patient prognosis [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In the other tumor types having reduced ratios of Treg genes to other T cell genes (i.e., melanoma and head and neck tumors), the presence of a T/NK signature is associated with improved prognosis. Taken together, our results indicate that elevated levels of T cell genes may be associated with either better or worse patient survival in different tumor types, depending upon the type of T cell infiltrate.</p><p>We also observed either better or worse patient survival, depending on tumor type, in patients having tumors with high levels of Myeloid cell gene expression. For example, neutrophil module CTSG.mod hi kidney tumors were associated with poor patient survival (<xref rid="pone.0138726.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A Fig</xref>). CTSG (Cathepsin G) is associated with a network of genes (<xref rid="pone.0138726.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B Fig</xref>) involved in neutrophil function, including: ELANE (neutrophil elastase); AZU1 (Azurocidin 1); DEFA4 (defensin, alpha 4); LTF (lactotransferrin); and MPO (myeloperoxidase). However, in breast tumors, DEFA3.mod hi tumors were associated with better patient survival (<xref rid="pone.0138726.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5C Fig</xref>). DEFA3.mod genes form an interconnected network involving (<xref rid="pone.0138726.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5C Fig</xref>) many of the same genes as in CTSG.mod (<xref rid="pone.0138726.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B Fig</xref>).</p><p>To provide evidence for the relevance of our findings at the protein level, we analyzed tumor protein expression by RPPA. Proteins measured by the TCGA group included the kinase LCK; LCK is an integral component of T cell receptor signaling, a T cell marker, and a node in the sub-network shown in <xref rid="pone.0138726.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>. Melanoma, head and neck, and bladder tumors expressing high levels of FLT3LG.mod, PDCD1.mod and FOXP3.mod transcripts, respectively, also expressed significantly higher levels of LCK protein (<xref rid="pone.0138726.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E&#x02013;2G</xref>). This finding demonstrates that all three module hi tumor sets contain higher levels of T cell infiltrate than their corresponding module lo sets. The difference in prognosis between melanoma and head and neck versus bladder module hi tumors therefore likely reflects differences in functional properties of the T cells in their respective infiltrates. Treg cells in bladder tumors may contribute to an immunosuppressive state that leads to tumor escape rather than elimination by the immune system [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec006"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have used a non-biased and data driven systems approach to identify transcript modules that represent specific immune cells or processes associated with patient survival in a dozen different tumor types. Numerous studies have shown that infiltrates of selected immune cell types are associated with survival of patients with individual tumor types (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]). However, our study is unique in our association of many immune cell processes with survival of patients across multiple tumor types.</p><p>Our studies show that expression of immune genes is associated with patient survival across some, but not all tumor types. Using a stringent cut-off to minimize false positive detections, we identified immune gene modules whose expression was associated with patient survival only in kidney, melanoma, head and neck, bladder, and breast tumors. In contrast, we did not find immune gene module expression associated with patient survival in 4/12 tumor types tested (rectal, colon, uterine and ovarian tumors). We could not attribute these differences to technical factors like sample size, or to survival characteristics of the particular cohorts used. Our data therefore suggest that specific tumor types may be more or less susceptible to control by the immune system.</p><p>Anecdotal evidence has long supported the notion that certain tumor types are inherently more responsive to immune therapy (i.e., &#x0201c;immunogenic&#x0201d;) than others. For instance, immunotherapy is most often effective against melanomas [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which may regress spontaneously [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] or in response to therapy [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] concomitant with autoimmune symptoms. Moreover, current FDA approved &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; immunotherapies for solid tumors [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] are limited to only a few tumor types (e.g., melanoma, bladder, kidney, etc.). Our data shows that these &#x0201c;immunogenic&#x0201d; tumors tend to be those where we most clearly identified immune gene expression associated with patient prognosis. This suggests that tumors with more active basal levels of immune processes are more amenable to immune-based therapy.</p><p>We observed distinct patterns of modules associated with survival in different tumors. Survival of kidney and breast tumor patients was most related to levels of innate cells (neutrophils and myeloid cells), whereas for melanoma, head and neck, and bladder tumors, survival was most related to levels of adaptive immune response genes (T/NK cells). Surprisingly, we identified predominant T cell effects on survival in only a few tumor types (most significantly melanoma, head and neck carcinoma, and bladder tumors). This contrasts with the variety of tumor types where T cell infiltrates have been associated with favorable prognosis in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This difference may result from the patient cohorts studied, or from methodologies used to assess significance. Importantly, since we relied on a population measure for gene expression (median), our results do not rule out roles for T cells in regulating survival of small subsets of the tumor types that scored negatively in our tests. Also, our methods are unlikely to detect differences in intra-tumoral localization of immune cells which can affect patient survival [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Nonetheless, our side-by-side testing strongly suggests relative differences in the extent to which T cells are associated with patient survival across tumor types.</p><p>Because of the unique scope and clinical characteristics of the TCGA tumor sets, they are an invaluable resource for molecular characterization of tumors [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. For characterization of a particular tumor type, it is important to consider how TCGA data are replicated in independent test sets. We previously confirmed in an independent study that ISG and T cell gene sets were associated with melanoma patients&#x02019; survival, just as they were with TCGA samples [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For the present studies, we have been unable to locate profile sets of adequate size or comparable clinical characteristics to validate our findings with bladder and kidney tumors. However, in agreement with our results, previous studies have found elevated neutrophil levels in later stage renal cell carcinomas [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Poor prognosis has also been associated with a high pre-treatment neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio in kidney tumors [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Also in agreement with our results, FOXP3+ infiltrates have been observed in bladder carcinomas [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], although these have not yet been associated with poor prognosis.</p><p>We have shown that tumor subgroups selected on the basis of immune cell gene expression often show distinct genetic alterations. Long-range chromosomal alterations may disrupt production of entire families of immune modulators, which frequently are encoded in gene clusters. Chromosomal instability was demonstrated to be a mechanism of modulating local cytokine expression in colorectal tumors [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Likewise, our previous studies showed that reduced expression of ISGs in melanomas was associated with poor patient prognosis, and with copy number loss of the interferon gene cluster located at chromosome 9p21.3 [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In the present study, we show that a subset of melanoma patients associated with reduced T cell infiltrate may lose chromosomal sequences at 9p2. This new locus is many megabases away from the interferon gene cluster we previously linked to reduced interferon gene expression and poor prognosis. These additional sequences encode the PD-L1 and PD-L2 immune modulatory genes, which negatively regulate T cell proliferation and are targets of immunotherapeutic mAbs [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>We also show that a cluster of chemokine receptor genes at chromosome 3p2 is lost in head and neck tumor patients selected for reduced expression of PDCD1-linked T cell genes. Cancer cells oftentimes subvert the chemokine system, such that chemokines and their receptors become important regulators of cell movement into and out of the tumor microenvironment [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Several members of the chemokine receptor gene cluster at 3p22.3 (CCR1, CCR3. CCR5, CCRL2, XCR1) are receptors for T cell chemokines, including CCL5 (RANTES), XCL1 (lymphotactin) and RARRES2 (chemerin) [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This suggests a possible relationship between T cells expressing a network of PDCD1 associated genes and the chemokine receptor cluster at 3p2 in head and neck tumors. Overall, therefore, our findings contribute to emerging evidence that genomic rearrangements within tumors can modulate the tumor microenvironment and influence anti-tumor immunity.</p><p>Our findings suggest new potential biomarkers for patient selection that could improve the successful use of cancer immunotherapies. PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression were reduced in tumors having copy number loss at chromosome 9q2. PD-L1 expression was the factor most closely correlated with therapeutic response to anti-PDCD1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Other studies have suggested that anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy is most effective in patients where existing PD-L1/PDCD1 interactions are available for reversal by anti-PD-L1 mAbs [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Our findings therefore suggest that melanoma patients with high copy number at 9q2 may be better candidates for anti-PD-L1 therapy than patients with reduced copy number and expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2. Likewise, our demonstration of improved survival in a subset of head and neck tumor patients with elevated levels of PDCD1-linked gene expression and alterations at chromosome 3p2 suggests that this is a population of head and neck tumor patients who may benefit from anti-PDCD1/PD-L1 therapy.</p><p>Our results also suggest that immunosuppressive environments involving either T/NK or Myeloid cells, depending on tumor context, may influence the ability of the immune system to control tumor growth. We showed that high levels of a gene network including the T regulatory (Treg) gene FOXP3 are associated with poor survival of bladder tumor patients. Likewise, we showed that high levels of a neutrophil gene network including CTSG (Cathepsin G, a component of the azurophilic granules of neutrophils) are associated with poor survival of kidney tumor patients. Both Tregs [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and azurophilic granules [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] have previously been associated with immune suppressive function in tumors. Our findings, therefore, support the seemingly contradictory notion that the immune system may have both host-protective and tumor-promoting effects on developing tumors [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Moreover, our findings suggest a framework for molecular categorization of these effects, which will enable finer control of immunotherapy.</p><p>Finally, our results suggest that T regulatory cells (Tregs) might be important therapeutic targets in certain tumor types. Animal studies have clearly shown the inhibitory effects of Tregs on anti-tumor immunity [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This suggests that strategies to deplete tumor-associated Tregs might enhance anti-tumor immunity and cause tumor shrinkage in humans. However, efforts to therapeutically target Tregs have met with mixed success [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Indeed, Tregs are not currently portrayed as a major target for cancer immunotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Here we show evidence for significant negative association of FOXP3-linked genes and patient survival in only 1/12 tumors tested (bladder tumors). This suggests that identifying suitable patients and tumor types may be a major limitation for Treg-directed therapies. Our finding that FOXP3-linked genes are associated with poor prognosis in a subset of bladder tumor patients suggests a specific patient subset predicted to benefit from therapeutic reduction of FOXP3+ Tregs. Taken together, these findings suggest that personalized approaches towards selection of specific patient subsets within and between tumor types will aid in optimizing cancer immunotherapies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec008"><title>The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Data</title><p>TCGA data designated as available without restrictions were obtained from public repositories.

Modules were derived from coexpression matrices between levels of marker genes and all other genes across a dataset of RNAseq profiles. Marker genes included all known CD antigens and cytokines, as well as transcription factors found in human hematopoietic cells [<xref rid="pone.0138726.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The dataset comprised profiles from 336 samples of whole blood and/or purified cells (CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, NK cells, B cells, neutrophils, and monocytes) from healthy controls and individuals with autoimmune or infectious diseases. We calculated Pearson correlation coefficients between levels of marker gene transcripts and levels of transcripts matching 50,045 ENSEMBL gene models, across all samples. We arbitrarily chose the top 100 transcripts most positively correlated with each marker (Pearson correlation coefficients, 0.228&#x02013;1.00, median = 0.831) and designated these gene sets as immune molecular modules (<xref rid="pone.0138726.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). In general, correlation coefficients were weaker for transcripts negatively correlated with markers; these transcripts were not considered further. Many transcripts in immune molecular modules also were also positively correlated with markers across the combined melanoma/PANCANCER data sets (top quartile and median correlation coefficients, 0.14 and 0.036, one-tailed p-values = 0.0160 and &#x0003c;1e-8, respectively).

This is to be expected because of the highly similar distributions of marker genes (e.g., CD19 and CD20 for B cells). To systematically identify clusters of related immune molecular modules, we calculated the fraction of pairwise gene overlap between all 526 different immune molecule modules. We then clustered the resulting overlap table using the <italic>hclust</italic> function in R (Ward D method).
