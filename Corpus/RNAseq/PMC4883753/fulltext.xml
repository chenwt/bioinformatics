We made use of the ability to isolate cuticle synthesizing cells in relatively pure form by dissecting pupal wings and we used RNAseq to identify genes expressed during the formation of the adult wing cuticle. We observed dramatic changes in gene expression during cuticle deposition, and combined with transmission electron microscopy, we were able to identify candidate genes for the deposition of the different cuticular layers. Among genes of interest that dramatically change their expression during the cuticle deposition program are ones that encode cuticle proteins, ZP domain proteins, cuticle modifying proteins and transcription factors, as well as genes of unknown function. A striking finding is that mutations in a number of genes that are expressed almost exclusively during the deposition of the envelope (the thin outermost layer that is deposited first) result in gross defects in the procuticle (the thick chitinous layer that is deposited last). An attractive hypothesis to explain this is that the deposition of the different cuticle layers is not independent with the envelope instructing the formation of later layers. Alternatively, some of the genes expressed during the deposition of the envelope could form a platform that is essential for the deposition of all cuticle layers.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Insects and other arthropods are an extremely successful group of animals.

It provides shape, protects the animal from the environment, limits water loss and provides the skeletal elements needed for locomotion. In different tissues of an individual animal the cuticle will have very different physical properties. For example, in one region the cuticle can be stiff and hard while in another region soft and elastic. The Young's modulus of different cuticles varies over about 8 orders of magnitude&#x02013;a greater range than any other biological material [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The structure of the cuticle is as varied as its function and physical properties and is composed of multiple layers [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Cuticle is secreted in a sequential fashion by epidermal cells with the most external layer being secreted first. The number of layers and their thickness varies from one cuticle to another and insect cuticle has served as inspiration for a variety of human engineered material [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Insect cuticle contains proteins, chitin, lipids and water all of which are thought to be functionally important [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Some cuticle proteins have been identified by analyzing extracted soluble proteins from mature cuticle or cuticle in the process of synthesis [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Others have been identified by the analysis of RNA in cuticle synthesizing cells, by comparing the sequence of known cuticle proteins to genome sequences [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] or by serendipity [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The number of cuticle proteins encoded by the Drosophila genome is estimated to be around 150 and in some insect genomes the estimate is more than 200 [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A number of other proteins have been identified as being essential for the synthesis of normal cuticle such as chitin synthase [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], chitinases [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], Knk [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and ZP domain proteins [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It is unclear if any of these ends up being part of the cuticle proper, although that has been suggested for ZP domain proteins [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The analysis of cuticle composition is complicated by the cross linking that is part of cuticle maturation [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], the insolubility of some components and because other tissues and cell types become attached to the cuticle (e.g. muscles) as it is being synthesized by epidermal cells. The wing provides potential advantages as pupal wings can be dissected in a pure form without attached muscle or other tissues. We have taken advantage of this and characterized the pupal wing transcriptome of Drosophila by RNAseq [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We also examined pupal wings by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) over the period covered by the RNAseq experiments allowing us to correlate the dramatic changes in gene expression with the morphological process of cuticle deposition. The expression of many genes was almost completely restricted to a single time point making these genes candidates for taking part in the deposition of specific cuticle layers.</p><p>Mutations in a number of genes expressed almost exclusively in 42 hr pupal wings are known to result in dramatic wing phenotypes (e.g. <italic>miniature</italic> (<italic>m</italic>), <italic>dusky</italic> (<italic>dy</italic>) [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and <italic>dusky-like</italic> (<italic>dyl</italic>) [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]). This time point is in the middle of the period when the thin outermost envelope layer is deposited. It is known that wing procuticle, which is synthesized much later, is grossly abnormal in a <italic>m dy</italic> double mutant [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and we here found that to also be the case for <italic>dyl</italic>. We also identified wing and cuticle phenotypes of additional genes primarily expressed at 42 hr and for two of these transmission electron microscopy established that there is a procuticle phenotype. To explain the extent of the mutant phenotypes seen with a loss or decrease in the function/expression of &#x0201c;42 hr genes&#x0201d; we suggest either that the successively laid down layers are not independent and that earlier layers instruct the deposition of later ones or that some of the &#x0201c;42 hr genes&#x0201d; form a platform or complex that mediates the deposition of all of the cuticle layers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>The time course of wing development and cuticle deposition</title><p>The Drosophila wing tissue undergoes a number of dramatic morphogenetic transitions during development [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The wing and the dorsal thorax are derived from the wing disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) that proliferates throughout most of the larval period. The wing disc undergoes evagination after the start of pupariation producing a pupal wing that is a small version of the adult wing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). All cell division in the wing ceases around 24 hr after white prepupae (awp). The terminal differentiation of the Drosophila wing begins around 32 hr awp when the morphogenesis of the wing hairs (trichomes) starts [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The start of cuticle deposition is seen by the middle of wing hair outgrowth (~36 hr awp)[<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. At this stage diffuse material and small patches of envelope are seen by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Around 40 hrs awp hair outgrowth is largely complete. Around 40&#x02013;42 hr awp the wing cells begin to flatten and increase their apical surface area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006100.s001">S1A Fig</xref>)(18) a process we refer as flattening/expansion. Since the wing is enclosed within a pupal cuticle sac it is forced to deform and bend back on itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g001">Fig 1B&#x02013;1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006100.s001">S1A&#x02013;S1E Fig</xref>)(18). In previous experiments we first observed chitin in hairs around 42 hr awp and later in wing blade cuticle [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Pigmentation of the wing was first obvious around 80 hr awp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006100.s001">S1C and S1D Fig</xref>) and eclosion of the adult was around 96 hr awp. After eclosion the wing unfolds and extends to take on the shape of the adult wing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006100.s001">S1E Fig</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen.1006100.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1006100.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Changes in pupal wing morphology over time in wild type and mutants.</title><p>Shown are wing discs and pupal wings from wild type (Ore-R (A-E), <italic>dyl</italic>-kd (F-J), <italic>ect</italic>-kd (K-O) and <italic>CG8213</italic>-kd (P-T) animals. The wing discs were dissected from wandering third instar larvae and during this period the disc prepares for evagination. This leads to some discs being a bit more 3 dimensional (this can be seen in panel F). The folding pattern seen in post-flattening/expansion wild type pupal wing discs is highly reproducible. The mutants are more variable from animal to animal. This was particularly true for <italic>ect</italic>, where males showed a stronger phenotype than females. The final column shows pigmented pupal wings imaged through the pupal case and establishes that the differences between wild type and mutants are not due to dissection. The arrowheads point to shallower than normal proximal anterior folds and the arrows to ectopic folds seen in mutants. Note that during the process of dissection there is often some relaxation in the folding pattern of younger (pre-pigmentation) pupal wings.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1006100.g001"/></fig><p>Early evidence for the beginning of cuticle deposition can be seen in 35&#x02013;38 hr pupal wings. In these wings we observed disorganized relatively electron dense material close to the apical cell membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006100.s002">S2 Fig</xref>, arrowheads). Over the wing blade region of cells it was rare to see evidence of the trilaminar envelope. It is possible the amorphous material is a precursor to the envelope. Cuticle deposition appeared somewhat more advanced over the hairs, as we often saw patches of envelope there (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006100.s002">S2 Fig</xref>, arrows). In wings 42 hr awp we observed the trilaminar envelope over much of the epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, arrows) and hairs but it was not continuous and gaps were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, asterisks). Similar observations were made on 45 and 48 hr awp pupal wings although the gaps appeared less frequent. In 52 hr awp pupal wings the envelope was continuous and a layered epicuticle was seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Pore canals were observed in the 52 hr wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, arrows) and we often observed what appeared to be material being secreted from these pores. In both early stages and later ones we often observed protrusions of the cytoplasm in close juxtaposition to the cuticle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006100.s002">S2A Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006100.s003">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>, arrows) as has been seen previously (e.g. [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]). These are thought to represent sites of cuticle deposition. Although they appear as rectangles in these sections they are likely rows of elevated cytoplasm equivalent to the undulae described for the deposition of the first instar larval cuticle [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The procuticle layer appeared relatively thick by 62 hrs with additional thickening over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g002">Fig 2C&#x02013;2F</xref>), although differences in the angle of sectioning can be misleading as to thickness. At later stages the layered nature of the envelope and epicuticle was less obvious and subtle layering in the procuticle was more obvious (e.g. 96 hr awp) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). We refer to this cuticle maturation and it implies that some late gene expression modifies the structure of the cuticle layers deposited earlier. Filaments were seen in the procuticle and these are likely chitin. There was also a thin basal electron dense layer in 62 hr wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, asterisks) that appears similar to the adhesion layer seen during the synthesis of the first instar larval cuticle [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and perhaps what was called Schmidt&#x02019;s layer in older studies on cuticle [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This putative adhesion layer thickened and became more electron dense over time and was very prominent in 88 and 96 hr wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>, asterisks). This corresponds to the principal period of wing pigmentation and while there is relatively little pigmentation in the Drosophila wing blade compared to hairs it is possible that the material observed in 88 and 96 hr wings is pigmented procuticle. Thus, by morphology we can distinguish periods for envelope deposition (36&#x02013;48 hr awp), epicuticle deposition (52 hr awp), procuticle thickening (62&#x02013;88 hr awp), and the period of cuticle maturation and thickening of the adhesion layer/pigmentation of basal procuticle (88&#x02013;96 hr awp).</p><fig id="pgen.1006100.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1006100.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Transmission electron micrographs of wing cuticle deposition.</title><p>Panels A-F are all shown at the same magnification.

In relatively low magnification TEM images (3&#x02013;5,000X) we could often observe both dorsal and ventral cuticle and cell layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). The two cuticle layers appeared to be relatively similar in thickness. However, when we measured the thickness of the layers (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec019">Methods</xref>) we observed that one layer was reproducibly thicker (ave ratio = 1.2 (sd = .11)) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006100.s005">S1 Table</xref>). We suspect the dorsal surface is the thicker one as dorsal hairs are larger than ventral ones.</p><p>As noted above hair cuticle deposition appeared slightly advanced compared to wing blade cuticle. By 52 hrs awp the developing hairs were found on pedestals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006100.s003">S3H Fig</xref>, arrow and had taken on their fluted shape (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006100.s003">S3D&#x02013;S3H Fig</xref>). The pedestals are bulges of cytoplasm covered by cuticle that does not differ dramatically from that of the remaining wing blade cuticle (40). One difference is the cuticle in the center of the pedestal often appears darker by TEM. This could be due to pigment as is seen in the hairs. The size of the hairs in the micrographs was dependent on where along the apical basal axis of the hair the section was cut. During the remainder of pupal development the internal morphology of the hair changed dramatically with both electron dense and lucent regions seen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006100.s003">S3D&#x02013;S3F Fig</xref>). At later stages (e.g. 88 hr, 96 hr) it was primarily electron dense, perhaps due to pigmentation of the hair (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006100.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). One difference between the formation of hair and wing blade cuticle is that distinct undulae were infrequently associated with hair cuticle (see also [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]). Overall our TEM observations are consistent with those by others (e.g. [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]) although a complete TEM time series of wing cuticle deposition has not to our knowledge previously been presented.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Gene expression during cuticle deposition</title><p>We characterized the transcriptome of pupal wing cells at 42, 52, 62, 72, 80, 88 and 96 hrs awp by RNAseq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006100.s006">S2 Table</xref>).

Due to some genes being very highly expressed at multiple stages this was reduced to a set of 83 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006100.s014">S10 Table</xref>) that included genes with a wide variety of functions. For example, 9 of these encode known cytoskeleton proteins or effectors including <italic>actin5C</italic> and <italic>alpha-Tubulin84B</italic>. There were several enzyme encoding genes including <italic>Pxd</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], which encodes peroxidase and <italic>Mmp1</italic>, which encodes a metalloprotease [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Fourteen of the genes are annotated as cuticle protein genes in the fly genome and 2 others are homologs of genes annotated as cuticle protein genes in other insects (but not in Drosophila). Three additional genes encode proteins similar to ones identified as cuticle proteins by Mass Spec analysis of proteins extracted from Anopheles gambiae (Vectorbase). Eight of these 19 encode short proteins, less than 200 amino acids in length. In addition the amino acid content of many was unusual as is often seen in cuticle proteins [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Twelve lacked any Trp residues, 7 any Cys residues and there were also instances where proteins lacked any Arg, Asn, Asp, Gln or Glu. Four of the proteins contained greater than 20% Ala, 3 contained greater than 20% Val and there was one instance of greater than 20% Gln. An &#x0201c;average&#x0201d; protein does not possess more than 10% of any amino acid residue [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].

Thus, twenty two of the 83 genes are known to have a role in cuticle deposition. Among the remaining genes were 20 unstudied &#x0201c;CG&#x0201d; genes that are only found in arthropods. Interestingly, like the highly expressed annotated cuticle proteins 10 of the 20 encoded short (&#x0003c;200 aa) proteins and many also had a distinctive amino acid content. Nine did not contain any Trp, 5 did not contain any Asn, and 4 any Asp residues. There were also 3 instances of no Arg, 2 of no Cys, 2 of no Gln, 2 of no Glu, 2 of no Tyr, 1 of no His, 1 of no Phe and 1 of no Val residues. Two of the proteins contained greater than 20% Ala, 1 greater than 20% Val, 1 greater than 20% His and 1 greater than 30% Gly. We consider these genes candidates for encoding additional cuticle proteins or proteins that have specific functions in cuticle deposition. In addition, 7 members of the insect specific Osiris gene family [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] were among the 20 most highly expressed genes at 42 hr.

Having established that the relative FPKM values for individual isoforms are accurate across samples, we searched the dataset for isoform switching events between neighboring time points. The search returned a small number of genes from the early time points (42/52 hr: 10 genes, 23 isoforms; 52/62 hr: 3 genes, 6 isoforms; 62/72 hr: 2 genes, 4 isoforms), and none from the later ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Of particular interest was a pair of genes whose isoforms switched coordinately between 42 hr and 52 hr: <italic>mwh</italic> (<italic>multiple wing hairs</italic>) and <italic>CG14257</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). <italic>mwh</italic> is a downstream component of the <italic>frizzled/starry night</italic> planar cell polarity pathway and mutations cause the development of multiple trichomes of abnormal polarity from individual wing epithelial cells [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].

There are several possible mechanisms that could give this result. It could be due to reduced proliferation or increased apoptosis in the dorsal layer. It could be due to a disruption of the flattening and expansion of the wing cells that starts around 42 hr, or it could be due to disruption of the unfolding and extension of the wing that happens right after eclosion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006100.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). We did not see any gross abnormalities in wing discs or in pupal wings prior to flattening/expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g001">Fig 1F, 1G, 1K, 1L, 1P and 1Q</xref>) thus the curled phenotype is unlikely to be due to effects on proliferation or apoptosis. In wild type after flattening/expansion the pupal wing has a reproducible folding pattern. This was altered in the <italic>dyl</italic> kd wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g001">Fig 1H&#x02013;1J</xref>) indicating that <italic>dyl</italic> is required for normal wing flattening/expansion. This suggests that the envelope, which is being deposited at 42 hr, plays a functional role in this process. Since the <italic>dyl</italic> kd wings were abnormal at the time of eclosion we were not able to determine if the process of wing unfolding/extension could also be contributing to the <italic>dyl</italic> phenotype. We next examined <italic>ap&#x0003e;dyl</italic>-RNAi pupal wings in the TEM. The 44 hr pupal wings were not dramatically abnormal although we often observed hairs that looked abnormal on one wing surface. We note that equivalent TEM sections of <italic>m</italic> and <italic>dy</italic> pupal wings also did not appear highly abnormal [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Several types of abnormalities were observed in the older <italic>dyl</italic> kd pupal wings. In 76&#x02013;80 hr apf wings there were large gaps between the epithelial cells and the cuticle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g002">Fig 2H</xref>). This is reminiscent of what was observed in <italic>dyl</italic> mutant embryonic denticles [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It is worth noting that using <italic>ap-Gal4</italic> to drive the kd allows us to use the ventral wing cells as a control. Thus, we can be confident that abnormalities observed consistently in only one cell layer are not due to artifacts such as poor fixation as that would affect both cell layers. In addition to the large gaps we also consistently observed that the procuticle on the mutant side was significantly thicker (the ratio was 2.1 (sd = 0.43) compared to 1.2 for wt, p = 0.0017, t-test) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006100.s005">S1 Table</xref>), the procuticle appeared more variable with occasional &#x0201c;holes&#x0201d; and the adhesion layer appeared ragged. In some sections very abnormal procuticle was observed with large holes and irregularities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g002">Fig 2K and 2L</xref>). The pupal hairs were also highly abnormal with an atypical shape and very thin cuticle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006100.s003">S3K Fig</xref>). Given how abnormal <italic>dyl</italic> mutant hairs are as observed by SEM, brightfield and confocal microscopy [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] this was not surprising.</p><p>We previously found that knocking down <italic>ectodermal</italic> (<italic>ect</italic>) (99% of total FPKM at 42 hr) function in the pupal wing led to wing hair defects [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. When we kd <italic>ect</italic> using <italic>ap-Gal4</italic> or <italic>pnr-Gal4</italic> we observed notum abnormalities and frequently wings where the dorsal and ventral surfaces were not juxtaposed (i.e. wing blisters)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006100.s017">S13 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g007">Fig 7H</xref>). The <italic>ect</italic> kd wings also often appeared smaller than normal. As was the case for the <italic>dyl</italic> kd wings, we did not observe defects in <italic>ect</italic> kd wing discs or pupal wings prior to flattening/expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g001">Fig 1K and 1L</xref>), but such pupal wings showed a highly abnormal folding patterns after it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g001">Fig 1M&#x02013;1O</xref>). Thus, it appears that <italic>ect</italic> also functions in wing flattening/expansion. We examined <italic>ap&#x0003e;ect</italic>-RNAi pupal wings in the TEM and observed several defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g002">Fig 2I</xref>). As was the case for the <italic>dyl</italic> kd we also observed large gaps between the apical surface of the epithelial cells and the cuticle and the greater thickness of the dorsal vs ventral cuticle was enhanced (ratio = 1.79 (0.22)) compared to 1.2 for wt (p = 8 X10<sup>-5</sup>, t-test) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006100.s005">S1 Table</xref>). We did not, however, see the sort of holes in the procuticle seen with <italic>dyl</italic>. The <italic>ect</italic> pupal wing hairs also appeared abnormal as in proximal regions the hairs lacked the distinctive angular structure of wild type hairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006100.s002">S2M Fig</xref>). This fits the phenotype seen in adult <italic>ect</italic> kd wings [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. As was the case for the <italic>dyl</italic> kd we did not see any dramatic phenotype in the 42 hr wing as assayed by TEM.</p><p>We also chose 10 additional genes that were expressed primarily at 42 hr (&#x0003e;90% of total FPKM) and tested them to see if a kd would lead to wing and/or cuticle phenotypes. Seven gave a phenotype when kd with either <italic>ptc-G4</italic>, <italic>ap-Gal4</italic> or <italic>pnr-Gal4</italic> although in many cases these were weak in terms of expressivity or penetrance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006100.s017">S13 Table</xref>). Knocking down <italic>CG8213</italic> with <italic>ap-Gal4</italic> resulted in a severe curled upward wing phenotype as well as hair and notum bristle phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). The bristle phenotypes included very short bristles, bristles with wispy distal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g007">Fig 7J</xref>) and bristles with varying regions of increased and decreased pigmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g007">Fig 7J</xref>). This set of bristle phenotypes is not common but is also seen in knockdowns of <italic>dyl</italic>, <italic>Rab11</italic> and exocyst components [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. <italic>ap&#x0003e;CG2016</italic>-RNAi resulted in wings with a distinctive upward curl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g007">Fig 7F and 7L</xref>) and <italic>ap&#x0003e;ImpE2</italic>-RNAi wings with a distinctive downward curl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g007">Fig 7E and 7M</xref>). These were not as strong as with CG8213 but they showed complete penetrance.</p><p>We investigated the <italic>cg8213</italic> kd phenotype further. As was the case for the <italic>dyl</italic> kd wings, we did not observe defects in wing discs or pupal wings prior to flattening/expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g001">Fig 1P and 1Q</xref>), but abnormalities were obvious after (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g001">Fig 1R&#x02013;1T</xref>). Thus, it appears that <italic>CG8213</italic> also functions in pupal wing flattening/expansion. We also examined CG8213 kd pupal wings by TEM. As was the case for <italic>dyl</italic> and <italic>ect</italic> we observed large gaps between the cuticle and the apical surface of the dorsal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g002">Fig 2J</xref>). In contrast to the results with <italic>dyl</italic> and <italic>ect</italic> the cuticle on this side of the cell was also substantially thinner than that on the putative ventral side where the gaps were not seen. The V/D ratio was 2.29 (sd = 0.54) on average, significantly different from the putative V/D ratio of 0.82 in equivalent wild type wings (p = 2.9X10<sup>-5</sup>, t-test) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006100.s005">S1 Table</xref>). The difference was significant even if we assume the thicker layer in our wild type images was the ventral surface (p = 3.0 X 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>). We also observed occasional regions where the procuticle lost its normal organized layered morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g002">Fig 2M</xref>) and hairs with an abnormal shape (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006100.s002">S2L Fig</xref>).</p><p>Since we did not carry out RNASeq on wings younger than 42 hr the data presented does not establish if the expression of the 42 hr genes actually peaked at 42 hr or if it could have peaked earlier and be declining at 42 hr. To assess this we made use of an earlier study from our lab of gene expression at 24, 32 and 40hr awp that used Affymetrix gene chips [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. There were 48 &#x0201c;42 hr&#x0201d; genes with a total FPKM of over 100 and 45 of these were present in the chips used in our earlier study. Forty three of the 45 showed a higher level of expression at 40 hr than at 32 (or 24) hr (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006100.s018">S14 Table</xref>). In most cases the increase in expression from 32 hr to 40 hr was quite large (median 12.4 fold increase). We conclude that the vast majority of 42 hr genes show a peak in expression around that time.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec013"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="sec014"><title>Value of the data set for future studies on cuticle</title><p>Drosophila has served as a valuable model system for many molecular, cellular, developmental and behavioral problems. It has provided some important insights into cuticle synthesis, for example the role of ZP domain proteins in the process [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, the number of such studies has remained limited and cuticle synthesis has remained poorly understood for a process so important for a large part of the biological world. The data set we describe here should provide a valuable resource for future studies on cuticle synthesis in Drosophila as well as other arthropods.</p><p>Many of the previous studies and reviews concerning insect cuticle focused on molting behavior. While understanding this process is important, it is complicated by the shedding of the old cuticle and the influence of the environment. The pupa is a closed system, which presumably reduces the variability of cuticle formation due to external conditions and stimuli. Wings, as single-tissue organs, are ideal for transcriptomic or proteomic studies on the development of cuticle. It remains to be established how variable the program for cuticle deposition will be from one body region to another.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>How many cuticle protein genes?</title><p>The Drosophila genome is annotated with almost 150 cuticle genes [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Our expectation is that cuticle genes would be expressed at a high level as structural proteins are typically needed in stoichiometric amounts. We also expected that homologs of these genes would be found in insects and perhaps other arthropods but not in the genomes of the many types of animals that do not produce a cuticular exoskeleton (e.g. vertebrates). Among the most highly expressed genes we identified 19 genes annotated as cuticle proteins either in the Drosophila genome or the genome of other insects. In this same set of very highly expressed genes were 20 unstudied genes that shared these properties. If the 20 unstudied genes prove to encode cuticle proteins it would more than double the number of highly expressed cuticle protein genes. Many annotated cuticle proteins are relatively short and many contain unusual amino acid content. Either or both of these properties were also true for many of these 20 genes consistent with the possibility that some may prove to be cuticle proteins.</p><p>The 20 genes considered above were selected because they were among the most highly expressed genes. Our data also hint that there may be many other genes expressed in the pupal wing that have specific roles in wing cuticle formation. Of the 16 gene expression clusters 10 displayed patterns of gene expression that changed dramatically in a stage specific manner and these clusters were significantly enriched for arthropod specific genes. This suggests that the number of genes with specific roles in cuticle formation could be very large.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>The cuticle deposition program</title><p>The metamorphic behavior of insects is under hormonal control and at least indirectly changes in ecdysone titer almost certainly influence the pattern of gene expression we describe during wing cuticle deposition. It is not clear however that the large number of changes we described are a direct read out of hormone levels. Ecdysone levels increase rapidly during the start of the second day awp formation peaking at 30 hrs. Two less dramatic peaks were seen at 40 and 48 hr with generally declining levels from 40 hr to eclosion [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. It is not obvious that this pattern can explain our data. For example, ecdysone levels are similar at around 88 and 96 hr but we detect dramatic changes in gene expression. Further, based on simple observations of pupae we know that the time course of pupal development differs substantially across the body (e.g. abdominal development is delayed compared to thoracic development) but as far as we are aware there is no evidence for a similar spatial variation in ecdysone levels.</p><p>The literature provides validation that many genes we identified as being highly expressed in a dynamic fashion are essential for normal wing development and have phenotypes that implicate a role in cuticle formation or wing maturation. Several of the best examples are ZP domain proteins, which are known to organize apical extracellular matrix [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In insects this matrix becomes the cuticle. Previous studies had found that ZP domain proteins played important roles in cuticle formation [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In the embryo mutations in several ZP domain protein genes resulted in gaps between the apical surface of the epidermal cells and the cuticle [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], a result also seen previously for <italic>m dy</italic> double mutant wings [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and one that we observed in pupae for <italic>dyl</italic> mutants. In our experiments this set of ZP domain genes were almost exclusively expressed in 42 hr pupal wings suggesting they functioned in envelope formation. In <italic>dyl</italic> kd and mutants we first observed a hair morphology phenotype in 39 hr wings [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This is during the deposition of the envelope but prior to when we first detect chitin in hairs and before epicuticle deposition, suggesting <italic>dyl</italic> functions in envelope deposition. We did not detect a clearly abnormal envelope in TEM images of 42 hr <italic>dyl</italic> kd wings but this could be due to thinness of the envelope as even in wild type it sometimes appears diffuse. At later stages gross abnormalities in procuticle were seen. In their study of <italic>m</italic> and <italic>dy</italic> wings Roch et al. [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] detected disorganization and a delay in formation of the extensions of the apical cytoplasm that are thought to represent sites of envelope cuticle deposition. This led them to suggest that M and Dy were either structural components of the envelope or linked the cuticle and epithelial cells. Some of the early literature suggested envelope formation was mediated by polymerization [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] which is the presumed function of <italic>zona pellucida</italic> domain. CG10005 stood out due to being highly expressed only in the 52 hr sample. It is a candidate for mediating some aspect of epicuticle formation; as an example of a protein with only the ZP-N domain present (most ZP-domain proteins contain ZP-N and ZP-C) it might be a good candidate for studying the function of ZPD proteins in subdomain detail.</p><p>The sclerotization of insect cuticle generally takes place very late in pupal development and shortly after eclosion. This process utilizes enzymes such as Tyrosine Hydroxylase, which is encoded by the <italic>pale</italic> gene [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and Dopa Decarboxylase, which is encoded by the <italic>Ddc</italic> gene [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Loss of function mutations in these genes lead to lightly pigmented, weak and fragile cuticle. Consistent with this biological function <italic>pale</italic> displayed a dramatic peak in expression at 96 hr awp, just prior to eclosion. There was a more than 12000-fold increase in <italic>ple</italic> expression between 42 and 96 hr awp and an almost 500-fold increase in the 24 hrs between 72 and 96 hr awp. The expression of Ddc did not change as dramatically but it showed a strong peak at 88 hr and 92 hr awp with a 27 fold increase from 62 to 96 hr. Thus, the expression pattern of these two key sclerotization genes nicely fit with their known biological function.</p><p>In our experiments the pigmentation of wing hairs was first obvious around 80 hr awp and it increased dramatically between then and 96 hr awp. There is a further increase during the first few hours of adult life. The expression of a number of genes known to be important for pigmentation varied during the period of cuticle deposition and provided further validation of our data set. Two of the most notable pigmentation genes are <italic>ebony</italic> (<italic>e</italic>) [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and <italic>black</italic> (<italic>b</italic>) [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The expression of both of these showed a major peak at 96 hr awp. The <italic>yellow</italic> (<italic>y</italic>) gene is another key pigmentation gene and published data indicated it functioned in the middle of the pupal period [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Consistent with that <italic>y</italic> expression peaked at 52 hr awp in our experiments.</p><p>The genetic analysis of cuticle proteins in insects has been relatively limited, although in recent years a number of interesting studies have been published (e.g. [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In general these are based on examining the phenotype(s) associated with mutations that inactivate a single gene. It is important to distinguish between the mutant phenotype being a primary defect and not simply an end point that results from the lack of the gene product at an earlier execution point. The very sharp expression peaks that we found for some cuticle protein genes should facilitate such analyses.</p><p>Understanding of the genetic basis for the complex structure of insect cuticle remains challenging. We believe exclusivity of some genes to arthropods is a clue to narrow down the gene search space. A reasonable hypothesis is that the thickness of individual cuticular layers is dependent on the level of expression of a few major cuticle proteins and on the density of protein packing. Knowing the details of the gene expression program allows one to design tests of this hypothesis. A likely hypothesis to explain the change from one cuticle layer to another (e.g. envelope to epicuticle) is that a change in the abundance of one or a few transcription factors leads to a change in the array of cuticle proteins expressed. Our analysis suggests candidates that could mediate such changes. For example, the large reduction in the expression of <italic>vri</italic> and <italic>CG14431</italic> between 42 and 52 hrs and the steep increase in the expression of <italic>HR4</italic> and <italic>Pdp1</italic> at 52 hr could be responsible for the changes in gene expression that cause the transition from envelope to epicuticle.</p><p>The <italic>shaven baby</italic> (<italic>svb/ovo</italic>) transcription factor was not detected as having a high level of expression at 42 hr. At first glance this might be considered surprising as it is known to regulate the formation of larval denticles [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] and wing hairs [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] and it functions to regulate the expression of a number of genes such as <italic>dyl</italic> and <italic>m</italic> whose expression was primarily found in 42 hr wings [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. In previous experiments that utilized Affymetrix gene chips to examine pupal wing RNA at 24, 32 and 40 hrs awp we found a peak of <italic>svb</italic> RNA at 32 hr with a sharp decline by 40 hr [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Thus, our previous results are consistent with the current ones. We suggest that Svb is required to turn on the expression of genes such as <italic>dyl</italic> and <italic>m</italic> but either it is not required to maintain their expression or Svb is stable enough so that protein synthesized at 32 hr can drive a high level of target gene expression at 42 hr.</p><p>We analyzed a small collection of genes primarily expressed in 42 hr wings for their potential role in wing cuticle deposition. The results on CG8213 proved to be a particularly interesting. This gene encodes 3 large proteins (range 1430&#x02013;1693 aa) each of which contains a serine protease domain [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. A protein trap of CG8213 localized it to the perivitelline space in stage 11 and stage 15 embryos [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], indicating the protein is secreted, which would place it in a subcellular location to function in cuticle deposition. A perivitelline space localization was also seen for several other proteins likely to function in cuticle deposition (e.g Cda4 (Chitin deacetylase 4) and Dsx-c73A). The bristle phenotype observed with kd CG8213 was reminiscent of that seen with kd of <italic>dyl</italic> and genes such as <italic>Rab11</italic> that are needed for the secretion and/or plasma membrane insertion of Dyl [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This suggests the possibility that Dyl and CG8213 are functionally linked.</p><p>The timing for the formation of the cuticle that covers wing hairs appears to differ from that of the cuticle that covers the wing blade. This could be a complicating factor in the analysis of our data. We previously found that chitin could first be detected in 42 hr hairs while it not detected in the wing blade until later [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that some 42 hr genes might in fact function in the formation of internal hair cuticle layers and not envelope, although we suspect this would not be the case for the most highly expressed genes. Indeed, the formation of internal hair cuticle appears to be more rapid, and the epi- and procuticle are less easily distinguished than in the wing blade cuticle.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>The relationship of cuticle layers</title><p>There is usually a strict temporal relationship between the deposition of the various cuticle layers [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. From the literature it is unclear if the deposition of the later layers is independent of or dependent on the earlier ones. If the layers were independent then loss of function mutations in genes that are only involved in envelope deposition would be expected to produce an altered envelope with normal epi- and procuticles. Since the envelope is such a small part of the cuticle thickness, envelope defects would only be expected to alter the surface of the cuticle and not its overall structure. Such defects might be visible as a rougher surface and it would not be surprising if they had functional effects on the hydrophobicity of the cuticle and/or made the animals more sensitive to desiccation. However, by combining the data in this paper and the literature it appears that mutations in genes expressed almost exclusively during envelope deposition often result in highly abnormal procuticle. We suggest two classes of models to explain this. In the first we hypothesize that the early layers are important for and perhaps instruct the deposition of the later ones. The first step in cuticle deposition&#x02014;the formation of the envelope presumably involves proteins such as Dyl, Dy and M along with other candidates such as CG8213, Ect and Cpr76Bc. Dy and M have been hypothesized to be envelope components [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], an idea that we find attractive. Interactions between these proteins and cellular constituents such as apical transmembrane proteins and the cytoskeleton could provide the spatial and patterning information needed to build the envelope. Once the envelope is complete it would then guide the deposition of the epicuticle. This could be mediated by outside in signaling from the envelope to the epidermal cells with this leading to the epicuticle components being deposited in the correct spatial pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Support for such signaling comes from observations of abnormal apical cytoskeletons in <italic>dyl</italic>, <italic>dy</italic> and <italic>m</italic> mutants [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Alternatively, the patterning of secreted epicuticle components could be mediated by their binding directly to envelope components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006100.g008">Fig 8</xref>). It seems likely that this would only work for the deposition of the epicuticle that was at the envelope-epicuticle transition boundary. At a later stage interactions between the patterned boundary layer epicuticle proteins and newly secreted epicuticle proteins could pattern the remainder of the epicuticle. Equivalent interactions between the epicuticle and procuticle would serve to instruct the initial deposition of the procuticle. It is worth noting that the late maturation changes observed in the envelope and epicuticle show that cuticle deposition is not a strict temporal hierarchy. While most studies have argued for such a hierarchy a study on the deposition of the first instar larval cuticle of Drosophila came to a different conclusion [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><fig id="pgen.1006100.g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1006100.g008</object-id><label>Fig 8</label><caption><title>Models to explain the procuticle phenotypes of 42 hr genes.</title><p>In the Instructive 1 model the 42 hr proteins form the envelope, which signals back to the cell to organize the cytoskeleton so that the epicuticle and procuticle is secreted in the proper pattern. In Instructive 2 the 42 hr proteins form the envelope and when the proteins that form the epicuticle are secreted they bind to and are patterned by envelope and 42 hr proteins. A similar situation could result in the epicuticle patterning the procuticle. In the Platform model the 42 hr proteins are not part of the envelope but they form a complex that is essential for the patterned secretion of the proteins that form the 3 cuticular layers. Our second model is that many of the 42 hr genes do not encode proteins that are part of the envelope. Rather they would form a &#x0201c;platform&#x0201d; or complex that in some way mediates the tight juxtaposition of the cuticle and the apical surface of the epithelial cells and that this platform is needed for the proper deposition of the envelope and other cuticular components [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1006100.g008"/></fig><p>The instructive model is appealing in that it does not require a structure yet to be identified (i.e. the platform) and it can explain the altered apical cytoskeleton seen in mutants. However, it does not provide an obvious explanation for the large gaps seen between the apical surface and the cuticle in mutants, although that could be due to defects in outside-in signaling. In contrast the &#x0201c;platform model&#x0201d; can explain the gaps, however it does not provide an explanation for the changes in the apical cytoskeleton. Given the multiplicity of cuticle-related proteins it may be that these models are too simple and that a model that contains aspects of both will be correct. It will be important to determine if the proteins in question are incorporated into the envelope as predicted by the instruction models.</p><p>The models suggested above assume that RNA levels are reflective of levels of synthesis of the relevant proteins. This is sometimes not precisely the case but in this system we find very large (often 100 fold or greater) changes in RNA levels so we doubt that changes in translational efficiency would be great enough to unlink RNA levels to general levels of protein synthesis. The model also assumes that the time of action of the relevant proteins is close to the time of their synthesis. Consistent with this are the cytoskeleton and other phenotypes seen in <italic>dyl</italic> mutants during the period of envelope deposition [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], as well as the sharp increase of <italic>ple</italic> expression with simultaneous cuticle darkening. We also note that the Dyl protein accumulated on the apical surface and/or apical extracellular matrix during envelope deposition consistent with deposition and secretion being closely linked temporally to the presence of RNA in pupal wing and bristle forming cells [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>The apical extracellular matrix and cellular/tissue morphogenesis</title><p>The apical extracellular matrix is poorly understood compared to the basal extracellular matrix. Arthropod cuticle is not the only example of such a material as they are found in a wide variety of tissues, organs and organisms [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. For example, the zona pellucida that surrounds mammalian oocytes [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and the tectorial membrane of the cochlea [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Studies on the secretion and morphogenesis of insect cuticle could provide insights into more general questions about how cells can organize their apical extracellular matrix and how it influences tissue function and development. Our observations establish that mutations in a number of &#x0201c;42 hr genes&#x0201d; disrupt the process of wing cell flattening and expansion. This could be due defects in outside in signaling regulating the cytoskeleton or to a proper physical connection between the apical surface of wing cells and the developing cuticle being required for mechanical regulation of morphogenesis. The importance of the apical extracellular matrix for morphogenesis is not unique to the wing. Extensive studies have found defects in trachea lumen morphogenesis associated with mutations in genes required for the deposition of the cuticle that covers the apical surface the trachea cells [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] [<xref rid="pgen.1006100.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>].
