These viruses are presumed to be less dependent on host functions than other DNA viruses because they have large genomes and replicate in the cytoplasm, but a detailed understanding of the host factors required by orthopoxviruses is lacking. To address this topic, we performed an unbiased, genome-wide pooled RNAi screen targeting over 17,000 human genes to identify the host factors that support orthopoxvirus infection. We used secondary and tertiary assays to validate our screen results. One of the strongest hits was heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), the ancient master regulator of the cytoprotective heat-shock response. In investigating the behavior of HSF1 during vaccinia infection, we found that HSF1 was phosphorylated, translocated to the nucleus, and increased transcription of HSF1 target genes. Activation of HSF1 was supportive for virus replication, as RNAi knockdown and HSF1 small molecule inhibition prevented orthopoxvirus infection. Consistent with its role as a transcriptional activator, inhibition of several HSF1 targets also blocked vaccinia virus replication. These data show that orthopoxviruses co-opt host transcriptional responses for their own benefit, thereby effectively extending their functional genome to include genes residing within the host DNA. The dependence on HSF1 and its chaperone network offers multiple opportunities for antiviral drug development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Orthopoxviruses bring in many of the factors they need for replication and impair the host cell by preventing the expression of host proteins. Although orthopoxviruses are less reliant on the host than some viruses, host factors are still required for infection. Here, we report results from two genome-scale approaches that identify host proteins used by orthopoxviruses during infection. These approaches showed that the master regulator of the heat shock response, heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), is a critical host factor for orthopoxvirus replication. HSF1-regulated genes are some of the only host genes with expression maintained or increased following virus infection. Our studies show that orthopoxviruses enter the cell and activate a host transcription pathway as part of its own replication process. These proteins are then utilized by the virus during infection and packaged into the virion, essentially extending the viral genome to include genes co-opted from the host nuclear DNA. This is supported by the existence of heat shock proteins in the viral genome of non-orthopoxvirus genera. We further show that small-molecule inhibitors of HSF1 and HSF1-transcribed genes are effective inhibitors of orthopoxvirus replication, suggesting a new avenue for antiviral development.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by an NIH R03 (MH094169-01) and a SPARC grant (800050) from the Broad Institute.

With a dramatic increase in human MPXV cases in Africa, the rise of VACV-like orthopoxvirus infection in South America, and concerns about the weaponization of smallpox, it is important to design new strategies for the treatment and prevention of these diseases <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Rimoin1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Damaso1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. To this end, one valuable method to understand the mechanism of disease is to determine the virus-host interactions necessary for orthopoxvirus infection.</p><p>Orthopoxviruses are large double-stranded DNA viruses with a unique lifecycle in the cytoplasm of the host cell. The viruses enact a cascade of transcriptional responses, with early gene expression occurring from the stages of viral entry to uncoating, intermediate gene expression after DNA replication, followed by late gene expression until the end of the virus lifecycle <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Yang2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Early in infection, orthopoxviruses express factors that cleave host mRNAs, effectively preventing the expression of most host genes <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Yang2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Guerra1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Poxviruses are also known to use host proteins during their lifecycle. This includes the use of the proteasome to facilitate viral uncoating and DNA replication, the ribosome to translate mRNAs, and specific host factors to help drive late viral transcription events <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Satheshkumar1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1003904-Mercer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Several RNAi screens have been performed in recent years and have expanded our knowledge of the host proteins involved in orthopoxvirus replication. Moser et al. performed a screen of kinase genes in Drosophila cells and found that modulation of the actin cytoskeleton by AMPK is important for VACV entry <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Moser1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Mercer et al. screened the 7,000 genes comprising the &#x02018;druggable genome&#x02019; and revealed the role of the proteasome in viral uncoating and of the Cullin3 ubiquitin ligase in initiating viral DNA replication <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Mercer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Finally, Sivan et al. performed two siRNA screens targeting over 18,000 genes to reveal the importance of nuclear pore genes in viral morphogenesis <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Sivan1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. All of these important new insights were based on an arrayed RNAi screen format. Notably, these screens generated hit lists with some overlap on the protein or functional level, but also significant numbers of unique hits. This is presumably due to substantial false negative rates, false positive rates, and the distinct model systems and readouts used to assess VACV infection, suggesting that more host protein factors remain to be discovered.</p><p>Here, we used two complimentary and unbiased assays to identify host proteins necessary for orthopoxvirus infection. First, we developed a pooled-cell lentiviral shRNA screen in human cells based on screening formats previously utilized to determine pathways important in cancer biology <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Cheung1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Strengths of the pooled screen format are the ease of scaling to larger screening sets and the ability to enable multiple screening paradigms. Furthermore, cells are cultured in standard low-throughput format, rather than in multiwell plates, and thus can be easily passaged and otherwise manipulated. As a second assay, we used RNASeq to analyze the host transcriptional responses elicited by poxviral infection. These data identified host mRNAs that were upregulated during infection, suggesting that they may facilitate virus infection.</p><p>By comparing the data from these two orthogonal datasets, we identified proteins involved in the heat shock response as critical factors for orthopoxvirus infection. In particular, we found that heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), the ancient master regulator of the cytoprotective heat shock response, is necessary for orthopoxvirus infection. We find that depletion and knockout of HSF1 or its pharmacologic inhibition significantly reduces VACV infection. Moreover, the principal targets of HSF1 transcription are upregulated during VACV infection, even as global host gene expression is suppressed. Our findings define a set of host factors that are necessary for orthopoxvirus infection and suggest that poxviruses have evolved to utilize host stress responses to their own advantage.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Pooled RNAi Screen to Identify Host Factors Necessary for Orthopoxvirus Infection</title><p>To identify host factors necessary for orthopoxvirus infection we completed a whole-genome scale, pooled RNAi screen using lentiviral vectors. This method delivered &#x0223c;90,000 short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) with 5 or more independent shRNAs targeting &#x0223c;17,000 human genes to our target cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003904-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Whittaker1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Human A549 cells were transduced in four replicates with the shRNA lentivirus library at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of &#x02264;1 to generate cell populations with predominantly no more than one shRNA expressed in each cell. Non-transduced cells were eliminated following selection with puromycin. Each replicate was then infected at an MOI of 5 with a modified vaccinia virus (VACV) that expressed a fusion of the core protein A4L and Venus yellow fluorescent protein <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Dower1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This dose of VACV infected 100% of control cells at 12 hours (data not shown). At 12 hours post infection (hpi), cells were fixed and sorted for Venus-negative cells, with gates set on uninfected cells to collect Venus-negative pools. This population was selected to enrich for cells in which a host protein essential for orthopoxvirus replication, but not essential for host cell survival, had been suppressed.</p><fig id="ppat-1003904-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1003904.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Pooled-cell shRNA screen revealed host factors necessary for orthopoxvirus infection.</title><p>(A) Schematic of the primary pooled shRNA screen.

The abundance of each hairpin was assessed by next generation sequencing <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Ashton1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> using the Illumina GAIIx system. For each replicate, hairpins with fewer than 15 raw reads were not considered. The remaining hairpins were normalized to the total read depth for each individual replicate to eliminate variation in read depth across replicates. The fold-change enrichment of each hairpin within the Venus-negative sorted cells was determined by comparison to the initial abundance of each hairpin observed in the plasmid DNA pool used to generate the pooled lentivirus library. These fold changes were used to rank the enrichment of each hairpin in the Venus-negative cell population in each replicate. Using the RIGER <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> algorithm within the Gene-E software tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/GENE-E/">http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/GENE-E/</ext-link>), the weighted-second-best metric was used to rank the enriched target genes within each replicate. This method uses the pre-calculated ranked hairpin lists for each replicate, and then ranks the candidate genes based on the first and second most enriched hairpin for each gene in each replicate. Therefore, at least two hairpins against each gene were enriched in the original screen, providing evidence for the specificity of the target gene in VACV infection. The target genes identified in the top 500 genes in each replicate were considered candidate hits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003904.s003">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>To better understand the candidate hits from our screen, we categorized the cellular pathways represented in our dataset for both functional pathways and biological process gene ontology (GO) terms. First, we used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to analyze the functional and signaling pathways associated with these host genes. We found that genes associated with molecular transport, ion transport and apoptosis were significantly overrepresented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003904-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The top categories overrepresented in our dataset correlate well with those identified in other screens for host genes important during vaccinia infection, with cell death and survival (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.27E-06) and cell morphology (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3.17E-05) being significantly overrepresented in both screens analyzed using these parameters <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Sivan1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Using a second gene ontology classifier, Panther, we determined the Biological Process GO terms represented in the dataset, represented in a pie chart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003904-g001">Figure 1C</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003904.s004">Table S2</xref> for more information). This classification highlighted the wide range of cellular processes represented in the initial hit list. Together, these data indicate that the candidate host factors necessary for orthopoxvirus infection are varied, and that several host biological processes act to promote orthopoxvirus infection.</p><p>From the initial list of candidate genes identified in our primary screen, a subset of 172 genes was selected for a secondary screen in arrayed format with a different VACV reporter virus system (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003904.s003">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003904.s001">Figure S1</xref> for details). In the secondary screen, 5&#x02013;7 distinct shRNAs targeting each gene of interest were used to assess the effect of decreased host protein expression on VACV early and late gene expression. The shRNA lentiviral vectors were arrayed in a 96 well plate format, with a different shRNA in each well. A549 cells were transduced at an MOI of &#x0223c;1 with the lentivirus vectors expressing each shRNA, selected with puromycin for lentiviral integration, and then infected with a modified vaccinia virus that expressed soluble Venus under an early promoter and soluble mCherry under a late promoter (VACV-LREV) <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Dower1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Dower2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Cells were fixed 20 hours post VACV-LREV infection and fluorescence was measured from each well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003904-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

In most cases, knocking down host factors with shRNA blocked VACV-LREV late gene expression and not early expression, indicating that the host genes were not necessary for VACV entry and early gene expression. We compiled a list of 34 genes that validated in the secondary screen (20% of those tested; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003904.s006">Table S4</xref>). There were 7 genes that were positive hits in all replicates of the secondary screen: transcriptions factors HSF1 and SKI, the integrin binding protein ITGB1BP1, the aminophospholipid transporter ATP8B1, the Notch ligand JAG1, the nuclear transporter TNPO3 and the chemokine receptor CCR9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003904-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

For each gene, we calculated the difference in normalized read counts (from the Illumina sequencing) between the pre-infection and the 6 hpi samples and compared it with the average number of Illumina read counts across these samples. Consistent with prior reports of a profound suppression of host mRNA following VACV infection, we also saw an overall decrease in the amount of host mRNA <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Yang2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Guerra1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003904-BECKER1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.

In addition to the involvement of HSPs as mentioned in the previous paragraph, HSC70, HSP72 and HSP90 have been shown to be packaged within virions <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Manes1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1003904-Resch1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, suggesting an importance for chaperones in early stages of virus infection. The continuous usage of host cell chaperones at multiple (if not all) stages of the virus lifecycle shows that poxviruses use the heat shock response to extend their genome, activating HSF1 to transcribe essential factors that are encoded by the host.</p><p>A prediction of this genome extension hypothesis would be that some members of the family <italic>Poxviridae</italic> will have evolved to include one or more HSF1-stimulated genes in their own genome, reducing their dependence on host-production of HSPs. Consistent with this, genus <italic>Mulluscipoxvirus</italic> (Molluscum contagiosum; accession number AAC55141) and genus <italic>Crocodylipoxvirus</italic> (Nile crocodilepox virus; accession number YP_784220) encode proteins with homology to the DNAJ/HSP40 chaperone family. Interestingly, other large, cytoplasmically replicating DNA viruses encode HSPs in their genome. This is most striking in the case of mimiviruses, which express HSP70 (MIMI_L254), HSP40/DNAJ (MIMI_R269, MIMI_gp0838) and DNAK (MIMI_L393) homologs, suggesting the requirement for large amounts of these HSPs during viral replication is consistent across cytoplasmic large DNA viruses <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Legendre1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Raoult1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>.</p><p>How orthopoxviruses activate HSF1 is an interesting question for future study. In unstressed cells, HSF1 is in an inactive form in the cytoplasm, bound to several proteins including HSP90 and HSP70. There are several proposed mechanisms of activation of HSF1, including the idea that recruitment of HSP90 and/or HSP70 away from HSF1 in the cytoplasm allows the free HSF1 to become post-translationally modified and translocate to the nucleus to begin transcribing genes <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Santoro1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Jolly1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1003904-Guettouche1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. HSF1 may be activated during VACV infection when cytosolic HSP90 is recruited to the viral factory, as has been previously shown <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Hung1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Poxviruses also encode kinases, which may act to directly phosphorylate and activate HSF1 during VACV infection. Finally, orthopoxviruses may indirectly activate HSF1 by stimulating the MAPK signaling pathway <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Andrade1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>, which in turn strongly drives HSF1 activity <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Dai2" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. Understanding these mechanisms may provide insight into how an invading virion can manipulate the levels of a selective set of host proteins while also deploying proteins that reduce the general level of host mRNAs.</p><p>Together, these data unify previously disparate observations regarding individually identified heat shock proteins and poxvirus infection. Earlier studies had illustrated the importance of individual members of the heat-shock response, but had not established whether poxviruses co-opted existing proteins or whether a heat-shock response was activated. Both our shRNA screening data and transcriptomic analysis implicate HSF1 activation as an important aspect of the orthopoxvirus lifecycle. This has implications not only for understanding viral evolution but also offers potential antiviral targets. Furthermore, our studies underscore that the HSF1 pathway is a viable target for broad-spectrum antiviral development, as it is a core cellular process used by multiple viruses, including HIV and EBV <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003904-Rawat1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>. A more complete understanding of how perturbing cellular homeostasis benefits viral replication will be important for illuminating the biology of virus-host interactions and for recognizing new therapeutic possibilities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Culture and Viruses</title><p>A549 cells (CCL-85), HFF-1 (SCRC-1041) and HeLa (CCL-2) cells were obtained from the ATCC.
