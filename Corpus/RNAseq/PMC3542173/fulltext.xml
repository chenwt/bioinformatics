With improving sequencing technologies, large amounts of oomycete transcriptomics data are now available which have great biological utility. A known bottleneck with next generation sequencing data however lies with their analysis, interpretation, organization, storage and visualization. A number of efforts have been made in this respect resulting in development of a myriad of resources. Most of the existing NGS browsers work as standalone applications that need processed data to be uploaded to the browser locally for visualization. At the same time, several oomycete EST databases such as PFGD, ESTAP and SPC, are not available anymore, so there is an immediate need for a database resource that can store and disseminate this legacy information in addition to NGS data.</p></sec><sec><title>Description</title><p>Oomycetes Transcriptomics Database is an integrated transcriptome and EST data resource for oomycete pathogens. The database currently stores processed ABI SOLiD transcript sequences from <italic>Phytophthora sojae</italic> and its host soybean (<italic>P. sojae</italic> mycelia, healthy soybean and <italic>P. sojae-</italic>infected soybean) as well as Illumina transcript sequences from five <italic>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</italic> libraries. In addition to those resources, it has also a complete set of Sanger EST sequences from <italic>P. sojae</italic>, <italic>P. infestans</italic> and <italic>H. arabidopsidis</italic> grown under various conditions. A web-based transcriptome browser was created for visualization of assembled transcripts, their mapping to the reference genome, expression profiling and depth of read coverage for particular locations on the genome. The transcriptome browser merges EST-derived contigs with NGS-derived assembled transcripts on the fly and displays the consensus. OTD possesses strong query features and the database interacts with the VBI Microbial Database as well as the <italic>Phytophthora</italic> Transcriptomics Database.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Oomycete Transcriptomics Database provides access to NGS transcript and EST data for oomycete pathogens and soybean. The OTD browser is a light weight transcriptome browser that displays the raw read alignment as well as the transcript assembly and expression information quantitatively. The query features offer a wide variety of options including querying data from the VBI microbial database and the <italic>Phytophthora</italic> transcriptomics database. The database is publicly available at

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Superficially, oomycete pathogens resemble fungi, but in fact they belong to a kingdom of life called Stramenopila, which also contains algae such as kelp and diatoms. Hence, conventional fungal control measures often fail against these pathogens
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. <italic>Phytophthora</italic> species and many other members of the order Peronosporales cause destructive diseases in an enormous variety of crop plant species as well as forests and native ecosystems
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The potato pathogen, <italic>P. infestans</italic>, was responsible for the Irish potato famine and is still a destructive pathogen of concern for bio-security
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In the past few years, whole genomes, transcriptomes and ESTs have been sequenced for many oomycete species
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. With the rapid growth of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies such as those of 454 Life Sciences, Illumina and ABI SOLiD, informatics tools and resources have increasingly become a bottleneck. Several oomycete EST databases described previously are no longer available, including the Syngenta <italic>Phytophthora</italic> Consortium (SPC) EST sequence data bases at

<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://staff.vbi.vt.edu/estap/">http://staff.vbi.vt.edu/estap/</ext-link>. Recently a new transcriptomics database, <italic>Phytophthora</italic> transcriptomics database (PTD) was created at Nanjing Agricultural University, that contains digital gene expression information from <italic>Phytophthora sojae</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. We previously created the VBI microbial database (VMD)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], that served as a data warehouse for several oomycete genome sequences. However, the schema level of VMD did not readily accommodate NGS transcriptomic data. Therefore, we have created the Oomycete Transcriptomics Database (OTD) to store oomycete transcriptomics data and easily interface with VMD and PTD.</p><p>One challenging feature of presenting transcriptomics data produced by next generation sequencing (NGS) methods is data visualization on a browser. Most of the existing NGS browsers are stand alone applications that require users to upload processed data into the browser for visualization. This is a significant drawback, since the users must have access to the processed information or else they need to run analysis pipelines. We have created a web based transcript browser that displays EST transcripts, NGS transcripts, their alignment to the reference genome, genome annotation features and merged EST and NGS transcripts.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction and contents</title><p>OTD is a relational database with a backend that uses MySQL version 5.1.49, a front end that uses PHP version 5.3.3 and PERL CGI version 5.12.1. All the visualization tools were created using PERL GD, GnuPlotter and Image Magik.</p><p>The <italic>P. sojae</italic> ABI SOLiD sequences were obtained from mycelial transcripts and from soybean hypocotyls 12&#x02009;h after inoculation with <italic>P. sojae</italic> (four replicates each). The Soybean ABI SOLiD sequences were obtained from the mock inoculated transcripts and 12&#x02009;h <italic>P. sojae</italic> post infected samples. Details of the production of these data will be published elsewhere. The <italic>H. arabidopsidis</italic> Illumina reads were obtained from Arabidopsis leaves 7&#x02009;days after inoculation with the pathogen
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The EST sequences of <italic>P. sojae</italic> were generated from six different cDNA libraries
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and the <italic>P. infestans</italic> EST sequences, downloaded from Genbank
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><sec><title>Data processing</title><p>Raw SOLiD, Illumina and EST sequences were preprocessed and analyzed prior to uploading them into the database.</p><sec><title>Processing of next generation sequencing data</title><p>We worked with approximately 63 million SOLiD reads from the <italic>P. sojae</italic> mycelial library, 240 million reads from the <italic>P. sojae</italic> soybean infection library and 900 million Soybean mock inoculated libraries with an average read length of 50 bases. We included around 6 million cDNA Illumina reads (210&#x02009;MB) from 5 replicates of <italic>H. arabidopsidis</italic>-infected Arabidopsis leaf samples 7&#x02009;days post-inoculation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]; these were downloaded from an EBI repository

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. For <italic>P. sojae,</italic> we used two different genome assembly versions v1.0 and v5.0 (to be described elsewhere) whereas for <italic>H. arabidopsidis</italic> we used the latest assembly version 8.3.2
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] [Table
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. For <italic>P. sojae</italic> mycelial data, only about 50% of the reads found a match with the reference in V1.0 genome assembly, while this number was slightly greater (about 55%) with V5.0 assembly. For <italic>P. sojae</italic> infection samples, the number was poor for both the assembly versions. The read depth of coverage was calculated for each nucleotide of each genome, if at least one read from each replicate spanned it. 13.5 million bases of the <italic>P. sojae</italic> genome were represented by at least one read from each of the four mycelial replicates and 15.1 million bases were represented by at least one read from each of the infection library replicates. Four million bases from the <italic>H. arabidopsidis</italic> version 8.3 assembly were represented by the Illumina reads. Read quantification and transcript assembly were computed using CuffLink
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. CuffLink detected many highly expressed exons that were not included in the present genome annotation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We used the CuffCompare utility (a part of the CuffLink distribution) to merge the expression data across different libraries. CuffCompare was run with and without the genome annotation option, so that we could curate and compare the expression results for annotated genes and the novel exons [Figure

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] for assembly. The analysis was run on a Sun server with 2 Xeon 3-GHZ processors and 4&#x02009;GB RAM with Slackware Linux (i486). The minimum percent of identity for overlaps was kept at 94, minimum overlap length was kept at 30, and maximum length of unmatched overhangs was kept at 30 for CAP3 alignment. Finally, 7,863 unigenes from <italic>P. sojae</italic>, 2,292 unigenes from soybean (derived from <italic>P. sojae</italic>-infected tissue), 14,754 unigenes from <italic>P. infestans</italic> and 13,363 unigenes from <italic>H. arabidopsidis</italic> were obtained.</p></sec><sec><title>Identifying protein coding regions</title><p>We identified the protein coding sequences from the unigenes using a modified log-likelihood algorithm
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This algorithm calculates the coding potential across a sliding window of user-defined size (we used 120) for all six frames and determines the most likely coding frame. Then it compares the islands with higher coding potential with known sequence patterns such as start and stop codons. If the start/stop pattern is found around the window size where there is high coding potential, then that region is called a coding sequence. Cases of frame shift sequence errors, chimeric sequences and contamination were easily detected using this algorithm and marked accordingly. Once protein coding regions were marked, the sequence annotation steps required much less processing time.</p></sec><sec><title>Alignment of assembled EST unigenes to genome sequences</title><p>The unigenes derived from EST sequences of <italic>P. sojae</italic><italic>P. infestans</italic> and <italic>H. arabidopsidis</italic> were aligned to their respective genome assemblies as well as to other oomycete genome assemblies using BLAT
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. All the alignments were carried out with a minimum alignment ratio of 0.93, and the minimum size of alignment of 20. The alignments were ranked from 1 to 4 using the following criteria:</p><p>1) More than 95% identity and no query gaps.</p><p>2) More than 95% identity. Query gaps exist and can be explained by the presence of plausible genomic sequence gaps.</p><p>3) More than 95% identity. Query gaps exist that can&#x02019;t be explained by genomic sequence gaps but are less than 10 bases and/or end mismatches are present but are less than 10 bases.</p><p>4) More than 95% identity. Query gaps that can&#x02019;t be explained by genomic sequence gaps are more than 10 bases and/or end mismatches are present and more than 10 bases.</p></sec><sec><title>Annotation</title><p>The primary annotation of the sequences was done with tera-BLASTX against a non-redundant protein database accelerated on the TimeLogic&#x02019;s DeCypher system. The Blast outputs were parsed, and up to 10 significant blast hits with associated HSP data were stored in the database. For functional annotation of the protein sequences, we used InterProScan
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We sent smaller chunks of sequences to the server to optimize the resource usage. The data were parsed and stored in the database. Secretory and membrane proteins were predicted by running signalP
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and TMHMM
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] on the protein sequences. The annotations are updated every six months.

A brief Entity relationship diagram of the database is provided (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure S2). The database stores the following information:</p><p>1) Read depth of coverage of NGS data</p><p>2) Assembled reads generated from mapped and unmapped NGS reads</p><p>3) Levels of existing and novel transcripts expressed as FPKM [Fragments Per Kilobase of exons per Million fragments mapped]</p><p>4) Cleaning, clustering, assembly, and annotation information for EST data.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Utility and discussion</title><sec><title>Transcriptomics browser</title><p>We have created a new web based browser for visualization of NGS data. The browser retrieves genomic features such as predicted gene models and their annotations from VMD
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and retrieves the transcriptome information from OTD. The first track on the browser displays the gene models predicted from the genomes, followed by the transcript depth of coverage track. The transcript depth of coverage is plotted in two different colors e.g. yellow for infected samples and blue for mycelia samples for <italic>P. sojae</italic>. For <italic>H. arabidopsidis</italic>, the track just displays one color, orange since the samples are only from infection library. The next two tracks are for transcript assembly where the transcripts are color coded for their expression values calculated in FPKM. Transcripts with expression values&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1000 FPKM are considered very highly expressed and are color coded in red; transcripts with moderate to high levels of expression (FPKM value between 100 and 1000) are coded in green; transcripts with low to moderate levels of expression (between 10 and 100) values are represented in blue; low expressed transcripts (&#x0003c; 10) are represented in black [Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A, B]. The remaining tracks are the EST-derived unigenes mapped into the reference genome assembly. These are also color-coded according to the quality of alignment to the genome sequence and the coloring scheme is similar to that of Genbank blast results. The best alignments, in which there are no gaps in the query or subject alignments are color coded in red; the next best alignments, that have subject gaps but no query gaps are coded in green; the third category, in which there are both query gaps and subject gaps are coded in blue and the poorest category, that contains query gaps as well as mismatches, is coded in black.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Screenshots of Transcriptomics browser.</bold> (<bold>A</bold>) Transcripts page for <italic>P.sojae</italic> V1.0 assembly.

This viewer can also be used for SNP viewing and for correcting gene models based on the alignment of the transcript reads to the reference genome. Links to the text based viewer are provided from the main transcript assembly page that is based on the reads assembly on the reference strand. The top most row is the genomic reference followed by the reads mapped to them arranged in rows. As the number of reads increase, the page needs to be scrolled down and towards right to view the alignment. We have used java script for fixing the position of the reference strand on the screen vertically, so the users can always superimpose reference bases with the read bases (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This greatly helps in detecting substitutions, intron&#x02014;exon location and a false assembly.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptomics blast site</title><p>We have significantly upgraded the transcriptomics Blast utility which carries out Wublast
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] against 23 transcriptomics databases. The graphical user interface of the blast utility uses the standard bioperl Bio::GMOD::Blast::Graph package. We replaced the HTML writer utility with our own perl package, so that subject values would point to the correct links in our database [Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B, C]. All of the transcripts assembled from the NGS reads along with several additional datasets such as Soybean CDS are available for blast. If the user chooses external databases such as the soybean genome and Soybean predicted transcripts, the links are directed towards the Phytozome web site [Figure

The primary annotation page includes component ESTs that make up the unigenes. Unigenes can be queried by name from the query page with a wild card search or an absolute string search. If a wildcard search is performed, then a number of unigenes will be displayed on the output page, with a lot of information such as the number of component ESTs making up that unigene, their primary annotations etc. [Figure

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B]. The assembly plot of the component EST sequences displays the matching and non-matching regions in a sequence cluster. This helps users judge the quality of the assembly. From the unigene primary annotation page, a one-click link is provided for BLAST searches against the NCBI nr database. If the unigene has an overlap with a gene model predicted from the genome sequence, then a link to the gene is provided on the primary annotation page. Also, users can choose to run a BLAT alignment of the unigene against the reference genome on-the-fly [Figure
