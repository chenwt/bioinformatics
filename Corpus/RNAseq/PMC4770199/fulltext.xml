Despite advances in the development of methods for profiling polyadenylated RNAs from small amounts of input RNA, techniques for profiling coding and non-coding RNAs simultaneously are not well established. Here, we optimized a transcriptome profiling method based on double-random priming and applied it to serially diluted total RNA down to 10 pg. Read counts of expressed genes were robustly correlated between replicates, indicating that the method is both reproducible and scalable. Our transcriptome profiling method detected both coding and long non-coding RNAs sized &#x0003e;300 bases. Compared to total RNAseq using a conventional approach our protocol detected 70% more genes due to reduced capture of ribosomal RNAs. We used our method to analyze the RNA composition of compartmentalized motoneurons. The somatodendritic compartment was enriched for transcripts with post-synaptic functions as well as for certain nuclear non-coding RNAs such as 7SK. In axons, transcripts related to translation were enriched including the cytoplasmic non-coding RNA 7SL. Our profiling method can be applied to a wide range of investigations including perturbations of subcellular transcriptomes in neurodegenerative diseases and investigations of microdissected tissue samples such as anatomically defined fiber tracts.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="19"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>29 February 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Spatial asymmetries in protein localization in highly polarized cells such as neurons are thought to be guided, at least in part, by mechanisms establishing local diversity in levels of the underlying transcripts (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Subcellular transcriptome profiling is an emerging field that explores such transcript abundance patterns by combining cell culture techniques for selective RNA extraction with amplification methods for profiling the low amounts of transcripts that usually can be extracted. In neurobiology, characterization of the axonal transcriptome has become of interest based on observations that diverse neuronal functions such as axon guidance and regeneration as well as presynaptic functions depend on local protein translation in the axon and axon terminal (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In order to investigate the axonal transcriptome, neurons are typically grown in compartmentalized chambers and RNA extracted from the axonal side is then processed for further analysis. Since the amount of RNA contained within axons is typically low, amplification steps need to be applied. So far, axonal RNA has been subjected to serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) or microarray analysis and up to thousands of RNAs have been cataloged (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). However, novel techniques utilizing next-generation sequencing methodologies may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the axonal transcriptome.</p><p>Current methods for transcriptome amplification use oligo(dT)-based reverse transcription followed by either template switching and exponential amplification or <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription for linear amplification (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, for subcellular transcriptome profiling it might be desirable to capture the whole transcriptome including non-polyadenylated non-coding RNAs in order to obtain a more complete picture of local transcriptome diversity. A potential approach for whole transcriptome amplification would be double-random priming whereby an oligonucleotide containing a random 3&#x02032; end is used for both reverse transcription and second strand synthesis followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Here we present a double-random priming protocol for amplifying total RNA using off-the-shelf reagents. We systematically optimized and controlled several parameters of the method and applied this protocol to diluted series of total RNA ranging from 5 ng to 10 pg. We generated high-throughput sequencing libraries directly from the PCR products and observed a robust gene-by-gene correlation down to 10 pg input RNA. In order to demonstrate the applicability of our method, we cultured embryonic mouse motoneurons in microfluidic chambers and investigated the RNA content of the somatodendritic and axonal compartment using our profiling method. We found the RNA repertoire present within the axonal cytoplasm to be highly complex and enriched for transcripts related to protein synthesis and actin binding. Beyond that we identified a number of non-coding RNAs enriched or depleted in motor axons. We validated our motoneuron transcriptome data by three independent approaches: quantitative PCR, fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and comparison with previously generated microarray data.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that whole transcriptome profiling is a suitable method to quantitatively investigate very small amounts of RNA and, to our knowledge, gives the most complete view of the axonal transcriptome to date. Due to this we suggest that whole transcriptome profiling lends itself to a number of applications. For example, we envision that the transcriptome profiling method described here may be suitable for detailed investigations on the axonal transcriptome alterations occurring in motoneuron diseases in particular, and in neurodegenerative disorders in general. Specifically, disorders involving RNA-binding proteins or defective RNA transport mechanisms might be suitable areas of application of our method. There is growing evidence that disease-associated proteins such as SMN in spinal muscular atrophy and TDP-43 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are involved in axonal RNA transport such that loss of their function may critically affect the axonal RNA repertoire (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Beyond that, RNA transport processes occurring in response to nerve injury or during nerve regeneration could be analyzed by whole transcriptome profiling (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Furthermore, transcriptomes from other subcellular neuronal compartments such as dendrites or growth cones that can be isolated in microfluidic chambers or through laser capture microdissection could be profiled by the method described here. For example, both coding and non-coding RNAs have been shown to translocate into dendrites in an activity-dependent manner to facilitate synaptic modifications (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Our method could be utilized to investigate such changes in a transcriptome-wide manner. Additionally, microdissection of the synaptic neuropil from hippocampal slices or other brain subregions followed by whole transcriptome profiling might give insights into transcript alterations that accompany or underlie synaptic plasticity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Finally, whole transcriptome profiling might be a useful addition to the existing repertoire of single-cell gene expression techniques due to its ability to monitor both coding and non-coding transcripts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Animals</title><p>CD-1 mice were bred in the animal husbandries of the Institute for Clinical Neurobiology at the University Hospital of Wuerzburg.

For this purpose we optimized a PCR-based double-random priming protocol. Since we were interested in the total RNA content of axons we did not remove ribosomal RNAs or used oligo(dT)-based reverse transcription to select for polyadenylated RNAs. Instead, RNAs were reverse-transcribed with an oligonucleotide used previously for whole genome amplification [multiple annealing and looping-based amplification cycles (MALBAC)] containing a 3&#x02032; random octamer and a 5&#x02032; adapter sequence (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, Supplementary Table S1). The same oligonucleotide is used for one round of second strand synthesis generating cDNA fragments that harbor the adapter sequence in a reverse-complementary manner at both ends. These fragments are then amplified by PCR using adapter oligonucleotides to produce sufficient cDNA amounts for generating high-throughput sequencing libraries. As an advantage of this approach each transcript is covered by multiple cDNAs of varying length thus preventing any bias in amplification (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Optimization of double-random priming and amplification efficiency.

For this purpose we first optimized the whole transcriptome profiling protocol using 40 pg total RNA obtained from embryonic mouse spinal cord (see Supplementary Methods &#x02018;Optimization of whole transcriptome amplification&#x02019; section). We monitored amplification efficiency of the PCR reactions by removing aliquots every two cycles starting at cycle 10 and measuring yield by qPCR. Since for whole transcriptome profiling it is important to capture both abundant and less abundant transcripts we monitored <italic>Gapdh</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) representing an abundant transcript as well as the less abundant <italic>Ubqln2</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) by qPCR. The following parameters were tested: (i) two different polymerases (Accuprime <italic>Taq</italic> DNA polymerase or the strand displacement polymerase <italic>Bst</italic>, Large Fragment) for second strand synthesis, (ii) four different primer concentrations for second strand synthesis (0.2, 1.725, 5 or 10 &#x003bc;M final concentration) and (iii) three different adapter primer concentrations for final PCR (0.2, 3.15 or 10 &#x003bc;M final concentration). We found that all three parameters were critical for amplification efficiency. Whilst <italic>Bst</italic> and Accuprime <italic>Taq</italic> performed similarly for second strand synthesis of <italic>Gapdh</italic>, Accuprime <italic>Taq</italic> out-performed <italic>Bst</italic> for capturing <italic>Ubqln2</italic>.

Similarly, whilst a primer concentration of 0.2 &#x003bc;M was sufficient for <italic>Gapdh</italic> amplification, <italic>Ubqln2</italic> amplification efficiency required at least 1.725 &#x003bc;M. Since further increase did not improve detection efficiency for <italic>Ubqln2</italic> we decided to use 1.725 &#x003bc;M primer concentration for second strand synthesis. For final PCR a primer concentration of 3.15 &#x003bc;M was optimal and either a decrease or increase was detrimental for amplification efficiency.

As a starting point we sought to determine a suitable number of PCR cycles to amplify second strand synthesis products derived from 5 ng total RNA. For this purpose PCR aliquots were removed from 12 to 20 cycles and products were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). After 12 cycles PCR amplicons were sized &#x0223c;150&#x02013;600 bp. If more than 12 cycles were used larger-sized fragments appeared indicating overamplification. Thus, we reasoned that for 5 ng total RNA 12 cycles were suitable to obtain sufficient amounts of PCR products for visualization on a gel without overamplification. We also noticed the presence of non-specific products sized &#x0223c;25 bp. These products were inert and not amplified with increasing cycle numbers. Nevertheless, for amplicons that were further processed into high-throughput sequencing libraries (see below) we decided to purify PCR reactions with AMPure beads in subsequent experiments which readily removed such non-specific products.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Whole transcriptome amplification of serially diluted total RNA.

Following second strand synthesis cDNA fragments were amplified for 12 (5 ng), 15 (500 pg), 18 (50 pg) and 20 (10 pg) cycles and PCR products were purified with AMPure beads. Final amplicons were similarly sized (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) and <italic>Gapdh</italic> was reproducibly amplified with similar efficiency for all dilutions (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). We used the PCR products directly for generating Illumina sequencing libraries without size selection and without adapter removal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). This was made possible by using four adapter primers of varying length (Supplementary Table S1) for PCR which produced heterogeneous 5&#x02032; ends required for Illumina cluster calling. After addition of the Illumina sequences and pooling of all replicates the final sequencing library was sized approximately 270&#x02013;1000 bp (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, Supplementary Figure S3).</p><p>Following high-throughput sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq we typically obtained &#x0223c;1.1&#x02013;1.6 million reads per replicate (Supplementary Table S3). One 500 pg replicate gave rise to &#x0223c;2.7 million reads and one 10 pg replicate produced &#x0223c;950 000 reads. For data analysis we established a custom bioinformatics pipeline that screened reads for presence of the adapter sequence and utilized the random octamer region for &#x02018;molecule counting&#x02019; of PCR duplicates (Supplementary Figure S1). More than 90% of reads for these samples contained the adapter sequence (Supplementary Table S3) and for all RNA input amounts the vast majority of sequencing reads was unique (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). After removal of PCR duplicates, reads were mapped to the mouse genome in order to calculate normalized read numbers per transcript expressed as FPKM values.</p><p>Comparison of transcript levels showed a high degree of gene-by-gene correlation between the individual technical replicates for genes with FPKM &#x02265; 0.001 (Supplementary Figure S4A). The Pearson correlation coefficient was 1.0 even for the technical replicates derived from 10 pg total RNA. In line with the correlation analyses, individual transcripts encoding the housekeeping genes <italic>Ppia</italic> and <italic>Gapdh</italic> showed similar levels for all RNA inputs (Supplementary Figure S4B). However, we noticed that the variability in FPKM values for the lower-expressed transcripts increased between 50 and 10 pg input RNA. Since the Pearson coefficient might overestimate the correlations due to presence of highly expressed transcripts we also calculated the Spearman coefficient for all comparisons which considers gene ranks. The Spearman coefficient was &#x0003e;0.8 for the 5 ng, 500 pg and 50 pg replicate comparisons and &#x0003c;0.7 for the 10 pg replicates. Therefore, we estimate that the threshold of input RNA until which our protocol may still reproducibly yield quantitative information is 50 pg.</p><p>The number of detectable genes was 12 621, 12 748 and 12 681 for the 5 ng replicates, 12 712, 12 993 and 12 798 for the 500 pg replicates, 12 330, 12 337 and 12 334 for the 50 pg replicates and 10 553, 10 516 and 10 609 for the 10 pg replicates. The number of expressed genes (FPKM &#x02265; 1) common to all three technical replicates was &#x0223c;10 000 for 5 ng, 500 pg and 50 pg of input RNA and decreased to &#x0223c;7600 for 10 pg RNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>) corresponding to &#x0003e;80% and &#x0223c;72%, respectively, of expressed genes in each dataset (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>). Thus, in line with the correlation analyses transcripts are reliably detected for RNA input amounts &#x0003e;50 pg. Nevertheless, even though the detectability somewhat decreased for 10 pg input RNA the number of transcripts shared between the replicates was still substantially non-random at this level. We also generated saturation plots by randomly subsampling fractions of the total reads and measuring the number of genes that were detectable with FPKM &#x02265; 1 from these fractions. For all samples &#x0003e;90% of the final number of expressed genes were already detectable when half the number of total reads were subsampled (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref>). Since 11 out of the 12 replicates gave rise to &#x0003c;1.6 million reads we investigated the 500 pg replicate producing &#x0223c;2.7 million reads in more detail. When &#x0223c;1.6 million reads of this replicate were subsampled &#x0003e;98% of the final number of expressed genes were detectable (Supplementary Figure S5). This indicates that the sequencing depth was sufficient to achieve representative gene detection.</p><p>Finally, we evaluated to what extent the measured transcript levels were preserved among the different input amounts of RNA. For this purpose we first determined the top 20 most abundant transcripts by FPKM value in the 5 ng samples and assessed their levels in the lower input RNA samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>). The rRNA gene Gm26924 was the most abundant transcript in all samples. In addition, we found other non-coding RNAs to be highly expressed. Among these were 7SK (<italic>Rn7sk</italic>), which is involved in transcriptional regulation, 7SL (<italic>Metazoa_SRP</italic>), which is a component of the signal recognition particle and <italic>Rpph1</italic>, an RNA which is part of the RNase P ribonucleoprotein complex that cleaves tRNA precursors. The most abundant protein-coding RNAs were <italic>Actb</italic> encoding &#x003b2;-actin, <italic>Lars2</italic> encoding mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase 2 and <italic>Tuba1a</italic> encoding tubulin alpha 1A. Furthermore, transcripts encoding the translation factors Eef1a1 and Eif4g2 were highly expressed. The abundance of these top 20 transcripts was similar for all samples down to 10 pg total RNA suggesting that whole transcriptome profiling preserves their relative expression levels even at low input amounts of RNA as was already indicated by the correlation analysis. In order to investigate the concordance of measured transcript levels among the different RNA input amounts on a global scale we calculated correlation coefficients for all replicate comparisons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2J</xref>, Supplementary Figure S6). Whilst the Pearson correlation coefficient was &#x0223c;1.0 for all comparisons the Spearman coefficient was &#x0003e;0.8 for all comparisons involving 5 ng, 500 pg and 50 pg replicates. This indicates that whole transcriptome profiling detects transcripts at similar levels for total RNA input amounts of &#x0003e;50 pg.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-3"><title>Characteristics of transcript capture by whole transcriptome profiling</title><p>Since we do not fragment the input RNA prior to library preparation we sought to investigate the ability of our protocol to capture different regions across a transcript. When we visualized the read distribution for the lncRNA <italic>Malat1</italic> we obtained a non-uniform read density profile for all replicates suggesting that different subdomains contained in an individual transcript are differentially available for profiling (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The most likely explanation for this observation is that the random octamers used for the two random priming steps are biased toward particular sequences, as has been shown before for random hexamers (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Nevertheless, when averaged across transcripts reads were distributed uniformly along their middle portions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) whilst the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends were considerably underrepresented.</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Characterization of transcript captured by whole transcriptome profiling.

In contrast, only &#x0223c;14% of aligned bases were derived from intronic regions. Considering that introns by far exceed the length of exons the relatively low number of intronic alignments indicates that mostly spliced mRNAs rather than pre-mRNAs were present. Furthermore, &#x0223c;6% of aligned bases were within intergenic regions. Thus, whilst the large majority of transcripts originated from annotated genes a nevertheless sizeable fraction was derived from intergenic RNAs.</p><p>Finally, we examined the potential of whole transcriptome profiling to detect transcripts belonging to different gene classes. For this purpose we analyzed what percentage of the total FPKM for each sample is derived from individual gene classes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Surprisingly, about 42&#x02013;44% of the total FPKM was derived from protein-coding genes. In contrast, rRNAs contributed 36&#x02013;39% which is substantially below the expected relative amount of rRNA of about 80&#x02013;90% in cells. The rRNA fraction detected is similar for all amounts of input RNA indicating that there is no amplification bias with additional PCR cycles. One possibility for the detection of less rRNA than would be expected is that rRNA genes might not be covered comprehensively by the ENSEMBL annotation or are masked by other genes. To test this possibility we calculated separately what proportion of aligned read bases were located within annotated rRNA genes. As a result &#x0223c;60% of all aligned read bases were within rRNA genes which is still below the actual fraction of rRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). This suggests that whole transcriptome profiling captures less rRNA than would be expected.</p><p>Another gene class that contributes a sizeable proportion (7&#x02013;10%) of FPKM values is annotated as &#x02018;misc_RNA&#x02019; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). This class contains non-coding RNAs such as 7SK, 7SL and <italic>Rpph1</italic>, all three of which are &#x0223c;300 nt in length. In contrast, snRNAs, which are &#x0003c;200 nt, were underrepresented contributing &#x0003c;0.5% toward the total FPKM. Taken together, these results suggest that whole transcriptome profiling reliably detects both coding and non-coding RNAs of at least 300 nt with rRNAs being relatively under-represented.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-4"><title>Whole transcriptome profiling of standardized total RNA containing ERCC reference RNAs</title><p>The whole transcriptome profiling results from mouse embryonic spinal cord RNA suggest that the method can be used to identify RNAs of different gene classes and that the relative proportions of transcript abundance are preserved when probing varying amounts of input RNA. Since the RNA extraction method which we used for the mouse embryonic spinal cord RNA might de-select certain RNAs of smaller size we also applied whole transcriptome profiling to the HBRR which is a standardized total RNA from human brain that contains RNAs of all sizes including small RNAs. Additionally, we included ERCC spike-in control RNAs which allow associating measured transcript levels with molecule numbers.</p><p>5 ng, 500 pg, 50 pg and 10 pg HBRR were reverse-transcribed and amplified under the same conditions used for mouse spinal cord RNA. The size of the amplified products was ranged 150&#x02013;600 bp similar to the products derived from mouse RNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). As negative control we also set up one reaction without RNA (0 pg) and amplified it for 20 cycles in parallel. As a result, no amplification products were generated when input RNA was omitted showing that the PCR amplicons formed from the serially diluted RNA are specific to the input provided. As a quality control step we performed qPCR for <italic>Gapdh</italic> on pre-amplified cDNA and amplified products. For all RNA dilutions <italic>Gapdh</italic> was amplified with similar efficiency (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).

Likewise, we evaluated the FPKM levels of the ERCC control RNAs which were mixed with the HBRR prior to its dilution. Similar to the HBRR transcripts the observed amounts of ERCC transcripts were consistent among the technical replicates and showed a good concordance even for the 10 pg samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). When we compared the ERCC FPKM values for different amounts of input RNA we also observed robust correlations among replicates (Supplementary Figure S7). This provides further evidence that whole transcriptome profiling preserves the relative levels of detectable transcripts for different input amounts of RNA spanning at least two orders of magnitude.</p><p>Since the number of individual ERCC control RNAs in the stock is known it is possible to calculate their numbers in the serial dilutions. For all RNA input amounts the measured ERCC FPKM values were highly correlated with the calculated number of transcript molecules present in the samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>). In the 5 ng HBRR samples ERCC transcripts with more than 400 copies were detectable. In line with the dilution the minimum number of copies required for detection was &#x0223c;40 in the 500 pg samples. In the 50 and 10 pg samples transcripts with as low as 1&#x02013;10 copies became detectable in individual replicates. Thus, the detection threshold for individual RNAs scales with the total amount of RNA present. Taken together, these results indicate that the relative transcript levels observed by whole transcriptome profiling are consistent both on a global scale when assessing all transcripts as well as when subsets of individual transcripts are considered.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-5"><title>Comparison of whole transcriptome profiling with total RNAseq</title><p>Our results indicate that whole transcriptome profiling detects both coding and non-coding RNAs of as low as 300 nt length. In order to be able to compare our results with an alternative method that profiles total RNA we used a commercially available RNAseq kit and performed total RNAseq by omitting the initial selection step for polyadenylated transcripts. As input we used 5 ng HBRR containing ERCC control RNAs. We produced altogether three replicate Illumina libraries which were of similar size as those derived from whole transcriptome profiling (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, Supplementary Figure S3). The total RNAseq technical replicates were highly correlated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), similar to the 5 ng technical replicates from whole transcriptome profiling.

This suggests that, whilst there is a linear relationship between the transcript levels from both methods, the FPKM values for most transcripts are higher for whole transcriptome profiling than for total RNAseq.

As a result we found that in total RNAseq rRNAs were represented by 77.6% of the total FPKM whereas in whole transcriptome profiling only 47.4% of the total FPKM were derived from rRNAs. When rRNA abundance was quantified separately 60.3% of all aligned bases were within rRNA genes for whole transcriptome profiling whilst for total RNAseq this was the case for 85.7% of aligned bases (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>). Since the amount of rRNA determined by total RNAseq is within the actual cellular rRNA fraction of 80&#x02013;90% these data now directly show that rRNAs are relatively less represented in whole transcriptome profiling data. In addition to rRNAs, we also found snRNAs detected to a higher extent by total RNAseq than by whole transcriptome profiling (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). In contrast, lncRNAs such as <italic>MALAT1</italic>, <italic>MEG3</italic>, <italic>NEAT1</italic>, <italic>RMST</italic>, <italic>MIAT</italic> and <italic>XIST</italic> had higher FPKM values in whole transcriptome profiling than in total RNAseq (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G</xref>). Thus, the reduced detection of rRNAs and short non-coding RNAs such as snRNAs allows whole transcriptome profiling to cover other transcripts such as lncRNAs and those encoding proteins more extensively which increases their FPKM values. In agreement with this notion more genes were detected with FPKM &#x02265; 1 in all three replicates by whole transcriptome profiling (10 059 genes) than by total RNAseq (5938 genes) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5H</xref>). The reproducibility of gene detection was similar for both methods (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5I</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we compared both methods in terms of transcript coverage. Similar to mouse spinal cord RNA whole transcriptome profiling of HBRR covered transcripts uniformly with the exception of 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5J</xref>) even though a slight bias toward the 3&#x02032; half of transcripts was visible. In contrast, total RNAseq showed a more pronounced 5&#x02032; bias indicating that more reads were derived from the 5&#x02032; end of transcripts. In agreement, compared to whole transcriptome profiling more aligned bases were in UTRs than in coding regions in total RNAseq (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5K</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, we reasoned that our whole transcriptome profiling protocol is suitable for investigating picogram amounts of input RNA typically obtained from axons of motoneurons grown in compartmentalized cultures.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-6"><title>Whole transcriptome profiling of compartmentalized motoneuron cultures</title><p>To investigate the transcriptome of motor axons we cultured wild-type embryonic mouse motoneurons in microfluidic chambers for 7 days <italic>in vitro</italic> as described before (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). We used our whole transcriptome amplification approach to analyze total RNA extracted from the somatodendritic and axonal compartments of five separate compartmentalized motoneuron cultures.

Their average <italic>Gapdh</italic> crossing point is 31.33 which, when compared to the spinal cord samples, would correspond to a total RNA amount of &#x0223c;20 pg, which is below the threshold at which we found our method to be quantitative for spinal cord RNA. Therefore, for further analysis we only considered those three axonal datasets (and corresponding somatodendritic datasets) with estimated axonal levels of more than 20 pg (Supplementary Figure S8B).</p><fig id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Whole transcriptome profiling of compartmentalized motoneurons.

Likewise, transcript coverage was comparable for axonal and somatodendritic whole transcriptome profiling both on a global scale (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>) as well as for individual transcripts as exemplified by the coverage along <italic>Malat1</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>).</p><p>In order to evaluate the composition of somatodendritic and axonal RNA more closely we first determined the different classes of transcripts that could be detected in each compartment. We found that the RNA composition of axons is complex containing transcripts of multiple classes, similar to the somatodendritic side. In both compartments &#x0223c;50% of FPKM values were derived from annotated protein-coding transcripts, whilst the remaining 50% came from ribosomal and other RNAs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>). We noticed that in the axonal transcriptome mitochondrial rRNAs contributed twice as much to the total FPKM compared to the somatodendritic transcriptome (21.3% compared to 9.7%). This suggests that in the axonal cytoplasm mitochondria are, on average, relatively more abundant than in the cytoplasm of the soma. In contrast, cytoplasmic rRNAs were relatively less abundant in axons compared to the somatodendritic side (15.9% compared to 23.9% of the total FPKM). This difference in rRNA abundance also became apparent and was statistically significant when rRNAs were quantified separately (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>).</p><p>We also evaluated the relative abundance of individual non-coding RNAs in the axonal transcriptome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6G</xref>). We first investigated the short non-coding RNAs 7SK and 7SL, which are of similar length (7SK: 331 nt, 7SL: 300 nt). We found 7SK relatively more abundant in the somatodendritic compartment, but also detectable in motor axons, which we validated by qPCR (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). In contrast, 7SL RNA was enriched in the axonal compared to the somatodendritic cytoplasm. We then analyzed the abundance of several lncRNAs, namely <italic>Malat1</italic>, <italic>Meg3</italic>, <italic>Rmst</italic>, <italic>Xist</italic> and <italic>Miat</italic>. All of these lncRNAs were present in the axonal compartment.

For <italic>Malat1</italic> we validated its relative enrichment by qPCR (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). Finally, analysis of read mappings to gene segments revealed that both introns and RNAs derived from intergenic regions were more prevalent in axons than on the somatodendritic side (introns: 30.2% compared to 22.0%; intergenic: 14.9% compared to 7.8%) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6H</xref>).

For this purpose we first selected well-characterized synaptic marker proteins in our RNAseq data and validated their relative enrichment by qPCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). We found transcripts encoding the NMDA glutamate receptor subunit Grin3a and encoding the AMPA receptor subunits Gria1 and Gria2 to be enriched on the somatodendritic side in accordance with their postsynaptic localization. Additionally, the mRNA encoding Piccolo (Pclo), a protein involved in the organization of the presynaptic apparatus, was enriched on the somatodendritic side.</p><p>In order to find transcripts significantly enriched in either compartment in an unbiased manner we performed differential expression analysis comparing the somatodendritic with the axonal datasets using Cuffdiff (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). We used the FDR-adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value, <italic>q</italic>, as a measure for significance. We found 545 transcripts enriched with <italic>q</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 on the somatodendritic side and 468 transcripts with <italic>q</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 enriched on the axonal side. Since six PCR cycles were used for pre-amplification of somatodendritic cDNA and 18 cycles for axonal cDNA we also performed a control experiment in order to test the effect of difference in cycle number on differential expression. For this purpose we used three replicates each of undiluted and diluted somatodendritic RNA, amplified the cDNA for 6 or 18 cycles, respectively, and performed differential expression analysis comparing the undiluted with the diluted RNA (Supplementary Figure S10). As a result, 13 transcripts were differentially expressed with <italic>q</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05. Of these, five were enriched in undiluted RNA and eight were enriched in diluted RNA. We overlayed these transcripts enriched in undiluted and diluted RNA with those enriched on the somatodendritic and axonal side and found two transcripts that were shared between undiluted and somatodendritic samples and three transcripts that were shared between diluted and axonal samples. After subtracting these from the list of transcripts enriched on the somatodendritic and axonal side 543 transcripts remained enriched in the somatodendritic compartment (Supplementary Table S4) and 465 transcripts remained enriched in the axonal compartment (Supplementary Table S5). For the latter we validated a number of candidates by qPCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). Their enrichment compared to the somatodendritic compartment was in agreement with the predictions by differential expression analysis. We also performed unsupervised clustering of the differentially expressed transcripts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>). As a result only the individual replicates for each compartment were related but there was no correlation between the compartments. This suggests that the transcripts identified by differential expression analysis are predictive for the somatodendritic and axonal transcriptome.</p><p>The differential abundance of particular transcripts in the somatodendritic and axonal compartment might reflect a subcellular enrichment of specific physiological functions. In order to gain an overview over such functions we performed GO term and KEGG pathway analysis for the transcripts enriched in the somatodendritic and axonal compartment. For the analysis we used the 10 433 transcripts found to be expressed on the somatodendritic side and the 11 127 transcripts found to be expressed on the axonal side as background datasets. As a result, transcripts with synaptic functions (&#x02018;synaptic transmission&#x02019;, &#x02018;synapse&#x02019;) were particularly enriched on the somatodendritic side (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D</xref>, Supplementary Table S6).

Among these were transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins such as Rpsa and eukaryotic translation initiation factors. Beyond translation we found transcripts involved in actin binding enriched in axons compared to the somatodendritic compartment. Notably, transcripts with functions in cell cycle regulation were also over-represented on the axonal side, including transcripts for cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-9"><title>Comparison of whole transcriptome profiling results with available microarray expression data for compartmentalized neurons</title><p>In order to evaluate the accuracy of transcripts detected by whole transcriptome profiling in compartmentalized motoneurons we compared our lists of transcripts with existing datasets generated by microarray expression analysis (see Supplementary Methods &#x02018;Comparison of whole transcriptome profiling of compartmentalized motoneurons with microarray data&#x02019; section).

In order to compare our RNAseq data with the microarray expression levels we first generated a list of 17 587 transcripts that are covered by both microarray and whole transcriptome profiling and assigned either the microarray probeset showing the lowest or the probeset showing the highest expression value to any given transcript.

Of these, 6867 transcripts were common to both sets of transcripts corresponding to 83.3% of the transcripts detected by microarray and 76.4% of the transcripts detected by RNAseq. Thus, for the somatodendritic compartment microarray analysis and RNAseq identified a similar set of expressed transcripts.

Of these, 4998 transcripts were common to both methods which corresponds to 87.6% of the transcripts detected by microarray and 53.0% of the transcripts detected by RNAseq in axons.

Similar to the previous analysis we retained the probeset with the highest expression value for any given transcript and, additionally, removed those transcripts that we were not able to match with our RNAseq data. This produced a set of 1677 axonal DRG transcripts of which 1594 (95.1%) were present in the set of 11 127 transcripts that we detected by RNAseq in motor axons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9C</xref>).

Their study would benefit from techniques that enable the simultaneous analysis of multiple classes of RNAs. Here we describe an optimized protocol for whole transcriptome profiling based on double-random priming using off-the-shelf reagents. This protocol was tested on serially diluted total RNA and applied to RNA derived from compartmentalized motoneuron cultures. Whilst whole transcriptome amplification techniques based on double-random priming have been described before and used successfully for amplification of low input amounts of RNA (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), we introduced several modifications. First, we used optimized parameters for second strand synthesis and PCR. We noticed that choice of polymerase during second strand synthesis as well as primer concentration during second strand synthesis and PCR had considerable impact on amplification efficiency. Thus, whilst abundant transcripts such as <italic>Gapdh</italic> might be captured under a wide range of reaction conditions, less abundant RNAs such as <italic>Ubqln2</italic> might be more susceptible to such differences. Second, we found that one round of second strand synthesis using a <italic>Taq</italic> polymerase is sufficient for transcriptome capture. Existing protocols either use one or several rounds of second strand synthesis with a strand displacement polymerase (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Third, we use PCR amplicons directly for Illumina library preparation without further enzymatic manipulations. Illumina MiSeq sequencing normally requires the first few bases to be heterogeneous since they are used for cluster calling (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Therefore, low diversity samples require higher amounts of the spike-in control phage library PhiX to achieve 5&#x02032; end heterogeneity. In order to overcome this limitation we used four adapter primers of various lengths simultaneously during the PCR to obtain diverse 5&#x02032; ends of the amplicons. This allowed us to use only 1% of PhiX as spike-in. Fourth, we scan all reads for presence of the adapter sequence which ensures a stringent selection of reads derived solely from the amplification process. Finally, we used the random octamer sequence for molecule counting to eliminate PCR duplicates.</p><p>We tested our protocol on serially diluted mouse and human RNA and also included external control RNAs. Even with modest sequencing capacity and read numbers of typically &#x0003c;2 million reads per sample we found that whole transcriptome profiling was scalable into the lower picogram range of input RNA. Whilst we estimated that 50 pg might be the lower limit of input RNA at which our protocol might still provide quantitative information a substantial number of transcripts was reliably detected even for 10 pg total RNA. Importantly, relative transcript levels were preserved for different numbers of amplification cycles which indicates that expression values can be compared across different RNA input amounts.</p><p>We also compared our method with total RNAseq which we conducted using a conventional kit and omitting the initial poly(A) selection step. Compared to total RNAseq, whole transcriptome profiling captured less rRNA and, thereby, detected 70% more transcripts. One possible reason for the difference in rRNA coverage seen between the two protocols might be that in whole transcriptome profiling RNA is left intact prior to reverse transcription such that the highly structured rRNAs might at least partially re-fold and thereby are less amenable for primer binding or reverse transcription under the conditions used in our protocol. The inaccessibility of structured regions for primer binding might also explain the relative under-representation of 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; UTRs in our whole transcriptome profiling data since UTRs are known to harbor structural elements for translational control (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In contrast, for total RNAseq RNA is initially fragmented which might allow a more representative capture of structured RNAs, particularly rRNAs. Whatever the reason might be we propose that profiling the whole transcriptome including rRNAs might provide some advantages, particularly for studies investigating the subcellular distribution of RNA. In axons, for example, the presence of rRNAs might be an indicator for the local translational potential and differences in translational capacity have been associated with the ability for axonal regeneration (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Since our method is capable of monitoring rRNAs and coding RNAs simultaneously at different levels of input RNA we envision that it is clearly suitable to study axonal transcriptomes in such a comprehensive manner.</p><p>In order to demonstrate that our protocol can give such neurobiological insights we investigated the total RNA content of embryonic motor axons from which picogram amounts of RNA can be extracted in microfluidic chambers. For comparison we also extracted RNA from the somatodendritic side. Even though it has already been shown that the subcellular transcriptome contained within neuron extensions is complex (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), to our knowledge an unbiased approach to obtain the complete catalog of coding and non-coding RNAs present in axons has not been conducted so far. Surprisingly, our results suggest that motor axons contain a similar number of transcripts as the somatodendritic part and that the RNA composition is similar between both compartments. Nevertheless, we found a large number of transcripts with distinct functions enriched in either compartment. On the somatodendritic side we noticed an enrichment of transcripts with synaptic functions which most likely originate from dendrites (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In axons, transcripts with functions related to protein synthesis and actin binding were over-represented. Actin binding proteins as well as the organization of the actin cytoskeleton play important roles in growth cone establishment (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and defects of axonal translocation of <italic>&#x003b2;-actin</italic> mRNA have been observed in models of motoneuron diseases (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Another interesting finding was the observed existence of cell cycle associated mRNAs in the axonal compartment which is in line with previous results showing an enrichment of cell cycle associated mRNAs in the axonal compartment of embryonic dorsal root ganglia (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Even though the associated protein products are considered to primarily function in the nucleus, there are hints for some of these mRNAs to play important roles in axonal growth and axon pruning, neuronal migration, dendrite morphogenesis and dendrite spine formation as well as in synaptic plasticity (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>An important aspect of our whole transcriptome amplification protocol is that non-coding RNAs are captured including the abundant rRNAs. For example, we detected less rRNA on the axonal compared to the somatodendritic side of motoneurons. At the same time, transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins were relatively more abundant in axons compared to the somatodendritic compartment. Whilst we cannot rule out the possibility that the performance of our method is influenced by the initial amount of rRNA present one possible consequence would be that an alteration of the ribosomal RNA-to-protein stoichiometry might affect the number of functional ribosomes and, therefore, modify the translational potential available for protein synthesis in axons (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). However, it is worth noting that ribosomal proteins have also been associated with extraribosomal functions. For example, the ribosomal protein Rpsa, which is involved in ribosome biogenesis and, as part of the 40 S ribosomal subunit, in ribosome function, also binds cytoskeletal components such as actin and tubulin (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Thereby, Rpsa locally targets ribosomes to the cytoskeleton and regulates cell migration through protein synthesis. Moreover, Rpsa acts as a laminin receptor and controls cell adhesion (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). In the brain, <italic>Rpsa</italic> mRNA is elevated during embryogenesis and declines in adulthood, further signifying its function in development (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Nevertheless, the axonal presence of transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins as well as translation initiation factors points toward the possibility that regulated synthesis of these components can modify the translational potential of axons. Therefore, future studies might investigate to what extent these transcripts are being translated into functional components of the protein synthesis machinery.</p><p>In addition to rRNAs, our method detected other non-coding RNA species with lengths of &#x0003e;300 nt. Among these were 7SK and 7SL, two structured RNAs of similar size which have been described for their roles in transcription and translation, respectively. In our motoneuron dataset we found 7SK more abundant in the somatodendritic compared to the axonal cytoplasm in line with its nuclear function in transcriptional regulation (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). We confirmed this localization pattern by FISH in cultured motoneurons. In contrast, 7SL was enriched in the axonal cytoplasm. As part of the signal recognition particle, 7SL is involved in co-translational transfer of proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, its abundance in axons as well as the presence of rRNAs such as 18S might be further indication for the presence of the protein secretion machinery in axons (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, our whole transcriptome profiling method captured lncRNAs more efficiently than total RNAseq. Considering that lncRNAs have received much attention over the last years due to their multifaceted roles in gene regulation our method might provide an interesting opportunity for this field. In recent years it became clear that lncRNAs are not just especially enriched in the central nervous system and are important for neurodevelopment but seem to have different functions in neurodegenerative diseases as well (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Because of this knowledge it would be interesting to get a deeper insight in the localization and possible enrichment of these non-coding RNAs in different subcompartments of neurons as this was not possible so far. As a surprising finding we observed several lncRNAs in the axonal compartment. Even though lncRNAs have so far been predominantly studied for their nuclear roles in regulating gene expression (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) their presence in the axonal cytoplasm might indicate additional functions in translocation. RNA-binding proteins interact with these lncRNAs and thereby might mediate their axonal transport. For example, <italic>RMST</italic> has been found to interact with hnRNPA2/B1 (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). It is possible that such protein&#x02013;RNA complexes might be transported subcellularly and, as part of larger transport particles, mediate subcellular trafficking of other RNAs. Therefore, our whole transcriptome profiling protocol could help to determine how the axonal transcriptome is affected by loss of these lncRNAs. In line with these data an interesting finding of our study was the detection of introns in motor axons. One possible explanation for this observation would be that unspliced pre-mRNAs or partially spliced mRNAs containing retained introns, respectively, are located in axons. Even though splicing normally occurs in the nucleus the possibility for cytoplasmic splicing has been discussed (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). However, an alternative explanation for the presence of introns in axons could be that introns are not simply by-products of the splicing process but might give rise to functional RNAs themselves that act independently of their associated mRNA (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). In either case, the apparent axonal presence of intronic RNAs warrants further investigation.</p><p>In conclusion, we describe here a method for whole transcriptome profiling that is scalable, quantitative and cost-effective. It provides the major advantage that both non-coding RNAs and coding RNAs can be detected simultaneously. This also includes rRNAs the levels of which might indicate translational capacity and, therefore, might be an important parameter when studying subcellular transcriptomes in the context of local protein synthesis.</p></sec>
