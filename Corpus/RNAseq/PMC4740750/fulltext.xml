Until now, courtship pheromones of Salamandridae and Plethodontidae have been intensively studied, but information on chemical communication in other urodelan families is essentially lacking. The axolotl (<italic>Ambystoma mexicanum</italic>, Ambystomatidae) has a courtship display that suggests a key role for chemical communication in the orchestration of its sexual behavior, but no sex pheromones have yet been characterized from this species. Here we combined whole transcriptome analyses of the male cloaca with proteomic analyses of water in which axolotls were allowed to court to show that male axolotls secrete multiple ca. 20&#x02009;kDa glycosylated sodefrin precursor-like factor (SPF) proteins during courtship. In combination with phylogenetic analyses, our data show that the male cloaca essentially secretes a courtship-specific clade of SPF proteins that is orthologous to salamandrid courtship pheromones. In addition, we identified an SPF protein for which no orthologs have been described from other salamanders so far. Overall, our study advocates a central role for SPF proteins during the courtship display of axolotls and adds knowledge on pheromone use in a previously unexplored deep evolutionary branch of salamander evolution.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The Mexican axolotl (<italic>Ambystoma mexicanum</italic>) is an aquatic, neotenic mole salamander with a long and fruitful history in scientific research. Axolotls have been serving as valuable, non-traditional model organisms for developmental biology since the middle of the 19<sup>th</sup> century<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> and are still extensively used in laboratory experiments, covering research topics such as regeneration, development, neuroscience and olfaction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Since axolotls have been bred in laboratories for over 150 years<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, observational records on their reproductive behaviour are readily available<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Axolotls display a courtship dance that suggests a key role for pheromones in the orchestration of their sexual behaviour. Nonetheless, surprisingly little is known about the chemical ecology of this model organism, except for its ability to determine the reproductive status and sex of conspecifics based on chemical cues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p><p>Mole salamanders (Ambystomatidae) belong to the internally fertilizing salamanders and similar to most members of this clade, they do not engage in copulation to reproduce<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Instead, a male transfers his sperm to a female through a spermatophore deposited in the environment. In order to attain internal fertilization, females are persuaded to pick up this sperm package with their cloaca during an elaborate courtship display. Male axolotls vigorously nudge the female with their snout and perform a so-called &#x02018;hula dance&#x02019; in which they widely open their cloaca and undulate the posterior parts of their body and tail. The female responds to the courting male by nudging the male&#x02019;s cloacal region. When the male moves forward and deposits a spermatophore, the female follows him and picks up the sperm cap with her cloaca<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Courting males are believed to secrete chemical cues in the water when they widely open their cloaca and expose the cloacal papillae to the female. The sexually dimorphic cloaca of a male axolotl harbours six different types of glands, including the vent gland which is assumed to be the pheromone-producing gland<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Moreover, the strong interest of a female in a male&#x02019;s cloaca emphasizes the importance of chemical communication during courtship. Despite clear indications that sex pheromones affect axolotl reproductive behaviour, knowledge on the nature of these molecules in the axolotl, and ambystomatids in general, is largely absent.</p><p>Over the past 20 years, research on sex pheromones in salamanders has led to the discovery of three unrelated protein pheromone systems in two distinct urodelan families (Plethodontidae and Salamandridae)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Only proteins of the highly diversified Sodefrin Precursor-like Factor (SPF) pheromone system were shown to fulfil a courtship function in both salamandrid and plethodontid species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. In the terrestrial plethodontid <italic>Desmognathus ocoee</italic>, fractions enriched with 23&#x02009;kDa SPF proteins were shown to shorten the duration of courtship when applied to the dorsal skin of a female<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. In a natural courtship sequence of this species, males scratch the back of the female with their premaxillary teeth and rub their mental gland over the newly-formed skin abrasion to &#x02018;vaccinate&#x02019; pheromones into the female&#x02019;s blood stream and increase her receptivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. In the aquatically reproducing salamandrid <italic>Lissotriton helveticus</italic> (palmate newt), males fan an array of 21&#x02009;kDa SPF proteins towards the female with their tail during courtship<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Two-female behavioural experiments showed that a single SPF isoform is sufficient to induce stereotyped female sexual behavioural responses. In addition, the seemingly unrelated decapeptide sodefrin, which exhibits a female-attracting activity in the Japanese fire-bellied newt <italic>Cynops pyrrhogaster</italic> (Salamandridae)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, was shown to have originated through a frameshift in one of the SPF genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Irrespective of the wide variety in courtship strategies and pheromone delivery modes, the SPF pheromone system seems to have retained a central role during courtship of internally fertilizing salamanders.</p><p>Mole salamanders (Ambystomatidae) diverged from Salamandridae about 150 million years ago (Mya)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> and therefore constitute a long branch of independent evolutionary history in amphibian evolution. Here we combined cloacal gland transcriptome data and protein characterisation of water in which axolotls were allowed to court, with phylogenetic analyses to gain insight in axolotl (<italic>Ambystoma mexicanum</italic>) courtship pheromone use. Proteomic analyses showed that courting male axolotls secrete multiple ca. 20&#x02009;kDa glycosylated SPF proteins in the water. The combination of these proteomic data with transcriptome analyses allowed identification of the full-length precursor transcripts, the corresponding proteins they encode and their individual expression levels in the male cloaca. Finally, we combined a gene phylogeny of known salamandrid and plethodontid SPF precursors with axolotl pheromone candidates to demonstrate their orthology with established urodelan courtship pheromones.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Axolotls actively secrete SPF proteins during courtship</title><p>To investigate what molecules are secreted from a male&#x02019;s cloaca during courtship, we collected water in which axolotls were allowed to court (hereafter referred to as &#x02018;courtship water&#x02019;), and compared this with both water in which non-courting males had been held and water in which non-courting females had been swimming. Proteins were directly extracted from the three types of water and further separated on a reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) system. Our analyses indicate that the RP-HPLC elution pattern of courtship water differs profoundly from water in which non-courting animals had been held (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>&#x02013;c), evidencing that some molecules were specifically released during courtship. A direct protein comparison was made between RP-HPLC purified male, female and courtship water using mass spectrometry, gel-electrophoresis and N-terminal protein sequencing by Edman degradation. Gel electrophoresis of the main differential peak shows the presence of several 20&#x02013;25&#x02009;kDa proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). At similar solvent concentrations, a faint 20&#x02009;kDa band is visible in male water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), while no such band is apparent in female water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Figure S3</xref>). Edman degradation sequencing shows that, during courtship, at least seven different 20&#x02013;25&#x02009;kDa proteins are secreted in the water that bear a distinctive N-terminal cysteine pattern typical for SPF proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). These findings suggest that, similar to salamandrids and plethodontids, axolotls augment female receptivity during courtship by secreting a blend of highly distinct SPF proteins. Sequencing by N-terminal degradation of other molecules in courtship-specific differential peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, indicated with an asterisk) revealed that these do not belong to the SPF pheromone system (data not shown). Conversely, N-terminal sequencing of the faint 20&#x02009;kDa band in male water revealed an SPF protein whose amino acid sequence is identical to one of the SPF proteins present in courtship water (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, sequences corresponding to SPF12 and SPF13). No N-terminal sequences could be generated that confirm the presence of SPF proteins in female water. Finally, mass spectrometry identified a series of glycoproteins in courtship and male water that could be matched to the theoretical relative molecular mass (Mr) of <italic>in silico</italic> translated transcripts obtained by RACE-PCR (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary note</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref>), while no SPF masses were measured in the relevant fractions of female water.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Male axolotl SPFs are orthologous to established pheromones</title><p>To further characterize the axolotl SPF pheromone candidates, we performed RACE-PCR with a diverse set of primers (see Methods). Thirteen different SPF cDNA precursor sequences were identified this way, encoding 12 unique mature SPF proteins, each with a 20 AA signal peptide (SPF1-13, GenBank numbers KU043451-KU043463). Earlier studies have differentiated two types of SPF, both encoding for a two-domain three-finger protein, but exhibiting a distinct cysteine pattern: alpha SPFs show an anterior 8-cysteine motif and a posterior 6-cysteine motif, while beta SPFs have an anterior 10-cysteine motif followed by a posterior 8-cysteine motif<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Molecular dating estimates suggest that the gene duplication that gave rise to these SPFs happened near the origin of stem salamanders about 300 Mya<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. In our transcripts, two highly similar SPF precursors (SPF10 and SPF11) exhibit a cysteine pattern typical for alpha SPF, while all other precursors show a beta SPF cysteine pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, descendants of both anciently diverged SPF copies are currently expressed in the cloaca of male axolotls.</p><p>To determine the phylogenetic position of the identified axolotl SPF precursors in relation to known salamandrid and plethodontid SPF precursors, we combined the mature coding sequences of our axolotl SPF precursors with precursor sequences available on GenBank for salamandrids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and plethodontids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Two frog sequences were selected as outgroup<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Alignment resulted in a data matrix of 56 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and 239 characters, for which ProtTest 2.4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> assigned JTT&#x02009;+&#x02009;G as the best fitting model of amino acid replacement under the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analyses revealed a single best tree (-Ln <italic>L</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12277.47) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>) that is largely congruent with previously published SPF gene trees<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Furthermore, our tree allows unambiguous identification of the speciation events that represent the family level diversifications in both alpha and beta SPF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>, node S1 to S3). Within alpha SPFs, our tree strongly supports orthology of two ambystomatid precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>, SPF10 and SPF11) with salamandrid and plethodontid SPFs containing demonstrated courtship pheromones<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>, orange triangles). Within beta SPFs, a clade of diverse precursors with pairwise amino acid divergences of up to 42% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>, &#x02018;courtship-specific&#x02019;) originated through lineage-specific duplications that occurred after the Ambystomatidae-Salamandridae split (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>, node S3). This clade is orthologous to the highly diversified beta salamandrid SPF clade, for which multiple isoforms were shown to be tail-fanned by palmate newt males as courtship pheromones<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>, indicated with orange dots). So far, no orthologs of the remaining sequences (SPF12 to SPF15) were identified in the pheromone-producing glands of urodelans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Courtship-specific beta SPFs are highly expressed in the male cloaca</title><p>To estimate the relative expression of SPF precursors amplified from male cloaca tissue, we performed transcriptome sequencing (RNASeq) of the cloacal glands of a sexually active male axolotl, yielding 127,404,240 paired-end (100 bp) reads. Expression analyses in CLC Genomics Workbench (v8.0.1) on <italic>de novo</italic> assembled SPF transcripts (including 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032;-UTR) revealed 3,557,293 reads belonging to the SPF family, indicating that about 2.8% of all reads belong to the SPF protein family. Subsequent expression analyses on the coding region of transcripts obtained by RACE-PCR resulted in mapping of 1,153,834 reads, and indicate that a strongly supported clade of beta SPFs jointly account for nearly all SPF expression (99.2%) in the male&#x02019;s cloaca (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>, SPF1 to SPF9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>, &#x02018;courtship-specific&#x02019;). The presence of the corresponding proteins in courtship water is supported by several Edman degradation sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Together, the orthology with highly expressed salamandrid pheromones, the high transcript expression in the male cloacal glands of the axolotl, and the exclusive secretion during male courtship strongly advocate a female-receptivity enhancing pheromone function for this clade of beta SPFs. In contrast, we observed a low cumulative expression of 0.7% for the alpha SPF precursors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>, SPF10 and SPF11), which is in line with Edman degradation sequencing signals being close to the background level. Though present in courtship water, the concentration of alpha SPFs is probably significantly lower than the beta SPFs, and their relative role as courtship pheromones in the male SPF blend may be limited.</p><p>With a relative expression of 0.08%, our transcriptome analyses suggest that SPF12 and SPF13 are hardly expressed in the cloaca (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). This is remarkable, since the corresponding protein is present in both courtship water and male water. We currently cannot exclude that the discrepancy between proteome and transcriptome level expression is due to an exceptional translational efficiency or longevity of transcripts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. However, we consider it more likely that the cloaca is not the main organ secreting these SPFs, and that there is a continuous - i.e. not exclusively linked to courtship activities - passive release of the molecule from sexually mature males, potentially from epidermal skin secretion. Since protein synthesis carries a high energetic cost, this secretion may nevertheless be an essential part of the chemical communication system of axolotls. The male-specific SPF12/13 could be involved in sex identification, provide information on reproductive condition, or augment a female&#x02019;s receptivity. Indeed, female axolotls were shown to perform courtship displays when exposed to whole-body odorants from males<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> (i.e. male water). Since SPF12/13 is an important component of a male&#x02019;s odorant blend, it will be interesting to examine how sexually mature females react on this particular SPF protein in a behavioural assay (e.g. similar to the one performed by Park <italic>et al</italic>. 2004<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although chemical communication is generally acknowledged in the Mexican axolotl, ambystomatid pheromones had remained entirely unexplored. Here, we used combined transcriptomic and proteomic evidence to identify a set of male courtship-specific SPF proteins, further supporting the widespread presence of the SPF pheromone communication system in internally fertilizing salamanders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. In addition, we identified an SPF protein for which no orthologs have been described yet from other salamanders. This gene, which originated through a duplication more than 150 million years ago, is abundant in water containing sexually mature males. Behavioural experiments in which female axolotls are exposed to the identified SPF pheromone candidates are a prerequisite to achieve a more comprehensive understanding on the exact function of these SPF molecules in ambystomatid reproduction. Since axolotls were proposed as useful model organisms to study olfaction and the neurobiology of chemosensory systems, our findings will facilitate further research on pheromone perception. Electro-olfactogram recording techniques for investigating pheromone responses in the olfactory and vomeronasal epithelia of adult axolotls are readily available<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Electrophysiological experiments with female axolotls would enable us to study electro-olfactogram responses on each individual SPF, giving us insight on their relative contribution in the multicomponent putative pheromone blend. Finally, future research using demonstrated SPF pheromones could shed light on the function of the vomeronasal system relative to the olfactory system in pheromone processing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Animal husbandry</title><p>Eight males and six females were obtained from a commercial supplier (Petco, Deurne, Belgium), and raised until fully sexually mature.

Proteins were eluted with 80% ACN in 0.1% TFA (solvent B) at 1&#x02009;ml per minute as follows: 0&#x02013;30% B in 24&#x02009;minutes, 30&#x02013;65% B in 56&#x02009;minutes (increase of 0.5% ACN per minute) and lastly 65&#x02013;100% B in 10&#x02009;minutes. Since the 5RPC SOURCE column was no longer commercially available at the time male and female water was collected for purification, a 15RPC SOURCE column (4.6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100&#x02009;mm, GE Healthcare Life Sciences) was used at a constant flow rate of 0.5&#x02009;ml per minute. Proteins extracted from male and female water were eluted with 80% ACN in 0.1% TFA (solvent B) at 0.5&#x02009;ml per minute by applying the following gradient: (1) 0&#x02013;30% B in 10&#x02009;minutes, (2) 30&#x02013;70% B in 64&#x02009;minutes (increase of 0.5% ACN per minute), (3) 70&#x02013;100% B in 10&#x02009;minutes. Absorbance of the eluting samples was measured at a wavelength of 214&#x02009;nm and eluates were collected in 1&#x02009;ml fractions. To visualize the protein content of male, female and courtship water, peak fractions were subjected to non-reducing SDS-PAGE using precast gels (Any kD Mini-PROTEAN TGX, Bio-Rad) and silver-stained (Silverquest Silver Staining kit, Invitrogen).</p><p>To ascertain all relevant proteins elute in a similar fashion on both the 15RPC and 5RPC column, courtship water samples were re-run on the 15RPC SOURCE column at a flow rate of 0.5&#x02009;ml per minute applying the same gradient as used for the chromatographic separation of proteins in male and female water. The order in which the proteins of interest eluted did not change as a result of using a different column or flow rate. By re-running courtship water on the 15RPC column, we were able to define the entire SPF elution range that had to be screened to identify any potential SPF molecules in male and female water (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mass spectrometry and amino acid sequence analyses</title><p>After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by semi-dry blotting (Trans Blot Turbo System, Bio-Rad) and stained with 0.1% Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 (Sigma). Bands of interest were excised from the blot, destained with methanol and the amino acid sequence of the proteins determined on a 491 Procise cLC protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Proteins in 30&#x02009;ul aliquots of each fraction were concentrated to 15&#x02009;&#x003bc;l and 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;l was further separated in a 0.1% formic acid to 80% ACN 0.08% formic acid gradient at 0.8&#x02009;&#x003bc;l per minute on a C4 Acclaim Pepmap 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;m (300&#x02009;&#x003bc;m&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;150&#x02009;mm) column using an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Scientific) coupled to an amaZon speed electron transfer dissociation (ETD) ion trap (Bruker) for mass spectrometry analyses with a target mass of 1700&#x02009;m/z. Each nano LC run was repeated with a target mass of 2500&#x02009;m/z to detect proteins with a higher Mr and less charges. Averaged profile spectra of proteins were obtained using Bruker Daltonics deconvolution software (data analysis 4.1). The experimentally obtained average Mr of our SPF protein candidates was compared to the theoretical average Mr of all SPF cDNA precursors found in male cloacal tissue.</p><p>SDS-PAGE, mass spectrometry and Edman sequencing results in the main article are shown for compound fractions, each representing a set of three consecutive 1&#x02009;ml fractions from the Source RPC columns. Compared fractions differ in elution range and thus fraction number due to the use of a different flow rate and column, and because of a faster initial gradient for the elution of male and female molecules (0&#x02013;30% B in 10&#x02009;min instead of 24&#x02009;min, which did not affect the elution of SPF proteins, since these elute at higher ACN concentrations, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Figure S3</xref>). Mass spectra obtained per glycoform for each of the three consecutive 1&#x02009;ml fractions were averaged.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Computation of theoretical molecular weight from SPF precursors</title><p>SPF cDNA precursors obtained by RACE-PCR (see Collection of transcriptome data) were translated into proteins using the ExPASy Translate tool<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.
