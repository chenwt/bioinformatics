Using The Cancer Genome Atlas, overexpression of the GABA synthetic enzyme, glutamate decarboxylase 1 (<italic>GAD1</italic>), was found to be associated with decreased disease free-survival in prostate adenocarcinoma and decreased overall survival in clear cell renal cell carcinomas. Furthermore, <italic>GAD1</italic> was found to be expressed in castrate-resistant prostate cancer cell lines, but not androgen-responsive cell lines. Using a novel fluorescence-coupled enzymatic microplate assay for GABA mediated through reduction of resazurin in a prostate neuroendocrine carcinoma (PNEC) cell line, acid microenvironment-induced stress increased GABA levels while alkaline microenvironment-induced stress decreased GABA through modulation of GAD1 and glutamine synthetase (GLUL) activities. Moreover, glutamine but not glucose deprivation decreased GABA through modulation of GLUL. Consistent with evidence in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms that GABA synthesis mediated through GAD1 may play a crucial role in surviving stress, GABA may be an important mediator of stress survival in neoplasms. These findings identify GABA synthesis and metabolism as a potentially important pathway for regulating cancer cell stress response as well as a potential target for therapeutic strategies.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by grants from the Radiological Society of North America (RR1031; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rsna.org">http://www.rsna.org</ext-link>) and the National Institutes of Health (P50 CA94056).

Interestingly, adenocarcinomas can exhibit NE features characterized molecularly as the expression of gene products associated with the NE cell lineage. This phenomenon has been demonstrated in many types of adenocarcinoma, including those from lung, prostate, and colon, and correlates with tumor aggressiveness, metastasis, and shortened survival <xref rid="pone.0088667-Bhattacharjee1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0088667-diSantAgnese1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

Classical enzymatic-based metabolite quantitation, on the other hand, provides a cost-effective, readily accessible, sensitive means for quantitative analysis of metabolites <xref rid="pone.0088667-Passoneau1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.

However, the clinical significance of GAD1 in castrate-resistant prostate cancer remains to be clarified, as the number of GAD1-overexpressing prostate cancers identified in the public databases were small and could not be accurately correlated with castrate-resistant disease. Nonetheless, increased protein expression of the NE enzyme, dopa decarboxylase (DDC; E.C. 4.1.1.28) correlates with castrate-resistant disease <xref rid="pone.0088667-Wafa1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, further supporting a NE program associated with castrate-resistant prostate cancer.

For example, glutamic acid decarboxylase is widely implicated in the survival of prokaryotes and plants in acidic environments <xref rid="pone.0088667-Feehily1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088667-Capitani1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0088667-Shelp1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. However, the mechanisms by which glutamic acid decarboxylase allows organisms to survive acidic stress remains unclear. The apparent role of the GABA shunt in the evasion of environmental stresses to promote survival in other organisms is intriguing as such stresses are also significant in the cancer cell microenvironment and may therefore be involved in the ability of cancer cells to survive stress.</p><p>Many studies have been conducted on the effects of the cancer microenvironment on tumor physiology. For example, acidity has been demonstrated to drive metastasis <xref rid="pone.0088667-Estrella1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, while alkalization of the tumor microenvironment with sodium bicarbonate reduces metastasis <xref rid="pone.0088667-IbrahimHashim1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0088667-Robey1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. Our findings suggest an interplay between the cancer microenvironment, cancer metabolism, and metastatic potential of cancer cells. It has been documented previously that GAD1-mediated GABA synthesis and signaling through GABA-B receptors facilitate the expression of matrix metalloproteinases and invasion of prostate cancer cells <xref rid="pone.0088667-Azuma1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. We suggest that activity of the GABA shunt, at least in prostate cancer cells, may represent a metabolic pathway through which the microenvironment may stimulate metastasis and may also represent a mechanism by which bicarbonate therapy acts to reduce metastasis.</p><p>Herein, we demonstrated that alterations in extracellular pH can modulate levels of the GABA shunt metabolites glutamate and GABA through modulation of the expression and activity of the enzymes GAD1 and GLUL. Under acidic conditions, GAD1 protein and activity are increased in PNEC cells correlating with increased GABA concentration. Interestingly, GLUL protein levels and activity are also increased under acidic pH. Despite the increased activity of both of these enzymes involved in glutamate metabolism, there are no statistically significant differences in glutamate concentration under acidic pH. These findings could represent a complex manifestation of metabolic flux through additional metabolic as well as protein synthetic pathways in which glutamate is involved.</p><p>The effects of alkalinity on the GABA shunt are equally as intriguing. Exposure to an alkaline pH of 8.5 is met with decreased GAD1 activity as well as a decrease in GABA and an increase in glutamate concentration. Although these changes in metabolite concentration are expected for decreased GAD1 activity, there is also an increase in GLUL activity under alkaline pH. Of note, protein levels of GLUL in alkaline pH were higher compared to acidic pH, despite similar enzyme activity. This could be due to the presence of endogenous enzymatic inhibitors in complex cell lysate or could represent metabolic variability among passages in cell culture, although all cells used in this study were of low culture number. It is currently unclear if the mechanism underlying upregulation of GLUL or its predicted increase in glutamine concentration under alkaline pH is the same as that under acidic pH. The significant increase in glutamate concentration under alkaline, but not acidic pH further underscores the potential for complex metabolic fluxes of glutamate, glutamine, and GABA during pH stress. At this point, we hypothesize that the decrease in GABA under alkaline pH may be related to a combination of substrate competition from increased GLUL as well as decreased GAD1 activity.</p><p>The mechanism underlying relatively stable expression of ALDH5A1 under acid and alkaline stress as well as its known regulation by the cellular redox state <xref rid="pone.0088667-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref> suggests that the metabolism of GABA into succinate may be more dependent upon post-translational regulation than gene expression. Although the activity of ALDH5A1 is optimal at a pH of 8&#x02013;9 <xref rid="pone.0088667-Passoneau1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, there was no evidence of significantly different changes in enzyme activity in PNEC cell lysates. Although factors such as extracellular pH, pCO<sub>2</sub>, bicarbonate, and lactate can directly affect intracellular pH <xref rid="pone.0088667-Edwards1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088667-Buckler1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>, it is currently unclear if ALDH5A1 activity is directly modulated by alterations in intracellular pH. In addition, the role of ABAT in GABA metabolism remains to be elucidated. Unchanged concentration of SSAL under pH stress may also represent the effect of complex metabolic fluxes, specifically from carbons through the urea cycle arm of the GABA shunt <xref rid="pone.0088667-Ippolito1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>The relative contributions of glucose and glutamine to GABA synthesis in cancer cells are incompletely understood. However, general contributions of glucose and glutamine to cancer cell metabolism have been widely documented <xref rid="pone.0088667-VanderHeiden1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. Of note, glutamine is an alternative substrate to glucose for the synthesis of nucleotides and lipids and a source for ATP <xref rid="pone.0088667-Kovacevic1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088667-DeBerardinis1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. In addition, the contributions of glutamine metabolism toward cancer cell stress survival have been studied to some extent with evidence that cancer cell survival in hypoxia may be dependent on glutamine and glutamate metabolism <xref rid="pone.0088667-Kobayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>. Despite no significant change in GAD1 expression or activity following glutamine deprivation, we identified decreased glutamate and GABA, correlating with increased GLUL activity, as a potential mechanism to increase cellular stores of glutamine. This further supports a potential metabolic antagonism between GLUL and GAD1 that we also identified under alkaline conditions and suggested from the survival analysis. A trend toward decreased SSAL and ALDH5A1 activity following glutamine deprivation suggests decreased flux through the GABA shunt as a result of glutamine deprivation. These findings provide further support for glutamine deprivation as an anticancer therapy to decrease GABA synthesis.</p><p>Although glucose deprivation did not result in significant changes in GAD1 expression or activity, there was also a potential trend toward increased GAD1 activity as well as significantly increased SSAL, suggesting that flux through the GABA shunt is maintained or potentially increased during glucose deprivation. Of note, our glucose deprivation experiments were conducted in the absence of exogenous pyruvate, which could potentially act as carbon sources for the TCA cycle. It is possible that the GABA shunt in glucose deprivation may represent a mechanism to produce NADH through the activity of ALDH5A1 and supply carbons to the TCA cycle, presumably through glutamine and potentially the urea cycle, although this remains to be demonstrated with more complex metabolic flux analysis. Increased GLUL activity in glucose deprivation is likely a manifestation of depleted glutamine reserves in cell culture media (used at 6 mM in these experiments) further supporting the need for glutamine as a carbon source for cells in the absence of glucose.</p><p>In summary, we have described a new fluorometric assay that has provided a first glimpse into how pH and nutrient stress modulate GABA in prostate NE cancer cells. This presents a novel regulatory mechanism by which cancer cells can respond to environmental stresses. This assay can be widely adapted into single microplate or high throughput formats to measure GABA content in multiple samples under multiple conditions, treatments, or time points.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Jayne Marasa of the High Throughput Screening (HTS) core for her assistance.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0088667-DeLellis1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>DeLellis</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name> (<year>2001</year>) <article-title>The neuroendocrine system and its tumors: an overview</article-title>. <source>Am J Clin Pathol</source><volume>115</volume><issue>Suppl</issue>: <fpage>S5</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>16</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11993690</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0088667-Wick1"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Wick</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name> (<year>2000</year>) <article-title>Neuroendocrine neoplasia.
