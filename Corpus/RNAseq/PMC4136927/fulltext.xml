Studies in plants and vertebrates suggest they have an important housekeeping function in rRNA recycling. However, little is known about this family of enzymes in protostomes. We characterized RNase X25, the only RNase T2 enzyme in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. We found that RNase X25 is the major contributor of ribonuclease activity in flies as detected by <italic>in gel</italic> assays, and has an acidic pH preference. Gene expression analyses showed that the <italic>RNase X25</italic> transcript is present in all adult tissues and developmental stages. <italic>RNase X25</italic> expression is elevated in response to nutritional stresses; consistent with the hypothesis that this enzyme has a housekeeping role in recycling RNA. A correlation between induction of <italic>RNase X25</italic> expression and autophagy was observed. Moreover, induction of gene expression was triggered by oxidative stress suggesting that RNase X25 may have additional roles in stress responses. Phylogenetic analyses of this family in protostomes showed that RNase T2 genes have undergone duplication events followed by divergence in several phyla, including the loss of catalytic residues, and suggest that RNase T2 proteins have acquired novel functions. Among those, it is likely that a role in host immunosuppression evolved independently in several groups, including parasitic Platyhelminthes and parasitoid wasps. The presence of only one RNase T2 gene in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome, without any other evident secretory RNase activity detected, makes this organism an ideal system to study the cellular functions of RNase T2 proteins associated with RNA recycling and maintenance of cellular homeostasis. On the other hand, the discovery of gene duplications in several protostome genomes also presents interesting new avenues to study additional biological functions of this ancient family of proteins.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>A.R. is the recipient of a Fulbright Fellowship.

These ribonucleases (RNases) are found ubiquitously, with RNase T2 genes in genomes of most eukaryotes, many bacteria, as well as some viruses <xref rid="pone.0105444-Irie1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105444-MacIntosh1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Although primary sequence identity between eukaryotic and prokaryotic enzymes is low, there are conserved secondary structures that contain key core hydrophobic residues associated with the RNase T2 active site <xref rid="pone.0105444-MacIntosh1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105444-Deshpande1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. All characterized RNase T2 family members consist of a central four-stranded antiparallel &#x003b2;-sheet (strands &#x003b2;1, &#x003b2;2, &#x003b2;4 and &#x003b2;5), a small two-stranded antiparallel &#x003b2;-sheet (&#x003b2;3 and &#x003b2;7), and three &#x003b1;-helices (&#x003b1;B, &#x003b1;C, &#x003b1;D), with the catalytic site of the enzyme residing mainly within strands &#x003b2;2 and &#x003b2;5 and helix &#x003b1;C (Kurihara et al. 1996; Tanaka et al. 2000; Rodriguez et al. 2008). Two histidine residues within &#x003b2;2 and &#x003b1;C, together with surrounding residues form the conserved active site (CAS) motifs CAS I and CAS II <xref rid="pone.0105444-MacIntosh1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Importantly, each histidine is a direct participant in the acid-base catalysis mechanism that enables the transphosphorylation and hydrolysis reactions of RNase T2 enzymes <xref rid="pone.0105444-Irie1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105444-Tanaka1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>These ancient ribonucleases are secreted or targeted to membrane-bound intracellular compartments (lysosomes and vacuoles) where they degrade single stranded RNAs. Long known for their function in gametophytic self-incompatibility, and as part of the response to phosphate starvation in plants <xref rid="pone.0105444-MacIntosh1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105444-Luhtala1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, the RNase T2 family has been recently shown to play distinctly different developmental and physiological roles in plants and animals. Recent insights from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and zebrafish indicate that conservation of the RNase T2 family in all eukaryotes may be related to an important housekeeping function carried out by these enzymes, which includes recycling of ribosomal RNAs <xref rid="pone.0105444-Haud1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105444-Hillwig1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. A ribophagy-like pathway is thought to mediate this turnover of rRNAs in normal, non-stressed cells <xref rid="pone.0105444-MacIntosh2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, which is essential to maintain cellular homeostasis. Additionally, in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>, the enzymatic activities of RNase T2 proteins have been associated with cleavage of mature tRNAs to produce tRNA halves in response to starvation and oxidative stress <xref rid="pone.0105444-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105444-Andersen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The significance of the accumulation of these degradation intermediates is unknown, although it has been suggested that they may play a signaling role in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis <xref rid="pone.0105444-Luhtala1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Alternatively, they may accumulate as a consequence of targeted degradation of the translation machinery during stress conditions that leads to suppression of cell division <xref rid="pone.0105444-Andersen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Interestingly, a different ribonuclease carries out tRNA cleavage function in response to stress in vertebrate cells. In this case angiogenin, a member of the vertebrate-specific RNase A family, is responsible for the accumulation of tRNA fragments <xref rid="pone.0105444-Yamasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>At least one member of the RNase T2 family has been found in every eukaryotic genome that has been sequenced, with Trypanosomatids as the only exception <xref rid="pone.0105444-MacIntosh1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. High frequency of gene duplication and extensive divergence of the T2 RNases has occurred in plants <xref rid="pone.0105444-Igic1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105444-MacIntosh3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. On the other hand, only one, well-conserved gene, is found in most vertebrate genomes <xref rid="pone.0105444-Hillwig2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>; and it has been proposed that RNase A members have replaced RNase T2 in several biological roles in these organisms <xref rid="pone.0105444-MacIntosh1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105444-Hillwig2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Thus, characterization of the biological role played by RNase T2 enzymes in multicellular organisms is complicated in plants and vertebrates due to the presence of potentially redundant enzymatic activities. In contrast, the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> genome contains only one RNase T2 gene, <italic>RNase X25</italic> (also known as <italic>DmRNase-66B</italic>), and no RNase A homolog; thus, this organism could be used as a simpler system to demonstrate the conserved function(s) of this enzyme family in animals. <italic>RNase X25</italic> (CG8194), located at 66A21 on chromosome 3, is 1658 nucleotides in length and encodes a single form of mRNA transcript with a 325 amino acid open reading frame <xref rid="pone.0105444-Hime1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. A signal peptide cleavage site is anticipated between residues 21 and 22 suggesting transport of the predicted polypeptide chain to the secretory pathway. In addition, two asparagine residues (positions 214 and 231) and a threonine (residue 34) may serve as N- and O-glycosylation sites, respectively. N-glycosylation is the most common modification found for the RNase T2 family, while a few cases of O-glycosylation have been observed for fungal enzymes (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0105444-MacIntosh1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>).</p><p>As a first step towards understanding the role of RNases T2 in animals, biochemical analyses and gene expression studies were initiated in the fruit fly <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. RNase T2 activity was detected in all <italic>Drosophila</italic> life cycle stages examined, and this correlated well with <italic>RNase X25</italic> gene expression patterns. Furthermore, <italic>RNase X25</italic> gene expression levels were responsive to nutritional and oxidative stress as determined by the accumulation of <italic>RNase X25</italic> mRNAs in larvae starved for nutrients or exposed to wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), or hydrogen peroxide. A correlation between induction of autophagy and increased RNase X25 expression and activity was also observed in response to starvation. Finally, we used phylogenetic analyses to shed light on the evolution of the RNase T2 family of ribonucleases in protostomes and found evidence for gene duplications followed by divergence and the potential acquisition of new functions in several phyla, in contrast to the pattern observed in most deuterostomes. Together, these analyses suggest that RNase X25 carries out a conserved housekeeping function as proposed for other RNases T2 in plants and animals, and that <italic>Drosophila</italic>, with a single RNase T2 gene, is a good eukaryotic model system in which to investigate the role of RNases T2 in the process of ribophagy. The discovery of gene duplications in several protostome genomes also presents interesting new avenues to study additional roles of this ancient family of proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>D. melanogaster</italic> strains, and tissue preparations</title><p>In this study the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> strain <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>/<italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> with two wild type <italic>RNase X25</italic> genes and <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>/<italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>; <italic>Df(3L)Excel6279/+</italic> (denoted <italic>Df(3L)Excel6279/+</italic> in the text), with one wild type <italic>RNase X25</italic> gene were raised at 25&#x000b0;C on standard cornmeal media.</p><p>For staged embryo collections, females were placed in collecting bottles and eggs were gathered after aging from molasses-agar plates dusted with yeast.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Stress treatments</title><p>To provide standardized non-crowded growing conditions prior to stress treatments, 43 <italic>w<sup>1118</sup>/w<sup>1118</sup></italic> embryos (0&#x02013;2 hrs) were gently transferred onto Formula 4&#x02013;24 instant blue <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> diet (363.6 mg/1.625 &#x000b5;l H<sub>2</sub>O; Carolina Biological Supply, Burlington, NC, USA), that had been placed into a small petri dish (60&#x000d7;15 mm).

To detect RNase activities in extracts from different <italic>Drosophila</italic> developmental stages we used a standard <italic>in gel</italic> activity assay that allows size separation of different proteins with RNase activity. Embryos at 0&#x02013;2, 2&#x02013;6, and 0&#x02013;16 hr after egg deposition, as well as wandering third instar larvae, white prepupae, pupae, adult males, females, and isolated ovaries were collected. Protein extracts were prepared and analyzed for RNase activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105444-g001">Figure 1</xref>, top panel). At all developmental stages, RNase activities in the apparent 25&#x02013;30 kDa range, which correspond to the predicted size range of RNase T2 enzymes, were observed. It is important to note that the PAGE method used for this assay is semi-denaturing, since it includes SDS but not reducing agents, and the apparent molecular weight observed for each protein band does not necessarily correspond to the predicted mass. Detection of RNase activities with distinct molecular weights in this range may be indicative of posttranslational processing, including N- and O-glycosylation, a common posttranslational modification of RNase T2 proteins. While most stages showed a similar level of RNase activity, samples collected from early 0&#x02013;2 hr embryos and third instar larvae showed lower RNase activity.

In our analysis, parasitic wasps were the only insects with multiple T2 genes in their genome. Remarkably, wasps from the Braconidae family form a symbiosis with polydnaviruses that help the insect parasitize its host <xref rid="pone.0105444-Burke1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Bracovirus in the Braconidae contain an RNase T2 gene in their genome, which has a role in immunosuppression of the wasp's host <xref rid="pone.0105444-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The RNase T2 protein predictions derived from ESTs from <italic>Glyptapanteles flavicoxis</italic>, a wasp from the Braconidae family, cluster with bracovirus RNases included in our phylogenetic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105444-g007">Figure 7</xref>), indicating that these RNases are expressed from the symbiotic viral genome. However, the RNases in <italic>N. vitripennis</italic>, which belongs to the Pteromalidae family and does not form a symbiotic relation with polydnaviruses, form an independent clade. One <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> gene, <italic>RNase Nvi1</italic>, is included in the clade that includes the RNases from all other Hymenoptera. This gene is located in chromosome 4 in this wasp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105444-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The other six full-length genes (<italic>RNase Nvi2</italic> - <italic>RNase Nvi7</italic>) and a pseudogene (<italic>RNase Nvi8</italic>) are located in tandem in chromosome 3, and are likely the result of later gene duplications. We searched for any potential viral gene that could be linked to the RNases in chromosome 3 without success, suggesting that these RNases do not have a viral origin. The fact that these RNases form an independent cluster with strong bootstrap support suggests that these proteins diverged quickly after the initial gene duplication event. Identification of an EST from <italic>Nasonia giraulti</italic> (GeneBank Accession number ES622650) with 97% identity at the nucleotide level with <italic>RNase Nvi2</italic> indicated that this duplication event(s) should have occurred before speciation in the genus <italic>Nasonia</italic>. Analysis of protein sequences indicated that all the RNases from chromosome 3 have an H to Y amino acid substitution in the conserved active site II (CAS II, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105444-g010">Figure 10</xref>) that may lead to an attenuation of enzymatic activity, as has been previously observed in other animal and plant RNase T2 proteins <xref rid="pone.0105444-MacIntosh1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Substitutions in this position were also observed in some Platyhelminthes and mollusk RNases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105444-g010">Figure 10</xref>). Moreover, some flatworm RNases (RNase Sja2, RNase Sja3, and RNase Sja6) may have lost enzymatic activity completely, since they also have a substitution in a CAS I histidine that is essential for RNase activity <xref rid="pone.0105444-Irie1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0105444-g010" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0105444.g010</object-id><label>Figure 10</label><caption><title>Identification of mutations in conserved active site residues in protostome RNase T2 proteins.</title><p>The alignment shows the conserved CAS I and CAS II regions characteristic of RNase T2 enzymes.

We found constitutive expression of <italic>RNase X25</italic> mRNA during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development, and we were able to show a correlation between the main RNase activity detected in zymograms and expression of this gene in wild-type and deletion mutants, indicating that RNase X25 is a major contributor of endonuclease activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> extracts. This activity has a pH optimum in the acidic range, a common characteristic of animal RNase T2 enzymes, which indicates that the active enzyme may normally be sequestered in an acidic compartment within cells to carry out its function. Animal RNase T2 proteins have been localized to lysosomes in zebrafish and humans <xref rid="pone.0105444-Haud1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105444-Campomenosi1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, and prediction of subcellular localization for RNase X25 indicated that this protein is also targeted to the secretory pathway <xref rid="pone.0105444-Hime1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Based on our results and data extracted from databases, RNase X25 seems to be active at all stages of development and in all larval and adult tissues investigated. This result is in agreement with those studies that have characterized the RNase T2 family in other eukaryotes <xref rid="pone.0105444-MacIntosh1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and suggest that, as it has been proposed for other eukaryotic RNase T2 enzymes constitutively expressed, RNase X25 may perform a housekeeping function. Absence of this constitutive RNase activity in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and zebrafish leads to accumulation of rRNA in vacuoles or lysosomes <xref rid="pone.0105444-Haud1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105444-Hillwig1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Additionally, Arabidopsis plants lacking expression of <italic>RNS2</italic>, the housekeeping RNase T2 in this organism, show constitutive autophagy <xref rid="pone.0105444-Hillwig1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Thus, it has been proposed that the role of these RNases is to maintain normal cellular homeostasis by recycling rRNA.</p><p>A role in rRNA recycling and cellular homeostasis may also be carried out by RNase T2 enzymes in cells under nutritional stress conditions, likely through a specialized autophagy process known as ribophagy. Ribophagy, the targeted degradation of ribosomes through a mechanism that uses the autophagy machinery, has been described for yeast cells undergoing starvation <xref rid="pone.0105444-Kraft1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>; and Rny1, the only RNase T2 enzyme in yeast <xref rid="pone.0105444-MacIntosh4" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, may mediate rRNA degradation under stress conditions <xref rid="pone.0105444-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. While a direct role for RNase T2 enzymes in ribophagy has not been established, their participation in this process has been suggested for plants, animals, and unicellular eukaryotes <xref rid="pone.0105444-Haud1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105444-MacIntosh2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105444-Andersen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Moreover, several plant <italic>RNase T2</italic> genes are induced under conditions of phosphate starvation, probably as a mechanism to scavenge nutrients <xref rid="pone.0105444-MacIntosh1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and at least two <italic>Tetrahymena RNase T2</italic> genes are also induced by starvation conditions <xref rid="pone.0105444-Miao1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. We observed that expression of <italic>RNase X25</italic> is significantly induced in fly larvae subjected to starvation or fed WGA. Concomitant with this response we could also observe an increase in the expression of <italic>Atg5</italic>, which encodes one of the core components of the autophagy machinery that has been previously shown to be induced by starvation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovaries <xref rid="pone.0105444-Barth1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, and the robust appearance of Lysotracker-positive vesicles in larval fat body cells, marking lysosomes and autolysosomes participating in the autophagy process <xref rid="pone.0105444-Scott1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105444-JimenezSanchez1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Induction of <italic>RNase X25</italic> by nutritional stresses and evidence of autophagy may indicate that this enzyme also has a role in cellular homeostasis through recycling of cellular RNAs.</p><p>Data from a genome-wide microarray analysis of mRNA expression had previously identified <italic>RNase X25</italic> as one of 61 transcripts differentially expressed when animals were fed a 1% WGA diet <xref rid="pone.0105444-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In that study, a 9-fold increase in <italic>RNase X25</italic> transcript levels was observed for midgut tissue dissected from third instar larvae. Since whole animals were harvested for our analysis, it is conceivable that the modest &#x0223c;2 fold increase in <italic>RNase X25</italic> mRNA levels we observed reflects a tissue specific differential response to WGA. Higher levels of <italic>RNase X25</italic> mRNAs may accumulate in tissues of the gut, with stable expression levels in remaining tissues. This effect could also explain the discrepancies in results observed in several high throughput analyses of starved <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae or adults (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0105444.s003">Table S1</xref>). This &#x0201c;dilution effect&#x0201d; may also explain the difference between the <italic>Atg5</italic> levels of expression observed in our experiment and the experiments of Barth et al. <xref rid="pone.0105444-Barth1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, who isolated ovaries for their analyses.</p><p>In addition to the housekeeping role, RNase T2 enzymes have acquired novel functions during eukaryote evolution. In some cases, novel functions appeared after gene duplications. This seems to be the case for plant RNase T2 enzymes that participate in defense mechanisms, and also for S-RNases, specialized T2 enzymes that determine gametophytic self-incompatibility in several plant species <xref rid="pone.0105444-Igic1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105444-MacIntosh3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In other cases, a single protein can have multiple roles. For example, both RNase activity-dependent and -independent functions have been proposed for human RNASET2. Lack of RNASET2 causes cystic leukoencephalopathy in humans and a similar phenotype in zebrafish <xref rid="pone.0105444-Haud1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105444-Henneke1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. This neurological disorder is likely caused by lysosomal malfunction due to the high levels of rRNA that accumulate in these organelles when the enzyme is absent <xref rid="pone.0105444-Haud1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In addition, human RNASET2 has been shown to have anti-metastatic properties independent of its catalytic activity <xref rid="pone.0105444-Acquati1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Another enzyme with more than one function is yeast Rny1. This protein may work in rRNA recycling during ribophagy-like processes, given its localization in vacuoles in normal growth conditions <xref rid="pone.0105444-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Additionally, Rny1 is responsible for tRNA cleavage during the cell's response to oxidative stress, after the enzyme is likely released from the vacuole into the cytoplasm. The accumulation of stable tRNA halves is thought to act as a signal during the stress response <xref rid="pone.0105444-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105444-Andersen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Moreover, during the oxidative stress response, Rny1 is able to promote cell death through an unknown mechanism that is independent of its RNase activity <xref rid="pone.0105444-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Cleavage of tRNAs in stress conditions that inhibit cell growth is a response conserved in plants and animals <xref rid="pone.0105444-Andersen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105444-Thompson2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, and there is some evidence that tRNA fragments also accumulate in <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref rid="pone.0105444-Brennecke1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105444-Aravin1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. We showed here that <italic>RNase X25</italic> expression is increased in flies subjected to oxidative stress, making this enzyme the logical candidate for a role in tRNA cleavage in these insects, and suggesting that RNase X25 may have dual function, as shown for other members of the RNase T2 family.</p><p>Our phylogenetic analyses showed that most insects have only one gene belonging to the RNase T2 family in their genomes. However, parasitoid wasps of the genus <italic>Nasonia</italic> seem to be the exception. In these insects, several gene duplications have occurred, and there is EST evidence indicating that the duplicated genes are expressed. In addition, mutations in the conserved active site of these proteins suggest that the duplicated enzymes have attenuated activity. Interestingly, parasitoid wasps from other families have a symbiotic relationship with polydnaviruses that provide protein factors essential for parasitism <xref rid="pone.0105444-Burke1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, including proteins belonging to the RNase T2 family <xref rid="pone.0105444-RamjanAli1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. These virus-encoded RNase T2 proteins are expressed in the parasitoid larva and likely delivered into the host during the parasitization process <xref rid="pone.0105444-RamjanAli1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Expression of the viral RNase alone in the host larva resulted in reduction in hemocyte populations and increase in susceptibility of the larva to bacterial and baculovirus infections, indicating that these RNases have an important immunosuppressive function during parasitism <xref rid="pone.0105444-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105444-Park2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. <italic>Nasonia</italic> wasps do not have a polydnavirus symbiont. It is possible, then, that upon duplication of the conserved housekeeping <italic>RNase T2</italic> gene, the new proteins diverged and were recruited for a novel function in immunosuppression during parasitism, in a case of convergent evolution.</p><p>It is intriguing that the duplicated <italic>Nasonia</italic> RNases have mutations in the enzymes' active site. These changes have been previously reported in other proteins of the RNase T2 family, and it has been speculated that they may result in attenuated yet active enzymes <xref rid="pone.0105444-MacIntosh3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105444-Hillwig2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. However, the biological significance of this mutation is not yet understood. Other RNase T2 proteins are also able to modulate immune responses. E<sup>rns</sup>, a Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus RNase T2 protein, can inhibit the host beta interferon response potentially by interfering with the dsRNA signal <xref rid="pone.0105444-Iqbal1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, or through an intracellular mechanism involving cell-to-cell signaling even in the absence of virion particles <xref rid="pone.0105444-Python1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. This inhibitory effect on the beta interferon response depends on the RNase activity of E<sup>rns</sup>
<xref rid="pone.0105444-Iqbal1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105444-Python1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. However, a catalysis-independent cytotoxic effect for this protein has also been proposed based on the ability of mutant proteins without RNase activity to induce cell death in swine kidney cells <xref rid="pone.0105444-Hulst1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Omega-1, a secreted RNase T2 protein from <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>, also has a cytotoxic effect on its host hepatic cells <xref rid="pone.0105444-Fitzsimmons1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. This protein is also able to induce a strong Th2-polarized immune response in the host, which is necessary for the efficient passage of parasite eggs from the intravascular sites of deposition to the intestinal or bladder lumen <xref rid="pone.0105444-Pearce1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. In this case, modulation of the immune response seems to be caused by suppression of protein synthesis after internalization by dendritic cells following recognition of the glycosylation signature of omega-1 <xref rid="pone.0105444-Everts1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. The RNase activity of omega-1 is necessary for this immunomodulating role. However, other <italic>Schistosoma</italic> species appear to have inactive RNase T2 proteins in addition to enzymes with conserved active sites. It is possible that these proteins could also play a role in immunoregulation, although these inactive proteins are present also in free living planarians.</p><p>Recent insights from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, zebrafish, and human indicate that the RNase T2 enzymes carry out an important housekeeping function in normal cells <xref rid="pone.0105444-Haud1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105444-Hillwig1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Arabidopsis mutants lacking this conserved RNase T2 activity accumulate RNA, mainly in the vacuole, have an increased rRNA half-life, and exhibit constitutive autophagy <xref rid="pone.0105444-Hillwig1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>; while <italic>rnaset2</italic> mutant zebrafish show aberrant accumulation of undigested rRNA in neuronal lysosomes and present brain lesions similar to those observed in leukocephalopathies associated with deficiencies in RNASET2 in humans <xref rid="pone.0105444-Haud1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105444-Henneke1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Thus, RNase T2 enzymes participate in the normal recycling of rRNA, and this housekeeping function seems to be essential for cellular homeostasis. Duplication and divergence of the RNase T2 gene family has occurred in the evolution of plants and fishes. Secreted RNases of the RNase A family seem to have acquired in vertebrates, including humans, some of the biological roles carried out by RNase T2 enzymes in other systems (reviewed by MacIntosh <xref rid="pone.0105444-MacIntosh1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>). Use of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model, whose genome encodes only one <italic>RNase T2</italic> gene and lacks RNase A homologs or other evident secretory RNases with similar activity, is likely to provide insight into the ancestral physiological function of this gene family in multicellular animals during normal growth and development, and also under stress conditions. Analyses of <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants with reduced RNase X25 activity may lead to identification of phenotypic characteristics that could be the basis of genetic modifier screens to identify other key genes that participate in RNase T2 function. These may also prove important to understand how RNA degradation systems interface with other cellular processes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0105444.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression profile of </bold><bold><italic>RNase X25</italic></bold><bold> in different adult tissues from the modENCODE database.</bold></p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0105444.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0105444.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p><bold>Expression profile of </bold><bold><italic>RNase X25</italic></bold><bold> in different adult and larval tissues from the FlyAtlas database.</bold></p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0105444.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0105444.s003"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p><bold>Regulation of RNase X25 expression under nutritional stress or other conditions, obtained from public databases or the literature.</bold></p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0105444.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0105444.s004"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p><bold>Proteins belonging to the RNase T2 family used for phylogenetic analyses.</bold></p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0105444.s004.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Shelby Gosa, Amanda Haffarnan, and Joanne Tran for their help collecting fly samples.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0105444-Irie1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Irie</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name> (<year>1999</year>) <article-title>Structure-function relationships of acid ribonucleases: lysosomal, vacuolar, and periplasmic enzymes</article-title>. <source>Pharmacol Ther</source><volume>81</volume>: <fpage>77</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>89</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10190580</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0105444-MacIntosh1"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">MacIntosh GC (2011) RNase T2 Family: Enzymatic Properties, Functional Diversity, and Evolution of Ancient Ribonucleases.
