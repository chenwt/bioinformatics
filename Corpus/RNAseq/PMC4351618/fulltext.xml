By analyzing RNASeq datasets, we demonstrate region specific enrichment of populations of lncRNAs and mRNAs in the mouse hippocampus and pre-frontal cortex (PFC), the two major regions of the brain involved in memory storage and neuropsychiatric disorders. We identified 2759 lncRNAs and 17,859 mRNAs in the hippocampus and 2561 lncRNAs and 17,464 mRNAs expressed in the PFC. The lncRNAs identified correspond to ~14% of the transcriptome of the hippocampus and PFC and ~70% of the lncRNAs annotated in the mouse genome (NCBIM37) and are localized along the chromosomes as varying numbers of clusters. Importantly, we also found that a few of the tested lncRNA-mRNA pairs that share a genomic locus display specific co-expression in a region-specific manner. Furthermore, we find that sub-regions of the brain and specific neuronal populations have characteristic lncRNA expression signatures. These results reveal an unexpected complexity of the lncRNA expression in the mouse brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>lncRNA</kwd><kwd>mRNA</kwd><kwd>genomic context</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>pre-frontal cortex</kwd><kwd>differential gene expression</kwd><kwd>RNAseq</kwd><kwd>pathway analysis</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="49"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="9621"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>While previously regarded as simply &#x0201c;transcriptional noise,&#x0201d; non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) constitute 97&#x02013;98% of the human genome that is not translated into proteins (Derrien et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcribed by RNA polymerases II and III (Dieci et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Kapranov et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Guttman et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), and are a minimum of 200 nucleotides long. Closer scrutiny of lncRNAs, spurred by recent technological advances in DNA microarrays and RNA sequencing, has suggested that they are involved in chromatin remodeling, transcription, alternative splicing, imprinting, cytoplasmic trafficking, and aging (Mercer et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Wang and Chang, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Soreq et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Based on the genomic orientation of lncRNAs and their associated protein-coding genes, lncRNAs are characterized as intronic, bidirectional, antisense, sense overlapping, and intergenic (Ma et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Whole transcriptome sequencing to investigate tissue-specific expression in lower organisms found that the largest number of tissue specific lncRNA transcripts is expressed in the brain (Kaushik et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The large number of lncRNAs that exhibit neuronal-specific expression suggests their essential role in the neuronal diversification seen in higher vertebrates (Cao et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Qureshi et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). It has been reported that aberrant expression of lncRNAs is associated with neurological disorders (Faghihi et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Khalil et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Johnson, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Pauli et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Roberts et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Soreq et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Using the <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization data available from the Allen Brain Atlas, Mercer et al., reported that lncRNAs are differentially expressed in different regions of the adult mouse brain (Mercer et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Recently, Sauvageau et al., have developed several lines of knockout mice to investigate a family of non-coding RNA molecules known as long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) (Sauvageau et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). These studies reveal that lincRNAs regulate key functions of the overall viability and developmental processes of mice, including the development of the cerebral cortex.</p><p>While functional characterization of neuronal-enriched lncRNAs is still limited, broader studies of lncRNA function have implicated them as regulators of transcription through epigenetic regulation of chromatin structure and RNA-transcription factor interaction (Kurokawa, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Kornienko et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Wu et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Halley et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Despite this importance we still do not have unbiased estimates of lncRNAs expressed in specific brain regions and the extent of their differential expression in mammalian brain.</p><p>Here we report the identification of the lncRNAs and mRNAs expressed in two key brain regions involved in memory and neuropsychiatric disorders, the hippocampus and pre-frontal cortex (PFC). Following RNAseq analysis (<italic>N</italic> = 4 biological replicates) of hippocampus and PFC, we identified 2759 lncRNAs expressed in the hippocampus and 2561 lncRNAs in PFC using a customized computational analysis pipeline and have identified their chromosomal locations. Among these, 2390 lncRNAs are expressed in both regions. Importantly, 24 lncRNA transcripts are differentially expressed in the hippocampus and PFC. We have then studied differential expression of a subset of lncRNAs in (1) two other brain regions, striatum and cerebellum, (2) dorsal and ventral hippocampus, (3) three different neuronal populations (CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus neurons of hippocampus), and (4) have examined subcellular distribution of a subset of candidates in the hippocampus and PFC by RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and sub-cellular fractionation. Our studies establish that specific brain regions and neuronal populations have characteristic expression pattern of lncRNAs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Overview of lncRNA and mRNA profiles in adult mouse hippocampus and PFC</title><p>To perform an unbiased profiling of the total transcriptome of the hippocampus and pre-frontal cortex (PFC) in the adult mouse, RNA samples were prepared from the respective brain regions of 7&#x02013;9 week old male mice (<italic>N</italic> = 4 biological replicates, each replication has two mice). The transcripts were assembled and analyzed using a reported workflow as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>. We mapped a total of 20,618 genes in the hippocampus and 20,025 genes in the PFC, including both protein-coding and non-coding transcripts (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>). There are 3823 lncRNAs so far annotated in the mouse genome, according to the NCBIM37, and the 2759 lncRNAs mapped in the hippocampus and 2561 in the PFC from our study represent ~70% of the total annotated mouse lncRNAs. Alignment of mapped reads from each sample to mouse transcriptome is provided in Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>. Additionally, these lncRNAs represent ~14% of the total mouse brain transcriptome mapped in this study. The total transcriptome composition in each tissue is shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B,C</xref> for the hippocampus and PFC, respectively. Next, we estimated the expression abundance of all lncRNA and mRNA genes by running Cufflinks across 8 samples using the ENSEMBL annotation file (NCBI37).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Next generation sequencing analysis of hippocampus (HP) and pre-frontal cortex (PFC) from adult mouse brain</bold>. <bold>(A)</bold> Pipeline for the identification of mRNAs and lncRNAs from mouse brain total RNA preparation.

The Allen Brain Atlas shows a similar expression profile for the lncRNAs <italic>MEG3, RIAN</italic>, and <italic>MIAT</italic>. Additionally, we looked at the top 50 mRNAs and the complete list is represented in Figures S1C,D. This abundance estimation indicated much lower expression levels of non-coding RNAs compared to that of protein-coding RNAs and that most lncRNAs (&#x0003e;80%) are expressed at a low level, an observation similar to those drawn from previous studies of the mammalian genome (Mercer et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Derrien et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>The transcriptomic profile of mRNA and lncRNA expression is summarized in Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>. Further classification of the lncRNAs based on genomic context using the ENSEMBL annotation file provided eight biotypes: antisense, long lincRNAs, processed transcripts, sense overlapping, sense intronic, long non-coding, 3&#x02032; overlapping ncRNA and ncRNA host. Among these, lincRNAs (53%) and antisense ncRNAs (38%) showed predominance compared to other types of ncRNAs in both tissues (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D,E</xref>), an outcome similar to the observations from earlier studies (Khalil et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Pauli et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Ma et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). For example, the human GENCODE catalog mapped more than 70% of the lncRNAs into the lincRNA category (Derrien et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Similarly the transcriptomic profiling in Maize showed that 93% of lncRNAs are located in intergenic regions and only 7% of the lncRNAs overlap with gene sequences (Li et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). To estimate the differential expression (DE), the raw read counts generated in HTSeq were used in the R Bioconductor package DESeq. DESeq analyses of the protein coding as well as non-coding transcripts showed a robust DE pattern where 24 long non-coding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) and 821 protein-coding transcripts were differentially expressed between the hippocampus and PFC (adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05; Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Co-expression analyses of differentially expressed lncRNAs and neighboring mRNAs.

In order to observe the chromosomal distribution of lncRNAs, we mapped the transcriptional loci of all 2930 lncRNAs detected in this study. Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref> list the number of lncRNAs expressed from each chromosome from the current study and Figure S3 shows the distribution of lncRNAs on each chromosome. Based on the number of lncRNAs encoded, the top three chromosomes (2, 4, and 11) are highlighted in red. A &#x0201c;spot&#x0201d; on the chromosome where we observe a large number of lncRNAs are clustered together, we termed as an &#x0201c;lncRNA transcriptional cluster&#x0201d; while discussing the chromosomal distribution of lncRNAs in the manuscript. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> shows that most of the lncRNA loci mapped in this study are clustered along chromosomes 2, 4, and 11. LncRNA loci in other chromosomes are shown in Figure S3. We find that though lncRNA loci are present as several clusters, the genomic loci of differentially expressed lncRNAs in the hippocampus and PFC are randomly distributed along the chromosomes (red: higher in PFC and blue: higher in hippocampus). Interestingly, we did not find any hippocampal or PFC lncRNAs present in the Y chromosome. Similar to our finding, an earlier study on the mouse embryonic brain also did not assign any lncRNAs to the Y chromosome (Lv et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Chromosome locations of all lncRNAs along mouse genome</bold>.

Horizontal black lines in the color shaded along the chromosome show chromosomal location of individual lncRNAs. This analysis showed clustering of several lncRNAs along the chromosomes. All the 21 chromosomes and their lncRNAs distribution are illustrated in Figure S3.

Selective enrichment of lncRNA and neighboring mRNAs suggest co-regulation of their expression. We determined which of the 24 differentially expressed lncRNAs are transcribed from genomic loci overlapping with, or adjacent to, the loci that encode 821 differentially expressed mRNAs identified from DESeq analysis. For the purpose of defining &#x0201c;genomic association,&#x0201d; we have defined 50 Kb in either direction of the genomic loci of a given lncRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) as the &#x0201c;neighboring chromosomal region.&#x0201d; Furthermore, we considered that the DE of one of the genes in this pair (lncRNA and mRNA) is either positively or inversely correlated with the DE of the other gene.</p><p>By screening ~50 Kb genomic region flanking the genomic loci of all 24 lncRNAs on either direction using the UCSC genome database, (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/">https://genome.ucsc.edu/</ext-link>), we identified ~50 mRNA genes. Matching these ~50 mRNAs to the differentially enriched 821 mRNA gene list identified 9 mRNAs, that are within 50 kb of lncRNAs and are differentially enriched between the hippocampus and PFC. For further characterization we have selected from this list, lncRNAs and their corresponding mRNAs coded from the same loci. We found three lncRNA-mRNA pairs that share a common genomic locus and are partially or completely overlapping with each other.</p><p>One of these three pairs, <italic>GM9968</italic>, is an lncRNA significantly enriched in the mouse hippocampus and transcribed in the antisense direction of DNA binding protein gene <italic>ZBTB20</italic> (Zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 20). Past studies showed that <italic>ZBTB20</italic> is particularly expressed in primary hippocampal neurons, cerebellar granule cells, gliogenic progenitors and differentiated glia. RNAseq analyses showed that both of these transcripts are enriched in the hippocampus, and we confirmed the results by qRT-PCR, which showed a 2-fold enrichment of <italic>GM9968</italic> and 3-fold enrichment of <italic>ZBTB20</italic> in the hippocampus compared to the PFC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). In a similar way we analyzed two more protein-coding lncRNA pairs to identify specific expression patterns. <italic>GM14290</italic> is another lncRNA on chromosome 2 that shares exonic overlap with the gene <italic>KCNB1. KCNB1</italic> is a potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily B member 1 that mediates the voltage-dependent potassium ion permeability of excitable membranes. Interestingly, the <italic>GM14290</italic>-<italic>KCNB1</italic> pair is enriched in the PFC compared to the hippocampus and we have confirmed the NGS results with qRT-PCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Additionally, our studies showed that <italic>2310002F09Rik</italic> is another lncRNA that shares an exonic overlap with <italic>KLK8</italic> in the antisense direction. <italic>KLK8</italic> (kallikrein-related peptidase 8), known commonly as neuropsin, is a serine protease expressed predominantly in the brain. Earlier analyses using northern blot and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization demonstrated that neuropsin is expressed specifically in the limbic system of the mouse brain and is present at the highest concentrations in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 subfields (Oka et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with the above studies, our gene expression analyses, both by RNAseq as well as qRT-PCR validated that klk8/neuropsin is highly enriched in the hippocampus (~5-fold difference) compared to the PFC. We found that the lincRNA <italic>2310002F09Rik</italic> that shares exonic overlap with neuropsin spans the promoter region of the neuropsin and is enriched in the hippocampus (~8-fold) compared to the PFC. Both genes are enriched very significantly in the hippocampus compared to the PFC. Here, these three pairs had a positive, direct correlation where both mRNA and lncRNA were selectively enriched in either the hippocampus (<italic>GM9968</italic> -<italic>ZBTB20 and 2310002F09Rik</italic> -<italic>KLK8)</italic> or PFC (<italic>GM14290</italic>-<italic>KCNB1)</italic>. This observation is consistent with the prevalence of concordant expression patterns in mammalian <italic>cis</italic>-sense or <italic>cis</italic>-antisense gene pairs (Nakagawa and Kageyama, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>To understand the functional significance of the tissue-specific gene signatures, we applied gene ontology enrichment analysis of upregulated (log2 fold change &#x0003e; 1, adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05) and downregulated genes (log2 fold change &#x0003c; &#x02013;1, adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05) in the hippocampus compared to the PFC using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen-IPA). The top ten upregulated and downregulated pathways were identified and sorted according to their statistical significance as the negative logarithm of <italic>p</italic>-values calculated by IPA (Figures S4A,B). Our analysis found that many of the differentially expressed mRNAs assigned to the canonical pathway mapping are involved in the categories &#x0201c;Neurological diseases, Psychological diseases and Behavior&#x0201d; and are enriched in the PFC compared to the hippocampus.</p></sec><sec><title>Dynamic expression pattern of lncRNAs in different mouse brain regions</title><p>We next studied whether the selectively enriched lncRNAs in the hippocampus and PFC show DE in other regions of the brain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).

We next studied how lncRNAs are differently expressed within a brain region. We first examined the lncRNA expression in dorsal and ventral hippocampus and then in the three specific sub-regions of hippocampus DG (Dentate Gyrus), CA3 (Cornu Ammonis 3), and CA1 (Cornu Ammonis 1)&#x02014;that constitute the tri-synaptic circuitry. DG, CA3, and CA1 regions contain populations of neurons that are homogeneous and show characteristic electrophysiological properties.</p><p>Dorsal and ventral hippocampus are implicated in different cognitive functions (Wang et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).

However, between the vHP and dHP, the expression level of GM9968 is different. <italic>GM9968</italic> level appears to be higher in the vHP compared to dHP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>GM13644</italic>, another lncRNA enriched in the hippocampus, did not exhibit any prevalence in the vHP vs. dHP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>).

A representative Cresyl violet staining image showing successful microdissection of CA1, CA3 and DG regions of the hippocampus is shown Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>. The DE analysis of each region compared to the total hippocampus showed that four of the lncRNAs we analyzed follow a unique expression pattern in a specific sub-region of the hippocampus as summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>. All of these lncRNAs are enriched in these sub-regions compared to the total hippocampus, which suggests potential roles in spatial regulation of gene expression of lncRNAs. Additionally, we found differences in the expression levels of some of these lncRNAs between CA1, CA3, and DG. For example, <italic>GM2115</italic> is significantly enriched in the CA1 relative to both CA3 and DG (Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) whereas CA3 and DG have similar levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). In the case of 2<italic>310002F09Rik</italic>, CA1 has significantly lower expression levels (Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) relative to both CA3 and DG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>).

These differences in the expression levels indicate neuron specific expression profile of lncRNAs within subregions of the hippocampus. As one of the most abundantly expressed lncRNAs in the hippocampus and PFC, MALAT-1 did not show any preferential expression between these two regions, and within the hippocampal subregions.</p><p>qRT-PCR results showed lncRNAs we studied in DG and CA3 have similar expression levels, and expression in CA1 is lower than that in DG and CA3. The slight disparity could come from the challenges posed by LCM during which some amount of RNA degradation unavoidably occurs even under the most stringent RNase-free environment, as well as from the following linear amplification (Wang et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), where aRNA production leads to shortening of transcripts over successive cycles of amplification (Clement-Ziza et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). These results indicate a unique spatial distribution of specific lncRNAs within the same anatomical region of the adult mouse brain.</p><p>It has been shown that the lncRNAs are trafficked to specific subcellular locations (Prasanth et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Puthanveettil et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Kadakkuzha et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Van Heesch et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), which are directly indicative of their function. We next investigated the subcellular distribution of four different lncRNAs in the CA1, CA3, and DG neurons and CG1 (cingulate cortex 1) region of PFC. For CA1, CA3, and DG neurons, we selected <italic>GM9968</italic> and <italic>GM13644</italic>, which we analyzed earlier for hippocampal subregion specific expression.

Similar large-scale studies have discovered fundamental characteristics of lncRNAs including their low levels of expression, temporal and spatial patterns of expression exons junction modulation, and disease-related splicing events. In a recent RNA-Seq study in Parkinson Disease (PD) patients that sequenced libraries from leukocytes and two brain regions added over 7000 lncRNAs to the human lncRNA database, of which 3495 were co-expressed in the PD brain and leukocytes suggesting the involvement of lncRNA in neurodegenerative diseases (Soreq et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Our results and the above mentioned study outcomes are providing framework to find out the diverse mechanisms through which lncRNAs act to regulate protein-coding genes at both the transcriptional and translational levels.</p><p>Estimates from the most recent GENCODE project in mouse and humans indicate the presence of 4074 and 13,870 lncRNAs, respectively. Unlike the numbers of protein coding genes, which do not increase with organism complexity, the numbers of lncRNAs increase significantly (Khaitovich et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). The vast difference in the number of lncRNAs between human and mouse is intriguing as both species have a similar number of protein coding genes, and implies the role of lncRNAs in evolutionary development. Confirming this notion, it has been reported that that changes in lncRNA sequences constitute half of all the genetic differences between the human and chimpanzee genomes (10). However, it has yet to be determined if these changes are causative of the differences between humans and chimpanzees or if they are the result of genetic drift (Carninci et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Despite their significance little is known about the functions and identity of lncRNAs in specific brain regions and specific neuronal populations of the vertebrate brain. Specifically, we do not have unbiased estimates of populations of lncRNAs in sub-regions of the vertebrate brain. To address this, we have carried out RNAseq analysis of the total transcriptome to identify lncRNA population in two key regions of the brain, hippocampus, and PFC of the adult mouse. Annotation of lncRNAs in the mouse genome is yet to be completed and is often challenging due to the low expression levels of these transcripts, which leads to poor definition of the transcript boundaries.</p><p>To compare the overall expression status of lncRNAs and mRNAs in the hippocampus and PFC, we employed whole transcriptome sequencing and identified a total of 20,618 genes in the hippocampus and 20,025 in the PFC, including 2759 lncRNAs in the hippocampus and 2561 lncRNAs in the PFC. Less restrictive values for compared methodologies usually results in far too large a number of selected genes and here we applied a rather conservative adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value of 0.05 instead of <italic>P</italic>-value to identify the lncRNAs in these two regions. These lncRNA transcripts reported from the present study, out of the 3823 annotated lncRNA transcripts in the mouse genome, according to NCBIM37, represent a very robust (~70%) expression pattern of lncRNAs in the adult mouse brain. Consistent with the previous results that lncRNAs are generally expressed at lower levels than protein-coding genes and are more likely to display tissue-specific pattern of expression (Mercer et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Derrien et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Kutter et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), based on FPKM values we find that more than 80% of lncRNAs are expressed much lower than mRNAs (Figure S1) present in the same brain regions. Our depth of sequencing restricted us from identifying novel lncRNAs and recently described circular non-coding RNAs such as competing endogenous RNAs (Jeck et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with previous reports (Cabili et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Derrien et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), we found that most of the lncRNA expressed (53%) belong to the lincRNA category followed by antisense RNAs and a low prevalence of other biotypes in both the hippocampus and PFC. We next mapped all the lncRNAs from the hippocampus and PFC onto mouse chromosomes and found that they are present as clusters in varying numbers along the chromosomes, with three chromosomes (Figure S3: 2, 4, 11) expressing &#x0003e;300 lncRNAs and the rest of the chromosomes contained loci for 50&#x02013;150 lncRNAs. These results are consistent with previous finding on mRNAs and lncRNA pairs in the developing mouse brain that a large number of brain-expressed lncRNA loci are not evenly distributed along the mouse chromosomes (Ponjavic et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>We next searched for mRNAs and miRNAs within the 50 Kb of loci of differentially enriched lncRNAs to examine possible co-regulation of expression. We identified three lncRNA&#x02013;mRNA pairs [<italic>GM9968 and ZBTB20;</italic> 2<italic>310002F09Rik and KLK8</italic> (neuropsin); <italic>GM14290 and KCNB1</italic>] that displayed concordant expression. The observation that these three pairs of tightly co-expressed, share common genomic loci, and are differentially expressed between the hippocampus and PFC, suggest that these lncRNAs might regulate neuronal functions mediated by these mRNAs. For example, the lncRNA <italic>2310002F09Rik</italic>, which is enriched in the hippocampus and the protein-coding gene KLK8/neuropsin, share a 5&#x02032; exonic overlap in the antisense direction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Neuropsin is key in hippocampal plasticity (Oka et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) and plays an important role in brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Epilepsy. Another example is <italic>GM9968</italic>, an lncRNA that is significantly enriched in the mouse hippocampus. <italic>GM9968</italic> completely overlaps with <italic>ZBTB20</italic> in the antisense direction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>).

In addition, hypermethylation in the <italic>ZBTB20</italic> gene is shown to be associated with major depressive disorders. Taken together, these observations suggest that by regulating expression of specific mRNAs these lncRNAs might engage in neural plasticity and neuropsychiatric disorders.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Genomic context of two lncRNAs that share genomic loci with protein-coding genes associated with neurological diseases.

We examined expression differences in striatum, cerebellum, PFC, hippocampus and differences between dorsal and vHP and within the well-studied tri-synaptic circuitry of the hippocampus. The mammalian brain harbors a large variety of neuron types and sub-types, arranged in specific layers within the sub-regions. The hippocampus is an intensively studied part of the brain with dedicated sub-regions that differ in their physiological functions and capacities and display quite a specialized response to pathophysiological stimuli as illustrated in neurodegenerative disorders. Our studies showed an interesting distribution of these lncRNAs in the tri-synaptic circuitry. The two hippocampus enriched lncRNAs, <italic>GM9968</italic> and <italic>GM13644</italic>, showed different expression patterns. <italic>GM9968</italic> is equally distributed in the DG, CA1, and CA3 regions, but enriched in the vHP compared to the dHP. <italic>GM13644</italic> on the other hand, is equally distributed in the vHP and dHP, but highly enriched in DG compared to CA1 and CA3. Thus, lncRNAs show DE along dorsal-ventral axis of the hippocampus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Consistent with these observations we find that specific neuronal populations in hippocampus have characteristic lncRNA expression profiles. Our <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and sub-cellular fraction analysis add another layer to the complexity of lncRNA expression. These studies suggest that lncRNAs could be enriched in specific cellular compartments. Taken together, the tissue-specific expression patterns and the distinct subcellular localization of many lncRNAs suggest that their expression is under precise control. We now provide novel details on the expression patterns of lncRNAs per hippocampal sub-region and are of potential interest in further investigation of how lncRNAs regulate gene expression and other hippocampus dependent functions such as learning and memory.</p><p>In summary, in this study, we provide the first unbiased estimates of lncRNAs in two key brain regions, the hippocampus and PFC that are involved in memory and cognition. We have characterized their expression, in detail, including their chromosome distribution, genomic context, sub-region specific analyses and subcellular distribution. Our analyses establish complex lncRNA expression profiles in the mouse brain. This DE might play important roles in the development, physiology, plasticity and pathology of the mammalian brain.

Cufflinks measure transcript abundances in Fragment Per Kilobases of transcripts per million fragments mapped. The alignment data were then processed and quantified using HTSeq (Anders et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The raw read counts generated in HTSeq were used to identify differentially expressed genes in the R Bioconductor package DESeq (Anders and Huber, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). HTSeq count was run with &#x0201c;&#x02013;stranded = no&#x0201d; option, and the ID attribute option, &#x0201c;-i&#x0201d; set to &#x0201c;gene_name.&#x0201d; DESeq uses the total size of each library to normalize the raw read counts and perform calculations on fold change as well as significance based on <italic>p</italic>-value and adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value. The comparisons in this case are between samples of two groups, hippocampus and PFC. The distance matrix analysis based on DESeq method indicates that the hippocampus samples and PFC samples cluster together (Figure S2). LncRNA transcripts were extracted from the Ensembl annotation file (NCBIM37) and categorized into eight biotypes.</p></sec><sec><title>Co-expression analysis/IPA/chromosome distribution</title><p>Twenty-four differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05) were selected for co-expression analysis. At first, all the protein coding genes flanking each lncRNA within 50 Kb chromosomal region was selected from the UCSC genome browser. A total of nine neighboring differentially expressed protein-coding genes within 50 Kb distance from these lncRNAs were identified using the UCSC genome browser. To generate heat maps of these two corresponding gene lists (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,B</xref>), the GeneSpring GX V12.1 (Agilent Technologies) two dimensional hierarchical clustering algorithm was applied to median centered DESeq log2 normalized read counts (yellow/black/blue indicate higher, median and lower expression, respectively). The similarity measure was set to Pearson centered and the linkage rule was set to average.</p><p>Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (Qiagen-IPA) was used to identify enriched canonical pathways in the list of up-regulated (log2 fold change &#x0003e;1, adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05) and down-regulated genes (log2 fold change &#x0003c;&#x02212;1, adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05) in the hippocampus compared to PFC. The top 10 up-regulated and down-regulated pathways were identified and sorted according to their statistical significance as the negative logarithm of <italic>p</italic>-values calculated by IPA.</p><p>A karyotype displaying the location of all lncRNA transcripts was prepared using IGV (Integrated Genomics Viewer) (Robinson et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The loci of lncRNAs were obtained from cufflinks and this information was used to create a BED file. This BED file, along with the karyotype from reference genome mm9, was used to create the karyotype of lncRNA transcripts.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)</title><p>RNA was isolated from the tissues dissected from the adult mouse brain as described earlier and cDNA was generated by reverse transcription as described earlier (Kadakkuzha et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Briefly, 1 &#x003bc;g of RNA was used with Quanta cDNA SuperMix (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions and the expression of transcripts were quantified by qRT-PCR using SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems Carlsbad, CA) for detection in ABI 7900 cycler (Applied Biosystems Carlsbad, CA). All the qPCR amplifications were performed in quadruplicate in a total volume of 10 &#x003bc;l containing 2 &#x003bc;l of H2O, 2 &#x003bc;l of cDNA, 5 &#x003bc;l of 2X Master Mix, 1.0 &#x003bc;l of 10 &#x003bc;M (each) forward and reverse primers. Quantification of each transcript was normalized to the mouse 18S reference gene following the 2<sup>&#x02212;&#x00394;&#x00394;Ct</sup> method (Livak and Schmittgen, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>).

Mice were sacrificed and the brain was removed from the skull and quickly washed in ice-cold HEPES HBSS (HHBSS: 1&#x000d7; Hank's basal salt solution, 2.5 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 35 mm glucose, and 4 mm NaHCO3) containing 100 &#x003bc;g/ml of cycloheximide, protease inhibitors (1 tablet/50 ml, complete EDTA-free from Roche Products, Hertfordshire, UK) and SUPER&#x02022;aseIn&#x02122; RNase Inhibitor (1U/&#x003bc;l), Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Then, brains were embedded in OCT FSC 22 Blue frozen section compound (Leica Biosystems, Richmond, IL, USA) and immediately frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Cryosectioning</title><p>The fresh, frozen brains were sectioned at 16 &#x003bc;m on a Leica 3050 s cryostat. This thickness was optimal for minimizing sectioning artifacts, and was adequate for probe penetration into the section during the <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization procedure. Each OCT block containing a fresh, frozen brain was trimmed in the cryostat until reaching the desired starting section. Two brains sectioned in coronal plane were used to generate 3 series of 24 slides each. Each series contained sections collected from the same brain area (dHP, vHP, and PFC) and each slide of a given series contained four 16 &#x003bc;m thick sections (2 slices per brain).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In situ</italic> hybridization</title><p>DIG labeled ribo probes complementary to selected lncRNAs for <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization were prepared by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription of cDNA templates by using T7 RNA polymerase as described earlier (Kadakkuzha et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Briefly ~400 nt long sense strand of each transcript was prepared by PCR using mouse hippocampus cDNA as a template and transcript specific PCR primers (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S4</xref>) and ligated to pCRII-TOPO Vector with dual promoters T7 and SP6 (Invitrogen, Cat. Number K4600-01). The Vector with the sense lncRNA DNA in the 5&#x02013;3&#x02032; direction was linearized with BamH I (New England Biolab) for transcription using T7 RNA polymerase to generate antisense probes. A small aliquot (2 &#x003bc;l) was run on 1.5% agarose gel to confirm the integrity of RNA probes and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until used. The <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization using digoxigenin (DIG) labeled riboprobes was followed as described in Puthanveettil et al. (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Fifteen &#x003bc;M Cryo-sections were fixed in a freshly prepared solution of 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, washed three times for 5 min in 0.01 M PBS<sub>DEPC</sub> and acetylated in freshly prepared TEA solution for 10 min and pre-hybridization at 68&#x000b0;C overnight. After hybridization, the antisense RNA probes were visualized using a Fluorescent Antibody Enhancer kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) for DIG detection. The immunohistochemical analyses of b-tubulin were performed for each slice. Alexa Fluor&#x000ae; 546 Donkey Anti-Mouse IgG secondary antibodies (Life Technologies) were used for visualization. Images were acquired by using Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope system with 20X/63X objective. Only projection images are shown.</p></sec><sec><title>Laser capture microdissection (LCM)</title><p>7&#x02013;9 week old C57BL/6J male mice brains were freshly frozen in OCT compound and sectioned at 14 &#x003bc;M on Leica 3050 s cryostat, taking every other section throughout the hippocampus. Sections were then mounted on PEN membrane slides, ~12 sections per slide with 3 slides per brain. The staining and preparation of sections for the LCM procedure was done using the LCM staining kit (Cat# AM1935, Life Technologies) with Cresyl Violet following manufacturer's recommendations. Following staining, slides were kept at room temperature before beginning LCM. The microdissection of the CA1, CA3 and DG hippocampal regions were done using the Arcturus PixCell II LCM microscope where the laser power was set at 50 mW and each capture was done with 2 or fewer laser pulses. After dissection, each sample was placed in 50 &#x003bc;l ice-cold Trizol and RNA was extracted using the Trizol-Chloroform method (Life technologies). Purified RNA from each dissection was subjected to a single round of linear T7 RNA Polymerase&#x02013;driven transcription using MessageAmp&#x02122; II aRNA Amplification Kit (Cat# AM1751, Life Technologies).</p></sec><sec><title>Cytoplasmic and nuclear separation of lncRNAs from PFC and hippocampus</title><p>PFC and hippocampi of two adult mice were used to extract the total RNA. The tissues were dissected from the whole brain and briefly washed in 1X PBS and immediately transferred into a mortar containing liquid nitrogen to cover the sample and to thoroughly grind the tissues. After the grinding was complete, the liquid nitrogen was allowed to evaporate off without allowing the tissues to thaw. Cell lysis and extraction of cytoplasmic and Nuclear RNA were carried out using SurePrep, Nuclear or Cytoplasmic RNA Purification Kit (Cat. # BP2805-25, Fisher Bioreagents) according to the kit protocol (Jiang et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). cDNAs were generated from the purified RNA by reverse transcription using Quanta cDNA SuperMix as described earlier and the expression levels of each gene were determined by qPCR using SYBR Green PCR master mix as described earlier. CT values of each lncRNA were first normalized to GM11549, resulting in a deltaCT value. Relative differences between lncRNAs and GM11549 were determined by subtracting the delta CTs of cytoplasm fraction from the delta CTs of nucleus fraction for each sample, resulting in delta (deltaCT) values (Van Heesch et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). &#x003b2;-actin mRNA that is enriched cytoplasm was used as a control to validate the efficacy of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p>By performed RNA sequencing; MF, GS, and ACC performed the RNAseq data analyses; BMK, XL, VR, BR, and SVP designed the experiments.
