An intriguing family of regulatory RNAs includes transcripts from the opposite strand of protein coding genes, so called natural antisense transcripts (NATs). Here, we test the hypothesis that antisense transcription triggers RNA interference and gives rise to endogenous short RNAs (endo-siRNAs).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We used cloned human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) followed by short RNAseq to investigate the small genic RNA transcriptome. 378 genes gave rise to short RNA reads that mapped to exons of RefSeq genes. The length profile of short RNAs showed a broad peak of 20-24 nucleotides, indicative of endo-siRNAs. Collapsed reads mapped predominantly to the first and the last exon of genes (74%). RNAs reads were intersected with sequences occupied by RNAPII or bound to Argonaute (AGO1 by crosslinking, ligation, and sequencing of hybrids, CLASH). In the first exon, 94% of the reads correlated with RNAPII occupancy with an average density of 130 (relative units); this decreased to 65%/20 in middle exons and 54%/12 in the last exon. CLASH reads mapping to multi-exon genes showed little distribution bias with an average of about 5 CLASH reads overlapping with 60% of the endo-siRNA reads. However, endo-siRNAs (21-25 nt) intersecting with CLASH reads were enriched at the 5&#x02032;end and decreased towards the 3&#x02032;end.</p><p>We then investigated the 378 genes with particular focus on features indicative for short RNA production; however, found that endo-siRNA numbers did not correlate with gene structures that favor convergent transcription. In contrast, our gene set was found notably over-represented in the NATsDB sense/antisense group as compared to non-overlapping and non-bidirectional groups. Moreover, read counts showed no correlation with the steady-state levels of the related mRNAs and the pattern of endo-siRNAs proved reproducible after an induced mutagenic insult.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results suggest that antisense transcripts contribute to low levels of endo-siRNAs in fully differentiated human cells. A characteristic endo-siRNA footprint is being produced at sites of RNAPII transcription which is also related to AGO1. This endo-siRNA signature represents an intriguing finding and its reproducibility suggests that the production of endo-siRNAs is a regulated process with potential homoeostatic impact.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Endo-siRNA</kwd><kwd>Noncoding RNA</kwd><kwd>Antisense transcripts</kwd><kwd>RNAseq</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The full nature of the human transcriptome is taking shape thanks to highly efficient sequencing strategies that reach unprecedented depth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Layers of long and short RNAs with unknown biological functions keep emerging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A particularly intriguing family of non-protein coding RNAs are natural antisense transcripts (NATs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. NATs are commonly understood to be transcribed from the complementary DNA strand of protein coding genes. Processing of the primary antisense transcripts result in mRNAs that share complementary exons with the related sense transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Genomic loci that express NATs are highly abundant and sense/antisense transcript pairs tend to be co-expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The most comprehensive studies predict that in human and mice 40-72% of all transcriptional units show evidence of bi-directional transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. NATs are most prominently found in testis, they are also detectable at low levels in other tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Interestingly, the occurrence of NATs correlates with genes that show imbalanced allelic expression (random imprinting or random monoallelic expression) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This observation suggests that NATs carry the potential to induce allele-specific gene silencing. Accordingly, they are significantly under-represented on the mammalian X chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. SiRNAs can potentially trigger transcriptional gene silencing and, interestingly, endo-siRNAs originating from sense/antisense RNA pairs have been detected in several model systems; however, the nature of these endo-siRNAs has not been thoroughly investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The potential of NATs to form RNA-RNA hybrids with the sense transcript can trigger various mechanisms and regulatory cascades. The three best supported ones are RNA masking, the establishment of chromatin marks and RNA interference. RNA masking describes a process where the antisense transcript occludes a regulatory motif in the sense RNA by direct base pairing. Depending on the nature of these motifs the interactions stabilize or de-stabilize the mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Well-documented examples include the hypoxia induced factor 1&#x003b1; (HIF 1&#x003b1;) and &#x003b2;-secretase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Chromatin modification as a result of ectopic expression of NATs has been linked to human disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A rare form of &#x003b1; thalassemia is caused by a genomic deletion that brings a constitutively active gene (<italic>LUC7</italic>) into close vicinity to the <italic>HBA2</italic> gene. The resulting antisense transcript was shown to induce methylation of a GC island in the promoter of <italic>HBA2</italic> and silence the gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In addition, a tumor suppressor gene (<italic>p15</italic>) was shown to be epigenetically silenced by antisense transcription. <italic>P15</italic> is repressed in a variety of cancers and an inverse expression of sense and antisense transcripts was discovered in leukemic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The involvement of NAT-triggered RNA interference in gene regulation is supported by research focusing on the Slc34A gene (encoding a Na-phosphate cotransport protein). In this case, endo-siRNAs derived from sense/antisense overlaps were found in mouse testis and kidneys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Moreover, large scale sequencing approaches also found endo-siRNAs originating from bi-directionally transcribed loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>RNA interference involves two key enzymatic components, an endo-ribonuclease and an effector protein complex. The endonucleases, Dicer or Drosha, process double-stranded RNA precursors into short RNA duplexes of about 22 base pairs. These oligonucleotides are integrated into effector complexes that include an Argonaute protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. One of the RNA strands is unwound and becomes quickly degraded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The remaining single stranded RNA molecule, the guide strand, directs the RNA-protein complex to its biological target. RNA interference was initially thought to be a predominantly cytoplasmic process; however, recent studies have detected Dicer and Argonaute proteins in the nucleus associated with chromatin. Moreover, Argonaute-dependent processes have been documented to alter chromatin marks and also the dynamics of RNA polymerase II was shown to be affected by Argonaute and Dicer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>A putative link between antisense transcription and the synthesis of endo-siRNAs has not been comprehensively investigated. We used total RNA from cloned of HEK293 cells to determine the short RNA transcriptome. The analysis focused on reads that mapped to exons of protein-coding genes. Our findings suggest that sense/antisense transcripts can feed into an RNA interference related pathway. The resulting low levels of endo-siRNAs contribute to a stable short RNA signature in differentiated somatic cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Analysis of endo-siRNAs</title><p>To avoid cell heterogeneity due to the accumulation of stochastic mutations we first cloned HEK-293 cells by serial dilution. A single clone was selected and expanded for short RNA sequencing. Total RNA was isolated, size selected and then used to generate a directional cDNA library. The material was amplified and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000. A total of 30.9 million parsed reads were obtained and annotated to the human genome (hg18). The most prevalent of the genic short RNAs were microRNAs (31%) and short structural RNAs (9%). Genic short RNAs comprised 5% of the reads of which 1% (282319) were between 16 and 30 bases long (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). In total, 378 genes gave rise to genic short RNAs (1.9% of all protein coding genes [Gencode version 18], Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S1). The genes are localized on all but the Y chromosome which is not present in HEK293 cells. Chromosomes 5 and 11 contain a proportionally high number of genes with short RNAs (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure S1). Because of the relatively small size of the remaining data set the analysis was performed using the UCSC table browser and spread sheet functions. Size distribution of the short RNAs shows a broad peak between 20 and 24 nucleotides which concurs with the size of endo-siRNAs (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B) or 21-26 nucleotides if collapsed (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B, inset). The majority of endo-siRNAs reads were found to be in sense orientation with respect to the parent gene (69.4%), 30.6% were antisense (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C). Similar observations have been reported, indicating that preferentially the sense transcript gives rise to short RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Moreover, only 6.3% (24 of 378 genes) displayed significant read counts (&#x0003e;5) in both sense and antisense orientation. Of note, manual scrutiny of the 378 genes revealed that 3 genes, TMEM25, LPPR5 and LYPD3, contributed disproportionally to the dataset with almost 63% of the reads. These 3 genes have exonic hairpin structures that feed into micro RNA processing (hsa-miR151A, LPPR5 and LYPD) or are possibly related to piRNAs (TMEM25) and are therefore excluded from the quantitative analysis of expanded endo-siRNA reads.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Genic endo-siRNA in HEK293 cells.

To assess the involvement of RNAPII we downloaded the publicly available RNAPII ChIP-Seq data (chromatin imunoprecipitation-sequencing) from the GEO database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM891237">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM891237</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Collapsed reads were manually binned into 4 categories, first 5&#x02032; exon (25.3%), middle exons (22.5%), last 3&#x02032; exon (37.8%) and single exon genes (10.6%) using IGV (Integrated Genomics Viewer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]) followed by intersection with RNAPII occupancy using the UCSC table browser. As expected, both co-localization (94.3% of the reads covered sequences with RNAPII occupancy) as well as signal strength (129.6 average integrated units) was highest for reads mapping to the first 5&#x02032;exon. These values decreased to 65%/20.4 integrated units in internal exons and 54.4%/12.1 units in the final exons. Single exon genes showed average occupancy and intensity (65.7%/54.2) (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, upper panel). Next, the reads mapping to RNAPII occupancy were quantified with respect to their length; profiles were established for all reads intersecting with RNAPII occupancy (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B, low stringency) as well as for reads that map to highly RNAPII occupied regions (excluding the lowest percentile, &#x0003c;0.72 units) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C, high stringency). Short RNAs of 21-25 nt were found to predominantly map with RNAPII occupied sites in addition to lesser populated length bins (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B, left panel). Interestingly, increased stringency predominantly depleted RNAs of 20-22 nucleotides and of 26-30 nucleotides from the data set (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C right panel). The peak of 21-25 nt was notably sharper (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C, left panel) indicating a possible weak association between components of the RNAi machinery and RNAPII

The parameters collected of the 378 genes included orientation, length and exon-number, distance to neighboring genes and their orientation as well as the number and orientation of reads. The finding, that 30.6% of the genic reads were oriented in antisense to the transcript of origin may suggest a role for antisense transcription in generating endo-siRNAs.</p><p>We sorted the 176 genes with a near neighbor in tail-to-tail configuration according to the distance between the two genes to assess if the potential antisense transcript promotes the formation of endo-siRNAs. As Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> demonstrates, there is no link between distance and configuration of neighboring genes (head to head, tail to head and tail to tail) and the number of endo-siRNA reads. The low R<sup>2</sup> values suggest that there is no direct correlation between the convergent transcription of closely located genes and endo-siRNAs. Other parameters such as the length of the endo-siRNA producing genes and their exon count had no influence on the number of endo-siRNA reads (not shown).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Scatter plot of endo-siRNA read count versus distance to the neighboring gene.</bold> Left panel, genes arranged head to head (divergent transcription); middle, genes in tail to head orientation; right panel, genes in tail to tail arrangement (convergent transcription).

Either such gene pairs were separated by substantial gaps (&#x0003e; 35&#x000a0;kb) or they were located at chromosome ends in clusters with relaxed imprinting. This finding concurs with the documented reduced expression of antisense transcripts from the X chromosome and suggests that in a biologically relevant cellular context convergent transcription may be linked to epigenetic gene silencing.</p><p>We also assessed the expression levels of endo-siRNA related genes using the natural antisense database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/datasets/2012-NAT/">http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/datasets/2012-NAT/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].

We wanted to investigate whether this endo-siRNA signature may be characteristic for a specific cell stage or whether it is an unstable, transient feature. To address this question we subjected the original HEK293 clone to random mutagenesis by ethyl methyl sulfonate (EMS) and immediately re-cloned the cells. Two individual mutagenized clones were selected and used for RNAseq (denoted C5 and C12). A total of 44.3 and 47.1 million parsed reads was obtained from C5 and C12, respectively; the data from the mother clone was included into the further analysis as a control. The reads were annotated to the human genome (hg18) and again categorized into &#x0201c;non genic&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;genic&#x0201d;, the latter group including miRNAs, structural RNAs (largely snoRNAs) and exonic reads. In general, both mutagenized clones followed very similar trends regarding up &#x02013;or down- regulation of specific RNAs &#x02013;in agreement with single allele point mutations induced by EMS. An overview of the results for all three clones (control, C5 and C12) is given in Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>. The impact of EMS mutagenesis on a genome wide level was established by assessing the variance of read numbers mapping to the individual genes. The pooled variance was taken as readout for the systemic consequences of the mutagenic insult. RNAs involved in a tightly controlled network were expected show a small variance (miRNAs) whereas a highly redundant system would tolerate a large variance (snoRNAs, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Summary of the RNAseq results</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></th><th colspan="2" align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Wild type</bold><hr/></th><th colspan="2" align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Clone 5</bold><hr/></th><th colspan="2" align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Clone 12</bold><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="left">&#x000a0;</th><th align="left">&#x000a0;</th><th align="left"><bold>% of total</bold></th><th align="left">&#x000a0;</th><th align="left"><bold>% of total</bold></th><th align="left">&#x000a0;</th><th align="left"><bold>% of total</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Total reads<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">30903553<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">44325908<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">47144485<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Total genic reads<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">14112356<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">45.67<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">26539818<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">59.87<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">35543718<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">75.39<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>miRNA</bold><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>9549312</bold><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">30.90<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>21615459</bold><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">48.76<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>29684876</bold><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">62.97<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Small structural RNAs</bold><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>2646057</bold><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">8.56<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>2252302</bold><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">5.08<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>1984388</bold><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">4.21<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Exonic reads<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1916987<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">6.20<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2672057<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">6.03<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3874454<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">8.22<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Exonic reads 16-30 bases</bold><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>282319</bold><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.91<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>586555</bold><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1.32<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>627123</bold><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1.33<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Others</td><td align="left">16791197</td><td align="left">54.33</td><td align="left">17786090</td><td align="left">40.13</td><td align="left">11600767</td><td align="left">24.61</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The categories in bold are further investigated in this project.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The most prevalent of the genic short RNAs in both control and mutagenized samples were microRNAs, which is in agreement with published short RNAseq data.

Experimental evidence suggests that convergent sense-antisense transcription contributes to the synthesis of these endo-siRNAs. The endo-siRNA signature is largely unaffected by mutagenic perturbation and does not reflect the level of the parent mRNAs. Because only about 2% of all expressed genes in HEK cells contribute to the RNA signature these endo-siRNAs are therefore unlikely to be a direct byproduct of transcription. Our observations suggest endo-siRNAs to have a biological role and add significance to recent RNA sequencing projects which report increasingly complex layers of low abundance short RNAs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We present a comprehensive characterization of genic short RNAs in the human kidney cell line HEK293. We found that only a limited number of genes give rise to short RNAs, predominantly endo-siRNAs that are associated with AGO1 and correlate with RNAPII occupancy at 5&#x02032;ends of genes. This RNA signature does not scale with the transcription of the related gene and expression level of the mRNA. Moreover, the short RNA pattern is resistant to mutagenic insults indicating that the endo-siRNAs are the result of a controlled synthesis &#x02013;or the byproduct of a controlled process.</p><p>Three possibilities how these endo-siRNAs are being produced are plausible and not mutually exclusive. First, RNAPII produces a variety of RNA by-products, related to pausing of the enzyme during initiation and termination of transcription or as a consequence of incomplete splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The most prominent of the short RNA species are denoted &#x0201c;promoter-associated small RNAs&#x0201d; (PASRs) and &#x0201c;transcription initiation RNAs (tiRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Their occurrence is linked to highly active promoters and does not appear to involve RNA interference since they are either capped (PASRs) or do not co-precipitate with Argonaute (tiRNAs). tiRNAs are hypothesized to be generated by the backtracking RNA polymerase and the action of an intrinsic endonuclease activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The fact that the short RNAs identified in this screen show a very restricted expression pattern and do not scale with RNAPII occupancy genome-wide suggests that the RNA signature is not an obligatory by-product of transcription.</p><p>Second, the reads could represent degradation products from cellular mRNAs and reflect physiological mRNA turnover. Several observations, however, argue against this hypothesis. Only about 1-2% of genes produce short RNAs whereas roughly 40-50% of mRNAs generate positive calls in expression analysis. Moreover, careful expression analysis of 10 gene clusters, genes producing short RNAs and its neighbors (discussed below), showed no correlation between mRNA levels and short RNA reads. On the other hand, we identified genes where a very low number of randomly distributed reads could well be explained by RNA breakdown or sequencing errors, these were not studied in further detail. The reproducibility of the endo-siRNA signature after mutagenesis, however, suggests that such random errors do not contribute significantly to the sequencing output.</p><p>Third, the short RNAs identified in this screen could be synthesized by components of the RNAi machinery. Nuclear localization of key components such as Dicer, Drosha and Argonaute proteins and shuttling of related RNA protein complexes between the cytoplasm and the nucleus has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Our results from the AGO1 CLASH experiments and also the length profile of the short RNAs suggest that the RNAseq reads are significantly constituted of endo-siRNAs. At what stage a double stranded RNA precursor is formed and dicing occurs, is yet unknown.</p><p>One particular focus of the presented work was to investigate a potential link between convergent transcription, i.e. the co-expression of sense and antisense transcripts, and the formation of endo-siRNAs. Genic endo-siRNAs have been documented in several systems, predominantly in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and also in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. However, in mammalian systems, the link between convergent transcription and RNA interference is controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Our results confirm the existence of endo-siRNAs in human cells and the fact that 53% of these derive from SA loci provides circumstantial evidence that sense/antisense transcription may be involved. Our observation, that genes on the X chromosome tend to avoid the possibility of convergent transcription, indicates that situations of convergent transcription may indeed exist in somatic, diploid cells.</p><p>There is a substantial body of evidence that siRNAs can promote both transcriptional silencing and activation through chromatin modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The siRNAs used in those experiments were synthesized <italic>in vitro</italic> and applied at high concentrations indicating that the process was inefficient. Our findings also suggests that the cell culture model used may not express balanced levels of all the components essential for the processing of NATs into endo-siRNAs and transcriptional silencing. For example, Hela cells transfected with vectors expressing both thymidylate synthase (TS) sense and antisense transcripts failed to generate TS related siRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. On the other hand, highly expressed convergent transcripts from a single plasmid were recently demonstrated to produce siRNAs which induced transcriptional gene silencing in <italic>trans</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Our findings support the conclusion that the production of endo-siRNAs from NATs is inefficient in HEK293 cells and probably in other cell culture models as well. Indeed, the genome wide studies suggest that NATs-linked endo-siRNA processing is a highly cell-specific process, for example in developing sperm cells where antisense transcripts and endo-siRNAs are prominently found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In HEK293 cells convergent transcription may trigger the production of endo-siRNAs; however, the process appears to be rather inefficient and only relevant in specialized cell types.

Secondly, read numbers of endo-sRNAs do not reflect steady-state mRNA levels of their parent genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Cell culture, cloning and mutagenesis: The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 was maintained and passaged according to established cell culture conditions. Cloning was performed in a 96 well cell culture dish by serial dilution starting with 60-120,000 cells. Cells were grown until single colonies could be identified. Individual clones were transferred to 24 well plates and grown to confluency. At this stage a single clone was chosen and passaged into two wells of a 6 well plate. When the cells were about 80% confluent, the medium in one well was replaced and 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS; Sigma) was added. Cells were grown in the presence of EMS for 24&#x000a0;hours followed by a 24&#x000a0;hour recovery period in fresh medium. At that point the mutagenized cells were re-cloned by serial dilution. Thereafter, single mutagenized clones were expanded and two clones, C5 and C12 were randomly selected for further experiments. The non-mutagenized original clone was propagated to yield enough cells for RNA extraction and long term storage.</p><p>Nucleic acid isolation: RNA and DNA were isolated using Trizol according to standard methodology.</p><p>Short RNAseq: Short RNA purification was performed by GATC Biotech in Konstanz, Germany.

Tagged 3&#x02032; adaptors and 5&#x02032; adaptors were ligated to the recovered RNA to ensure strand specificity. The material was used for cDNA synthesis. The three samples were pooled and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000. The sequencing data has been submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive, accession number GSE52996.</p><p>Data analysis: The reads were processed using the fastx toolkit to remove low quality reads and trim low quality bases. The parsed reads were mapped to the hg18 build of the human genome using Bowtie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Samtools was then used to remove unaligned reads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Refseq exons and micro RNA tracks were downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser server and intersectBed from bedtools was applied to compare the reference data with the experimental data sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Overlaps were sorted into miRNAs, short structural RNAs and genic RNAs. Reads of more than 30 bases or less than 16 bases were removed from the genic RNA data set. Further analysis was done with standard spread sheet programs using specific statistical functions to collapse reads, sort reads according to their length and generate the graphs.</p><p>Reverse transcription- quantitative PCR: RNA from the original extraction, stored at -80&#x000b0;C, was used for expression analysis by RT-qPCR. Reverse transcription of approximately 0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of total RNA was performed using the Omniscript kit from Qiagen following the supplier&#x02019;s instructions.
