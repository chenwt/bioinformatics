The infection process involves a short primary infection of root hairs by zoospores, followed by a secondary phase where plasmodia develop intracellularly in the root cortex for several weeks. During this secondary phase, <italic>P. brassicae</italic> induces hypertrophia and hyperplasia of infected plant cortical cells, leading to the development of galls and to the wilting of the infected plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Functional genomics approaches have established an increasingly detailed picture of plant signaling and metabolic pathways involved in positive or negative control of clubroot gall development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Untargeted transcriptomic analyses also highlighted additional mechanisms of regulation, but the biological significance of many of these remains uncertain. In this context, Jubault et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and Schuller et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] pinpointed the induction of ethanol fermentation during secondary infection by <italic>P. brassicae</italic>, and both studies suggested that ethanol fermentation may allow root cells to cope with an oxygen deficit induced by tumor development or by the increased energetic demand in infected cells.</p><p>Ethanol fermentation, i.e., conversion of pyruvate into ethanol by the action of pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), is the classical hallmark of root responses to flooding. Under limited oxygen conditions, fermentation allows plant cells to avoid toxic accumulation of pyruvate that would result from the decrease in mitochondrial respiratory activity. This process allows cells to sustain glycolytic fluxes and to meet minimal energetic and metabolic needs to cope with moderate hypoxia constraints. In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, <italic>ADH1</italic>, <italic>PDC1</italic> and <italic>PDC2</italic> have been reported to be important players in flooding-triggered fermentation responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Hypoxia is sensed in plants through the N-end rule pathway of ubiquitin-mediated targeted proteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The five Group VII Ethylene Response Factor transcription factors (RELATED TO APETALA [RAP]2.12, RAP2.2, RAP2.3, HYPOXIA RESPONSIVE ERF [HRE]1 and HRE2) are the only known plant substrates of this pathway, and their oxygen-dependent degradation controls the hypoxia-associated expression of fermentation genes. Oxidation of amino-terminal Cysteine (<sup>OX</sup>Cys) of ERFVII proteins in vivo by oxygen (and nitric oxide) leads to amino-terminal arginylation of <sup>OX</sup>Cys by ARGINYL TRANSFERASES (ATEs) that allows recognition by an E3 ligase of the N-end rule pathway PROTEOLYSIS (PRT)6 and subsequent ubiquitination and degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>The objectives of the present study were to: 1) specifically document the temporal regulation of ethanol fermentation and other hypoxia-responses during pathogen-induced gall development, and 2) assess the extent to which fermentation, hypoxia-sensing and responses may contribute to the enhancement or reduction of tumorigenic processes. The induction of fermentation during clubroot development was assessed by a combination of RT-qPCR analysis, GUS staining and respiration measurements. The development of clubroot symptoms was evaluated in mutant lines defective for ethanol fermentation, and in mutants of the N-end rule pathway exhibiting constitutive induction (in mutants of the E3 ligase; <italic>prt6</italic> or Arginyl transferase <italic>ate1 ate2</italic>) or constitutive absence of hypoxia responses (<italic>erfVII</italic> and <italic>prt6 erfVII</italic>).

The results presented in the Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> indicate that global respiration in roots was not significantly reduced by infection, suggesting that oxygen diffusion in infected roots was not a major limiting factor at this stage.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Effect of clubroot infection on the respiration activity in root tissues at 7 dpi.

A focused analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) indicated that a large proportion of N-end rule regulated genes were induced in roots by clubroot infection (17 of 23 genes at 16 dpi, and 14 of 23 genes at 26 dpi). A similar pattern was found in analysed data from clubroot infected hypocotyls (data not shown). Hypoxia responses were also analysed in the transcriptomic responses of hosts to two other gall-forming diseases. A hypoxia transcriptomic fingerprint can be found in the data from root galls induced by root-knot nematodes, at 3 dpi (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, data from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]), with 17 of 23 genes upregulated. In addition, the plant cell response at a late (35 dpi) time-point of <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] was associated with the upregulation of 19 of 23 hypoxia gene markers.

The dataset of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] describes an earlier response to <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> at 6 dpi, but even at that early time-point 5 hypoxia responsive genes were significantly induced, including <italic>PDC1</italic>. Altogether, these data suggest that Arg/N-end rule driven hypoxia responses might be a general feature of gall development caused by plant pathogens.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Transcriptional regulation of a set of 23 hypoxia and N-end rule-regulated genes, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants infected with gall-inducing pathogens.

<italic>ADH1</italic> and <italic>PDC1</italic> are commonly used as marker genes for the study of hypoxia responses in plants. The induction of these genes is the emerged face of a (small) iceberg of co-regulated genes that are collectively controlled by the Arg/N-end rule pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The data presented in the present work converge to the idea that <italic>P. brassicae</italic> infection significantly induces <italic>ADH1</italic>, <italic>PDC1</italic> and <italic>PDC2</italic> during the secondary infection of roots, and that this response should be viewed as a component of a global stereotypical hypoxia response. Two major factors may induce genuine hypoxia in clubroot infected root tissues: First, the oxygen diffusion rate may be significantly reduced in tumorigenic tissues (previously proposed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]). Second, keeping in mind the observation that <italic>P. brassicae</italic> plasmodia develop intracellularly inside root cortical cells, the plant hypoxia response may result from an intracellular competition for oxygen between the respective mitochondria of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Plasmodiophora</italic>. Both hypotheses would be consistent with the localisation of <italic>ADH1::GUS</italic> staining in the core infected cells of the root galls (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In our data however, hypoxia-response gene induction was found as soon as 7 dpi, i.e. a time point at the very beginning of root cortical infection where galls are not yet visible. Then, for the earliest time point of the secondary infection, hypoxia responses may result from subtle or localized drops of oxygen availability. Alternatively, one can also not exclude that this response may be triggered by the modulation of other plant-derived factors such as nitric oxide, that also affects Arg/N-end rule degradation of ERFVIIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. If plant hypoxia responses are of benefit to pathogen development, it should be also worthy to envisage that the Arg/N-end rule pathway could be influenced by biochemical effectors of the pathogen, as previous work has shown that this pathway is regulated by small molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Additional work would be needed for a clarification of these different possibilities.</p><p>Our principal objective in this study was to identify the biological consequences of the induction of fermentative metabolism during clubroot infection. We therefore used appropriate mutant lines to clarify who from the host plant and/or the pathogen would be the payee of ethanol fermentation. The Arabidopsis genome harbours four different PDC encoding genes, but to date only <italic>PDC1</italic> and <italic>PDC2</italic> have been reported to play significant role in hypoxia and flooding responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In the present work, the phenotypes of <italic>pdc1</italic> and <italic>pdc2</italic> mutants indicate that both genes positively contribute to the development of clubroot symptoms. This clearly eliminates the conceivable hypothesis that ethanol biosynthesis by plant cells could act as an antibiotic for inhibiting <italic>P. brassicae</italic> development. Rather, the phenotypes of <italic>pdc</italic> and Arg/N-end rule pathway mutants support a model where hypoxia response benefits disease development and pathogen spore production. This response may be originally a response of the plant to cope with the reduced oxygen availability caused by the infection. As a &#x02018;secondary effect&#x02019;, the metabolic adaptation to hypoxia may benefit the pathogen, just because any biotrophic pathogen benefits from a host plant that can maintain its metabolic functions as much as possible during the infection process. As discussed above, this conclusion requires confirmation that cell oxygen content actually drops during the development of clubs.</p><p>We previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] that clubroot disease development reaches higher rates in Col-0 when infected plants are cultivated in well-aerated soil substrate. Waterlogging led to the inhibition and restriction of gall development on plant collars, i.e. above the level of water-saturated soil. Thus, from the present study, conducted in well-aerated substrate, it may be inferred that clubroot development is paradoxically at its maximum when hypoxia response is induced in well-aerated infected roots.</p><p>ADH activity is a major step of ethanol fermentation because this step allows the regeneration of NAD<sup>+</sup>, thereafter supporting intensive glycolysis flux, and the resulting production of ATP, when respiration is impaired. <italic>ADH1</italic>, being the only ADH encoding gene in Arabidopsis, is actually a key gene to support this mechanism in cells under anoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The absence of difference for clubroot symptoms between the <italic>adh1-4</italic> mutant and the wild type was surprising and suggests that, beyond transcriptional regulation, clubroot infection may not activate a genuine anaerobic ethanol fermentation response: 1/ regeneration of NAD<sup>+</sup> might not be a major stake in root cells infected by <italic>P. brassicae</italic> 2/ PDC-derived acetaldehyde undergoes non-ethanolic fates. Such metabolic features are reminiscent of the &#x02018;PDH bypass&#x02019; model, a metabolic pathway also reported as &#x02018;aerobic fermentation&#x02019;, where acetaldehyde produced by the decarboxylation of pyruvate, is converted to acetyl-CoA, thus furnishing the biosynthesis of fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The PDH bypass has been experimentally documented in aerobic plant tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and has been proposed to play a role in the rapid development of actively respiring sporophytic tissues during pollen germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In the context of clubroot infection, this mechanism would fit with above-described unexpected data: 1/ the fermentation response is triggered at a time point where respiration is apparently unaffected in infected roots 2/ clubroot symptoms are similar in the <italic>adh1-4</italic> mutant and in the wild type. This model would also make sense with the recently reported auxotrophy of <italic>P. brassicae</italic> for fatty acids, suggested by the absence of fatty acid synthase in its genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Thus, for an efficient clubroot infection, the pathogen may require the activation of metabolic plant features, possibly including a PDH-bypass, which would allow massive synthesis of acetyl-CoA for the synthesis of fatty acids. A careful investigation on carbon fluxes in a series of appropriate mutants would be necessary to test this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Ethanol fermentation in plant cells has been mostly studied for its role in flooding and hypoxia/anoxia responses. The present work shows that pyruvate decarboxylase genes <italic>PDC1</italic> and <italic>PDC2</italic> support the development of clubroot, and increase the fitness of pathogen through enhancing spore production. The induction of ethanol fermentation genes is part of a prototypical Arg/N-end rule driven hypoxia response, controlled by ERFVII transcription factors, which may play a role in the infection of many gall-forming pathosystems. Further work is needed to assess if hypoxia actually drives the response during the earliest steps of the clubroot infection, and to test the possible role of PDH bypass in regulating clubroot development.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Plant material</title><p>All mutant lines were in the Arabidopsis genetic background Columbia.
