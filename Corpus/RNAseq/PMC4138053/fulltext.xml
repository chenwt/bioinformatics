Responses of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients to cytarabine-based therapies are often short-lived with a median overall survival of months<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Therapies are under development to improve outcomes including targeting the eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF4E) with its inhibitor ribavirin<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. In a phase II clinical trial in poor prognosis AML,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> ribavirin monotherapy yielded promising responses including remissions; however all patients relapsed (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 1</xref>). Here we identify a novel form of drug resistance to ribavirin and cytarabine (Ara-C). We observe that the sonic hedgehog transcription factor Glioma associated protein 1 (Gli1) and the UDP-glucuronsyl transferase (UGT1A) family of enzymes are elevated in resistant cells. UGT1As add glucuronic acid to many drugs, modifying their activity in diverse tissues<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Gli1 alone is sufficient to drive UGT1A dependent glucuronidation of ribavirin and Ara-C, and thus drug resistance. Resistance is overcome by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Gli1 revealing a potential strategy to overcome drug resistance in some patients.</p><p id="P2">To better understand the molecular basis for relapse in our clinical trial, we generated resistant cells using head and neck carcinoma FaDu and M5 AML THP-1 cells, both of which have highly elevated eIF4E and concomitant ribavirin sensitivity<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Two forms of drug resistance emerged, characterized by unimpaired growth in clinically achievable ribavirin concentrations and a loss of eIF4E targeting (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B&#x00026;C</xref>; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 2A&#x02013;C</xref>). Type I resistant cells (FRI, THPA, THPB) had severely impaired drug uptake, whereas Type II resistant cells (FRII) did not (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D</xref>; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data 2D</xref>). Type I resistance was characterized by substantial reduction of adenosine kinase (ADK) (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 7A&#x02013;C</xref>). ADK acts in cellular retention of ribavirin since unphosphorylated ribavirin is readily exported by the nucleoside transporter ENT1<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Indeed, ADK reduction alone imparts ribavirin resistance (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 3C&#x02013;D</xref>). Analysis of our patient pool indicated that only two patients had features consistent with type I resistance (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 3E&#x02013;F</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Therefore, we investigated type II resistance. Given that eIF4E was not mutated and was functional in FRII cells (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 2E&#x02013;G</xref>), we examined whether the ribavirin-eIF4E interaction was disrupted, by assessing the ability of eIF4E to immunoprecipitate <sup>3</sup>H-ribavirin (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). While <sup>3</sup>H<bold>-</bold>ribavirin is enriched ~6 fold in the eIF4E immunoprecipitated fraction in parental cells, this interaction is lost in FRII cells, despite normal uptake and functional eIF4E.</p><p id="P4">RNASeq analysis revealed that 30 transcripts were differentially expressed in FRII cells, including Gli1 mRNA, by 21 fold (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 1</xref>). Consistently, Gli1 protein levels were highly elevated, as was Gli1&#x02019;s target SNAIL (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). We investigated the clinical relevance of this elevation in our patients treated with ribavirin monotherapy. At relapse, leukemic blasts had elevated Gli1 mRNA levels for 9/9 patients examined (up to 10 fold baseline) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). For example, Gli1 mRNA and protein levels were elevated at relapse (e.g. patients 8 (complete remission (CR)), 11 (partial remission (PR)) and 17 (blast response (BR); <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 4</xref>; confocal microscopy was used due to limited material at response). Interestingly, Gli1 levels in patient 17 decreased during response and re-emerged at relapse. Patients 9, 13 and 19, who did not respond clinically or molecularly, had highly elevated Gli1 levels before treatment, relative to healthy individuals or responding patients. Moreover in our ribavirin and low-dose Ara-C phase I combination trial, patients A (CR, relapsed at 2 years) and B (CR, relapsed at 9 months) had increased Gli1 levels at relapse (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). For patient C (PR, off treatment due to a dose limiting toxicity), Gli1 mRNA levels were unchanged at EOT, consistent with continued remission at that time. Thus, elevated Gli1 is associated with primary and acquired resistance in both ribavirin clinical trials. We observed that Types I and II resistance co-existed in two patients (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 3</xref>). Whether this occurs in the same cells or if multiple resistant populations emerge is unknown.</p><p id="P5">We extended these studies to investigate whether Gli1 levels were elevated in patients who failed more commonly used Ara-C therapies (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Gli1 mRNA levels were substantially elevated at relapse relative to diagnosis in 7/9 patients examined. Consistently, analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas AML dataset<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> showed that Gli1 elevation was associated with poor prognosis (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 5</xref>). These data suggest that Gli1 overexpression contributed to drug resistance and clinical relapse in some AML patients.</p><p id="P6">Next, we investigated whether Gli1 alone imparted drug resistance by generating FaDu and THP1 cells stably overexpressing Gli1 (FaDu-Gli; THP1-Gli; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C&#x00026;D</xref>). Growth of Gli1-overexpressing cells was not substantially affected by levels of ribavirin or Ara-C that impaired growth of controls. Further, Gli1 knockdown re-sensitized FRII cells to ribavirin and Ara-C without affecting growth in the absence of either drug (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p id="P7">In order to identify strategies to restore drug sensitivity, we used a clinically approved inhibitor of sonic hedgehog signaling upstream of Gli1, GDC-0449<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). FRII cells were pretreated with 200nM GDC-0449 (which is clinically achievable<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>) and subsequently, 20&#x003bc;M ribavirin. Strikingly, GDC-0449 treatment followed by ribavirin led to ~ 60% reduction in growth relative to untreated FRII cells. GDC-0449 treatment alone did not substantially affect growth in either cell line. Importantly, GDC-0449 treatment also restored sensitivity to clinically relevant Ara-C levels (200nM). Furthermore, GDC-0449 treatment of FaDu-Gli and THP-Gli cells re-sensitized these to ribavirin and Ara-C (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). Finally, a direct inhibitor of Gli1, GANT-61<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> paralleled the effects of GDC-0449 (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 6A</xref>). Thus, type II resistance is reversed by pharmacological inhibition of the sonic hedgehog pathway.</p><p id="P8">To better understand the molecular basis for resistance, we monitored the ability of eIF4E to immunoprecipitate <sup>3</sup>H-ribavirin as a function of Gli1 status (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B&#x02013;D</xref>; <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data 6B&#x02013;D</xref>). While eIF4E-ribavirin complexes were readily detected in controls, they were absent in Gli1-overexpressing cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Conversely, GDC-0449 treatment or Gli1 knockdown in FRII cells restored ribavirin-eIF4E complexes to control levels (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, there is a clear correlation between Gli1 elevation, reduction in eIF4E-ribavirin complexes, and resistance.</p><p id="P9">Given that resistant cells did not form ribavirin-eIF4E complexes but retained active eIF4E (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1E</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B&#x02013;D</xref>, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data 2E&#x02013;G</xref>), we hypothesized that ribavirin, and possibly Ara-C, underwent some form of Gli1 dependent modification. The drug metabolizing UGT1A enzymes had elevated protein levels in FRII cells. thereby suggesting a resistance mechanism (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1F</xref> &#x00026; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4A&#x02013;C</xref>). This was also the case for FaDu-Gli and THP-Gli cells, relative to vector controls (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D</xref>; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). Significantly, Gli1 knockdown or GDC-0449 treatment reduced UGT1A protein levels (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A&#x02013;C</xref>), confirming the correlation between Gli1 and UGT1A protein expression. Note that Gli1 does not increase mRNA levels but rather the protein stability of UGT1As (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 6E&#x02013;H</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To determine the clinical relevance of these observations, we examined UGT1A protein levels during response and relapse using confocal microscopy (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 4</xref>). We observed UGT1A elevation upon relapse i.e. patients 11 (CR), 8 (PR) and 17 (BR) in the ribavirin monotherapy trial and in patients A (CR) and B (CR) in the combination trial. Patient C (PR) had no change in UGT1A levels at EOT, consistent with still being in remission. In patients treated with standard Ara-C therapies, UGT1A protein levels were elevated in 6/7 specimens at relapse relative to diagnosis. and this occurred in the patients with concomitant elevated Gli1. There was insufficient material for protein analysis of the remaining two specimens (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Next, we used mass spectrometry (MS) to determine if ribavirin and Ara-C were glucuronidated in resistant cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D&#x02013;I</xref>; <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 7</xref>). Metabolites were isolated, subjected to hydrophilic chromatography and detected by ESI-MS. In parental cells, ribavirin diphosphate (RDP) is the major peak (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E&#x00026;L</xref>). In FRII cells, a new peak emerged with a mass consistent with the ribavirin-glucuronide (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Using collision induced ion fragmentation, we observed the triazole moiety of ribavirin as a major fragment supporting this as a site of glucuronidation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4L</xref>, red arrow; <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data 7A</xref>). Relative peak intensities suggest that there is more ribavirin-glucuronide than RDP (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Strikingly, GDC-0449 treatments eliminated ribavirin glucuronidation in FRII cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Gli1 overexpression in parental cells led to formation of ribavirin-glucuronides (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> glucuronidation studies indicated that specific UGT1As are likely important to this process as is ribavirin phosphorylation (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 7</xref>). Moreover, we observe AraC-glucuronides in FRII but not parental cells, and this modification was lost upon GDC-0449 treatment (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 7</xref>). Thus, Ara-C and ribavirin glucuronidation were Gli1-dependent, and elimination of the glucuronides by Gli1 inhibition correlated with restored drug sensitivity.</p><p id="P12">We examined the capacity of ribavirin-glucuronides to bind eIF4E. Ribavirin-glucuronide was isolated by hydrophilic chromatography and confirmed by MS/MS (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 7C</xref>). Using eIF4E-GST immobilized on glutathione agarose, we observed that non-radioactive ribavirin or RTP compete for <sup>3</sup>H ribavirin-eIF4E complexes, whereas neither the negative control GTP nor the ribavirin-glucuronide did so (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4M</xref>). Thus, ribavirin glucuronidation impairs its interaction with eIF4E, underpinning resistance.</p><p id="P13">To further explore the effects of Gli1 inhibition on drug sensitivity, we monitored colony growth of primary AML specimens as a function of GDC-0449 treatment (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Specimens were selected from patients that had previously failed induction chemotherapy. We observed that while GDC-0449 has little effect on colony growth alone, it strongly potentiated the effects of Ara-C and ribavirin, presumably by elimination of the respective glucuronides. By contrast, we observe little effect in specimens from healthy volunteers, consistent with our results in control cells.</p><p id="P14">Several factors likely contribute to Gli1 elevation in FRII cells, including reduced Patched1 levels but not altered promoter methylation or modified hedgehog ligand levels (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 8</xref>). Glucuronidation is typically perceived as a detoxification pathway but does not always enhance drug excretion<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Similar to our findings with ribavirin and eIF4E, testosterone glucuronidation modifies its targets rather than its efflux.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Our findings reveal a role for Gli1 in drug metabolism and resistance.

We note that RTP was clearly glucuronidated in these microsomes whereas ribavirin was not suggesting that ribavirin needs to be phosphorylated in order to be efficiently or stably glucuronidated. However, this step would be prior to glucuronidation as we never observed RTP-glucuronide or other phosphorylated form of the ribavirin-glucuronide. Furthermore, we did not observe glucuronidation of RTP in supersomes that express only UGT1A1 suggesting that other UGT1As must be present. Finally, although we observed glucuronidation of Ara-C efficiently in FRII and FaDu-Gli cells, we did not observe it in the microsomes, suggesting that some other UGT1A (than UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6 and UGT1A9) need to be present for efficient glucuronidation.

Error bars represent median &#x000b1; IQR (Inter-Quartile Range) of each group. Nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used to analyze the differences between groups. A total of 176 <italic>de novo</italic> AML patients with complete mRNA-seq and cytogenetic risk classification data are included in this analysis. (B, C) Kaplan-Meier plots of events-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of 168 <italic>de novo</italic> AML patients segregated by median <italic>Gli1</italic> expression (RPKM=0.8596) (B) or high <italic>Gli1</italic> expression (RPKM greater than or equal to 2) (C). Each tick on the survival curve represents a censored event because the patient is still alive at the end of the TCGA study. A total of 168 <italic>de novo</italic> AML patients with complete mRNA-seq, and reliable EFS, and OS data are included in this analysis (Patient information details are described in the Supplemental Table 1 of the NEJM study<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Mantel-Cox test was performed to calculate log-rank p values. We also observed that abnormally low levels of Gli1 were also correlated with poor outcome (data not shown), suggesting that Gli1 levels must be in a &#x0201c;Goldilocks&#x0201d; zone.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms579963f9"/></fig><fig id="F10" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Effects of modulation of Gli1 levels on UGT1A <bold>A.</bold> Effects of the direct Gli1 inhibitor GANT-61 on restoring ribavirin sensitivity (20 uM) in FRII cells.

These findings are consistent with <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 1</xref> which indicates lower levels of UGT1A mRNA levels. Further, UGT1A3 and UGT1A8 decreased similarly (data not shown). Experiments were carried out in triplicate, at least three independent times. Average values are reported and error bars indicate standard deviations. These findings, that Gli1 elevation leads to reduce mRNA levels but increased protein levels are counter-intuitive. We hypothesize that Gli1 elevation increases protein stability of UGT1As (see below) and this leads to some sort of feedback mechanism leading to reduced UGT1As. Other scenarios are possible but the main point that Gli1 elevation leads to increased UGT1A protein production is clear. <bold>G.</bold> Gli1 increases UGT1A protein stability as shown by studies with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 and a pan-UGT1A antibody. Here, MG132 addition stabilizes levels of UGT1A in parental cells, but in FRII cells where levels are already increased, there is no further increase with MG132. This indicates that UGT1A proteins are already stabilized in the FRII cells. All results are representative of three independent experiments. <bold>H.</bold> Western blot analysis with a pan-UGT2B antibody indicates that UGT2B levels are unchanged in FRII relative to FaDu cells suggesting the glucuronidation effects are mediated mostly through the UGT1A family. Tubulin provides a loading control.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms579963f10"/></fig><fig id="F11" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Ribavirin and Ara-C glucuronidation. <bold>A</bold>. MS/MS collision induced fragmentation analysis indicate that a breakdown product of the ribavirin glucuronide missing the ribose ring (exact mass 288.07) was further fragmented into a fragment of this glucuronide (exact mass 244.08, red asterisk) and to the triazole ring, the key moiety of ribavirin (exact mass 112.04). No ribose-glucuronide or ribose fragment was detected in our experiments suggesting this is not a major glucuronidation site in these cells. However, we cannot rule out that this exists and could not be detected. <bold>B.</bold> Microsomes expressing UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6 and UGT1A9 were treated with RTP, underwent HILIC chromatography and the resulting EIC is shown. The Rib-Glu peak is clearly present and fragmentation analysis as in part A confirms that this is glucuronidated ribavirin. We note that microsomes only expressing UGT1A1 do not glucuronidate RTP; and that RTP, but not ribavirin, is glucuronidated in microsomes. These studies suggest that UGT1A4, UGT1A6 and/or UGT1A9 are required for glucuronidation as is some phosphorylation event prior to glucuronidation. <bold>C.</bold> Using HILIC chromatography, we isolated the fraction containing the Rib-Glu peak in part B. A portion of this was re-assessed by MS/MS to be sure that the correct peak was isolated. This material was used in the <sup>3</sup>H ribavirin competition assay in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4M</xref>. Material was quantified using a standard curve of ribavirin (see Materials and Methods). <bold>D.</bold> Western blot demonstrating equal loading of eIF4E-GST in the <sup>3</sup>H ribavirin pulldown assay shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4M</xref>. All results are representative of at least three independent experiments. <bold>E.</bold> AraC is glucuronidated (AraC-Glu) in FRII cells but not parental FaDu cells where AraC-TP (triphosphate) is observed. AraC-TP is also observed in FRII cells, but at much lower levels than AraC-Glu. Treatment of FRII cells with GDC-0449 results in the loss of the AraC-Glu peak and causes no alteration to the parental FaDu cells. Fragmentation strongly suggests that the cytosine is the major site of glucuronidation (data not shown). We did not observe masses consistent with an arabinose breakdown product or an arabinose-glucuronide but cannot rule out that they are present at low levels or that our isolation procedure precluded their detection. <bold>F.</bold> Structures of AraC and AraC-TP are shown.
