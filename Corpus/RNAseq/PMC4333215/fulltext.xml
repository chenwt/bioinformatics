Over five hundred new lincRNAs were identified and lincRNAs signatures were described. Expression of linc-MAF-4, a chromatin-associated T<sub>H</sub>1-specific lincRNA, was inversely correlated with MAF, a T<sub>H</sub>2-associated transcription factor. Linc-MAF-4 down-regulation skewed T cell differentiation toward T<sub>H</sub>2. We identified a long-distance interaction between <italic>linc-MAF-4</italic> and <italic>MAF</italic> genomic regions, where linc-MAF-4 associates with LSD1 and EZH2, suggesting linc-MAF-4 regulated <italic>MAF</italic> transcription by recruitment of chromatin modifiers.

These different type of immune responses are mostly coordinated by distinct CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets through signals delivered both by cytokines and by cell-to-cell contacts<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Development and differentiation programs of CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes subsets with distinct effector functions have been extensively studied in terms of signaling pathways and transcriptional networks, and a certain degree of functional plasticity between different subsets has been recently established<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Indeed, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subset flexibility in the expression of genes coding for cytokines and transcription factors allows the immune system to dynamically adapt to the many challenges it faces<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. As CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte subsets are no longer considered stable and terminally differentiated cell lineages, the question arises as to how lymphocyte phenotype and functions can be modulated and whether these new findings offer new therapeutic opportunities.</p><p id="P5">Besides the well-established role of transcription factors as instructive signals for cell differentiation toward a given lineage, other cues, such as epigenetic modifications, can regulate maintenance of cellular states<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. In this context non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are emerging as a new regulatory layer impacting on both the development and the functioning of the immune system<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Among the several classes of ncRNAs that play a specific role in lymphocyte biology, microRNAs are the best characterized<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Although thousands of long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been identified in the mammalian genome by bioinformatics analyses of transcriptomic data<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, their functional characterization is still largely incomplete. The functional studies performed to date have shown that lincRNAs contribute to the control of cell differentiation and to the maintenance of cell identity through different modes of action<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Nuclear lincRNAs act mainly through their association with chromatin-modifying complexes<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Whereas, cytoplasmic lincRNAs can modulate translational control<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and transcript stability<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> directly by base pairing with specific targets or indirectly as competing endogenous RNAs<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Few examples of functional lincRNAs have been recently described in the mouse immune system. A broad analysis performed by interrogating na&#x000ef;ve and memory CD8<sup>+</sup> cells purified from mouse spleen with a custom array of lincRNAs reported the identification of 96 lymphoid-specific lincRNAs and suggested a role for lincRNAs in lymphocyte differentiation and activation<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. The lincRNA NeST has been found to be downregulated during lymphocyte activation in a reciprocal manner to expression of interferon-&#x003b3; (IFN-&#x003b3;) and to control susceptibility to Theiler&#x02019;s virus and Salmonella infection in mice through epigenetic regulation of the <italic>Ifng</italic> locus<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. More recently, mouse lincRNA-Cox2 has been reported to be induced downstream Toll-like receptor signaling and to mediate the activation and repression of distinct sets of immune target genes involved in inflammatory responses<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Another study on mouse thymocytes and mature peripheral T cells allowed the identification of lincRNAs with specific cell expression pattern during T cell differentiation and of a CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>2 specific lincRNA - LincR-Ccr2-5&#x02032;AS - involved in the regulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>2 lymphocytes migration<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Although these studies highlight the relevance of lincRNAs in regulating immune responses, a thorough analysis of their expression profile and functional role in the human immune system is still lacking.</p><p id="P6">The present study is based on a RNA-seq analysis of thirteen highly purified primary human lymphocytes subsets. We performed a <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome reconstruction, and discovered over five hundred new long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs). We identified several lymphocyte subset-specific lincRNAs signatures, and found that linc-MAF-4, a chromatin associated CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>1 specific lincRNA, correlates inversely with the transcription factor MAF and that its down-regulation skews CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation toward T<sub>H</sub>2 phenotype. We provide the first comprehensive inventory of human lymphocytes lincRNAs and demonstrate that lincRNAs can be key to lymphocyte differentiation. This resource will likely help a better definition of lincRNAs role in lymphocytes differentiation, plasticity and effector functions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>LincRNAs discriminate human lymphocyte subsets</title><p id="P7">To assess lincRNA expression in human primary lymphocytes, RNA was extracted from thirteen lymphocyte cell subsets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of five healthy donors<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. The polyadenylated RNA fraction was then analyzed by paired-end RNA sequencing obtaining about 1.7 billion mapped reads. To enrich for transcripts deriving from &#x0201c;bona fide&#x0201d; active genes, we applied an expression threshold (&#x0201c;0.21&#x0201d; fragments per kilobases of exons per million fragments mapped, FPKM) defined through the integration of RNAseq and chromatin state ENCODE project data<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. We found a total of 31,902 expressed genes (including both protein coding and non-coding genes) in the 13 subsets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>), of which 4,201 were lincRNAs annotated in public resources<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). To identify novel lincRNAs expressed in primary human lymphocytes, we used three <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome reconstruction strategies that are based on the combination of two different sequence mappers, TopHat and Star<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, with two different tools for <italic>de nov</italic>o transcripts assembly, Cufflinks and Trinity<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. LincRNAs were identified within the newly described transcripts exploiting the following process. We selected transcripts that were longer than 200 nucleotides and multiexonic, which did not overlap with protein coding genes (thus counting out unreliable single-exon fragments assembled from RNA-seq). Transcripts that contain a conserved protein-coding region and transcripts with ORFs that contain protein domains catalogued in Pfam protein family database<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> were excluded. We utilized PhyloCSF, a comparative genomics method that assesses multispecies nucleotide sequence alignment based on a formal statistical comparison of phylogenetic codon models<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>, which efficiently identifies non-coding RNAs as demonstrated by ribosome profiling experiments<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Finally, we defined a stringent <italic>de novo</italic> lincRNA set including those genes for which at least one lincRNA isoform was reconstructed by two assemblers out of three. Through this conservatively multi-layered analysis we identified 563 novel lincRNAs genes, increasing by 11.8% the number of lincRNAs known to be expressed in human lymphocytes.</p><p id="P8">The different classes of RNAs were evenly distributed among different lymphocytes subsets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>) and the ratio of already annotated and newly identified lincRNAs was similar across different chromosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>) and across various lymphocyte subsets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>). As previously observed in different cell types<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, also in human lymphocytes lincRNAs were generally expressed at lower abundance than protein coding genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>). However, when transcripts were divided based on their expression in cell-specific and non specific (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1f</xref>), we found that cell specific lincRNAs and cell specific protein coding genes, displayed similar expression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1e-g</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Lymphocytes subsets display very different migratory abilities and effector functions, yet they are very closely related from the differentiation point of view. As lincRNAs are generally more tissue specific than protein coding genes<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, we assessed the lymphocyte cell-subset specificity of lincRNAs. We therefore classified genes according to their expression profiles by unsupervised K-means clustering and found that lincRNAs were defined by 15 clusters and protein-coding genes by 24 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). Remarkably, the percentage of genes assigned to the clusters specific for the different lymphocyte subsets was higher for lincRNAs (71%) than for protein-coding genes (34%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). This superiority stands out even when lincRNAs were compared with membrane receptor coding genes (40%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), which are generally considered the most accurate markers of different lymphocyte subsets. Similar results were obtained also using the heuristic expression threshold of FPKM&#x0003e;1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). Altogether, based on RNA-seq analyses of highly purified primary T and B lymphocyte subsets, we provide a comprehensive landscape of lincRNAs expression in human lymphocytes. Exploiting a <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome reconstruction we discovered 563 new lincRNAs, and found that lincRNAs are very effective in marking lymphocyte cell identity.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Identification of lincRNA signatures in lymphocytes</title><p id="P10">Next, we interrogated our dataset for the presence of lincRNAs signatures in the different lymphocyte subsets. We therefore looked for lincRNAs differentially expressed (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test) that had more than 2.5-fold expression difference in a given cell subset compared to all the other subsets and that were expressed in at least 3 out of 5 individuals and found 172 lincRNAs that met these criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). We integrated the human transcriptome database with our newly identified transcripts and thus created a new reference to assess more thoroughly expression of new transcripts, in other human tissues. Looking at lincRNAs signatures in a panel of sixteen human tissues (Human BodyMap 2.0 project) we found that lymphocytes signature lincRNAs were not only very poorly expressed in non-lymphoid tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), but also that most signature lincRNAs were not detectable even in lymphoid tissues. These findings underscore the importance of assessing expression of lincRNAs (as well as of any highly cell-specific transcripts) in purified primary cells rather than in total tissues where a given cell subset-specific transcript is diluted by the transcripts of all the other cell types of the tissue. It is important to note that, the newly identified lincRNAs defined as signatures were more abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>) and more cell-specific (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 3</xref>) than the already annotated lincRNAs defined as signatures. Representative data obtained from the CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>1 cell subset are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>; similar results were obtained for all the other subsets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Finally, to confirm and extend our signature data, we assessed the expression of CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>1 lincRNAs by RT-qPCR in a new set of independent samples of primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> na&#x000ef;ve, regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) and T<sub>H</sub>1 cells, as well as in na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that were activated <italic>in vitro</italic> and induced to differentiate toward T<sub>H</sub>1 or T<sub>H</sub>2 cells. Specific subset expression was confirmed for 90% of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>1 signature lincRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Moreover, 90% of CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>1 signature lincRNAs thatwere expressed in resting CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>1 cells purified <italic>ex vivo</italic>, were also highly expressed in na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells differentiated under T<sub>H</sub>1 polarizing conditions <italic>in vitro</italic>, whereas they were poorly expressed in na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that were differentiated towards T<sub>H</sub>2 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). As a corollary to these findings, we observed by RNA-seq that CD4<sup>+</sup> na&#x000ef;ve signature lincRNAs were mostly down-regulated during differentiation towards T<sub>H</sub>0 cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, when T<sub>H</sub>1, T<sub>H</sub>2 and T<sub>H</sub>17 signature lincRNAs were mostly up-regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). Taken together our data demonstrate that lincRNAs provide excellent signatures of human lymphocyte subsets, and suggest that human CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes acquire most of their memory specific lincRNAs signatures during their activation-driven differentiation from na&#x000ef;ve to memory cells.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Linc-MAF-4 downregulation skews CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells towards T<sub>H</sub>2</title><p id="P12">As lincRNAs have been reported to influence the expression of neighboring genes<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>, we asked whether protein-coding genes proximal to lymphocytes signature lincRNAs were involved in key cell-functions. To this purpose we used the FatiGO tool from the Babelomics suite for functional enrichment analysis<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> and found that protein-coding genes neighboring to signature lincRNAs were enriched for Gene Ontology terms strongly correlated with lymphocyte T cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), pointing to a possible role of signature lincRNAs in important lymphocyte functions. To obtain proof of concept of this hypothesis, we chose to characterize in depth linc-MAF-4 (also referred to as linc-MAF-2 in LNCipedia database <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lncipedia.org">http://www.lncipedia.org</ext-link><sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>), a T<sub>H</sub>1 signature lincRNA, localized 139.5 kb upstream of the <italic>MAF</italic> gene. <italic>MAF</italic> encodes a transcription factor involved in T<sub>H</sub>2 differentiation<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>, which is also required for the efficient development of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> and controls <italic>IL4</italic> transcription in CD4<sup>+</sup> T follicular helper cells<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. Our sequencing data showed that high expression of linc-MAF-4 correlated with a low amount of <italic>MAF</italic> transcript in CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>1 cells, conversely T<sub>H</sub>2 cells had low expression of linc-MAF-4 and abundant <italic>MAF</italic> transcripts. The anti-correlation of expression between lincRNAs and their neighboring genes is not a common feature of all lincRNAs<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, and it is probably restricted to a limited number of <italic>cis</italic>-acting lincRNAs. This observation was confirmed also in our dataset (data not shown). Moreover, no correlation was observed between the expression linc-MAF-4 and its proximal upstream protein coding genes: <italic>CDYL2</italic> and <italic>DYNLRB2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). A similar inverse relation between linc-MAF-4 and <italic>MAF</italic> was observed when na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic> towards T<sub>H</sub>1 or T<sub>H</sub>2 cells. In T lymphocytes differentiating towards T<sub>H</sub>1 cells, <italic>MAF</italic> transcript increased up to day 3 and then decreased thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Conversely, linc-MAF-4 was poorly expressed for the first three days but then increased progressively. In CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes differentiating towards T<sub>H</sub>2 cells, we found the opposite situation, both <italic>MAF</italic> transcript and protein abundance increased constantly up to day 8 while Iinc-MAF4 remained constantly low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>), similarly to what was observed in CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes differentiating towards T<sub>H</sub>17 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4d</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We further characterized <italic>MAF</italic> transcriptional regulation by looking at histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) abundance and RNA polymerase II occupancy at <italic>MAF</italic> promoter region in T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>2 cells. Consistent with a higher active transcription of <italic>MAF</italic> in CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>2 cells, we found that H3K4me3 content in T<sub>H</sub>2 cells was greater than in T<sub>H</sub>1 cells and that RNA polymerase II binding at <italic>MAF</italic> promoter was higher in T<sub>H</sub>2 than in T<sub>H</sub>1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Intriguingly, linc-MAF-4 knock-down in activated CD4<sup>+</sup> na&#x000ef;ve T cells led to increased <italic>MAF</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4e</xref>). All the above results indicate that modulation of <italic>MAF</italic> transcription in T cells depends on tuning of its promoter setting, and suggest a direct involvement of linc-MAF-4 in the regulation of <italic>MAF</italic> transcription.</p><p id="P14">We then assessed the overall impact of linc-MAF-4 knock-down on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation by performing transcriptome profiling and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).

Interestingly, we found that lincRNAs define the cellular identity better than protein coding genes, including those that encode surface receptor coding genes that are generally considered the most precise markers of lymphocytes subsets. Due to their specificity of expression, human lymphocytes lincRNAs that are not yet annotated in public resources would have not been identified without performing <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome reconstruction. Indeed by exploiting three different <italic>de novo</italic> strategies we identified 563 novel lincRNAs and increased by 11.8% the number of lincRNAs expressed in human lymphocytes. As our conservative analysis was limited to thirteen cellular subsets, one may wonder how many novel lincRNAs could be identified by transcriptome analysis of all of the several hundreds human cell types.</p><p id="P18">We compared our data with previous analyses of lincRNAs expression in mouse immune system<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> exploiting the LNCipedia database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lncipedia.org">http://www.lncipedia.org</ext-link>) <sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>.

However, as lincRNAs expression in a tissue is averaged across all the cell types composing that tissue, a transcriptome analysis of unfractionated tissue-derived cells may underestimate the expression of cell specific lincRNAs. In fact, the great majority of our lymphocyte lincRNA signatures cannot be detected in RNAs extracted from total lymphoid tissues (peripheral blood and lymph nodes), although these same tissues contain cells from all of the lymphocytes subsets we assessed.</p><p id="P20">The lincRNAs role in differentiation has been described in different cell types<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. In the mouse immune system it has been found that lincRNAs expression changes during na&#x000ef;ve to memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and during na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells differentiation into distinct helper T cell lineages<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. We show in human primary lymphocytes that activation-induced differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> na&#x000ef;ve T cells was associated with increased expression of lincRNAs belonging to the CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>1 signature, suggesting that upregulation of T<sub>H</sub>1 lincRNAs is part of the cell differentiation transcriptional program. Indeed, linc-MAF-4, one of the T<sub>H</sub>1 signature lincRNA, was poorly expressed in T<sub>H</sub>2 cells and its experimental downregulation skewed differentiating T helper cells toward a T<sub>H</sub>2 transcription profile. We found that linc-MAF-4 regulated transcription by exploiting a chromatin loop that brings its genomic region close to the promoter of <italic>MAF</italic> gene. We propose that the chromatin organization of this region allows linc-MAF-4 transcript to recruit both EZH2 and LSD1 and modulate the enzymatic activity of EZH2 negatively regulating <italic>MAF</italic> transcription with a mechanism of action similar to that shown for the lincRNAs HOTAIR<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> and MEG3<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. We therefore provide a mechanistic proof of concept that lincRNAs can be important regulators of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation. Given the number of specific lincRNAs expressed in the different lymphocytes subsets, it can be postulated that many other lincRNAs might contribute to cell differentiation and to the definition of cell identity in human lymphocytes. These findings and the high cell specificity of lincRNAs suggest lincRNAs as novel and highly specific molecular targets for the development of new therapies for diseases (such as autoimmunity, allergy and cancer) in which altered CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell functions play a pathogenic role.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" specific-use="web-only" id="S8"><title>ONLINE METHODS</title><sec id="S9"><title>Purification of primary immunological cell subsets</title><p id="P21">Blood buffy coat cells of healthy donors were obtained from Fondazione I.R.C.C.S.
