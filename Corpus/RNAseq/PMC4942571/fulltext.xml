The dysfunction or loss of the insulin-producing &#x003b2; cells causes diabetes mellitus, a disease that harms millions. Until now, &#x003b2; cells were generally regarded as a single, homogenous cell population. Here we identify four antigenically distinct subtypes of human &#x003b2; cells, which we refer to as &#x003b2;1&#x02013;4, and which are distinguished by differential expression of ST8SIA1 and CD9. These subpopulations are always present in normal adult islets and have diverse gene expression profiles and distinct basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Importantly, the &#x003b2; cell subtype distribution is profoundly altered in type 2 diabetes. These data suggest that this antigenically defined &#x003b2; cell heterogeneity is functionally and likely medically relevant.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

In human islets, SLC18A2/VMAT2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) and DKK3 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) were found in &#x003b2; cell subsets and heterogeneity in insulin secretion has also been suggested<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. In this report, we explore human &#x003b2; cell heterogeneity with new markers and identify subpopulations present at different frequencies in healthy and type 2 diabetes (T2D) islets. Dissimilar basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) characteristics indicate that these subtypes are functionally distinct, and suggest possible clinical relevance.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Development of antibodies to assess cellular heterogeneity</title><p>To study cell type heterogeneity in the human pancreas, we developed cell surface marking antibodies by immunizing mice with human islets.

Live human pancreatic &#x003b2; cells were purified with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using the combination of positive selection with the pan-endocrine marker HPi2 (HIC1-2B4) and negative selection for HPa3 (HIC3-2D12), an antibody that labels all non-&#x003b2; endocrine cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. To determine whether this &#x02018;pure' HPi2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/HPa3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> &#x003b2; cell population was actually heterogeneous, we examined numerous cell surface antigens known to be expressed on &#x003b2; cells from transcriptome analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> and systematically analysed our novel monoclonal antibody collection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> for subset binding. Two antibodies exhibited clear antigenic heterogeneity within the &#x003b2; cell compartment: HIC0-3C5, a novel monoclonal antibody developed in our anti-islet screens and monoclonal antibodies recognizing CD9, a tetraspanin identified as a &#x003b2; cell marker in our transcriptome analyses. To identify the antigen for HIC0-3C5, rat C6 cells carrying a human cDNA library were screened by FACS isolation and the re-growth of positively labelled cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The HIC0-3C5 antigen was revealed by cDNA insert sequencing to be ST8SIA1, an alpha-N-acetylneuraminide alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase of unknown function in endocrine cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Neither of these &#x003b2; cell-subset markers were expressed exclusively in this cell type; in the pancreas, ST8SIA1 is found on about half of &#x003b1; cells and CD9 is present on most &#x003b4; cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>&#x003b2; cells can be subdivided into antigenic subtypes</title><p>Live pancreatic &#x003b2; cells were isolated from human islet samples by FACS and co-labelled with antibodies recognizing ST8SIA1 and CD9, revealing four antigenically distinct subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). We labelled these &#x003b2;1&#x02013;4, with &#x003b2;1 being most abundant and &#x003b2;4 most rare. Transmission electron microscopic imaging of evaluable populations revealed comparable structures and confirmed the presence of insulin granules in each subtype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). The subtype frequencies were similar in 17 healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1k</xref>), and all four subpopulations were present in each case. &#x003b2;1 was the largest subpopulation, followed by &#x003b2;2 and the minor &#x003b2;3 and &#x003b2;4 populations. Subset frequencies were compared with available clinical parameters including gender, age, body mass index and time of cold ischaemia for the donor and specimen, but no significant correlations were observed. Importantly, the subtype percentages of healthy obese individuals (body mass index&#x0003e;30) did not differ from healthy, lean people (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Assessment of &#x003b2; cell-subset markers in intact tissue</title><p>Human islet preparations from cadaveric donors are typically cultured for days before becoming available for analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Therefore, it was possible that the observed antigenic &#x003b2; cell heterogeneity was the product of <italic>in vitro</italic> de-differentiation and not representative of true <italic>in vivo</italic> heterogeneity. To address this possibility, we assessed the expression of ST8SIA1 and CD9 in sections of human pancreata. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3a</xref> illustrates co-labelling of CD9 and proinsulin, the non-secreted precursor of (&#x003b2; cell-specific) insulin. Most proinsulin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> &#x003b2; cells were CD9<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, but a large subpopulation of proinsulin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD9<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells was present, as predicted by FACS analysis. Similar heterogeneity, with a smaller proportion of positively marked &#x003b2; cells, was observed for ST8SIA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Quantification of the subtype frequencies in 100 tissue-resident islets fell within the range expected from the FACS data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Combination labelling with both &#x003b2; cell subset markers directly illustrates the antigenic heterogeneity of human &#x003b2; cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>). These results demonstrate &#x003b2; cell heterogeneity <italic>in situ</italic>, indicating that it is not an artefact of islet isolation or culture. Protein-level evidence of heterogeneity was also observed for HCN1 (potassium/sodium hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>), which had been identified as a potential &#x003b2; cell-subset marker by RNA expression analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>&#x003b2; cell subsets have differences in gene expression</title><p>We next determined whether antigenic heterogeneity correlated with functional differences between the &#x003b2; cell subsets. Transcriptome analysis by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on the &#x003b2; cell subsets of five healthy donors. Importantly, all four populations clearly displayed the gene expression profile of classic &#x003b2; cells with very high levels of insulin mRNA and other typical marker genes, such as <italic>PDX1</italic>, <italic>MAFA</italic> and <italic>NKX6.1</italic>. Indeed, the four populations are overall very similar in their RNA expression profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). A heat map showing the expression of a selected list of genes known to be important for &#x003b2; cell function is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>. Nonetheless, a subset of genes was consistently expressed at different levels in the &#x003b2; cell subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 6&#x02013;9</xref>). Using stringent statistical cutoffs, a sizeable list of genes (125 with false discovery rate&#x02264;0.1, 72&#x02264;0.05 and 49&#x02264;0.01) was found to be differentially expressed between the ST8SIA1-positive (&#x003b2;3/4) and -negative (&#x003b2;1/2) populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 6 and 7</xref>) as well as the CD9<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD9<sup>&#x02212;</sup> populations (107 with false discovery rate&#x02264;0.1, 86&#x02264;0.05 and 45&#x02264;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 8 and 9</xref>). Given the inter-individual heterogeneity inherent to human clinical specimens, these differences are highly significant and likely represent only a minimal estimate of the true transcriptome heterogeneity. Contamination with other endocrine cell types was negligible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>), but nonetheless all genes known to be robustly expressed in non-&#x003b2; pancreatic cells were removed from analysis. As expected, the genes encoding the antigens used for cell isolation, <italic>CD9</italic> and <italic>ST8SIA1</italic>, were expressed at significantly higher levels in the &#x003b2;2/4 and &#x003b2;3/4 populations, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 6 and 8</xref>). Most of the differentially expressed genes are of unknown function in &#x003b2; cells, but some have been clearly associated with insulin secretion (for examples, <italic>GLUT2</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), <italic>PPP1R1A</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and <italic>ABCC9/SUR2</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>)) or are known to be dysregulated in T2D (for examples, <italic>G6PC2</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, <italic>RPB4</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>) and <italic>MAFB</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Interestingly, the ST8SIA1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> population is significantly enriched for GO biological processes related to protein secretion including &#x02018;Regulation of Insulin Secretion' (<italic>n</italic>=9, <italic>P</italic>=0.012), whereas ST8SIA1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is enriched for &#x02018;Neurogenesis' (<italic>n</italic>=16, <italic>P</italic>=0.012). Thus, by gene expression, it might be expected that the ST8SIA1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> &#x003b2; cells are more capable of secreting insulin. Among the other genes expressed heterogeneously in &#x003b2; cells, one example with possible relevance to insulin secretion is the f-channel <italic>HCN1</italic>, which was increased threefold in the ST8SIA1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (&#x003b2;3/4) populations. Co-labelling of HCN1 with proinsulin confirmed that &#x003b2; cells exhibit a range of HCN1 expression at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Several transcription factors were also differentially expressed, including <italic>SIX3</italic>, <italic>RFX6</italic>, <italic>MAFB</italic> and <italic>NEUROD1.</italic> Notably, <italic>SIX3</italic> was recently shown to be important for &#x003b2; cell maturation during ageing and higher expression levels were found to enhance insulin secretion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Other previously reported human heterogeneity markers, that is, <italic>VMAT2</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) or <italic>DKK3</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) were not significantly differentially expressed in our subsets.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Functional assessment of insulin secretion</title><p>However, most of the genes identified here as differentially expressed in human &#x003b2; cell subsets currently lack a known role in this cell type. We therefore also wanted to ascertain whether functional differences between the subsets could be identified, particularly in regard to insulin secretion. Although FACS sorted single-cell suspensions of individual &#x003b2; cell subtypes lacked glucose responsiveness, GSIS was re-established by forming subtype aggregates in overnight co-culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). Post-assay viability was comparable (92&#x02013;96&#x00025;) in the different subtypes. Despite having equivalent insulin mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>) and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>) content, differences in basal and GSIS were found. Basal insulin secretion in islet subtype aggregates was lowest for &#x003b2;1 (0.12&#x000b1;0.01&#x02009;pmol per cell per h) and highest for &#x003b2;4 (0.25&#x000b1;0.23&#x02009;pmol per cell per h; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>), and the difference between these subtypes was significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.04). More importantly, there were clear differences in GSIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c,d</xref>). Analyses of reaggregated subtypes from five normal islet samples revealed that the stimulation index of &#x003b2;1 aggregates (3.2&#x000b1;0.9 &#x000d7;) was significantly higher than that of &#x003b2;2 (2.0&#x000b1;0.4 &#x000d7;), &#x003b2;3 (1.9&#x000b1;0.6 &#x000d7;) or &#x003b2;4 (1.4&#x000b1;0.2 &#x000d7;). Given the clear differences in insulin secretion and the observation of differential expression of some genes involved in insulin secretion, we wondered whether differentially regulated genes of unknown function in human &#x003b2; cells may also be involved in this process. The HCN channel genes <italic>HCN1</italic> and <italic>HCN4</italic> were chosen for functional evaluation, because HCN2 was previously shown to be involved in insulin secretion in rats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Ivabradine, a specific inhibitor of HCN channels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, was tested on whole human islets. Basal insulin secretion was significantly increased in the presence of the inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>), whereas GSIS was significantly suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e,f</xref>). To prove that inhibition of HCN channels affected &#x003b2; cells directly and not via paracrine effects, ivabradine was tested on &#x003b2;-like cells generated from pluripotent precursors <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. No other HCN-expressing cell types are present in this model. HCN inhibition significantly increased basal insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5g</xref>) as it had in intact islets. GSIS was not significantly altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5h</xref>). Together, these functional data show that the <italic>HCN</italic> genes differentially expressed in &#x003b2; cell subtypes play a role in modulating human insulin secretion, consistent with observations in rodents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. This &#x02018;spot-test' of the differentially expressed gene list further strengthens our conclusion that human &#x003b2; cell subtypes differ in their insulin release kinetics.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Diabetic islets have an abnormal &#x003b2; cell subtype distribution</title><p>Given that both gene expression analysis and insulin secretion analysis indicated functional heterogeneity among the &#x003b2; cell subtypes, we wondered whether disease states could affect the subset composition of human islets. To determine whether the alterations of islet structure and function associated with T2D<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> affected subset distribution, islet samples from eight patients were examined. The total recoverable (live, non-doublet) &#x003b2; cell frequencies in these specimens fell within the range for normal specimens (15&#x02013;45&#x00025; of all endocrine cells), but the distribution of subtypes was highly variable between donors and clearly different from that of normal islets. Two distinct patterns were observed. In six out of eight patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c&#x02013;j</xref>), the frequencies of the ST8SIA1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> &#x003b2;3 and &#x003b2;4 populations (normally &#x0223c;18&#x00025;) was unusually high. The differences in subtype percentages were highly significant between islets from normal individuals (both lean and obese) and those from T2D patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1l</xref>). In two additional patients, the &#x003b2; cell subset pattern was also very abnormal, but either the ST8SIA1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> population had disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>) or the primary abnormality was a very high percentage of CD9<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1i</xref>). These data indicate that the frequencies of &#x003b2; cell subtypes are altered in the majority of individuals with T2D diabetes.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Most of the 200&#x0002b; human cell types thought to exist were originally identified by nineteenth century histology methods. However, the advent of monoclonal antibody surface markers has led to the identification of important cellular subtypes among morphologically homogenous cell populations, most notably in the haematopoietic system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Functional heterogeneity among &#x003b2; cells had long been suspected based on functional assays suggesting cells with different insulin release kinetics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, but until now it was impossible to prospectively isolate the subtypes. Here we demonstrate the existence of at least four distinct human &#x003b2; cell subtypes that can be separated based on cell surface marker expression. Clear differences in both basal and stimulated insulin secretion behaviour were observed between the subtypes, suggesting that the &#x003b2; subpopulations differ in their insulin release kinetics. These dissimilarities may serve to create smooth rather than sharp changes in insulin secretion in response to various stimuli and ensure that rapid shifts in blood glucose levels do not occur. Differentially expressed genes found here are good candidates to be modifiers of insulin release. We were able to demonstrate this directly for the HCN channels, which, until now, have not been known to play functional role in human &#x003b2; cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. It seems unlikely that a single differentially expressed gene regulates the subtype insulin release kinetics. Instead, they probably act in concert. Future functional genomic studies should unravel the relative contributions of each factor. Recent work by Bader <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> shows that distinct &#x003b2; cell subtypes can also be found in the mouse. Using the Wnt pathway target gene <italic>Fltp</italic> as a marker, they demonstrated that these subtypes have distinct developmental origins, suggesting that this may also be the case with the human &#x003b2; cell subtypes described here. The genes differentially expressed in the murine subtypes only partially overlap with our human gene list, but like the human &#x003b2; cell subtypes, the murine subtypes differ in their insulin release kinetics. The clearly abnormal distribution of &#x003b2; cell subsets in the majority of our small T2D sample set raises the possibility that the subtypes differ in their susceptibility to metabolic stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, proliferative capacity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> or differentiation state<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. In normal islets, the ST8SIA1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> &#x003b2;3 and &#x003b2;4 populations, that is, those increased in most T2D patients, are less responsive to glucose. It is unclear at this time whether the four &#x003b2; cell subtypes are indicative of different developmental origins or whether they represent different functional and inter-convertible states of a single &#x003b2; cell type. However, given the remarkable reproducibility of their distribution percentages in normal islets obtained from many independent donors, it is unlikely that the subtypes could be the result of circadian, acute metabolic or ageing processes. Regardless of their ontogeny, the different properties of human &#x003b2; cell subtypes likely have an important impact on metabolic regulation and human disease processes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Tissue sources and pancreatic cell isolation</title><p>Human pancreatic islets from normal and diabetic donors were obtained from the NIDDK-funded Integrated Islet Distribution Program at City of Hope<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.
