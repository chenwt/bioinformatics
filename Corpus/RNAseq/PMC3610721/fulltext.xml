Unlike the majority of spliceosomal proteins (and despite having no obvious homologs), CTNNBL1 is inessential for cell viability as revealed by studies in both vertebrate B cell lines and in fission yeast. Here, however, we show that ablation of CTNNBL1 in the mouse germline results in mid-gestation embryonic lethality but that lineage-specific CTNNBL1 ablation in early B cell precursors does not affect the production and abundance of mature B lymphocytes. However, CTNNBL1-deficient resting B lymphocytes show sluggish exit from quiescence on cell activation, although once entry into cycle has initiated, proliferation and differentiation in response to mitogenic stimuli continue largely unaffected. A similar sluggish exit from quiescence is also observed on reprovision of nutrients to nitrogen-starved CTNNBL1-deficient yeast. The results indicate that, whereas other RNA splicing-associated factors have been connected to cell cycle progression, CTNNBL1 plays no essential role in cycling cells but does fulfill an evolutionarily conserved function in helping cells to undergo efficient exit from quiescence following activation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords: </title><kwd>CTNNBL1</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>quiescence</kwd><kwd>RNA splicing</kwd><kwd>B lymphocyte</kwd><kwd>yeast</kwd><kwd>conditional knockout mice</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>CTNNBL1 (catenin-&#x003b2;-like 1) is a widely expressed nuclear protein composed of multiple tandem armadillo domains that owes its name to the fact that it shows predicted structural homology (though little primary sequence homology) to &#x003b2;-catenin.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><sup>1</sup></xref> CTNNBL1 likely functions in RNA splicing, since it is associated with the Prp19-CDC5L-PLRG1 complex (also known as the 19 or NTC complex) of the spliceosome, interacting directly with CDC5L.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>-</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><sup>5</sup></xref> However, although present as a single-copy gene in vertebrates without any obvious sequence homologs, CTNNBL1 is inessential for cell viability, since the <italic>Ctnnbl1</italic> gene has been disrupted in both chicken and mouse B cell lines without notably affecting cell proliferation or viability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><sup>6</sup></xref></p><p>The fact that CTNNBL1 is inessential for the viability of mammalian cell-lines and yet the gene is widely-expressed and well conserved among most eukaryotes led us to ask whether more subtle effects of CTNNBL1 deficiency might be observed in intact animals, as opposed to in B cell-lines.

At 24 h of activation, control and knockout B cells already show considerable difference in cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.&#x000a0;5A</xref>) and total RNA content as judged by acridine orange staining (not shown). We therefore focused on an earlier time point to see if we could discern major differences in the extent of splicing. RNaseq was performed on total RNA extracted from splenic follicular B cells prior to and following 12 h of LPS stimulation. The results reveal that the 12 h period of activation is accompanied by a marked increased in the ratio of total exonic to intronic reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.&#x000a0;6A</xref>). However, not only is there no evident difference in the extent of this overall increase when comparing control and CTNNBL1-deficient B cells, we have also not been able to discern any individual transcripts whose splicing is affected by CTNNBL1 deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.&#x000a0;6B</xref>). Thus, although there is some sample-to-sample variation in the read ratios in individual genes, the results do not reveal any individual gene whose read ratio is consistently altered as a consequence of CTNNBL1 deficiency by an amount beyond the level of variability attributable to the observed noise of the data set (i.e., by an amount greater than 2 standard deviations, where the standard deviation is deduced from sample data with similar read ratios and assuming a normal distribution). Furthermore, the B cells from control and knockout mice show a remarkably similar pattern of gene activation at the 12 h time point. The most notable difference (apart from those in CTNNBL1 itself) is an increase in the reads for haem oxygenase (Hmox1) in the activated CTNNBL1-deficient sample, which likely reflects small differences in the efficiency of red blood cell lysis during sample preparation since the inducible form of Hmox1 is very sensitive to byproducts of erythrocyte clearance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><sup>9</sup></xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SUP1"><bold>Fig S2</bold></xref>). Thus, although we cannot exclude the possibility that CTNNBL1 deficiency has a small effect on the splicing of one or several specific RNAs, the RNaseq data do not reveal any genes that have suffered a major discernible splicing perturbation.</p><fig id="F6" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><caption><p><bold>Figure&#x000a0;6.</bold> Comparison of RNA splicing in CTNNBL1-proficient and &#x02013;deficient B cells.

A similar requirement for CTNNBL1 for timely exit from quiescence is also observed in fission yeast.</p><p>The embryonic lethality of CTNNBL1 deficiency manifests itself around the midterm of pregnancy, by which time most of the major cell lineages have been established. Although gross inspection of mid-term embryos has not revealed any organ that is specifically affected by CTNNBL1 deficiency, it remains possible that there is a particular cell type whose function or development is critically dependent on CTNNBL1 and that which accounts for the lethality of CTNNBL1 deficiency. Alternatively it may be that the phenotype observed in the B cells (sluggish exit from quiescence) has a severe effect on embryonic viability when recapitulated in multiple lineages during synchronized embryonic development and lineage expansion. It will therefore be interesting to cross our floxed CTNNBL1 allele into mouse lines carrying Cre recombinases active in multiple different lineages to ascertain whether there is any specific lineage or developmental stage at which loss of CTNNBL1 leads to a more severe phenotype than that observed in lymphocytes.</p><p>The molecular associations of CTNNBL1 suggest that it likely functions in RNA splicing. Although clearly not essential for splicing, a possibility suggested by this work is that CTNNBL1 may function in linking RNA splicing with timely exit from quiescence. This would be by no means the first occasion on which a link has been proposed between deficiency in an RNA splicing factor and the control of cell cycle progression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>-</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"><sup>15</sup></xref> However, the suggestion here is that CTNNBL1 may function in connection with the timely &#x0201c;bulking up&#x0201d; of RNA splicing that must occur on exit from quiescence and allow progression through to S phase. Thus although CTNNBL1 deficiency does not affect the expression of early activation markers, CTNNBL1 deficiency does manifest itself in a delay to the subsequent cell enlargement/blasting. Such blasting must be accompanied by a substantial increase in the RNA processing and protein translation machinery of the cell. In contrast, a requirement for CTNNBL1 might not be manifest in cells already undergoing rapid division since such cells will inherit a substantial endowment of transcription and translation factors from their parents. Indeed, the need for bulking up may especially apply to lymphoid cells. The adaptive immune system is notable in comprising very long-lived quiescent cells with little cytoplasm, which, following antigen triggering, take time to blast and then undergo multiple sequential rounds of rapid division. It is notable that the effect of CTNNBL1 deficiency on delaying cell blasting is especially marked with respect to the small follicular B cells as compared with their larger marginal zone counterparts.</p><p>The phenotype revealed by CTNNBL1 deficiency is an intriguing one and suggests that there may be other genes whose primary function is to assist cell blasting and exit from quiescence. Several studies have been performed to identify pathways associated with cell quiescence&#x02014;in budding and fission yeast, in nematode worms as well as in mammalian lymphocytes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>-</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><sup>18</sup></xref> Such studies have identified genes and pathways functioning in the maintenance of the quiescent state but have not, so far as we are aware, revealed any genes whose deficiency results in a phenotype similar to that seen with CTNNBL1. We suspect that this does not reflect that CTNNBL1 is unique with respect to functioning specifically in the blasting/&#x0201c;bulking up&#x0201d; phase of cell activation without being needed for immediate early gene activation or subsequent ongoing cell proliferation. Rather we suspect that such a phenotype might not have been easily scored in previous work, especially if deficiency in such genes leads to embryonic lethality, since it would only be readily apparent by following the blasting of resting cells obtained from animals carrying a lineage-specific gene ablation. It will be interesting therefore in future work not only to establish the molecular mechanism by which CTNNBL1 deficiency leads to sluggish exit from quiescence without affecting initial cell activation but also, by interrogation of mouse lines carrying other conditional gene ablations, to ascertain whether a similar phenotype is obtained with deficiencies in other genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Generation of <italic>Ctnnbl1</italic>-targeted mice</title><p>The targeting construct for conditional <italic>Ctnnbl1</italic> inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1A</xref>) was obtained from EUCOMM (construct PG00008_A_1_E07).
