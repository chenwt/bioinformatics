Little is known about specific host gene variants and molecular networks that influence herpetic disease progression, severity, and episodic reactivation. To identify such host gene variants we have initiated a forward genetic analysis using the expanded family of BXD strains, all derived from crosses between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J strains of mice. One parent is highly resistant and one highly susceptible to HSV-1. Both strains have also been fully sequenced, greatly facilitating the search for genetic modifiers that contribute to differences in HSV-1 infection. We monitored diverse disease phenotypes following infection with HSV-1 strain 17syn+ including percent mortality (herpes simplex encephalitis, HSE), body weight loss, severity of herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK), spleen weight, serum neutralizing antibody titers, and viral titers in tear films in BXD strains. A significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome (Chr) 16 was found to associate with both percent mortality and HSK severity. Importantly, this QTL maps close to a human QTL and the gene proposed to be associated with the frequency of recurrent herpetic labialis (cold sores). This suggests that a single host locus may influence these seemingly diverse HSV-1 pathogenic phenotypes by as yet unknown mechanisms. Additional suggestive QTLs for percent mortality were identified&#x02014;one on Chr X that is epistatically associated with that on Chr 16. As would be anticipated the Chr 16 QTL also modulated weight loss, reaching significance in females. A second significant QTL for maximum weight loss in male and female mice was mapped to Chr 12. To our knowledge this is the first report of a host genetic locus that modulates the severity of both herpetic disease in the nervous system and herpetic stromal keratitis.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The work was supported by NIH RC1 AI087336, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov/">www.nih.gov/</ext-link>.

While many infections are asymptomatic, serious disease occurs in some individuals and HSV is the leading cause of both sporadic necrotizing encephalitis and infectious blindness in the United States <xref rid="pone.0092342-Levitz1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0092342-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Significantly, genital infection with HSV-2 is associated with a two-fold increased risk of transmission in sexually transmitted cases of HIV <xref rid="pone.0092342-Corey1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0092342-Glynn1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The ubiquity of HSV in the human population is the result of its ability to establish latent infections in sensory neurons and subsequently reactivate to cause recurrent disease and transmission to new hosts. No effective vaccine is yet available. Effective anti-HSV drugs exist, but resistant strains can develop <xref rid="pone.0092342-Horsburgh1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0092342-Griffiths2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and antivirals cannot eliminate the latent viral reservoir. Advances in genomics present the opportunity to gain insight into host genetic variation that predispose to serious disease outcomes. This knowledge in turn can lead to enhanced treatment protocols, the design of new strategies to reduce latent reservoirs, and the potential to discover biomarkers to identify individuals at greater risk of severe herpetic disease.</p><p>About 40 years ago it was shown that both viral and host genetics contribute greatly to the outcome of experimental infection in mice <xref rid="pone.0092342-Plummer1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092342-Lopez1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Other factors that impact HSV disease outcome in mice include the age of the host at the time of infection, the route of infection and the inoculation titer. Traditional reverse genetic approaches (e.g. gene knock out, knock down, or over expression strategies) have provided insight into the viral genes that regulate pathogenic processes and the role that the components of the host immune system plays in the formation of herpetic stromal keratitis <xref rid="pone.0092342-Steiner1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0092342-VeigaParga1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. However, little is known about naturally occurring host gene variants and molecular networks that modulate the infectious process or predispose the host to severe outcomes. A very early study suggested that a gene or genes residing close to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus were involved in keratitis in mice <xref rid="pone.0092342-Foster1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Cantin and colleagues describe three loci on mouse chromosome (Chr) 6 involved in neutrophil function and resistance to fatal disease in mice <xref rid="pone.0092342-Lundberg1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Recently a human genetic locus associated with frequency of recurrent HSV-1 <italic>labialis</italic> (cold sores) has been mapped to Chr 21 <xref rid="pone.0092342-Kriesel1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092342-Hobbs1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Despite these successes, there is much left to learn about the naturally occurring gene variants and molecular networks that contribute to protection against severe disease caused by herpes simplex virus.</p><p>We employed the BXD advanced recombinant inbred (ARI, <xref rid="pone.0092342-Peirce1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>) lines of mice to identify novel gene variants that impact the severity of several important HSV-1 disease phenotypes including percent mortality (viral invasion of the central nervous system resulting in death) and herpetic stromal keratitis, in a well-characterized mouse model of HSV-1 corneal infection. The BXD gene reference population (GRP) is particularly well-suited for these studies for several reasons. First, the lines result from a cross of C57BL/6J (B6 or B) and DBA/2J (D2 or D) inbred strains of mice that are highly resistant and highly susceptible to HSV infection respectively <xref rid="pone.0092342-Lopez1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In addition both parental strains have been deeply and completely sequenced and the BXD lines have been densely genotyped. Thus interval mapping for the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) is greatly expedited. The BXD lines have been used by researchers throughout the world in many diverse studies including those centered on the eye and nervous system (for example see <xref rid="pone.0092342-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0092342-Alexander1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>), as well as several infectious agents (for example <xref rid="pone.0092342-Aziz1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0092342-Yadav1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>). The BXD family is one of the largest GRP, presently containing &#x0223c;160 lines of mice, each line of which is isogenic except for sex chromosomes. This large family permits the efficient identification of naturally occurring gene variants and molecular networks that regulate biologic properties. In addition a large number of previously published and as yet unpublished phenotypes and omics data sets on these strains can be accessed directly using the GeneNetwork.org site that also incorporates software for mapping and statistical analysis of the BXD and many other populations.</p><p>Here we infected the BXD lines and the parental strains with HSV-1 strain 17syn+ via the cornea and systematically phenotyped mice for &#x0003e;30 days post-infection. We report a novel QTL on Chr 16 that controls both virulence and HSK severity. This Chr 16 locus is also linked to maximum weight loss in females. A second QTL for maximum weight loss maps to Chr 12. The Chr 16 interval is homologous to human Chr 21, and the region identified here maps close to, but appears to be distinct from, the region on human Chr 21 that influences cold sore frequency in humans <xref rid="pone.0092342-Kriesel1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Our findings suggest that a single host locus may regulate both percent mortality and HSK severity in mice (and perhaps recurrent disease frequency in humans <xref rid="pone.0092342-Kriesel1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>) by some common as yet unidentified mechanism, which is discussed further below.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was carried out in complete accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping was performed with the GeneNetwork analysis tools (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genenetwork.org">www.genenetwork.org</ext-link>). Single marker regression was performed across the entire mouse complement of chromosomes at markers typed across BXD strains. A likelihood ratio statistic (LRS) was calculated at each marker comparing the hypothesis that the marker is associated with the phenotype with the null hypothesis that there is no association between marker and phenotype. Genome-wide significance was determined by performing 2000 permutations. Significant QTLs were found on Chr 12 and 16 (weight loss), Chr X and 16 (percent mortality) and Chr 16 (herpetic stromal keratitis severity).

Groups of each line, including males and females in approximately equal numbers, were infected with wild type HSV-1 strain 17syn+ on the cornea as detailed in Methods. A single investigator infected all of the mice to ensure high technical consistency. Infected mice were observed daily, weighed every other day, and tear films were collected on day 4 post-infection (p.i.) to evaluate viral titers. Eyes were independently scored by two investigators for the severity of herpetic stromal keratitis essentially as previously described <xref rid="pone.0092342-Brandt1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092342-Brandt2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, and as detailed further below and in methods. The parental strains and most BXD lines were analyzed more than once throughout the multi-year study in groups ranging from 3&#x02013;10. In all cases the reproducibility of the disease phenotypes displayed within individual lines was consistent. In contrast, extensive variability in the phenotypes was displayed between lines.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>General patterns of disease</title><p>Clinical and postmortem findings in humans combined with animal model studies provide a temporal and spatial understanding of primary HSV infection. In the mouse corneal infection model with viral strains of moderate virulence, viral replication occurs in an overlapping wave in three distinct tissue compartments including corneal epithelium, innervating trigeminal ganglion (TG), and connecting central nervous system (CNS). This acute phase of primary infection resolves in 8&#x02013;12 days. Viral replication on the cornea peaks at day 4 p.i. By 2 days p.i. virus that has transported through sensory neuron axons to the TG begins to replicate and viral titers reach their peak on day 4 p.i. in TG, and infectious virus is cleared within 8 to 9 days p.i. During this time virus enters the CNS, and it is the timing and extent of viral replication here that determines whether or not lethal encephalitis ensues <xref rid="pone.0092342-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092342-Shimeld1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0092342-Thompson5" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p><p>With respect to susceptibility to fatal encephalitis, four general patterns were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092342-g001">fig. 1</xref>). Some of the BXD lines were highly resistant as is the B6 parent strain. This outcome is typified by BXD69. In this line, 100% of both males and females survived infection with minimal weight loss. At its maximum, less than 10% of original body weight was lost which had returned to preinfection values within 12 days p.i. In contrast, other lines were highly susceptible with no survivors, similar to the D2 parent at the inoculation titer employed. The BXD48 line typifies the response of these susceptible lines.

Since the phenotypes of percent mortality, percent maximum weight loss and HSK had QTL that mapped to Chr 16, we performed Spearman rank correlations to determine if the co-mapping was statistically significant. The Spearman rank correlation is a non-parametric measure that assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function.

Analysis of genetic reference populations (GRP) coupled with genome wide association studies (GWAS) can lead to the identification of naturally occurring gene variants associated with severe disease outcomes and deduction of the gene networks to which they contribute. This information in turn can identify biomarkers of susceptibility and also suggest potential new treatment strategies. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection is an example of an infectious disease which is normally relatively benign in most individuals but can cause severe disease sequelae in otherwise healthy people. There is at present no way to predict who might be susceptible to these rare severe manifestations of herpetic disease.</p><p>Our current understanding of HSV-1 disease mechanisms comes largely from reverse genetics approaches such as gene deletions in mice and the virus or RNAi knock downs of viral or host genes. A large body of literature defines the importance of many viral genes and host immune modulating factors, cellular infiltrates, cytokines and angiogenic factors, and potential autoimmunity in viral virulence and/or the formation of the corneal scaring and loss of visual acuity (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0092342-Steiner1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092342-Gimenez1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092342-Brandt2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092342-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0092342-Inoue1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. However, these studies do not identify those individuals potentially at high risk. We employed an unbiased forward phenotypically driven systems genetics approach to begin to identify unknown gene variants and potential molecular networks of the host that contribute to these severe herpetic disease states, with the ultimate goals of disease risk prediction and improved treatment outcomes. It is of interest that none of the aforementioned host genes or molecular mechanisms was directly implicated in the QTLs we identified.</p><p>In this study a single well-characterized HSV-1 laboratory isolate (17syn+) and a single inoculation titer were employed in the BXD family using a generally well characterized model of ocular HSV infection. The BXDs are particularly well suited for these studies because the parental strains are either very resistant to HSV-1 (C57BL/6J) or very sensitive (DBA/2J). The BXD lines have the advantage of being widely available and they have a 40-year history of use <xref rid="pone.0092342-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. The BXDs have also been thoroughly genotyped and phenotyped and many large omics data sets generated in prior studies can be mined to, for example, identify relevant pleiotropic interactions and expression QTL (eQTL) in many tissues and cell types.</p><p>Our analysis revealed and mapped significant QTLs on Chr12 and 16 (weight loss), Chr X and 16 (percent mortality) and Chr 16 (herpetic stromal keratitis severity). Somewhat surprisingly a common QTL for all three of these phenotypes overlaps on the distal end of Chr 16. Virulence of a given virus strain and its ability to cause HSK are not linked <xref rid="pone.0092342-Brandt1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092342-Brandt2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.

A major common host QTL for both percent mortality (neuroinvasion) and HSK, while not predictable, may have important implications for how the process leading to HSK is initiated. This is currently under investigation.</p><p>There is a paucity of forward genetic analyses of HSV disease. Prior studies in mice implicated a region on Chr 6 that confers resistance to HSV infection that appears to be an autosomal dominant but is nevertheless strongly sex-biased <xref rid="pone.0092342-Lundberg1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Our studies did not detect this locus, presumably because the underlying variants are not segregating in the BXDs. Analysis of the eight parent Collaborative Cross mouse lines, when they become widely available, would cover more than 90% of mouse genetic diversity. An early study employed congenic lines of mice that varied at the immunoglobin heavy chain (IgH) locus and found an association with the locus on Chr 12 and keratitis <xref rid="pone.0092342-Foster1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. A study performed on 129/SVEV x C57BL/6)F(2) mice at the ten centimorgan (cM) level revealed loci on Chr 3, 5, 12, 13 and 14 with impacts on general disease, and 10 and 17 associated with keratitis in complex with other loci <xref rid="pone.0092342-Norose1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Our study uncovered a highly significant QTL on Chr 12 locus for percent maximum weight loss. The QTL on the distal end of Chr 12 (106&#x02013;119 Mb) contains the Igh locus, and this same region reached the suggestive linkage criterion for percent mortality and HSK severity. This region contains over 200 genes and further studies will be required to reduce this number of positional candidates to a manageable number.</p><p>While it is possible that IgH family members are involved in resistance to HSV, there was no direct correlation between serum neutralizing antibody titers in BXDs and percent mortality. A mechanism of molecular mimicry of an IgH locus and viral antigen leading to HSK has been described <xref rid="pone.0092342-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, but is limited to specific viral and mouse strains and dominant only under conditions of low viral load <xref rid="pone.0092342-Huster1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, which were not duplicated in our studies. Other potentially interesting genes within this region include YinYang1 (YY1), a transcription factor that can both up or down regulate genes through its cognate binding sites and is known to regulate HSV-1 genes <xref rid="pone.0092342-Gu1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092342-Lieu1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. The YY1 gene contains a non-synonymous SNP between B6 and D2 and also has a cis expression QTL (cis-eQTL) at 110.06 Mb (determined with the Hippocampus Consortium data set in GN <xref rid="pone.0092342-Overall1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>), which regulates levels of expression in the nervous system. Such cis-eQTL are often implicated in disease phenotypes. This region of Chr 12 also contains the <italic>Rest</italic> gene. REST and co-REST proteins are thought to help silence the viral genome in cultured cells, and there is evidence this occurs in sensory neurons in vivo <xref rid="pone.0092342-Roizman1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092342-Du1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. The <italic>Rest</italic> gene has a cis-eQTL at &#x0223c;112.35 Mb.</p><p>A few forward genetic analyses of HSV disease severity in humans have been reported. In a series of phenotypically driven GWAS studies in highly inbred human populations, Cassanova and colleagues have demonstrated the importance of the innate immune response in protection. In particular, they found TOLL receptor signaling/interferon gamma pathways important for protection of the central nervous system from HSV-1 encephalitis.

However the vast majority of people who experience HSE do not have frank defects in these pathways and there is as yet no evidence that certain alleles predispose to greater risk. These studies are akin to and confirm prior reverse genetic studies performed in mouse models in that the defects ablated gene function and emphasize the importance of the innate interferon response pathways in preventing serious CNS infection <xref rid="pone.0092342-Cantin1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0092342-Halford1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>.</p><p>A forward approach in a genetically more diverse human GRP examined frequency of herpes labialis (cold sores) and mapped frequent recurrent disease to a locus on human Chr 21, which is homologous to part of mouse Chr 16.

The list was filtered down to a list of 63 candidates using factors such as the LRS value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092342-g007">fig. 7</xref> bottom panel), known gene functions, known transcription levels in neural tissues and eyes (from Affymetrix and Illumina array and RNAseq databases in Genenetwork.org) as well as the density of SNPs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092342.s001">Table S1</xref>).

For these reasons <italic>Grik1</italic> is a top candidate gene for regulation of percent mortality (neuroinvasion) and severity of stromal keratitis. GluR5 is a ligand (glutamate) binding component of a kainate receptor that is involved in a large array of nervous system phenotypes such as complex behaviors and cocaine addiction (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0092342-Piers1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>) including some previously associated with HSV infection such as schizophrenia <xref rid="pone.0092342-ConejeroGoldberg1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092342-Rantakallio1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>.

One potential mechanism is a host function that regulates the efficiency of the virus to transport in axons in the anterograde direction from neuron cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglia to the brain (i.e. percent mortality) or cornea (HSK severity) and possibly to the mucocutaneous region around the mouth in humans (cold sore frequency, <xref rid="pone.0092342-Kriesel1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>). Further studies may clarify whether the locus identified on mouse Chr 16 and/or the human Chr 21 is associated with an increased risk of HSK in humans. Finally, our studies have revealed BXD lines relatively resistant to HSE that are either highly susceptible, or highly resistant to the development of HSK. By analyzing the infectious disease dynamics in these selected strains using powerful omics approaches, it should be practical now to identify molecular networks and biomarkers associated with high risk for the formation of severe HSK.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0092342.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p><bold>Shown are the known and predicted genes under and near the Chr 16 QTL for percent mortality detailed in</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092342-g007"><bold>figure 7</bold></xref><bold>.</bold> Genes within the QTL are highlited in light blue (entries 7 to 70).
