We have used a Cre/loxP-based strategy to identify <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements that control this replication-timing program on individual human chromosomes. In this report, we show that rearrangements at a complex locus at chromosome 15q24.3 result in delayed replication and structural instability of human chromosome 15. Characterization of this locus identified long, RNA transcripts that are retained in the nucleus and form a &#x0201c;cloud&#x0201d; on one homolog of chromosome 15. We also found that this locus displays asynchronous replication that is coordinated with other random monoallelic genes on chromosome 15. We have named this locus <underline>AS</underline>ynchronous replication and <underline>A</underline>utosomal <underline>R</underline>NA on chromosome <underline>15</underline>, or <italic>ASAR15</italic>. Previously, we found that disruption of the <italic>ASAR6</italic> lincRNA gene results in delayed replication, delayed mitotic condensation and structural instability of human chromosome 6. Previous studies in the mouse found that deletion of the <italic>Xist</italic> gene, from the X chromosome in adult somatic cells, results in a delayed replication and instability phenotype that is indistinguishable from the phenotype caused by disruption of either <italic>ASAR6</italic> or <italic>ASAR15</italic>. In addition, delayed replication and chromosome instability were detected following structural rearrangement of many different human or mouse chromosomes. These observations suggest that all mammalian chromosomes contain similar <italic>cis</italic>-acting loci. Thus, under this scenario, all mammalian chromosomes contain four distinct types of essential cis-acting elements: origins, telomeres, centromeres and &#x0201c;inactivation/stability centers&#x0201d;, all functioning to promote proper replication, segregation and structural stability of each chromosome.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Mammalian cells replicate their DNA along each chromosome during a precise temporal replication program. In this report, we used a novel &#x0201c;chromosome-engineering&#x0201d; strategy to identify a DNA element that controls this replication-timing program of human chromosome 15. Characterization of this element indicated that it encodes large non-protein-coding RNAs that are retained in the nucleus and form a &#x0201c;cloud&#x0201d; on one copy of chromosome 15. Previously, we found that structural rearrangements of a similar element on human chromosome 6 causes delayed replication and structural instability of chromosome 6. Mammalian chromosomes are known to contain three distinct types of essential DNA elements that promote proper chromosome function. Thus, every chromosome contains: 1) origins of replication, which are responsible for proper initiation of DNA synthesis; 2) centromeres, which are responsible for proper chromosome separation during cell division; and 3) telomeres, which are responsible for replication and protection of the ends of linear chromosomes. Our work supports a model in which all mammalian chromosomes contain a fourth type of essential DNA element, the &#x0201c;inactivation/stability center&#x0201d;, which is responsible for proper DNA replication timing and structural stability of each chromosome.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>MJT was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, CA104693 and CA131967.

The phenomenon of &#x0201c;chromosome pulverization&#x0201d; was first described in human cells, where infection with the measles virus causes a severe fragmentation that gives the appearance that the chromosomes have been &#x0201c;pulverized&#x0201d; <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Nichols1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Nichols2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Subsequently, abnormal chromosome condensation was shown to occur when viruses cause mitotic cells to fuse with interphase cells <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This <underline>p</underline>remature <underline>c</underline>hromosome <underline>c</underline>ondensation (PCC) phenotype was found to affect one of the two complete sets of chromosomes present in heterokaryons when mitotic cells are fused with other cells in different phases of the cell cycle. The PCC is most dramatic when S-phase cells were fused to mitotic cells, suggesting that condensation of partially replicated chromosomes causes the pulverized appearance <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Sperling1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In contrast, a morphologically similar abnormal chromosome condensation phenotype was observed on one or a few chromosomes during mitoses of cancer cell lines <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Kato1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004923-zurHausen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, primary tumor cells <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and in cells exposed to mitotic spindle poisons <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Stubblefield1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004923-Crasta1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> or DNA damage <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Ikeuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004923-Breger1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Moreover, we found that certain tumor-derived rearranged chromosomes exhibit a <underline>d</underline>elay in <underline>r</underline>eplication <underline>t</underline>iming (DRT), which is characterized by a&#x0003e;2 hour delay in the initiation and completion of DNA synthesis along the entire length of the chromosome <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Chromosomes with DRT also display a <underline>d</underline>elay in <underline>m</underline>itotic chromosome <underline>c</underline>ondensation (DMC), which is characterized by an under-condensed appearance and a concomitant delay in phosphorylation of serine 10 of histone H3 <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. DRT/DMC chromosomes were also detected in 5 of 7 tumor cell lines and in 5 of 13 primary tumor samples, indicating that DRT/DMC is common in human cancer cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1004923-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Subsequently, we found that chromosomes with DRT/DMC are present in as many as 25% of cells surviving exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), and that IR induced DRT/DMC on mouse chromosomes can persist for up to 2 years <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1004923-Breger1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Importantly, DRT/DMC occurred predominantly on chromosome translocations, estimated to be &#x0223c;5% of all translocations induced by IR, indicating that structural rearrangement is responsible for the DRT/DMC phenotype <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Breger1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>We have developed a chromosome engineering system that allows for the systematic analysis of chromosomes with DRT/DMC <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Breger1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004923-Stoffregen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Our strategy is based on the Cre/loxP system to generate precise chromosomal rearrangements. Using this system we previously identified five balanced translocations, affecting eight different autosomes, each displaying DRT/DMC on at least one of the two derivative chromosomes <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Breger2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Subsequently, we found that translocations or deletions at a discrete <italic>cis</italic>-acting locus on human chromosome 6 result in DRT/DMC. Characterization of this locus identified a large intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) gene, which we named <underline>AS</underline>ynchronous replication and <underline>A</underline>utosomal <underline>R</underline>NA on chromosome <underline>6,</underline> or <italic>ASAR6</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1004923-Stoffregen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The <italic>ASAR6</italic> gene displays random monoallelic expression, and as the name implies displays asynchronous replication that is coordinated with other monoallelic genes on chromosome 6 <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Donley1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Stoffregen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

In addition, disruption of the expressed allele of <italic>ASAR6</italic> results in transcriptional activation of previously silent alleles of other monoallelic genes on chromosome 6 <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Stoffregen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>In the current report we show the characterization of a <italic>cis</italic>-acting locus present at the breakpoint of a second balanced translocation identified in our original screen for DRT/DMC chromosomes <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Breger2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.

Because Cre/loxP is relatively inefficient at mediating inter-chromosomal events, we are using reconstitution of a selectable marker to isolate the cells that undergo Cre-mediated recombination (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).

Using a similar strategy we next determined if deletions in either chromosome 15 or 16 could cause DRT/DMC in the P268 cell line. For this analysis we used a random Lentiviral integration approach to introduce new loxP cassettes into P268 cells. The rationale behind this set of experiments is based on previous studies showing that intra-chromosomal Cre events are more efficient than inter-chromosomal Cre events <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Mills1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Thus, expression of Cre in pools of Lentiviral infected cells reconstitutes <italic>Aprt</italic> at a higher efficiency in cells containing Lentiviral integrations near the original loxP cassettes, and depending on the orientation of the newly integrated cassettes either deletions or inversions are generated following Cre transient expression <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Stoffregen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Using this random integration approach we generated 14 different deletions in chromosome 15, and 9 different deletions in chromosome 16 (in &#x00394;268 clones). Note that this approach resulted in nested deletions anchored at the original loxP cassettes in both chromosomes 15 and 16 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g001">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004923-t001">Table 1</xref>).

The AP-loxP cassette is at position 54,407,235 base pairs of chromosome 16, and the loxP-RT cassette is at position 76,858,743 base pairs of chromosome 15 (NCBI Build 37/hg19). Subsequent analysis indicated that deletions in chromosome 15 displayed DRT/DMC (see below), while deletions in chromosome 16 did not. Therefore, we have concentrated on the chromosome 15 loxP-RT integration site in this report. In addition, because our random loxP integration approach generates deletions in only one direction (e.g. distal on chromosome 15; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>), we also modified the original loxP-RT integration site so that deletions could be generated proximal to the original loxP cassette (see <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Stoffregen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> for details). Finally, we also characterized three different inversions in chromosome 15, which were generated by Lentiviral integrations of the loxP cassettes in the opposite orientation with respect to the original loxP-RT cassette integration site (see <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Mills1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>).</p><p>We characterized the Cre-dependent rearrangements in chromosome 15 at the genetic level using multiple independent assays, including: Southern blot hybridizations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004923.s001">S1 Fig.</xref>); PCR designed to span the genome-loxP-RT cassette junctions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004923.s002">S2A Fig. and B</xref>); LAM-PCR <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Harkey1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> to identify the Lentiviral 5&#x02032;-LTR integration sites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004923-t001">Table 1</xref>; see <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Stoffregen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>); PCR designed to span the Lentiviral-genome junctions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004923.s002">S2C Fig.</xref>); SNP analysis for loss of heterozygosity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004923.s002">S2D Fig.</xref>); and DNA FISH using BACs or fosmids located within the deleted or inverted regions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g001">Figs. 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g002">2D&#x02013;G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g003">3B&#x02013;C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g004">4A&#x02013;C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004923.s003">S3A and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004923.s006">S6A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004923.s008">S8B and D Figs.</xref>). The largest deletion distal to the original loxP-RT cassette was &#x0223c;12.8 megabases (mb), and the smallest distal deletion was only &#x0223c;2 kilobases (kb) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004923-t001">Table 1</xref>). The deletions proximal to the loxP-RT integration site did not cause DRT/DMC, and therefore were characterized genetically for loss of heterozygosity and with DNA FISH with a BAC from the deleted region (CTD-2117F7; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>), which allowed us to only determine the approximate sizes of the proximal deletions. Thus, the largest proximal deletion was &#x0223c;18 mb, and we characterized two different relatively small, &#x0223c;67&#x02013;126 kb, proximal deletions.

We previously used a &#x0201c;Luria-Delbruck fluctuation analysis&#x0201d; to characterize the instability associated with engineered chromosomes with DRT/DMC, and found that the t (15;16) generated in the P268 cell line results in an &#x0223c;80 fold increase in the rate of structural rearrangement of the affected chromosome <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Breger2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In addition, once the DRT/DMC chromosomes become extensively rearranged they no longer display DRT/DMC <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Breger2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Not surprisingly, the cells with DRT/DMC on chromosome 15, described in this report, acquired extensively rearranged chromosome 15 s and eventually lost the DRT/DMC phenotype during continued expansion in culture. Another complication in the analysis of DRT/DMC chromosomes is that they often experience non-disjunction events, resulting in cells that have either lost or gained the DRT/DMC chromosomes <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Furthermore, cells containing DRT/DMC chromosomes also experience endoreduplication at an increased frequency, resulting in an increase in the ploidy of the affected cells <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Consequently, during the characterization of the Cre/loxP-mediated rearrangements in chromosome 15, we observed additional copies of the Cre/loxP-rearranged chromosomes, and an increase in the ploidy of the cells with DRT/DMC chromosomes (see below).</p><p>To overcome the genome instability complications associated with DRT/DMC we employed a two-step process to characterize the stability and replication timing of the Cre/loxP-mediated rearrangements. First, we assayed low passage cultures for each clone, typically &#x02264;5 passages, which limited the number of generations each clone was expanded through prior to the analysis. Second, we assayed each clone for rearrangements in chromosome 15 using DNA FISH with a <underline>w</underline>hole-<underline>c</underline>hromosome-<underline>p</underline>aint (WCP) as probe, which allowed us to determine the frequency of secondary rearrangements in chromosome 15, and to identify clones with intact chromosome 15 s for detailed replication timing assays (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004923.s012">S1 Table</xref>).</p><p>An example of secondary rearrangements in chromosome 15 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>. Mitotic spreads from &#x00394;268-4f cells, which contain an &#x0223c;135 kb Cre/loxP-mediated distal deletion, were processed for DNA FISH using a chromosome 15 WCP. The chromosome 15 WCP detected 8 inter-chromosomal translocations involving chromosome 15 in this cell. In addition, the chromosome 15 WCP detected 4 non-rearranged chromosome 15s, indicating that this cell contained multiple copies of chromosome 15. Scoring additional metaphase cells with this WCP indicated that 25/50 (50%) cells in this clone contained structural rearrangements of chromosome 15, and the majority of the cells were also polyploid. Similar structural rearrangements affecting chromosome 15 were detected in clones containing Cre/loxP-mediated distal deletions&#x02265;124 kb (see below and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004923.s012">S1 Table</xref>). In contrast, a similar DNA FISH analysis of two clones containing an &#x0223c;2 kb distal deletion did not reveal any new chromosome rearrangements involving chromosome 15, with 200 metaphase cells examined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004923.s012">S1 Table</xref>). Finally, an analysis of four independent sub-clones (generated by transfecting an <italic>Aprt</italic> expression vector, selection for Aprt+ cells, and clonal expansion) from parental P268 cells did not reveal any new rearrangements affecting chromosome 15 in any sub-clone, with 400 metaphase cells analyzed (<xref rid="pgen.1004923-Breger2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>; and see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004923.s012">S1 Table</xref>). This analysis indicates that transfection, selection for Aprt expression, and clonal expansion did not lead to structural instability of chromosome 15 in P268 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Deletions and inversions in chromosome 15 cause DRT/DMC</title><p>We next assayed replication timing of the chromosome 15 s in clones containing the various Cre/loxP-mediated rearrangements using a BrdU incorporation assay in combination with DNA FISH (see <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Smith2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>). One critical component of this replication assay is the timing of the BrdU pulse. We used two different &#x0201c;terminal label&#x0201d; pulses of BrdU prior to mitotic harvest (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). The shorter pulse, 4.5 hours, detected extremely late replication, essentially DNA synthesis during the G2 phase. This relatively short pulse of BrdU detects DNA synthesis on DRT/DMC chromosomes, but not on non-DRT/DMC chromosomes, as non-DRT/DMC chromosomes have finished replication prior to the pulse. The longer pulse, 6 hours, detects DNA synthesis during G2, but also detects the latest replicating DNA of non-DRT/DMC chromosomes at the end of S phase (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). This longer pulse of BrdU allows us to compare differences in BrdU banding patterns between homologous chromosomes within the same cell, which allows for an estimate of the length of the delay, and allows for a quantitative assessment of replication timing differences between homologous chromosomes (see <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Smith2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>).</p><p>We carried out two independent replication-timing assays on the clones characterized in this report. The first assay involved BrdU incorporation combined with DNA FISH with a chromosome 15 WCP as probe. This BrdU-WCP assay allowed us to assess replication timing of every chromosome 15 within a given cell, including any secondary rearrangements involving chromosome 15. The second assay combined BrdU incorporation with DNA FISH using a chromosome 15 centromeric probe plus BACs located within the Cre/loxP-deletions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). This BrdU-BAC assay allowed us to distinguish between the deleted and non-deleted chromosomes. However, the BrdU-BAC assay was not informative in cells with highly rearranged chromosome 15 s, as the secondary rearrangements did not always hybridize to the chromosome 15 probes.</p><p>An example of the BrdU-WCP assay in cells with an &#x0223c;135 kb distal deletion is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>. Cells from clone &#x00394;268-4f were exposed to BrdU for 4.5 hours, harvested for mitotic cells, and processed for BrdU incorporation and DNA FISH with a chromosome 15 WCP. This mitotic cell was chosen to illustrate several points: 1) a single chromosome displays extremely late replication, the only detectable BrdU incorporation in this cell was in a derivative chromosome 15; 2) this cell contains 2 different chromosome 15 rearrangements, indicating that secondary rearrangements have already occurred on chromosome 15; and 3) the delayed replication on the chromosome 15 derivative also occurred on the translocated DNA from an unknown chromosome. These observations illustrate how an initial &#x0223c;135 kb deletion event can induce DRT/DMC, which subsequently causes structural instability of the affected chromosome, and that delayed replication can subsequently occur on the translocated DNA from a second chromosome.</p><p>An example of the BrdU-BAC assay on a second independent clone containing the &#x0223c;135 kb distal deletion is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g002">Fig. 2D&#x02013;G</xref>. For this analysis, &#x00394;268-4c cells were exposed to BrdU for 4.5 hours, harvested for mitotic cells, processed for BrdU incorporation and subjected to DNA FISH using a chromosome 15 centromeric probe plus a BAC from the deleted region. The FISH signal from the centromeric probe allowed us to identify the chromosome 15 s, and the presence or absence of the BAC allowed us to distinguish between the non-deleted and deleted chromosomes, respectively. The only two chromosomes showing any detectable BrdU incorporation in this cell hybridized to the chromosome 15 centromeric probe but not to the BAC from the deleted region, indicating that the two chromosomes with DRT/DMC represent deleted 15 s. In addition, DNA synthesis was detected on both arms of the deleted chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g002">Fig. 2D&#x02013;G</xref>), indicating that the affects of the &#x0223c;135 kb deletion extend across the centromere. Also note that two other non-deleted chromosome 15 s, which hybridized to both the centromeric and BAC probes, did not retain any detectable BrdU incorporation, indicating that the non-deleted 15 s had finished replication prior to the BrdU exposure.</p><p>Another example of structural instability and DRT/DMC on chromosome 15 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g003">Fig. 3</xref>. Mitotic spreads from &#x00394;268-5d cells, which contain one of our larger distal deletions (&#x0223c;5.6 mb), were processed for DNA FISH using a chromosome 15 WCP. This probe detected 12 rearrangements involving chromosome 15 in this cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Scoring multiple cells with the WCP indicated that&#x0003e;95% of the cells in this clone contained numerous secondary rearrangements of chromosome 15, and the majority of the cells were polyploid. Due to the high frequency of secondary rearrangements the replication timing assays were not performed in this clone. However, we did detect DRT/DMC in a second independent clone containing the same &#x0223c;5.6 mb deletion. &#x00394;268-5c cells were exposed to BrdU for 4.5 hours, harvested for mitotic cells, processed for BrdU incorporation, and analyzed by DNA FISH using a chromosome 15 centromeric probe plus a BAC from the deleted region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g003">Fig. 3B and C</xref>). Note the extreme level of &#x02018;pulverization&#x02019; and &#x02018;G2 DNA synthesis&#x02019; on two chromosomes that hybridized to the chromosome 15 centromeric probe. Also note the complete lack of BrdU incorporation in every other chromosome within this cell.</p><p>The delayed replication timing and pulverized appearance of the Cre/loxP-mediated deleted chromosomes shown above represent extreme examples of the DRT/DMC phenotype. However, this extreme level of delayed replication and condensation was detected in &#x02264;5% of the mitotic cells in any given clone. Therefore, to determine if the cells that don&#x02032;t display an extreme phenotype, yet retain intact chromosome 15 s, also display delayed replication we used the longer pulse of BrdU during the replication-timing assay (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). The 6-hour pulse of BrdU allowed us to detect late DNA synthesis on DRT/DMC and non-DRT/DMC chromosomes and to directly compare the replication timing of the deleted and non-deleted chromosomes within the same cells. An example of this analysis is shown for clone &#x00394;268-4 g, which contains an &#x0223c;161 kb distal deletion. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g004">Fig. 4A-E</xref> shows this analysis for a cell with three copies of chromosome 15, one with the Cre/loxP-mediated deletion and 2 without. Note that the deleted 15 contains a more extensive BrdU banding pattern than either non-deleted 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). Comparing the BrdU banding pattern of the deleted 15 s to the pattern of non-deleted 15 s in multiple cells indicated that the replication timing of the deleted 15 s is delayed by&#x02265;2 hours. In addition, quantification of the BrdU incorporation indicated that the deleted 15 s were delayed in their replication timing in all seven cells analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>). Furthermore, DNA FISH analysis with a chromosome 15 WCP as probe on a second clone containing the same &#x0223c;161 kb deletion, detected numerous secondary rearrangements of chromosome 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g004">Fig. 4G</xref>), indicating that the &#x0223c;161 kb deletion also results in secondary rearrangements of chromosome 15. In contrast, cells containing the &#x0223c;124 kb distal deletion displayed a high degree of variability in BrdU incorporation in chromosome 15 s containing the &#x0223c;124 kb deletion. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004923.s003">S3 Fig.</xref> shows this analysis for cells from clone &#x00394;26818a, and indicates that certain cells in the population displayed a high degree of replication asynchrony between the deleted and non-deleted 15 s (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004923.s003">S3A, B, and E Fig.</xref>), while other cells showed very little if any asynchrony (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004923.s003">S3C, D, and E Fig.</xref>). Therefore, the &#x0223c;124 kb deletion results in variable expression of the DRT phenotype.</p><p>In contrast, similar DNA FISH and replication timing assays on parental P268 cells and in cells containing an &#x0223c;2 kb distal deletion indicated that the chromosome 15 s were structurally stable and replicated synchronously (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004923.s004">Figs.

Furthermore, the Cre/loxP-mediated deletions proximal to the original loxP-RT integration site, including two different deletions of &#x0223c;66&#x02013;127 kb and an &#x0223c;18 mb deletion (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004923-t001">Table 1</xref>), did not cause delayed replication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004923.s006">S6 Fig.</xref>).</p><p>While there is some variability in the replication timing between deleted and non-deleted chromosome 15 s in cells with deletions&#x02265;124 kb distal to the original loxP integration site, we did detect delayed replication timing and chromosome structure instability in clones from all of the distal deletions&#x02265;124 kb (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004923-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004923.s012">S1 Table</xref>).

Therefore, the distal deletions define a relatively small critical region, &#x0223c;122 kb (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>), that when deleted results in delayed replication timing and instability of chromosome 15.</p><fig id="pgen-1004923-g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1004923.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Differential allelic expression of <italic>ASAR15</italic>.</title><p>A) A schematic diagram of <italic>SCAPER</italic>, <italic>MIR3713</italic>, RNA FISH probes, and five of the distal deletions in chromosome 15.

Because the smallest deletion that results in DRT/DMC on chromosome 15 is located entirely within the large protein-coding gene <italic>SCAPER</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>), we used multiple probes from within the <italic>SCAPER</italic> coding region (spanning &#x0223c;560 kb of genomic DNA) to detect RNA, plus either a chromosome 15 centromeric probe, BACs from nearby, or a chromosome 15 paint to detect the DNA. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g005">Fig. 5B&#x02013;D</xref> shows an example of this analysis for parental HTD114 cells using a probe from within the deleted region (E4) to detect RNA, plus a chromosome 15 centromeric probe to detect the DNA. Note the large &#x0201c;cloud&#x0201d; of RNA detected on one copy of chromosome 15. An example of RNA-DNA FISH in P268 cells using the H1 probe to detect RNA is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g005">Fig. 5E&#x02013;G</xref>. Note that these two cells are tetraploid for chromosome 15 and that the H1 probe detects RNA expressed from only one or two of the chromosome 15 s. We also note that the size of the RNA hybridization signals detected by these probes was variable, ranging form large &#x0201c;clouds&#x0201d; to relatively small pinpoint sites of hybridization (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g005">Fig. 5B&#x02013;G</xref>). In addition, we detected similar RNA hybridization signals using the D1, H3, F5, C5, and C4 probes, and hybridization was detected on &#x0223c;50% of the chromosome 15 s in P268 cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Therefore, the D1, H3, H1, F5, E4, C5 and C4 probes, spanning &#x0223c;370 kb of genomic DNA, detect transcripts that are retained within the nucleus and are localized to one of the chromosome 15 homologs. In addition, to determine if the large clouds of RNA detected from within <italic>SCAPER</italic> are physically localilzed to chromosome 15 we carried out RNA-DNA FISH using a pool of fosmids (D1, H3, H1, F5, E4, C5 and C4) to detect RNA plus a chromosome 15 paint to detect DNA. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g005">Fig. 5H&#x02013;M</xref> shows a panel of cells with large RNA signals that is localized to single chromosome 15 territories within the nuclei. We detected chromosome-sized RNA FISH signals in 82% (89/108) of P268 cells using this pool of fosmid probes.</p><p>In contrast to the D1, H3, H1, F5, E4, C5 and C4 probes, we were not able to detect RNA using the F8 or A4 probes in either HTD114 or P268 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g005">Fig. 5A</xref> and see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004923.s008">S8 Fig.</xref>). Thus, even though the F8 and A4 probes are within <italic>SCAPER,</italic> and are capable of detecting DNA as efficiently as the E4 probe using DNA FISH on metaphase chromosomes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004923.s008">S8 Fig.</xref>), they were not able to detect expression of RNA in HTD114 or P268 cells. However, we did detect low-level expression of the 5&#x02032; region of properly spliced <italic>SCAPER</italic> mRNA using RT-PCR (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004923.s011">S11 Fig.</xref>). Therefore, the 5&#x02032; region of <italic>SCAPER</italic> distal to the C4 probe (&#x0223c;150 kb) is expressed, but not at high enough levels to be detected by RNA FISH using the F8 or A4 probes.</p><p>Next, to determine if similar clouds of transcripts are present in human primary cells we used RNA-DNA FISH on human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g005">Fig. 5N&#x02013;P</xref> shows an example of this analysis using the E4 probe to detect RNA, plus a BAC to detect the DNA from this locus. The E4 probe detected a single large RNA signal on one chromosome 15 in &#x0223c;76% (41/54) of cells, or on both copies of chromosome 15 in &#x0223c;24% (13/54) of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g005">Fig. 5H&#x02013;J</xref>). Similar results were obtained with the D1, H3, H1, F5, C5 and C4 probes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>. In contrast, but similar to HTD114 and P268 cells, the F8 and A4 probes failed to detect RNA in HFFs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). In addition, to directly compare the size and appearance of the RNA signal detected from within <italic>SCAPER</italic> to XIST RNA on the inactive X chromosome we analyzed expression of the chromosome 15 locus plus XIST simultaneously in female primary dermal fibroblasts HDFs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g005">Figs. 5Q</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004923.s009">S9E and S9F</xref> show RNA detected by the H3 probe in relation to RNA detected by the <italic>XIST</italic> probe.

Furthermore, analysis of RNA-seq data, generated by the Encode Project, indicated that RNA expressed from the critical region for DRT/DMC, defined above, is enriched in the nuclear Poly A minus fraction in HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004923.s010">S10 Fig.</xref>). We previously found that ASAR6 RNA is present in the Poly A minus fraction and does not contain introns yet is transcribed by RNA Polymerase II <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Donley1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Therefore, to determine if the RNA produced from within the critical region of <italic>SCAPER</italic> is the product of RNA Polymerase II, we analyzed expression of RNA in cells treated with &#x003b1;-amanitin, which is a selective inhibitor of RNA Polymerase II <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Meihlac1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, using a semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004923.s011">S11 Fig.</xref> shows the results of this analysis, and indicates that the RNA derived from the critical region is indeed sensitive to &#x003b1;-amanitin. Similarly, RNA expressed from the protein-coding gene <italic>P300</italic> is also sensitive to &#x003b1;-amanitin treatment. We also detected properly spliced SCAPER mRNA and found that it was also sensitive to &#x003b1;-amanitin treatment. In contrast, expression of 45S RNA (an RNA Polymerase I product) and a tRNA gene (an RNA Polymerase III product) were not inhibited by &#x003b1;-amanitin. We conclude that the RNA produced from the critical region for DRT/DMC is generated by RNA Polymerase II. In addition, this analysis indicated that the half-life of the RNA from within SCAPER introns 21, 23, and 24 is similar to the half-life of ASAR6 RNA, which is approximately 5 hours. In addition, the half-life of these intronic RNAs is much longer than the half-life of properly spliced P300 or SCAPER mRNAs (&#x0223c;2 hours), which are spliced, polyadenylated, RNA Polymerase II products.</p><p>Taken together, our observations indicate that RNA transcripts from an &#x0223c;370 kb region from within the <italic>SCAPER</italic> gene are retained within the nucleus, and can be detected as chromosome sized clouds of RNA localized to either one homolog of human chromosome 15 in human cell lines and in primary skin fibroblasts. However, whether these transcripts represent transcription initiating within <italic>SCAPER</italic>, or represent transcripts that are processed from the larger <italic>SCAPER</italic> primary transcript and preferentially retained on chromosome 15 is currently not known. Regardless, because the locus that encodes these transcripts also displays asynchronous replication (see below), we have named these transcripts <underline>AS</underline>ynchronous replication and <underline>A</underline>utosomal <underline>R</underline>NA on chromosome <underline>15</underline>, or ASAR15.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Disruption of the expressed allele of <italic>ASAR15</italic> results in DRT/DMC</title><p>Previous studies indicate that disruption of the expressed alleles of either <italic>Xist</italic> or <italic>ASAR6</italic> result in extremely late replication and structural instability of their respective chromosomes <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Stoffregen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004923-DiazPerez1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Therefore, to determine if the deletions that cause DRT/DMC and instability on chromosome 15 occurred on the chromosome retaining ASAR15 RNA we utilized an RNA-DNA FISH assay that allowed us to distinguish between the deleted and non-deleted chromosomes. For this analysis we used a probe from within the deletion (E4) plus a probe from outside the deletion (H1) simultaneously to detect RNA in cells containing the &#x0223c;161 kb distal deletion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Thus, if the deletion occurred on the silent copy of chromosome 15, the H1 and E4 probes would detect ASAR15 RNA concomitantly. In contrast, if the deletion occurred on the expressed allele, the E4 probe would not detect RNA from the deleted 15, but the H1 probe would still detect RNA expressed from the deleted chromosome. First, to determine if the H1 and E4 probes detect the same sites of expression in non-deleted cells, we assayed expression of RNA in P268 cells using both probes simultaneously. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g006">Fig. 6A</xref> shows examples of this analysis and indicates that both probes detected RNA from the same chromosome 15.

We detected simultaneous expression with the H1 and E4 probes in 100% (50/50) of P268 cells.

In addition, because the H1 probe detected expression from the deleted chromosome, the &#x0223c;161 kb deletion did not disrupt expression nor retention of transcripts proximal to the original loxP-RT integration site (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Finally, because the E4 probe detected RNA in some of the cells in &#x00394;268-4 g (cell #2 and #3), some of the &#x00394;268-4 g cells retain an intact copy plus a deleted copy of the expressed allele of <italic>ASAR15</italic>, which was not surprising as the cells that still express RNA detected by the E4 probe were tetraploid for chromosome 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Regardless, these observations indicate that <italic>ASAR15</italic> RNA is present on one chromosome 15 homolog in P268 cells, and that the Cre/loxP rearrangements that cause DRT/DMC occurred on the chromosome 15 that retained ASAR15 RNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Asynchronous replication</title><p>Because all monoallelic genes display asynchronous replication between alleles (reviewed in <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Goldmit1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>), we next tested whether the locus that encodes ASAR15 RNA also displays asynchronous replication. For this analysis we used a DNA FISH based assay <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Selig1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> to determine the extent of asynchronous replication on chromosome 15.

Therefore, we next determined if the asynchronous replication of <italic>ASAR15</italic> is coordinated with other monoallelic loci on chromosome 15. For this analysis we used a two-color DNA FISH assay to determine the SD pattern for two loci simultaneously. We used a probe representing <italic>ASAR15</italic> in combination with BAC probes for <italic>MYO1E, PTPN9</italic>, and <italic>PEAK1</italic> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004923-t002">Table 2</xref>). This analysis indicated that the asynchronous replication of <italic>ASAR15</italic> was coordinated in <italic>cis</italic> with <italic>MYO1E</italic> (72/100 cells, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;1&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>), <italic>PTPN9</italic> (71/100 cells <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;1&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>), and <italic>PEAK1</italic> (74/100 cells, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;1&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>).</p><p>One limitation of the DNA FISH assay described above is that probes on the same chromosome that are&#x0003e;50 mb apart are difficult to score, as the hybridization signals coming from one homolog may be closer to hybridization signals coming form the other homolog. To overcome this limitation, we utilized a second replication-timing assay known as <underline>Re</underline>plication <underline>Ti</underline>ming-<underline>S</underline>pecific <underline>H</underline>ybridization, or ReTiSH <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Schlesinger1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The ReTiSH assay involves BrdU incorporation for different times followed by the analysis of metaphase chromosomes using a modification of the <underline>C</underline>hromosome <underline>O</underline>rientation-<underline>F</underline>luorescence <underline>I</underline>n <underline>S</underline>itu <underline>H</underline>ybridization (CO-FISH) assay <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Goodwin1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. CO-FISH involves the conversion of BrdU incorporated chromosomal DNA into single stranded DNA followed by hybridization with specific probes without further denaturation of the chromosomal DNA. Because metaphase spreads are analyzed for hybridization signals along individual chromosomes, the distance between the loci is not a limitation of the ReTiSH assay <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Schlesinger1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In order to assay asynchronous loci along the length of chromosome 15 we used probes for <italic>ASAR15</italic> (15q24), the rDNA cluster (15p11), and MYO1E (15q22). The rDNA clusters are located on five different human chromosomes (13, 14, 15, 21 and 22), and were recently shown to display random asynchronous replication <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Schlesinger1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Hybridization of the rDNA probe to chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22 also served as an internal control for asynchronous replication on multiple chromosomes detected simultaneously by the ReTiSH assay. This assay also included a chromosome 15 centromeric probe, which allowed for the unambiguous identification of the chromosome 15 s. Centromeric heterochromatin is known to be late replicating, and the ReTiSH assay detects hybridization of centromeric probes to both homologs at both time points <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Schlesinger1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. For this analysis we exposed human primary blood lymphocytes (PBLs) to BrdU for either 14 or 6 hours and then processed the cells for ReTiSH. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g007">Fig. 7A&#x02013;C</xref> shows that the rDNA probe hybridized to both homologs of chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22, at the 14 hour time point, but hybridization to single homologs of these same chromosomes at the 6 hour time point. Therefore, our ReTiSH assay detected asynchronous replication of the rDNA clusters on all five chromosomes. We detected hybridization of the rDNA probe to both copies of chromosome 15 in 100% (50/50) of cells at the 14 hour time point, and to a single copy of chromosome 15 in 100% (50/50) of cells at the 6 hour time point, which is consistent with previous observations that the rDNA cluster on chromosome 15 displays asynchronous replication <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Schlesinger1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Similarly, we found two sites of hybridization for <italic>ASAR15</italic> or <italic>MYO1E</italic> at the 14 hour time point (50/50 cells for both probes), and single sites of hybridization for <italic>ASAR15</italic> (47/50 cells), or <italic>MYO1E</italic> (47/50 cells) at the 6 hour time point, indicating asynchronous replication at both loci. Next, we used a two-color hybridization scheme to simultaneously detect <italic>ASAR15</italic> plus rDNA or <italic>MYO1E</italic>. We found that the asynchronous replication of <italic>ASAR15</italic> was coordinated in <italic>cis</italic> with the rDNA cluster on chromosome 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>; 44/50 cells, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;1&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>), and with the <italic>MYO1E</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004923-g007">Fig. 7E</xref>; 43/50 cells, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;1&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>).

We have found that disruption of the expressed alleles of either <italic>ASAR6</italic> or <italic>ASAR15</italic> results in DRT/DMC and structural instability of their respective chromosomes (<xref rid="pgen.1004923-Donley1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Stoffregen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>; and see above]. Whether or not the transcriptionally silent alleles of <italic>ASAR6</italic> or <italic>ASAR15</italic> control replication timing of their respective chromosomes is currently not known. Furthermore, ASAR15 RNA could be detected as a chromosome-sized cloud of RNA in human cell lines and in primary skin fibroblasts. In contrast, <italic>ASAR6</italic> RNA does not form large clouds on chromosome 6 in clonal cell lines nor in primary blood lymphocytes <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Donley1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Stoffregen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Therefore, the significance of the presence or absence of large clouds of RNA expressed from <italic>ASAR15</italic> or <italic>ASAR6</italic> remains an open question.</p><p>One complication in the analysis of chromosomes with DRT/DMC is the dramatic genomic instability that occurs in cells with these abnormal chromosomes. There are at least two distinct types of genomic instabilities that have been described in cells with DRT/DMC chromosomes. First, and the best characterized, is <underline>c</underline>hromosome <underline>s</underline>tructure <underline>i</underline>nstability (CSI). The CSI associated with DRT/DMC is characterized by a 30&#x02013;80 fold increase in the rate of chromosome rearrangements affecting the DRT/DMC chromosomes <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Breger2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Because the secondary rearrangements that occur on the DRT/DMC chromosomes are often inter-chromosomal translocations, all of the chromosomes within a cell with DRT/DMC chromosomes can be affected <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Breger2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The second type of genomic instability associated with DRT/DMC is <underline>c</underline>hromosome <underline>in</underline>stability (CIN). There are two distinct manifestations of CIN in cells with DRT/DMC chromosomes. First, DRT/DMC chromosomes activate the spindle assembly checkpoint, are often observed as lagging chromosomes during anaphase, and experience non-disjunction events at an increased frequency resulting in gains and losses of the DRT/DMC chromosomes <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Donley1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Second, cells with DRT/DMC chromosomes also experience failed cytokinesis, which results in endoreduplication and dramatic whole chromosome copy number alterations <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Therefore, the CIN that occurs in cells with DRT/DMC chromosomes can also affect the copy number of non-DRT/DMC chromosomes within the same cell. Therefore, the CSI and CIN observed in cells with DRT/DMC chromosomes affects the stability of the entire genome <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Thayer1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>We previously used IR to generate chromosome rearrangements in mouse and human cells, and found that &#x0223c;5% of inter-chromosomal translocations involving many different autosomes displayed DRT/DMC <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Breger1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In addition, we detected DRT/DMC in primary cells derived from skin fibroblasts, blood lymphocytes, and kidney epithelial cells, indicating that the DRT/DMC phenotype can affect chromosomes present in non-transformed cells from three different tissues. Furthermore, our original chromosome-engineering screen for DRT/DMC chromosomes identified five balanced translocations, affecting eight different autosomes, all displaying DRT/DMC on at least one of the two derivative chromosomes <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Breger2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. We previously characterized one of these balanced translocations in molecular detail and found that disruption of the <italic>ASAR6</italic> gene results in DRT/DMC on chromosome 6 <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Stoffregen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In this report, we characterized a second balanced translocation from this screen and identified a <italic>cis</italic>-acting locus that when disrupted results in DRT/DMC on a second human autosome. Our work, combined with the observation that disruption of <italic>Xist</italic> results in a similar replication and instability phenotype <xref rid="pgen.1004923-DiazPerez1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, suggests that all mammalian chromosomes contain <italic>cis</italic>-acting loci that function to synchronize chromosome-wide replication timing, promote monoallelic gene expression and help maintain structural stability of individual chromosomes <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Thayer1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Donley1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Stoffregen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. We believe that these <italic>cis</italic>-acting loci are as fundamentally important to mammalian chromosome function as telomeres, centromeres, or origins of replication. Therefore, we propose that every mammalian chromosome contains four essential <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements: origins, telomeres, centromeres, and &#x0201c;inactivation/stability centers&#x0201d;, all functioning to ensure proper replication, segregation and stability of each chromosome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture</title><p>The methods for culturing the cells in this study were carried out as previously described <xref rid="pgen.1004923-Donley1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.
