FGF signaling is fundamental in embryonic development as well as in regulation of angiogenesis and wound healing in adults. The FGF family consists of 22 ligands, among them 18 ligands which exert their actions through four highly conserved transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors: FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4. Stimulation of the receptors by ligand binding promotes receptor dimerization and activation of several signaling cascades, including the MAPK and PI3K pathways<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Aberrant activity of FGFRs has been identified in diverse cancer types.

NVP-BGJ398 (BGJ398) is an example of a selective, potent and orally bioavailable inhibitor of FGFR1/2/3 (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">ref. 22</xref>). BGJ398 inhibits the proliferation of various FGFR-dependent cell lines at nanomolar concentrations including lung and breast cancers harboring <italic>FGFR1</italic> amplification, gastric cancers harboring <italic>FGFR2</italic> amplification and bladder cancers with <italic>FGFR3</italic> mutations and/or amplifications<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">While FGFR inhibition shows considerable clinical promise it is expected that patients who initially respond to FGFR inhibitors will become refractory due to the development of acquired resistance<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Previous studies have shown that stimulation of some <italic>FGFR2</italic>- and <italic>FGFR3</italic>-dependent cell lines with the Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) decreases sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors and that concurrent inhibition of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) with pharmacologic inhibitors or RNA interference can potentiate the activity of FGFR inhibitors in some cell lines<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>.

Despite these initial observations, the mechanisms governing the acquisition of resistance to FGFR inhibitors remain poorly understood. Therefore, an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to FGFR inhibitors will likely provide valuable insight into how best to use this class of agents.</p><p id="P7">To study potential mechanisms of acquired resistance to selective FGFR inhibition, we established resistant cells <italic>in vitro</italic> following long-term exposure to BGJ398. We selected the RT112 bladder cancer cell line which harbors both <italic>FGFR3</italic> amplification and a <italic>FGFR3-TACC3</italic> fusion as our initial model. Through screening of the activity of 42 membrane receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and mRNA sequencing, we identified that ERBB2 and ERBB3 are activated in the resistant cells in a ligand dependent fashion. Acquired resistance to FGFR inhibition developed rapidly and was characterized by an Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) along with a switch in dependency from FGFR to ERBB receptor signaling. These results were specific to cell lines with dependency on <italic>FGFR3</italic> and were recapitulated using a second FGFR kinase inhibitor, ponatinib.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Phenotypic changes associated with the acquisition of resistance to the pan-FGFR inhibitor BGJ398 in the RT112 cell line</title><p id="P8">RT112 cells, which harbor both <italic>FGFR3</italic> amplification and the <italic>FGFR3-TACC3</italic> fusion, were rendered resistant to BGJ398 by a series of step-wise increases in drug concentration starting at 4nM (the approximate IC<sub>50</sub>) until the cells were able to proliferate in 1&#x003bc;M BGJ398. We selected this cell line for our studies given its dependence on the <italic>FGFR3</italic> fusion and anecdotal reports of clinical efficacy of FGFR kinase inhibitors in patients with <italic>FGFR3</italic> fusions. These cells were termed BGJ398 RS (BGJ398 Resistant Stepwise). 1&#x003bc;M was selected as the target final concentration as it is the approximate maximal serum concentration observed in animal and Phase I studies of BGJ398. The cell lines were both insensitive to BGJ398 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A</xref>) and a second, less specific, FGFR kinase inhibitor ponatinib (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We noted that the BGJ398 RS cells underwent a morphologic change during their acquisition of resistance to BGJ398 from a densely packed adherent layer of small cells to a spindle-like morphology with loss of intercellular adhesion, increased intercellular separation and increased formation of pseudopodia, suggestive of an EMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B</xref>). EMT has been previously observed in lung cancer in the context of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, prompting us to test whether this transition may also have occurred in our system. We performed real-time PCR analysis of genes previously associated with EMT. We observed that mRNA levels of E-cadherin were downregulated in BGJ398 RS cells and N-cadherin and fibronectin expression were upregulated, consistent with an EMT phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C</xref>) and levels of <italic>PLAU, PLAUR, SNAIL</italic> and <italic>SLUG</italic> were slightly but not significantly increased (data not shown). Immunoblots similarly demonstrated a decrease in the protein levels of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and an increase in the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and fibronectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1D</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Enhanced cellular migration and invasion are other hallmarks of advanced cancer and metastasis<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. We therefore assessed migration and invasion using scratch and matrigel invasion assays. BGJ398 RS cells displayed enhanced migration potential in a scratch assay in the presence or absence of BGJ398 treatment as compared to the parental RT112 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1E</xref>, DMSO treated cells), though the cells still demonstrated some sensitivity to BGJ398 in this assay, suggesting that there is ongoing FGFR-dependent signaling in the resistant state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1E</xref>, BGJ398 treated cells). Similarly, BGJ398 RS demonstrated greater invasion in matrigel coated Boyden chambers as compared to the parental line both in the presence and absence of BGJ398&#x02014;but as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1E</xref>, resistant cells retained some sensitivity to BGJ398 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Activation of ERBB2 and ERBB3 in BGJ398 RS cells</title><p id="P11">We sought to investigate the molecular underpinnings of acquired resistance to BGJ398 in RT112 cells.

We observed that p-MET was undetectable in the BGJ398 resistant cells and total MET levels slightly decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S2</xref>); however, cells resistant to ponatinib demonstrated stability of p-MET and total MET protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S2</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We next queried the activation status of many cancer-related RTKs using a phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array to compare the phosphorylation status of 42 RTKs in RT112 parental cells, RT112 cells treated acutely with BGJ398, and BGJ398 RS cells. We identified two RTKs with increased phosphorylation when comparing the treated and parental lines, ERBB2 and ERBB3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2A</xref>). ERBB2 was increased in RT112 cells treated with BGJ398 in the acute setting (1h) and both ERBB2 and ERBB3 were increased in the final resistant cell populations both in the presence and absence of BGJ398 treatment. Strong phospho-EGFR was maintained in both cell lines and IGF1R was decreased in the resistant line as compared to the parental.</p><p id="P13">To confirm these results, we performed immunoblots on RT112 cells treated with BGJ398 over a 24-hour timecourse. We observed that p-FRS2 and p-FGFR levels decreased with BGJ398 treatment as would be expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2B</xref>). While levels of phopsho- and total EGFR did not change to a substantial degree with BGJ398 treatment, both p-ERBB2 and p-ERBB3 were induced at 12 hours following treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2B</xref>). Similar immunoblots were performed in the BGJ398 RS and ponatinib RS lines; these results are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S3</xref>. Here we noted that p-FRS2 levels were below the limits of detection in the resistant lines and that basal levels of p-ERBB2 and p-ERBB3 were higher in the BGJ398 RS and ponatinib RS lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S3</xref>). p-AKT was also maintained at an increased level of phosphorylation in the resistant lines in the setting of pharmacologic inhibition of FGFRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S3</xref>).</p><p id="P14">As these data suggested that ERBB family members may be activated by treatment with FGFR inhibitors and may be playing a role in acquired resistance, we assessed the dimerization status of ERBB family members in RT112 cells treated with BGJ398.

The immunoprecipitation assays detected a ERBB2/ERBB3 complex when ERBB2 was immunoprecipitated followed by a ERBB3 immunoblot but this finding was not confirmed in the reverse order.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>BGJ398 resistant cell lines are selectively sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and to shRNA-mediated depletion of ERBB2 or ERBB3</title><p id="P15">To determine whether increased ERBB2 and ERBB3 signaling is necessary for acquired resistance to BGJ398, we examined whether ERBB inhibition suppressed growth of the resistant cells using a set of ERBB tyrosine kinase inhibitors. RT112 and BGJ398 resistant cells were exposed to AZD8931 (EGFR, ERBB2 and ERBB3 inhibitor), or lapatinib (EGFR and ERBB2 inhibitor) alone or in combination with 1&#x003bc;M BGJ398. The parental RT112 cells were sensitive to BGJ398 but showed little sensitivity to the ERBB family member inhibitors AZD8931 or lapatinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3A</xref> presents data with AZD8931; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S4</xref> shows all inhibitor combinations). In contrast, the BGJ398 RS cell line was sensitive to AZD8931 and lapatinib and insensitive to BGJ398 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4</xref>). Combined treatment with BGJ398 and AZD8931 resulted in increased growth inhibition in both the parental and resistant cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3A</xref>), suggesting a potential ongoing co-dependency in both cases with a higher degree of FGFR dependency in the parental line and higher ERBB dependency in the resistant line. Similar results were observed for combinations of BGJ398 and lapatinib (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S4</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Given that the inhibitor studies suggested a greater degree of FGFR dependence in RT112 and a greater degree of ERBB family member dependence in BGJ398 RS, we next sought to examine effects on signaling of ERBB and ERBB plus FGFR inhibition in the parental and resistant cell lines. The parental and resistant cells were treated with 1&#x003bc;M AZD8931 alone, 1&#x003bc;M BGJ398 alone, or the two drugs in combination and immunoblots were performed to assess the phosphorylation status of a number of signaling effectors. There was no acute toxicity associated with drug treatments at the assayed timepoint. We observed, as before, that p-FRS2 levels were high in the parental cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3B</xref>). p-FRS2 decreased with BGJ398 treatment but not AZD8931 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3B</xref>). There was little detectable p-FRS2 in BGJ398 RS as seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S3</xref>. Basal levels of p-ERBB2 and p-ERBB3 were higher in BGJ398 RS as compared to RT112 and sensitive to AZD8931 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3B</xref>). While AZD8931 alone inhibited p-AKT and p-ERK in BGJ398 RS it did not do so in the parental RT112 cells and a combination of BGJ398 and AZD8931 was required to observe a decrease in these signaling effectors, consistent with the concept co-dependency or rapid dependency switching in the parental line and a switch to a greater degree of ERBB dependency in BGJ398 RS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3B</xref>).</p><p id="P17">To address the roles of individual ERBB family members in acquired resistance to BGJ398, we expressed shRNAs targeting ERBB2 and ERBB3 using lentiviral vectors in the parental RT112 and BGJ398 RS. We screened a set of shRNA-expressing plasmids for the ability to knock down ERBB2 or ERBB3 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs. S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). We then utilized the shRNA plasmids that drove the greatest depletion of the target and observed that knockdown of endogenous ERBB2 by these shRNAs led to a reduction in proliferation in both cell lines, but with a more robust reduction in BGJ398 RS cells than in parental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3C</xref>), consistent with the inhibitor studies. The effects of ERBB3 depletion were more modest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S6A</xref>). ERBB3 was less effectively targeted by the shRNA, perhaps accounting in part for the more modest phenotypes as compared to ERBB2 knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S6</xref>).</p><p id="P18">We next probed shRNA and drug combinations. In the parental cell lines we observed that knock-down of ERBB2 resulted in a modest decrease in viability which was potentiated by treatment with BGJ398 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3D</xref>, left panel). In contrast knock-down of ERBB2 had a greater effect on the viability of BGJ398 RS but there was no additional effect of adding BGJ398 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3D</xref>, left panel). AZD8931 led to death of BGJ398 RS but not parental RT112 cells expressing a shRNA targeting LacZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3D</xref>, center panel). shERBB2 reduced proliferation of BGJ398 RS and the addition of AZD8931 increased this effect, consistent with a requirement for multiple ERBB family members in conferring resistance to BGJ398 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3D</xref>, center panel). The combination of BGJ398 and AZD8931 led to substantial decreased viability in RT112 and BGJ398 RS in the presence or absence of shERBB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3D</xref>, right panel).

Given this observation and our previous experiments which showed that ERBB activation occurs within one day of FGFR inhibition in RT112 cells, we reasoned that the acquired resistance may be due to changes in gene transcription and not due to the acquisition of additional somatic mutations, a process that can often take several weeks to arise. Consistent with this hypothesis, sensitivity to BGJ398 or ponatinib could be restored in the resistant cell lines by growth in the absence of drug for two to four weeks (resulting lines termed BGJ398 withdraw and ponatinib withdraw, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5A</xref>) which was accompanied by a morphologic conversion back to the appearance of parental RT112 cells.</p><p id="P22">Since the time-frame for acquisition of resistance to FGFR inhibitors and the reversibility of this phenotype seemed more consistent with transcriptional changes as opposed to acquisition of novel mutations, we performed mRNA sequencing (RNAseq) on parental RT112 as well as the BGJ398 RS or BGJ398 RD cell lines and ponatinib RS and RD. As expected, we noted variable up-regulation of EGFR, ERBB2 and ERBB3 in all four of the resistant lines relative to the parental line, suggestive of a common mechanism of resistance (RNAseq data are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table1</xref>; validation by quantitative PCR in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5B</xref>). We also observed that expression of NRG1, NRG2, NRG4, and BTC, ligands binding to ERBB family receptors, were also generally increased in the resistant cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5B</xref>). Not all ERBB ligands were upregulated; for example, expression of EGF, HBEGF, AREG, and TGFA were unchanged or downregulated in the resistant lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table1</xref>). To further validate these findings we performed triplicate ELISA assays on the media from parental RT112 cells and BGJ398 RS. In agreement with the gene expression data, NRG1 protein was undetectable in the parental cell line and averaged 92.7 &#x000b1; 9.4 pg/ml in BGJ398 RS and EGF was measured at 13.9 &#x000b1; 0.03 pg/ml in RT112 and 4.5 &#x000b1; 1.1 pg/ml in BGJ398 RS. NRG2 was undetectable in media from the parental RT112 line and just at the limits of detection in BGJ398 RS averaging 9.8 pg/ml, though the performance of the NRG2 ELISA assay was sub-optimal, suggesting that this result should be interpreted cautiously.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Ligand-mediated rescue</title><p id="P23">It has been previously demonstrated that bypass of dependence on RTKs can be achieved by ligand-mediated activation of alternative RTKs<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Given that we observed that BGJ398 drives increased ERBB family activation and that BGJ398 and ponatinib impact the expression of ERBB ligands, we reasoned that ERBB ligands may be important in facilitating the dependency switch. We examined two <italic>FGFR3</italic> dependent cell lines, RT112 and RT4, and found that both lines were rendered resistant to BGJ398 treatment if grown in conditioned media from RT112 cells previously treated with BGJ398 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6A</xref>). In contrast two other cells lines with a high degree of sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors, the FGFR1 amplified cell line H1581 and FGFR2 amplified cell line Kato III, could not be rescued by the conditioned media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6A</xref>). Interestingly, we also obtained similar results using recombinant EGF in which the two <italic>FGFR3</italic> dependent lines could be rendered insensitive to BGJ398 treatment but not the <italic>FGFR1</italic> or <italic>FGFR2</italic> dependent line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S8</xref>). The effects of conditioned media on sensitivity to BGJ398 in RT112 cells could be blocked in part by a neutralizing antibody targeting NRG1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S9A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>NRG1 can rescue cell from BGJ398 induced cell death in FGFR3-dependent cells</title><p id="P24">Our RNAseq data suggested that EGF was unlikely to be an important ERBB ligand in the setting of acquired resistance to FGFR inhibitors in the context of <italic>FGFR3</italic> dependency given that it was downregulated with BGJ398 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S Table1</xref>). NRG1, in contrast, is thought to be one of the principal ligands for stimulation of ERBB2/3 heterodimers<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> and was upregulated in our resistant cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5B</xref>). Since ERBB2 and ERBB3 appeared to be upregulated both at the mRNA and protein level in resistant lines and also demonstrated greater degrees of phosphorylation, we sought to establish whether NRG1 alone could rescue BGJ398-induced death in RT112 and other FGFR dependent cell lines. Similar to our results from the conditioned media experiments and with EGF stimulation we observed that NRG1 rescued BGJ398-induced death in the <italic>FGFR3</italic> dependent lines RT112 and RT4 but not the FGFR1 dependent line H1581 or the <italic>FGFR2</italic> dependent line Kato III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6B</xref>). Additionally, we probed upregulated ERBB ligand NRG2 and noted that this ligand also demonstrated an observable but more modest degree of protection from BGJ398-induced cell death as compared to NRG1 in the <italic>FGFR3</italic> dependent cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S9B</xref>). Addition of exogeneous NRG1 or NRG2 was sufficient to drive upregulation of p-ERBB2 and p-ERBB3 in RT112 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S9C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S10"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P25">The prevalence of somatic alterations of FGFRs in diverse types of cancer makes FGFRs attractive therapeutic targets. Given that the development of acquired resistance to targeted therapeutic drugs is a major obstacle in cancer medicine, we investigated mechanisms of acquired resistance to both selective and multi-targeted FGFR inhibitors. Using unbiased screening to examine the activity of RTKs in the setting of acquired resistance, we found that <italic>ERBB2</italic> and <italic>ERBB3</italic> were rapidly induced in cells treated with FGFR inhibitors and that resistant cells underwent a dependency switch from predominantly the FGFR to the ERBB signaling pathway, suggesting that signaling through ERBB2/3 can compensate for FGFR inhibition. This switching, in combination with the changes in cellular morphology and the production of ERBB receptor ligands was reversible, indicating substantial plasticity in the interaction among these oncogenic signaling pathways and suggesting a need for dual ERBB/FGFR inhibitors in this setting.</p><p id="P26">Acquired resistance to TKIs can arise through multiple mechanisms, typically involving second-site mutations in the target gene or by the activation of signaling pathways which bypass the original target<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>.

Recent data indicate that tumor EMT phenotypes are closely intertwined with the genomic alterations found in tumors and the response of cancers to targeted therapies. There are distinct &#x0201c;mesenchymal&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;epithelial&#x0201d; subsets of human bladder cancer cells. The &#x0201c;mesenchymal&#x02019; phenotype is associated with <italic>FGFR1</italic> expression, while &#x0201c;epithelial&#x0201d; phenotype is associated with <italic>FGFR3</italic> expression and sensitivity to BGJ398 (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">ref.40</xref>). We also found <italic>FGFR1</italic> mRNA is up-regulated in BGJ398 resistant cells, along with the other mesenchymal markers which may account for the resistance to FGFR inhibitors. Additionally, ERBB2 homo-dimerization and NRG1 secretion have been shown to cause EMT in mammary epithelial cells<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. Whether EMT is a cause or a result of acquired resistance is unclear and requires further study.</p><p id="P27">Our findings provide additional mechanistic insight into the ways in which tumors may develop resistance to FGFR inhibitors. Our study provides new details of how cancers may adapt to FGFR inhibition by activating ERBB2/3 in a rapid, reversible and ligand-dependent fashion. These results are similar to others obtained in the study of BRAF inhibitors in BRAF mutant melanoma and thyroid cancers<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. Interestingly, these data appear only to apply to cancer cell lines dependent on <italic>FGFR3</italic> and not to other <italic>FGFR</italic> dependent models. This may be due to high basal expression of ERBB family members in these models which could allow more readily for dependency switching as compared to cell lines in which the ERBB signaling pathway is dormant. This may be similar to the case of HGF-driven resistance in which cell lines which displayed resistance to BGJ398 in the context of HGF were noted to express high basal levels of MET. It is likely that additional mechanisms of resistance to FGFR inhibitors will be described in <italic>FGFR1</italic> and <italic>FGFR2</italic> dependent cancers.</p><p id="P28">Our findings provide pre-clinical insights into acquired resistance to FGFR inhibitor-based therapy and suggest that dual FGFR/ERBB family inhibition is likely to be more effective than inhibiting either pathway alone in cancers which display either dependency switching or co-dependency. Given that several small molecule inhibitors and antibodies targeting ERBB family members are being studied in the clinic, it would be reasonable on the basis of our study and the work of others<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> to consider whether dual FGFR and ERBB therapy may be efficacious in FGFR-driven cancers. As several trials of FGFR inhibitors are underway we will soon learn if FGFR-ERBB dependency switching is observed in patient samples. We hope that these data will motivate additional studies of the response to FGFR inhibitors and mechanisms of resistance and also, together with the work of others, anticipate clinically relevant mechanisms of resistance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S11"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Cell culture and reagents</title><p id="P29">RT112, RT4, NCI-H1581 and Kato III were obtained from the core collection at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute or Broad Institute and were previously purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

increasing concentrations of BGJ398. The resistance was confirmed by dose response curve. Cells were treated with the indicated concentration of BGJ398 for 4 days and growth was measured using the growth proliferation assay and plotted as a percentage of growth relative to untreated control cells. Data points are represented as Mean &#x000b1; SD (n=3). (B) Parental and BGJ398 resistant cells display different morphology under light microscope. (C) q-PCR analysis shows differential expression levels of EMT-related genes in parental and BGJ398 RS cells. (D) Immunoblots of candidate EMT related proteins. (E) Cell migration assay. A wound was produced on the cell layer with a pipette tip and the parental and BGJ398 resistant cells incubated with or without 1&#x003bc;M BGJ398. Wound repair after 24 hours of stimulation was observed under a microscope. (F) Cell invasion was examined using a Boyden chamber assay. Serum free parental cell and resistant cells were seeded on the top of the chamber, with or without exposure to 1&#x003bc;M BGJ398. Media containing 10% FBS was added into the lower chamber. After 24 hours, the invading cells were stained with DAPI and the number of cells manually counted. 3 independent experiments and five microscopic fields were counted per insert. The number of migrated control cells was taken as 100%.
