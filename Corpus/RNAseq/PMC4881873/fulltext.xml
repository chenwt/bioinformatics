Using several independent publicly available breast cancer gene expression databases, we investigated other members of the PGE<sub>2</sub> pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> is produced by COX-2 and actively exported by multiple drug resistance-associated protein 4 (MRP4) into the extracellular microenvironment, where PGE<sub>2</sub> can bind four cognate EP receptors (EP1&#x02013;EP4) and initiate diverse biological signaling pathways. Alternatively, PGE<sub>2</sub> is imported via the prostaglandin transporter (PGT) and metabolized by 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH/HPGD). We made the novel observation that MRP4, PGT, and 15-PGDH are differentially expressed among distinct breast cancer molecular subtypes; this finding was confirmed in independent datasets. In triple-negative breast cancer, the observed gene expression pattern (high COX-2, high MRP4, low PGT, and low 15-PGDH) would favor high levels of tumor-promoting PGE<sub>2</sub> in the tumor microenvironment that may contribute to the overall poor prognosis of triple-negative breast cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>COX-2</kwd><kwd>PGE<sub>2</sub></kwd><kwd>MRP4</kwd><kwd>PGT</kwd><kwd>15-PGDH</kwd><kwd>TNBC</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease classified into subtypes based on histopathologic (protein) or gene expression profiles, which guide treatment decisions. Breast cancers are defined histologically by estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) expression. More recently, gene expression profiling has been used to classify breast cancer into distinct subtypes. Each of these subtypes, defined at the protein or mRNA expression level, exhibits different biological behavior and is associated with different outcomes.</p><p>Similar to other epithelial-derived tumors, elevated levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein have been detected in aggressive breast cancer.

The differences in PTGS2 expression among the subtypes of breast cancer are quite remarkable, especially among basal subtype tumors with high PTGS2 compared with luminal or HER2-enriched tumors. Expression of PTGS2 in basal subtype tumors is greater than the mean of all samples tested and significantly greater than the expression of this gene in luminal A, luminal B, or HER2-enriched subtype tumors, all with expression less than the mean of all samples.

Of the tumor samples, basal and HER2-enriched tumors (dashed box) showed higher PTGER4 expression than the luminal subtype tumors (dotted box). These data support our previous findings that EP4 could be a therapeutic target in more aggressive breast cancer subtypes. PTGER2 is more highly expressed in normal breast tissue compared with malignant breast tissue.

To this point, our data suggested that TNBC is distinct from the other subtypes with respect to COX-2 pathway expression. These trends between breast cancer subtypes and PGE<sub>2</sub> pathway member gene expression patterns warranted a deeper analysis into TCGA data. The Illumina HiSeq dataset was downloaded using the UCSC Cancer Genome Browser and analyzed. TNBC samples (<italic>n</italic> = 123) were compared with all other primary tumor samples (<italic>n</italic> = 964) across the five PGE<sub>2</sub> pathway genes. Expression of PTGS2 (COX-2) and ABCC4 (MRP4) mRNA was significantly higher (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) in the TNBC samples compared with all other primary tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-bcbcr-10-2016-061">Fig. 3</xref>). Conversely, HPGD (15-PGDH, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0007) and SLCO2A1 (PGT, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0002) were significantly decreased in the TNBC samples compared with other primary tumor samples. PTGER4 (EP4) mRNA expression was similar in all groups. Taken together, this pattern of gene expression should lead to more PGE<sub>2</sub> synthesis and export to the tumor microenvironment and less import and degradation in the setting of TNBC. These results illustrate fundamental differences between TNBC and other types of breast cancer. Given these patterns, we would expect that PGE<sub>2</sub> levels in TNBC tumors would be elevated due to the increased production and export and decreased metabolism of PGE<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>There were 810 patients with complete records available to estimate OS; 93 patients (11.5%) were confirmed dead at the time of data entry. OS was defined as the time from initial diagnosis to death from any cause, censored at the date of last contact. RFS was estimated using 792 cases. RFS was defined as the time from initial diagnosis to disease recurrence. Patients without recurrence were censored at the date of last contact, given that the patient was still disease-free. High HPGD (15-PGDH) expression was found to be an independent predictor of a better outcome, longer OS (hazard ratio = 0.89, <italic>P</italic> = 0.01). A gene-dosage effect was observed where maximum observed expression of HPGD was correlated with higher OS probability; minimum observed expression of HPGD was correlated with lower survival probability by Cox regression model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-bcbcr-10-2016-061">Fig. 4</xref>, left). This was the only gene to show a strong association with OS. RFS was estimated and compared between the following two categories of patients, namely, <italic>new tumor</italic> and <italic>otherwise</italic>, as indicators of disease progression. Elevated HPGD expression was strongly associated with prolonged RFS (hazard ratio = 0.89, <italic>P</italic> = 0.02). Likewise, following Cox regression, a gene-dosage effect was observed between high expression of HPGD and higher chance of RFS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-bcbcr-10-2016-061">Fig. 4</xref>, right). These associations were highly significant and consistent with the classification of HPGD/15-PGDH as a tumor suppressor.<xref rid="b16-bcbcr-10-2016-061" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b28-bcbcr-10-2016-061" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>In order to investigate if these five PGE<sub>2</sub> pathway genes are associated with one another in their expression, we performed pairwise correlation analyses. We found no strong correlation between the pairs of PGE<sub>2</sub> pathway genes in primary tumors as the resulting Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficients ranged from 0.114 to 0.460 (data not shown). Other parameters compared to PGE<sub>2</sub> pathway gene expression included cancer stage, lymph node status, and racial background. Breast cancer stage was also not strongly associated with expression of any particular PGE<sub>2</sub> pathway gene and not pursued further. Of the five PGE<sub>2</sub> pathway genes investigated, only PTGS2 and SLCO2A1 were significantly different between lymph node-negative and lymph node-positive tumors. While these changes were significant, we did not identify strong biological associations between lymph node status and gene expression to pursue further. There is a racial disparity in breast cancers that develop in African-American (black/AA) women compared with white women.<xref rid="b29-bcbcr-10-2016-061" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Of the five COX-2 pathway genes examined in primary tumor samples from black/AA and white women, we found no strong associations between the expression of any gene and a particular racial background.</p><p>To confirm our conclusion derived from the TCGA dataset and to obtain some information regarding stromal expression of COX-2 pathway genes, we examined the expression of the same COX-2 pathway genes in three additional small breast cancer datasets. Three breast cancer subtypes (apocrine, luminal, and basal) were used to classify the samples of the Farmer Breast dataset.<xref rid="b23-bcbcr-10-2016-061" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Gene expression in breast cancer-associated stroma compared with healthy mammary stroma was evaluated using the Karnoub Breast dataset.<xref rid="b24-bcbcr-10-2016-061" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The 14 breast cancer samples in the Schuetz Breast 2 dataset are divided between DCIS and IDC classifications.<xref rid="b25-bcbcr-10-2016-061" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The distinction between DCIS and IDC is clinically relevant as IDC can progress rapidly while DCIS is a localized (stage 0) disease. Gene expression is reported as log2 median-centered intensity; the median expression signal from the entire gene array was subtracted from each gene and the resulting signal intensity was log2 transformed. A negative value for gene expression indicates that the gene is expressed, but at a level lower than the median of all genes on the microarray. Since each microarray is normalized independently, comparisons of the gene expression values between datasets are not valid. The distribution of gene expression values between categories within the same dataset was analyzed and described for each gene studied.</p><p>We observed that expression of ABCC4/MRP4 is elevated more frequently in basal breast tumors (median = 0.576) than in apocrine (median = &#x02212;0.404) or luminal (median = &#x02212;0.185) tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-bcbcr-10-2016-061">Fig. 5A</xref>), consistent with the pattern observed in the TCGA dataset. When gene expression in mammary stroma was examined, we observed that ABCC4 expression was elevated in breast cancer-associated stroma (median = 0.278) compared to normal mammary tissue (median = &#x02212;0.471; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-bcbcr-10-2016-061">Fig. 5B</xref>). The majority (13/15) of normal stromal tissue samples had ABCC4 expression less than zero, while six of the seven IDC samples had ABCC4 expression greater than zero. We observed a similar trend in the expression of ABCC4 in IDC tumor samples compared with DCIS samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-bcbcr-10-2016-061">Fig. 5C</xref>). ABCC4 expression is elevated more frequently in IDC tumors (median = 0.789) than in DCIS tumors (median = &#x02212;0.154). All the examined IDC tumor samples had expression of ABCC4 greater than zero, while the expression of ABCC4 from only two of the seven DCIS samples was greater than zero, and the maximum expression level was not as high as that seen in the IDC samples.</p><p>PGT is responsible for the import of PGE<sub>2</sub> from the tumor microenvironment as the first step in PGE<sub>2</sub> metabolism. We observed little variation in the expression of this gene among subcategories of breast cancer. Basal breast cancer had a slightly higher maximum gene expression value compared to apocrine or luminal breast cancer, but overall, the pattern of expression was similar in apocrine, basal, and luminal subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-bcbcr-10-2016-061">Fig. 5D</xref>). There were more basal breast cancer samples with SLCO2A1 expression around the maximum value compared to luminal samples. SLCO2A1 expression values in the stroma were greater than zero, and there was a slight increase in the median expression of SLCO2A1 in IDC-associated stroma (1.86) compared to normal stroma (0.927; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-bcbcr-10-2016-061">Fig. 5E</xref>). We also observed a modest increase in median SLCO2A1 expression when we compared IDC (1.477) versus DCIS (1.10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-bcbcr-10-2016-061">Fig. 5F</xref>).</p><p>15-Prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH/HPGD) metabolizes intracellular PGE<sub>2</sub> so that this ligand is unable to bind EP receptors, which results in suppression of PGE<sub>2</sub> signaling. When we examined three datasets for HPGD/15-PGDH expression, we observed that HPGD expression was detected in all samples, and gene expression values were generally below zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-bcbcr-10-2016-061">Fig. 5G&#x02013;I</xref>). This indicates that HPGD expression was less than the median expression of all genes on the microarray. HPGD expression between DCIS and IDC samples was very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-bcbcr-10-2016-061">Fig. 5I</xref>).</p><p>Expressions of PTGS2 (COX-2), PTGS1 (COX-1), and PTGER4 (EP4) were also evaluated in these three datasets; however, differences between the small groups were not strong enough to draw conclusions (data not shown).</p><p>Overall, data obtained from three, smaller, independent datasets show how distinct clinical subtypes of breast cancer can exhibit different expression patterns of several members of the COX-2/PGE<sub>2</sub> pathway. Even in these small datasets, we observed elevated expression of ABCC4/MRP4 in breast cancer samples with the worst prognoses (basal and IDC). These findings support the trends observed in the TCGA analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Expression of COX-2 and production of PGE<sub>2</sub> are two indicators of poor prognosis in breast cancer. COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes are inhibited by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, eg, aspirin, ibuprofen, and indomethacin), while COX-2 is inhibited by the coxib family of molecules (celecoxib, rofecoxib, and valdecoxib), with much higher affinity for COX-2 than COX-1.<xref rid="b3-bcbcr-10-2016-061" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> There is epidemiologic evidence that long-term use of NSAIDs for other indications modestly reduces breast cancer incidence.<xref rid="b30-bcbcr-10-2016-061" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b31-bcbcr-10-2016-061" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In the cancer treatment setting, both NSAIDs and coxibs have shown some efficacy; however, chronic use of NSAIDs can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, and prolonged use of coxibs has resulted in cardiotoxic secondary effects.<xref rid="b32-bcbcr-10-2016-061" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> While the COX enzymes are responsible for the rate-limiting step in PGE<sub>2</sub> synthesis, other members of the PGE<sub>2</sub> pathway are important to consider as they may also play a role in determining the overall level of PGE<sub>2</sub> in a tumor. Using publicly available gene expression datasets, we have now shown that members of the PGE<sub>2</sub> pathway are differentially expressed among the different molecular subtypes of breast cancer. The most aggressive breast cancer subtypes (basal-like, HER2-enriched, and TNBC) have gene expression profiles that would favor accumulation of PGE<sub>2</sub> in the tumor microenvironment. Gene expression changes include elevated expression of ABCC4/MRP4, which would increase the export of PGE<sub>2</sub> from cells, decreased expression of SLCO2A1/PGT, leading to reduced clearance of PGE<sub>2</sub> from the microenvironment, and lowered expression of HPGD/15-PGDH, which would decrease the overall metabolism of PGE<sub>2</sub> in the tumor.</p><p>Although discovered for its role in conferring resistance to chemotherapy, elevated expression of MRP4 has been detected in drug-na&#x000ef;ve tumors, including neuroblastoma, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia.<xref rid="b33-bcbcr-10-2016-061" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b35-bcbcr-10-2016-061" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> We report here that ABCC4/MRP4 mRNA is expressed in breast cancer and is strongly associated with aggressive breast cancer subtypes with the worst prognoses. The strong correlation between ABCC4 expression and aggressive breast cancer supports our central hypothesis that elevated MRP4 expression is correlated with aggressiveness in breast cancer, particularly in basal-like and HER2-enriched molecular subtypes. Transcription of ABCC4 is regulated by several signaling pathways, including the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR&#x003b1;), and the N-myc oncogene.<xref rid="b36-bcbcr-10-2016-061" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b38-bcbcr-10-2016-061" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Micro-RNAs (miRNAs), miR-124a and miR-506, suppress MRP4 protein translation in a tissue-specific manner.<xref rid="b39-bcbcr-10-2016-061" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> MRP4 expression is also regulated by alternative splicing and nonsense-mediated decay of a truncated mRNA transcript.<xref rid="b40-bcbcr-10-2016-061" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p><p>The inverse relationship between PGT (PGE<sub>2</sub> import) and MRP4 (PGE<sub>2</sub> export) was first reported by Holla et al who recognized the net effect of these proteins on the regulation of PGE<sub>2</sub> levels in colorectal cancer.<xref rid="b13-bcbcr-10-2016-061" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In the majority of colorectal tumor samples examined, they found elevated MRP4 expression and reduced PGT expression compared with adjacent healthy tissue. We found high expression of SLCO2A1/PGT mRNA in normal breast tissue and in luminal A and HER2-enriched breast cancers; expression of SLCO2A1 was lower in luminal B and basal-like breast cancers. Lower expression of SLCO2A1/PGT would decrease the amount of PGE<sub>2</sub> imported for metabolism, and therefore, the remaining PGE<sub>2</sub> could sustain signaling through EP receptors on the cell surface.</p><p>HPGD/15-PGDH is a tumor suppressor gene in breast and other epithelial-derived cancers. Expression of 15-PGDH is necessary for metabolism and inactivation of PGE<sub>2</sub> in order to fully suppress PGE<sub>2</sub>-mediated signaling even when COX-2 is inhibited.<xref rid="b41-bcbcr-10-2016-061" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> We found that HPGD/15-PGDH mRNA expression was decreased in breast cancer compared with healthy breast tissue and that HPGD expression was lower in breast cancers of the most aggressive subtypes (basal-like and HER2-enriched). Expression of HPGD was also suppressed in the majority of TNBCs compared with other breast cancers. High HPGD expression was associated with improved OS and RFS.

PTGS1 expression did not show any striking associations with the breast cancer subtypes. PTGS2 gene expression was elevated in TNBC compared with luminal A, luminal B, or Her2-enriched subtypes. PTGS2 was also elevated in normal breast tissue.
