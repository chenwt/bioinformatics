Reduced global histone methylation is an epigenetic state known to mediate plasticity in cultured embryonic SCs and T-cell progenitors. Here we find histone H3 K4/K9/K27me3 levels actively reduced in adult mouse skin and hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) during G0 quiescence. The level of marks over specific gene promoters did not correlate to mRNA level changes in quiescent HFSCs. Skin hypomethylation during quiescence was necessary for subsequent progression of hair homeostasis (cycle). Inhibiting BMP signal, a known HFSC anti-proliferative factor, elevated HFSC methylation <italic>in vivo</italic> during quiescence prior to proliferation onset. Furthermore, removal of proliferation factors and addition of BMP4 reduced histone methylases and increased demethylases mRNAs in cultured skin epithelial cells. We conclude that signalling couples hair follicle stem cell quiescence with reduced H3 K4/K9/K27me3 levels for proper tissue homeostasis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="i1" xlink:href="ncomms11278-i1.jpg"/>Changes in global histone trimethylation have been linked to embryonic but not adult stem cell plasticity.

Adult tissue stem cells (TSCs) are rare and difficult to access in their intact niche in a living organism, and the link between chromatin states and TSC plasticity to make differentiated cells during adult tissue homeostasis is poorly understood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Recently, work in the adult hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) suggested that the plasticity to adapt to different environments such as the natural niche, the injured skin or cultured conditions <italic>in vitro</italic> is influenced by pioneer factors that couple their activity with open chromatin domains known as super-enhancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. However, how super-enhancers or other epigenetic states influence the intrinsic plasticity of adult HFSCs during normal homeostasis, as a fundamental mechanism that allow these cells to both self-renew and also adopt differentiated hair lineage fates remains unclear. Interestingly, embryonic stem cell (ESC) plasticity of fate determination is characterized by decreased &#x02018;epigenomic identity', defined as low global levels of several histone epigenetic marks such as H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>; hypomethylation). Genetic interference with the level of such epigenetic marks affected ESCs pluripotency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> as well as the ability of committed cells to dedifferentiate and be reprogrammed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Similarly, T-cell progenitors in culture showed hypomethylation of H3 K27/K9me3, and this was confined to their G0 quiescent state, when cells do not divide. Interestingly, this hypomethylation conferred T-cell progenitors elevated genome plasticity during quiescence, to be more efficiently reprogrammed to pluripotency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Finally, muscle SCs <italic>in vivo</italic> also showed hypomethylation of H3K27me3 in quiescence, but a correlation with plasticity was not yet made<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. It is unclear if histone H3 hypomethylation of specific lysine residues is generally associated with quiescence of tissue stem and progenitor cells, and if there is any functional significance <italic>in vivo</italic> for this specific state. Also unclear is how such global, apparently genome-wide, reduction in histone methylation might relate to specific levels of gene expression. This is important because many, although not all, adult TSCs reside in G0 quiescence in their niche for long time periods, and upon activation are expected to rapidly adapt and perform tissue regeneration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p><p>Mouse HFSCs are an excellent model system for studying the link between SC plasticity and quiescence because they undergo synchronous phases of quiescence and proliferation that are tightly regulated. Furthermore, hair follicles have defined morphology, which permits unambiguous <italic>in situ</italic> identification of the SCs (bulge, Bu region), progenitor cells (matrix, Mx region) and differentiated lineages (inner layers, ILs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Furthermore, bulge HFSCs can be freshly sorted from skin in large quantities based on cell surface markers CD34 and &#x003b1;6-integrin, and this allows biochemical analyses, which are inaccessible to many other tissue systems. Hair homeostasis occurs in regenerative cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>) composed of successive synchronous stages of tissue remodelling: telogen (rest and quiescence of HFSCs), anagen (proliferation/differentiation of matrix progenitors and independent self-renewal of Bu HFSCs) and catagen (regression/apoptosis of progenitor and differentiated lineages, re-structuring of the SC niche and quiescence of the HFSCs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p><p>As HFSCs enter quiescence at late anagen/early catagen, they are re-positioned relative to the residence niche (bulge); eventually their ultimate position, by the end of catagen, dictates their subsequent fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In one fate, the HFSCs would become early progenitor hair germ cells, destined to divide rapidly at anagen, differentiate to matrix and further to terminally differentiated lineages in the ILs, and eventually die. In the second fate, the HFSCs would self-renew symmetrically within the bulge by undergoing several (&#x0223c;3 &#x000d7;) rounds of cell division during early anagen, become crowded in their niche and eventually cease proliferation to enter quiescence again in late anagen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. It follows that at catagen, quiescent HFSCs have higher cell fate potential or plasticity (two possible fates: differentiate/die or self-renew) when compared with proliferative HFSCs at anagen (single fate: self-renewal; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p><p>Here we examine global levels and genome distribution of histone H3 trimethylation marks commonly associated with transcriptional repression (H3K9me3 and H3K27me3) and activation (H3K4me3)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> in HFSCs (of CD34&#x0002b; bulge SCs) during self-renewal (early anagen) and quiescence (catagen). We show for the first time that quiescent HFSCs present global hypomethylation of specific H3 marks, relative to their proliferative counterparts. Hypomethylation of HFSCs peaks at catagen (before fate decisions), and was not previously reported by <italic>Lien et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, who focused on different hair cycle stages. Moreover, we demonstrate that methylation levels are actively controlled by diffusible proliferation inhibitory signals (bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)) but are not immediately relevant to mRNA levels in quiescent HFSCs. Importantly, hypomethylation throughout the skin at catagen appears crucial for subsequent normal hair cycle progression.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Reduction of H3 K4/K9/K27me3 in quiescent HFSCs</title><p>To probe the levels of H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 in HFSCs relative to more differentiated cells and at different stages of homeostasis, we examined mouse skin sections at different postnatal days (PDs) by immunofluorescence. We found that at anagen, bulge cells (HFSCs) were generally less stained than lower outer root sheath (ORS), progenitor (matrix) cells and differentiated hair lineages (ILs). The epidermis also generally showed higher methylation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c&#x02013;e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a,b</xref>). To rule out differences in antibody penetration in different cell types and validate our results of immunofluorescence data, we sorted HFSCs (bulge cells as CD34&#x0002b;/&#x003b1;6-integrin&#x0002b;) and non-HFSCs (mostly epidermis and hair follicle lower ORS cells as CD34&#x02212;/&#x003b1;6-integrin&#x0002b;) at early anagen (&#x0223c;PD25) by FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) and performed a test western blot analysis for one of our marks relative to total histone H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). This confirmed global reduction of H3K9me3/H3 in HFSCs relative to non-HFSCs and demonstrated that our immunofluorescence methods are good reporters of overall global levels of methylation. Furthermore, bulge HFSCs showed strikingly lower (but not absent) immunofluorescence signal levels of histone marks during quiescence (Late Catagen, LC-HFSCs) relative to proliferative (Early Anagen, EA-HFSCs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c&#x02013;e</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a&#x02013;c</xref>). Because histone H3K9me3 shows distinct bright nuclear foci, we could readily quantify the distribution of foci-positive and -negative cells within the CD34&#x0002b; bulge HFSCs at different hair cycle stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g,h</xref>), which confirmed lowest level for catagen bulge cells. The late catagen stage was assessed based on morphology, and was also confirmed using Caspase-3 staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1d,e</xref>). To verify that antibody immunofluorescence staining correctly report on levels of histone methylation in bulge cells at catagen, we performed western blots of sorted CD34&#x0002b;/&#x003b1;6-integrin&#x0002b; HFSCs at early anagen (PD25) and late catagen (&#x0223c;PD42-44) using histone H3K9me3/H3 as test of principle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1i</xref>). This validated our immunofluorescence methods for different hair cycle stages, and verified hypomethylation of bulge HFSCs at late catagen. Immunofluorescence suggested a most pronounced reduction of methylation in the bulge HFSCs relative to other skin compartments, but tissue sections at catagen consistently appeared less stained throughout the skin. This observation was confirmed by western blots of total skin tissue and quantification for all the H3 trimethylation marks relative to histone H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1j,k</xref>). These data together demonstrated that catagen is a stage when skin is generally hypomethylated for H3 K4/K9/K27me3. Furthermore, bulge HFSCs show hypomethylation at catagen (in quiescence) relative to early anagen (proliferation) and also relative to its more differentiated hair lineages (matrix and IL) at anagen.</p><p>To examine genome-wide distribution and levels of DNA-bound methylated histone H3 K4/K9/K27me3, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq). We used comparable number of sorted CD34&#x0002b;/&#x003b1;6-integrin&#x0002b; EA-HFSCs (PD22&#x02013;25) and LC-HFSCs (PD38&#x02013;44; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). We also sorted and analysed non-HFSCs (nEA and nLC) counterparts as CD34&#x02212;/&#x003b1;6-integrin&#x0002b;. Using IgG as background for normalization, our data revealed good correlation between experiments and enrichments in specific functional genomic regions, such as promoters, introns and repetitive regions, as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a,b</xref>). We compared our data with a previous ChIP-seq study of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 (H3K9me3 was not analysed) by <italic>Lien et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, done at Mid/late Anagen (MA-HFSCs) and Late Telogen (LT-HFSCs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a&#x02013;e</xref>). The overall genome-wide distribution for the marks was similar in the two studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>), however, our data uniquely revealed fewer ChIP-seq peaks in LC-HFSCs when compared with EA-HFSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). Close examination of ChIP-seq data distribution across the genome showed that for H3K27me3 and especially for H3K9me3 not only the total number of peaks but also the height was dramatically decreased in LC-HFSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e,f</xref>, arrows). In case of H3K4me3, the number of peaks were marginally decreased in LC-HFSCs relative to the other populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c,e</xref>), which prompted us to examine the ChIP-seq signals in a manner that would allow more quantitative examination of signal at discrete chromosomal loci.</p><p>For this, we adapted an existing sequencing data analysis pipeline that allows direct comparisons of fold changes at defined chromosomal loci across samples (see the Methods for details). We defined 201,177 chromosomal loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>), in which at least one of the three marks was detected as a &#x02018;peak' (via MACS, model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) in any one of our populations. We then quantified the signal as &#x02018;normalized tag density' (number of sequencing reads mapped within a specific region per total number of mapped reads normalized across analysed samples; see the Methods for details). As expected for these marks, this analysis revealed enrichment of H3K4me3 at transcription start sites (TSS), 5&#x02032; untranslated region and CpG sites, whereas H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 were enriched in regions elsewhere, such as repetitive satellite regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p><p>In all regions analysed, the signal appeared higher in EA-HFSCs than LC-HFSCs. This was true even for the H3K4me3 signal, which was indeed decreased not only at TSS but also overall in LC-HFSC relative to EA-HFSC by &#x0223c;2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The decrease was in line with our previous observations, but the fold change was less than expected from our western blots and immunofluorescence data. One possible explanation for this apparent difference, aside from inherent caveats of different methods of comparisons, is that in addition to its enrichment within defined narrow peaks analysed in ChIP-seq, H3K4me3 mark might also have a broad distribution across the genome, which is detected as &#x02018;background' and hence lost in peak calling methods. Examination of H3K4me3 levels distribution across transcription start (TSS) and termination sites, also revealed consistent elevated levels for EA-HFSCs relative to LC-HFSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d,e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). Similarly, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 were also decreased in LC-HFSCs across several types of chromosomal loci analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,e</xref>). In addition, a quantitative approach using FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcripts per Million mapped reads<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) signals allowed clustering analysis and heat mapping of ChIP-seq signals, which confirmed once more hypomethylation of specific chromosomal loci in LC-HFSCs for all the marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f&#x02013;h</xref>). We conclude that LC-HFSCs show global hypomethylation of H3 K4/K9/K27me3 relative to EA-HFSCs, and that this is true for chromatin-bound H3 histones at specific and functional genome-wide elements.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Poor mRNA and H3 K4/K9/K27me3 correlation in quiescence</title><p>The global hypomethylation observed in LC-HFSCs prompted us to question the correlation between changes in levels of mRNAs and H3 K4/K9/K27me3 levels at specific TSS gene loci. We used our Affymetrix microarray data from sorted HFSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>, see the Methods for details) and selected 24,778 genes (for H3 K4/K9me3) and 10,345 genes (for H3K27me3) that showed detectable signal in either microarray or ChIP-seq analysis. We found that in LC-HFSCs, irrespective of changes in mRNA levels, &#x0223c;90&#x00025; genes with H3K4me3 or H3K9me3 on TSS and 64&#x00025; with H3K27me3 on TSS downregulated the mark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). As with the analysis of the whole genome, this was again most pronounced for H3K9me3 and least pronounced for H3K4me3. Our analysis of data from the study by Lien <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> showed similar reduction for H3K27me3 but not for H3K4me3 in LT-HFSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>); it is likely that H3K4me3 was already regained by the late telogen stage analysed in that study, as also suggested by our western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1j</xref>). Also note that normalization to IgG (not available for Lien <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) accounts for accessibility of antibodies to the chromatin and noticeably modify quantitative ChIP-seq data distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Comparison of EA-HFSCs and non-EA-HFSCs showed better correlation of mRNA and histone mark levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>), suggesting that the LC-HFSCs might represent a special case (see the Discussion for details).</p><p>Next, we asked if subsets of genes that we pre-define based on function, might be differentially methylated at the HFSCs transition to quiescence. General histone H3 K4/K9/K27me3 decrease at TSS in LC-HFSCs relative to EA-HFSCs was detectable in all functionally defined gene sets analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figs 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5a&#x02013;d</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>), with two notable exceptions. First, a relatively large fraction of Genes Upregulated at the mRNA level at all hair cycle stages in the Bulge (GUB) showed elevated H3K27me3 mark in LC-HFSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figs 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5a</xref>, arrow), whereas all other gene sets showed reduced H3K27me3 levels. Second, a set of genes previously defined as cell cycle regulators and skin tumour suppressors did not show a decrease of H3K4me3 level at the TSS in LC-HFSCs, like all the other gene sets did, and displayed a striking and atypical lack of H3K27me3 in both LC-HFSCs and EA-HFSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b,c</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). These data show that most TSSs lose their histone marks to some degree in LC-HFSCs, and this is irrespective of the mRNA level changes. This loss is most pronounced for H3K9me3, and least pronounced for H3K4me3, whereas H3K27me3 show intermediate decrease and special behaviour at specific gene sets, suggesting these are under specific regulation. These data suggest that the level of H3 K4/K9/K27me3 does not dictate mRNA levels in quiescent HFSCs at catagen.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>H3 K4/K9/K27me3 reduction in quiescence governs homeostasis</title><p>To examine how histone methyl mark levels are regulated, we considered three possibilities: (i) direct correlation with cell cycle entry; (ii) passive dilution over multiple divisions and (iii) changes in levels of histone-modifying enzymes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. We examined correlation with cell cycle entry by quantifying H3K9me3 immunofluorescence signal as foci-positive and -negative cells in CD34&#x0002b; bulge cells co-stained for proliferation markers 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) or Ki67 at anagen (PD25). We found that the majority (&#x0003e;70&#x00025;) of BrdU&#x0002b; and Ki67&#x0002b; HFSCs at anagen were H3K9me3 foci&#x0002b; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>, left), suggesting that actively cycling HFSCs are generally highly methylated. The un-methylated CD34&#x0002b; bulge cells (H3K9me3 foci&#x02212;) showed only 6&#x00025; proliferative (BrdU&#x0002b;) cells, whereas methylated CD34&#x0002b; cells showed 30&#x00025; BrdU&#x0002b; cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>, right). These data suggested that the high levels of marks and active cell cycle are somewhat, but not strictly, correlated in CD34&#x0002b; bulge cells at anagen. In fact, at late anagen (PD34) when HFSCs are already known to have exited cells cycle and entered G0 quiescence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, the level of marks appeared still high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). All these data suggested that H3K9me3 levels did not strictly correlate with cell cycle and were likely related to hair cycle stage.</p><p>Simultaneously, we had examined if hypomethylation was a result of marks being passively diluted over divisions that occurred in the bulge at anagen. We counted H3K9me3 foci-positive and -negative cells in CD34&#x0002b;/&#x003b1;6&#x0002b; HFSCs that were FACS separated based on their division history over one hair cycle.

This was in line with our observed high level of histone marks in EA-HFSCs and the decreased level in LC-HFSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>). A number of histone demethylases for each mark were also expressed in EA-HFSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6f</xref>, right) and these could be responsible for the decrease in marks we detected by late catagen. Most of these genes (with the exception of <italic>Jarid1a</italic>) were also downregulated by catagen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6f</xref>, right), which might indicate that LC-HFSCs reached a steady state that does not require maintenance of high levels of histone methylases or demethylases.</p><p>Next, we examined the potential implication of histone demethylases in erasure of histone H3 K4/K9/K27me3 marks in HFSCs at catagen, and probed the functional significance of these levels. We employed demethylase chemical inhibitors (DIs) known to be specific for H3 K4me3, K9me3 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) and K27me3 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>), shown by biochemical and structural studies to have potent and specific activities towards these modifications. We applied a cocktail of DI onto mouse back skin from anagen (PD32) up to different time points, and assessed the proliferation status of hair follicle in the subsequent hair cycle stage at early anagen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). We used mice from a 1:1 mixed (CD1 &#x000d7; Fvb) genetic background, which we previously found to have a relatively shorter second telogen and more consistent early onset of the second adult anagen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, than other common mouse strains. Western blot analysis of histones extracted from total mouse skin DI-treated for 7 days (PD32&#x02013;39; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>, scheme 1) showed increased histone methylation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b,c</xref>) confirming the activity of DI <italic>in vivo</italic>. Similarly, CD34&#x0002b; bulge cells also showed increased methylation levels by immunofluorescence and its quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d,e</xref>). When we interrogated timing of early anagen onset at the expected later stages (&#x0223c;PD56&#x02013;62), the mice treated with DI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>, scheme 2), showed a delay relative to untreated (no DI) mice both by morphology and by number of proliferative hair germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7f&#x02013;h</xref>). Finally, mice treated with DI in catagen (PD35&#x02013;42; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>, scheme 3) failed to grow new hair in the subsequent hair cycle when monitored long-term up to PD98, whereas control mice clearly showed hair shaft growth throughout substantial portions of the shaved region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7i</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of reducing H3 K4/K9/K27 trimethylation levels in the skin during quiescence for proper subsequent hair follicle homeostasis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>BMP signalling regulates H3 K4/K9/K27me3 levels</title><p>Because the decreased levels of methylation observed to occur by late catagen was apparent in the whole skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c&#x02013;g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a,b</xref>), we wondered if a skin diffusible factor might be implicated in regulation. Skin at catagen/telogen lacks diffusible proliferation signals, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and Wnt, and elevates inhibitory signals, such as BMP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Indeed, we find that intra-dermal injection of Noggin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>), a BMP antagonist<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, during the long second telogen was sufficient to increase the histone H3 K4/K9/K27me3 mark levels in bulge cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b,c</xref>) before activation of proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8d,e</xref>). Furthermore, withdrawal of serum (lack of proliferative signals) and addition of BMP4 (increase of repressive signal) in cultured keratinocytes downregulated a number of methylases and upregulated demethylases at their mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). Histone methylation levels did not change noticeably upon serum removal and addition of BMP4 during the 12-h course of this experiment, as judged by microscopy of immunofluorescence-labelled cells, suggesting demethylation might be a relatively slow process. Alternatively, <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions might not completely mimic the skin environment at catagen onset. Nevertheless, these results demonstrate that BMP signalling, known to induce and maintain HFSC quiescence <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> can also produce immediate changes in mRNA levels of methylases and demethylases in skin keratinocytes.

Moreover, we found that bulge HFSCs depend on active BMP signals <italic>in vivo</italic> to maintain low levels of histone H3 methylation.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our data suggest that quiescent HFSCs display chromatin features previously associated with high plasticity and low epigenetic identity in ESCs and in quiescent T-cell progenitors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. These are characterized by low levels of histone H3 K4/K9/K27me3 in HFSCs at catagen. Suggestively, this state occurs at the stage during hair homeostasis when quiescent HFSCs are most na&#x000ef;ve with respect to fate choice and are preparing for subsequent decisions to either differentiate or self-renew (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9</xref>). Strikingly, the global decrease in levels of histone H3 K4/K9/K27me3 we found at this stage did not affect the mRNA levels in the expected direction. One possible explanation is that steady-state mRNA levels detectable by microarrays are not an accurate reflection of active transcription, and that at catagen mRNA levels are determined by post-transcriptional regulation. Another possibility is that in quiescence (in the absence of cell division) methylation level does not have a direct impact on ongoing or active transcription. Methylation impact on transcription can occur not only by change in binding of transcription factors at functional elements, but also at the large-scale chromatin level. For instance, physical association <italic>in trans</italic> of genes with large heterochromatic structures (associated with high level of H3K9me3) could broadly enforce gene repression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Genome-wide changes in histone methylation levels suggest that regulation at the large-scale chromatin level may be present in the hair follicle homeostasis.</p><p>Histone methylation has been deemed a long-range type of epigenetic mark that enforces patterns of gene expression over <italic>multiple rounds of cell division</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. HFSCs do raise their H3 K4/K9/K27me3 levels back up at late telogen/early anagen, before onset of multiple rounds of imminent cell divisions. We propose methylation might be needed only in dividing cells to enforce inheritance of gene expression patterns both in the differentiating rapidly dividing matrix cells, as well as in dividing bulge cells. This way, the bulge-specific SC patterns of gene expression must be transmitted over the multiple (1&#x02013;5x) rounds of symmetric bulge-cell divisions that replenish the SC pool<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. During anagen, HFSCs remain confined to the bulge and do not differentiate to matrix or IL until they finish self-renewal, exit the cell cycle and pass once again through a new stage of G0 quiescence at catagen/telogen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. During this quiescence stage, we showed that the histone methyl marks are erased, perhaps reducing the strong identity of these cells as SCs. This &#x02018;erasure' could create an &#x02018;empty page' in the genome, onto which new marks could later on be rapidly and efficiently added in the required patterns to either make matrix (progenitors) or bulge (stem) cells later on when proliferation starts again. The pattern corresponding to make either one of the two possible fates (matrix versus bulge) would be dictated by the location of the HFSCs within the niche (bulge) or outside the niche (hair germ). This model would predict that maintaining the levels of histone methylation high throughout quiescence in SCs, would block them from adopting a normal hair germ fate, characterized by abilities for subsequent rapid activation and proliferation at anagen onset. As recent studies have shown, HFSCs possess heterogeneous behaviour with respect to their spatial positioning within the niche<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Thus, in the future, additional markers that would allow one to more finely tease apart different populations of HFSCs (that is, old bulge versus new bulge or upper bulge versus lower bulge) as well as the ability to sort SCs during early catagen (as they are migrating outside of their niche and are not yet established as new bulge versus hair germ cells), may be utilized to more directly probe the regulation of histone methylation in HFSC fate plasticity. With that said, before anagen onset it seems both hair germ cells and bulge cells retain the ability to interconvert<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, thus their plasticity likely remains high until proliferation onset, which might irreversibly seal their fate.</p><p>Because of multiple methylases and demethylases that are simultaneously expressed in the bulge, genetic targeting to simultaneously modulate H3 K4/K9/K27me3 levels in HFSCs is not trivial. Our chemical inhibition of three classes of demethylases during 1-week of catagen in which subsequent hair growth is extensively delayed, comes close in supporting our model, although it cannot exclude the possible effects from the environment. Further testing will be needed in future by creating epithelial-conditional mouse models with concomitant forced-expression of several methylases in each class and/or concomitant knockdown of multiple demethylases, to complement our chemical inhibition studies. The advent of new genetic targeting approaches<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> might make this endeavour feasible in the foreseeable future. Suggestively, overexpression <italic>of Ezh2</italic> in haematopoietic SCs promoted self-renewal at the expense of differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, supporting our model. Importantly, the onset and maintenance of both quiescence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> and low histone marks (this work) coincide and seem to be regulated via the same signals (BMP) that temporally and functionally couple these two processes in the tissue. Recent studies concur with our model, and suggest that BMP signalling greatly influences the outcome of bulge SC fate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, and pSmad1/5, a BMP effector, directly binds upstream of multiple histone demethylases in HFSCs from second telogen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. However, ChIP-seq of pSmad1/5 at catagen is not currently available, and it remains possible that the regulation of H3 K4/K9/K27me3 levels throughout the skin by BMP occurs indirectly, by secondary induction of an intermediate pathway.</p><p>That demethylation observed at catagen occurs throughout the skin and is not epithelial specific is interesting, and is possible that BMP works in parallel with other signals at this stage to influence levels of methylation in different skin compartments. This is especially relevant as nuclear pSmad1/5 is only detected in the hair follicle but not in the epidermis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. In cell culture, loss of proliferative signals influence methylase/demethylase mRNA expression in a manner similar to the addition of BMP (this work). Thus, it is possible that lack of proliferative (that is, Wnt) signals <italic>in vivo</italic>, might influence the level of methylation in different skin compartments, such as epidermis, at catagen. Indeed, recent studies suggest that &#x003b2;-catenin is highly present in the basal layer of interfollicular epidermis and modulates transcription of demethylases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, some of which are crucial for epidermal self-renewal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Finally, in HFSCs, the Wnt pathway effector TCF3/4 directly binds to promoters of demethylases, suggesting direct transcriptional regulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Thus, the coupling between signalling, histone-modifying enzymes and methylation levels in different skin compartments, as well as their overall impact in skin biology might involve complex signalling networks that require further investigation.</p><p>Finally, it will be interesting to examine how the level of histone H3 methylation marks might interface with other mechanisms of HFSC plasticity. Recently, it has been shown that HFSCs are characterized by the activity of a number of super-enhancers that have been defined as chromatin domains with high levels of H3 K27 acetylation, low levels of H3K27me3 and the clustering of mediator together with specific HFSC transcription factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. These domains are remodelled during differentiation as well as in injury and culturing conditions, but it is unclear what their status might be during catagen, when global hypomethylation is instated in HFSCs, and how this status might compare with self-renewing HFSCs during early anagen when methylation levels are globally high.</p><p>In conclusion, our work suggests an intriguing model in which tissue SC quiescence and genome plasticity are linked by signals that temporally couple tissue homeostasis with histone H3 K4/K9/K27me3 hypomethylation. Our model might be relevant to other tissue SC systems. Many, although not all, tissue SCs are preferentially quiescent and/or undergo dynamic stochastic or environmentally driven choices of either differentiation or self-renewal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. The most potent haematopoietic SCs reside in G0 quiescence and divide only five times in a lifetime<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Notably, quiescent muscle SCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> and quiescent progenitor T cells also displayed globally hypo-methylated histones, and this state enhanced reprogramming efficiency in cultured T cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Thus, quiescence and plasticity, two fundamental characteristics of many tissue SCs, might be coupled via homeostatic signals and specialized chromatin states in tissues beyond hair follicles. It will be interesting to explore if hypomethylation plays a role in plasticity of not only quiescent but also more actively cycling tissue SCs, such as those of the intestine. These SCs might resemble more the situation recently described for proliferating progenitor cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, where genes that change expression dramatically during development lack methylation marks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Perhaps hypomethylation may be differentially implemented in distinct contexts to promote similar outcomes of enhancing plasticity for proper cell fate determination.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mice, growth factor-beads injections</title><p>All mice were treated according to Cornell University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocols.

However, the number of reads was not sufficient for H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 to be saturated by MACS. This is not uncommon as both histone marks are broadly enriched throughout the genome. Therefore, to get a better representation of the distribution and enriched regions, we pooled reads from experimental replicates and analysed them together subsequently. In the end, for each sample, there were between 10 and 40 million uniquely mapped reads (except for IgG, which were between 5 and 20 million reads).</p><p>Conditions used for MACS are listed below.</p><p>For H3K4me4: macs14&#x02014;tsize=70&#x02014;<italic>P</italic>-value=1e-5&#x02014;keep-dup=2&#x02014;nomodel&#x02014;mfold=10,40.</p><p>For H3K27me3 and H3K9me3: macs14&#x02014;tsize=70&#x02014;<italic>P</italic>-value=1e-4&#x02014;keep-dup=2&#x02014;nomodel&#x02014;mfold=5,40.</p><p>IgG for each population was used as control for all peak calling.</p><p>Conditions used for HOMER are listed below.</p><p>findPeaks -d &#x0003c;tag directory&#x0003e; -style histone -tbp 2 -o auto -i &#x0003c;IgG tag directory&#x0003e; -F 5</p><p>Interestingly, in both analyses, number of peaks called in LC-HFSCs was significantly less than in EA-HFSCs for all three histone modification marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). This was not due to the smaller number of reads sequenced. In fact, more reads were used in the LC-HFSCs (&#x0223c;30&#x02013;40 million) than in the EA-HFSCs (&#x0223c;10&#x02013;30 million). These suggest that the reads in LC-HFSCs are either not significantly enriched relative to the background or are more spread out throughout the genome.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Quantification of ChIP-seq reads</title><p>The primary purpose of peak calling is to identify a specific region of enrichment over the background. The peak calling methods generally calculate the fold enrichment relative to background in a given window. Thus, these values are not necessarily quantitative and comparable across different genomic regions and more importantly, are not directly comparable between two samples. To more quantitatively measure and directly compare enrichment among samples, we developed an alternative ChIP-seq analyses method.</p><p>We first called peaks using MACS for all marks in all populations using methods described in the section Peak calling. The peaks were merged, sorted and overlapping regions were combined to generate one customized annotation file containing all genomic regions displaying peaks in any of the populations analysed. This file was used to extract either the tag density (HOMER) or FPKM (Cuffdiff) values, using an RNAseq analysis pipeline. The values extracted are quantitative and are comparable across samples since both values are normalized to the overall number of mapped reads.</p><p>Using this approach, we identified 201,178 loci that cover &#x0223c;330&#x02009;Mb (&#x0223c;12&#x00025;) of the total genome. These regions included various sites of TSS/promoters, exons, introns, intergenic regions, CpGs, untranslated regions, non-coding RNAs and multiple repeat sequences. After subtracting the normalized IgG signal at each locus, cluster analysis was performed to generate a heat map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). We also used other pre-annotated files available in HOMER (such as TSS) to quantify and compare the reads at or around those sites. Normalized data were used in all ChIP-seq analyses done in this study except for when comparing normalized to the pre-normalized samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Correlation of histone marks and gene expression</title><p>For gene expression, previous microarray data sets were used. Briefly, K5tTA &#x000d7; pTRE-H2B-GFP transgenic mice were doxy-induced from PD18&#x02013;21 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), PD22&#x02013;25 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) or PD21&#x02013;42 (unpublished T. Tumbar and Y. V. Zhang). Cells from different H2B-GFP division peaks were sorted from the bulge and non-bulge. For correlation analyses done in this paper, signals from multiple peaks were combined based on the fraction of cells in each population, in order to reconstitute a single bulge signal for PD25 and PD42. Next, the reconstituted signals were divided between PD42 and PD25 bulges to get the fold changes of all genes. The fold changes were converted into log<sub>2</sub> scale. For correlation between LC-HFSCs and non-LC-HFSCs, the PD42 non-bulge (CD34-) signals and the reconstituted PD42 bulge signals were compared. The reconstituted array signals are included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>.</p><p>ChIP-seq reads from EA-HFSCs, LC-HFSCs and non-LC-HFSCs were quantified at 5&#x02009;kb spanning the TSSs (HOMER). Quantified reads were IgG normalized. The signals were divided between EA-HFSCs and LC-HFSCs, or between LC-HFSCs and non-LC-HFSCs to get the fold changes of all genes. The fold changes were converted into log<sub>2</sub> scale. These values were matched with array signal for each gene. The data were then converted into density and plotted using R.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional information</title><p><bold>Accession codes:</bold> ChIP-seq data have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database under accession code <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="NCBI:geo" xlink:href="GSE78749">GSE78749</ext-link>.</p><p><bold>How to cite this article:</bold> Lee, J. <italic>et al</italic>.

Hair follicle stem cells at this stage are faced with a bidirectional cell fate choice to (i) remain as a stem cell in the bulge and self-renew at anagen or (ii) migrate out from their niche before division and eventually become a progenitor matrix cell that fuel the hair growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Signalling (that is, BMP) that plays a crucial role in regulating quiescence of hair follicle stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, also may control the level of multiple histone-modifying enzymes, leading to a global reduction of several key histone modification marks previously implicated in transcriptional activation or repression. Such global reduction in histone marks may place the quiescent hair follicle stem cell epigenome at a &#x02018;blank' (or a plastic) state. This would subsequently allow efficient re-writing of the methylation marks throughout the genome in the pattern required to enforce the ultimate cell fate choice. The latter is dictated by the ultimate position within the niche in which the quiescent stem cell finds itself at the onset of hair growth.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ncomms11278-f9"/></fig></floats-group></article>
