Therefore, a reverse strategy, which identifies functionally important SNPs by virtue of the bimodal abundance across the human population of the SNP-related mRNAs will be useful. Those mRNA transcripts that are expressed at two distinct abundances in proportion to SNP allele frequency may warrant further study. Matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) is important in both normal development and in numerous pathologies. Although much research has been conducted to investigate the expression of <italic>MMP1 </italic>in many different cell types and conditions, the regulation of its expression is still not fully understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this study, we used a novel but straightforward method based on agglomerative hierarchical clustering to identify bimodally expressed transcripts in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) microarray data from 15 individuals. We found that <italic>MMP1 </italic>mRNA abundance was bimodally distributed in un-treated HUVECs and showed a bimodal response to inflammatory mediator treatment. RT-PCR and MMP1 activity assays confirmed the bimodal regulation and DNA sequencing of 69 individuals identified an <italic>MMP1 </italic>gene promoter polymorphism that segregated precisely with the <italic>MMP1 </italic>bimodal expression.

There has been much interest given to the identification of bimodally expressed mRNA transcripts, particularly in the context of cancer, where two distinct populations of patients can be defined by differing levels of a set of specific transcripts. These make excellent candidate biomarkers and often tend to show good correlation between transcript and protein abundance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. To this end, statistical approaches using mixture-model based clustering combined with either Akaike information criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian informatics criterion (BIC) have frequently been applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. One method based on systematic classification of gene expression profiles has been applied to over 2,000 microarray samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These methods have a strong theoretical base and have proven successful in identifying bimodality. However, they do depend on the investigator having a relatively high level of statistical understanding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In this study we suggest a simple screening approach based on hierarchical clustering to identify bimodally expressed transcripts from microarray expression data that can be used alongside more complex approaches. While this method is not motivated by statistical theory, it appears to work well and is easily understood by laboratory scientists with only basic statistical training, who are in a good position to immediately follow up their results experimentally.</p><p>The matrix metalloproteinase, MMP1, is one of the most abundant proteases in the matrix metalloproteinase family. It is capable of degrading type I, II and III collagens, and is one of only four MMPs able to degrade triple helical collagens. It therefore plays a pivotal role in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling in both normal development and pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. MMP1 is tightly regulated at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels. It is produced as a zymogen that is activated by serine proteases and its activity is regulated by inhibitors such as the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase's (TIMPs), which compete with the substrate for the enzyme active site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>MMP1 plays a clinically important role in inflammatory disease, and has been implicated in numerous pathological processes including wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], tumour metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The <italic>MMP-1 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] contains a 1G/2G polymorphism in its promoter at -1607 from the transcriptional start site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This polymorphism has been associated with increased <italic>MMP-1 </italic>expression in several cell types including; melanoma, stromal fibroblast, MCF-7/ADR breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and with several pathologies including: tumour metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], periodontitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Using our simple clustering method to examine RNA transcript abundance in HUVECs isolated from 15 different human individuals, we identified <italic>MMP1 </italic>as one of a small group of RNAs expressed in a bimodal manner in both un-treated endothelial cells, and in endothelial cells treated by inflammatory mediators. Our results suggest that the regulation of <italic>MMP1 </italic>expression is a complex process that is modulated by a promoter polymorphism around the binding sites for several TFs including ETS1, ETS2 and GATA3.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of mRNA transcripts with bimodal expression patterns among a set of individuals</title><p>Bimodally or multimodally expressed mRNA transcripts were defined as those transcripts for which two or more distinct populations of expression values were observed among a set of individuals. To identify and visualise bimodally expressed transcripts, we devised a simple algorithm (written as a script in the statistical language 'R'; Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) based on unsupervised agglomerative hierarchical clustering. The algorithm can be used as either a simple 'R' script, or for use in graphical user interface it can be supplied as a GenePattern module on request (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/">http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/</ext-link>). It is illustrated schematically in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and described in the methods section. Briefly, on a transcript-by-transcript basis, agglomerative hierarchical clustering across the dataset was carried out. The maximum cluster branch height identified for each transcript was approximately proportional to the greatest distance between the any two clusters of individuals, and is used here a surrogate marker for the degree of bimodal expression. To estimate the probability of transcripts appearing to be bimodally expressed due to chance alone we used a parametric bootstrapping method. Related methods where trees are constructed from re-sampled data have been used previously to assess the reliability of clusters in gene expression data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. As is often the case with microarray transcript abundance data, our log-transformed data approximated a normal distribution. Therefore, for each transcript we made a maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters of a normally distributed population from which the sample of individuals being studied may have been drawn. These parameters (mean and standard deviation) were then used to generate 10,000 simulated datasets for the transcript, each of which was clustered as described above. From the 10,000 clustering results we identified how frequently the largest distance between clusters &#x02265; the largest distance between clusters in the actual data set. This information is used generate an empirical p-value as an estimate of type I error rate.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Flow diagram of method to identify bimodally expressed transcripts from expression data</bold>. (A) Transcript abundance is quantified by microarray or RNAseq techniques. (B) On a transcript-by-transcript basis, agglomerative clustering across the dataset is carried out. The algorithm starts by assigning the same number of clusters as individuals (in this example 10 clusters were assigned since there are 10 individuals). The clusters are then progressively merged by combining the two most similar clusters, using Wards method to calculate the distance between clusters and Euclidian distance to calculate dissimilarities between the individuals. The distances between the merging clusters are recorded by the algorithm as branch "heights". The height values at either side of the dendrogram are removed to exclude transcripts that falsely appear to be bimodally expressed due to a single outlying individual. The maximum remaining branch height value (indicated by the red arrow) is identified for each transcript, which represents the greatest distance between the any two clusters of individuals, and is used a surrogate marker for the degree of bimodal expression for that particular transcript. (C) To estimate the probability of transcripts appearing to be bimodally expressed due to chance alone, for each transcript we make a maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters of the distribution of this transcript's abundance across the population from which the individuals being studied have been drawn. We use these parameters to generate 10,000 simulated datasets, each of which is clustered as described in (B) above. (D) In the 10,000 clusters formed from the bootstrapped data sets for this transcript, we identify how commonly the largest distance between clusters &#x02265; the largest distance between clusters in the actual data set. This information is shown graphically and is used generate an empirical p-value as an estimate of type I error rate.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-12-43-1"/></fig><p>This algorithm was applied to two RNA microarray data sets: (i) data from HUVECs from 15 different human individuals cultured to passage 4 in standard conditions (the untreated data set; UT) and (ii) data from passage 4 HUVECs from nine different human individuals cultured with a cocktail of 10 ng/ml TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-8 for 24 hours (the IM-treated data set; IM).

In each of the un-treated and IM-treated data sets, a relatively small group of transcripts with high maximum branch height and high -log2 p were identified.

This analysis revealed in addition to the ETS binding domain spanning the polymorphic region, AP-1 and GATA3 binding sites were located 44 bp and 5 bp respectively downstream from the polymorphism. To determine whether these TFs actually bind to this region of the <italic>MMP1 </italic>gene promoter, immunoprecipitation using antibodies against c-fos, ETS1, ETS2 and GATA3 was carried out in HUVECs isolated from two individuals of 1G genotype and in HUVECs isolated from two individuals of 2G genotype cultured in both IM and UT conditions. Quantitative PCR was used to measure the enrichment of the immunoprecipitated region (157 bp region, adjacent to an ETS, GATA3, AP-1 and NFKB binding site), relative to a 173 bp region positioned 5600 bases upstream of the polymorphism that contained no relevant motifs.

The aim of this experiment was to identify potential TF binding around the polymorphism, not to compare the degree of enrichment between IG and 2G individuals or between UT or IM cultured cells, which was impossible due to the small study size and variable degree of enrichment between individuals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).

This study suggests a complementary strategy, whereby we first identified those transcripts that showed bimodal expression levels, and then identified the polymorphism responsible for this differential expression. Clustering methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and statistical methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] have previously been used to identify bimodal expression in large datasets. These methods have the advantage of being motivated by strong theoretical statistical considerations. However, they also require a moderate level of statistical understanding, and in addition some of these methods can only be easily applied to large-scale meta-analysis of several data sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and may be less suitable for small expression data sets generated in a single laboratory. The approach we suggest is able to be used alongside more complex approaches by laboratory scientists with only basic statistical training, who are in a good position to immediately follow up their results experimentally. We believe that for bioinformatic tasks such as this, providing several complimentary methods that span the continuum of statistical complexity is important in order to bridge the gap between experimental biologists and statisticians.</p><p>Our clustering strategy successfully identified the abundance of several mRNA transcripts including <italic>MMP1 </italic>as bimodally distributed in human endothelial cells in both resting and inflammatory mediator-treated conditions. Up-regulated <italic>MMP1 </italic>expression has been associated with many pathologies in which endothelial cells are involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We sequenced the region spanning the well characterised polymorphism at -1607 from the transcription start site in the <italic>MMP-1 </italic>promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and found that this polymorphism was strongly associated with the bimodal expression observed in the HUVEC dataset. Individuals either homozygous or heterozygous for the 2G polymorphism at -1607 possessed constitutively higher levels of <italic>MMP1 </italic>(over 100 fold relative to the 1G isolates, P &#x0003c; 0.0001), implying a dominant effect of the 2G allele. This contrasts with previous findings in fibroblasts, where marginal differences in the basal levels of <italic>MMP1 </italic>between the 1G and 2G isolates were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Inflammatory mediator treatment revealed a differential response in MMP1 stimulation between HUVEC isolates homozygous for the 1G allele and those possessing the 2G allele. Whereas <italic>MMP1 </italic>mRNA levels were increased in all isolates homozygous for the 1G allele; in isolates possessing the 2G allele, <italic>MMP1 </italic>mRNA levels were essentially unchanged (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Regulation at the level of MMP1 enzyme activity mirrored this response to inflammatory mediator treatment. One possibility is that <italic>MMP1 </italic>expression is at maximum levels in the 2G isolates, even under the basal condition. In leukocytes continuously treated with high doses of inflammatory mediators (50 ng/ml, of TNF-&#x003b1; and Il-1&#x003b2;, 2 or 3 times over 24hrs), <italic>MMP1 </italic>mRNA levels are genotype independent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Whether this is the case in HUVECs remains to be determined.</p><p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was conducted to investigate the potential involvement of TFs that have putative response elements spanning the polymorphism. We found that three TFs bound to this polymorphic region of the <italic>MMP1 </italic>promoter in endothelial cells. Using nuclear extracts from fibroblast and A2058 melanoma cells, Rutter et al. previously demonstrated that recombinant ETS1 binds strongly to the 2<italic>G </italic>promoter and weakly to the 1<italic>G </italic>promoter and that this binding is dependent on cooperation with an adjacent AP1 site at -1602 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Their study along with others have revealed that several members of the AP1 family, including c-JUN, Fra and Fos, are involved in the heterodimmer complexes bound at this cooperative AP1 site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. While the limited ChIP analysis we have performed clearly indicated that GATA3, Fos, Ets1 and Ets2 do indeed bind to this region of the <italic>MMP1 </italic>promoter, further studies using larger numbers of individuals will be required to identify differential binding between genotypes or cell culture conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Identifying the functional importance of the millions of human SNPs is becoming a major challenge. Simultaneously, the amount of available RNA transcriptome data is rapidly growing, driving scientists to devise new methods to extract the most biologically and clinically useful information from RNA abundance profiles. Therefore, a strategy that identifies functionally important SNPs by virtue of the bimodal abundance across the human population of the associated mRNAs is potentially very useful. Here, we discuss a simple method based on hierarchical clustering to identify bimodally expressed transcripts, which may be used with either microarray or RNAseq data. This method complements more statistically complex approaches and is suitable for use by laboratory scientists with only basic statistical training, who are in a good position to immediately follow up their results experimentally. This strategy identified bimodal endothelial cell expression of several transcripts including <italic>MMP1</italic>, which appears to be biologically significant with implications for inflammatory disease and for understanding the complex relationships between TFs and polymorphic promoter elements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and IM treatment</title><p>Umbilical cords were collected after written informed consent and the study was approved by the Cambridge Research Ethics Committee.

To carry out inflammatory mediator treatment for microarray gene expression profiling, passage 4 HUVECs were treated with a cocktail of 10 ng/ml TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-8 for 24 hours prior to RNA extraction.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA processing and microarray preparation and data processing</title><p>RNA was extracted using TRIzol<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>reagent (Invitrogen, London UK). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyser. Biotin labelled cRNA was generated and hybridised on the CodeLink Human Uniset 20K microarrays following the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Microarrays, formally supplied by GE Healthcare). CodeLink microarray data was pre-processed to assess array quality using the CodeLink Expression analysis software v4.0. To enable comparable analysis between arrays, normalisation was carried out using the cyclic Loess method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The microarray data has been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and can be accessed through GEO series accession number GSE23070.</p></sec><sec><title>Bimodal analysis of microarray expression data</title><p>To identify bimodally expressed RNA transcripts, RNA was prepared from passage 4 HUVECs isolated from 15 different individuals and analysed using CodeLink Human Uniset 20K microarrays (the untreated (UT) data set). In addition, passage 4 HUVECs isolated from 9 different individuals were each treated with 10 ng/ml of each of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, Il-8, and analysed using microarrays as described above (the inflammatory mediator treated (IM) data set). Unsupervised agglomerative clustering was then applied separately to the UT and IM data sets to enrich for multimodality, using R bioinformatic software (freely available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cran.r-project.org/">http://cran.r-project.org/</ext-link>). For each transcript, our algorithm recorded the "height" (Euclidian distance) between the clusters. The height values at either end of the cluster dendrogram were discarded to remove cases where the clustering identified a single outlying individual, and the largest remaining height value was used as an indicator of bimodality/multimodality. For those RNAs with signal intensities that were similar across the set of individuals, the height between clusters is likely to be small. However, where there were two or more distinct clusters of expression values among the set of individuals, the height between clusters is likely to be large. In addition, parametric bootstrapping was carried out during the clustering process to identify the likelihood of identifying the given height value for each gene based on chance alone, as summarised in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and in the comments within the R script in Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. To be strictly statistically correct, the permutation p-values should be adjusted for multiple testing. For example the Benjamini &#x00026; Hochberg procedure could be used to control the false discovery rate by applying the mt.rawp2adjp function of the 'multtest' R package to the p-values produced from the bootstrap procedure described here. However, this is not included in the current iteration of our method, since it does not alter the ranking of the permutation p-values assigned to each RNA, and it appears to be overly stringent since it masks both of the bimodally-expressed RNAs that were experimentally confirmed in our study. Nevertheless, if larger data sets are analysed, from which the degree of bimodal expression and population distribution parameters for each RNA can be estimated more precisely, it may be worth experimenting with various multiple testing control procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Inflammatory mediator time course and immunoblotting</title><p>For the inflammatory mediator time course, passage 4 HUVECs were treated with a cocktail of 10 ng/ml of each of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-8 for up to 3.5 hours.
