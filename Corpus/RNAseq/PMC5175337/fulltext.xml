TCS are in most cases transcriptional regulators. A large class of sRNAs act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression that modulate the translation and/or stability of target-mRNAs. Many connections have been recently unraveled between these two types of regulators, resulting in mixed regulatory circuits with poorly characterized properties. This study focuses on the negative feedback circuit that exists between the EnvZ-OmpR TCS and the OmrA/B sRNAs. We have shown that OmpR directly activates transcription from the <italic>omrA</italic> and <italic>omrB</italic> promoters, allowing production of OmrA/B sRNAs that target multiple mRNAs, including the <italic>ompR-envZ</italic> mRNA. This control of <italic>ompR-envZ</italic> by the Omr sRNAs does not affect the amount of phosphorylated OmpR, i.e. the presumably active form of the regulator. Accordingly, expression of robust OmpR targets, such as the <italic>ompC</italic> or <italic>ompF</italic> porin genes, is not affected by OmrA/B. However, we find that several OmpR targets, including OmrA/B themselves, are sensitive to changing total OmpR levels. As a result, OmrA/B limit their own synthesis. These findings unravel an additional layer of control in the expression of some OmpR targets and suggest the existence of differential regulation within the OmpR regulon.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>16 November 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Regulation of gene expression plays a crucial role in the rapid adaptation of bacteria to their environment, a process that allows them to colonize and survive in various media. This control can take place at all stages of gene expression and via a great diversity of precise molecular mechanisms.</p><p>For instance, examples of transcriptional control have been reported at the level of transcription initiation, elongation or termination, and the regulators can be DNA- or RNA-binding proteins, but also RNA molecules. Among the most widely used regulators of transcription in bacteria are the two-component systems (TCS), which are typically composed of a sensor protein and its cognate response regulator (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In response to specific stimuli, the sensor controls the phosphorylation status of the regulator by acting as a kinase and/or as a phosphatase. In the phosphorylated state, the regulator typically controls transcription of multiple genes. More than 30 TCS have been identified in the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> genome and allow both sensing and adaptation to the environment, in response to extremely diverse input signals, such as phosphate limitation, low magnesium, pH or osmolarity.</p><p>EnvZ-OmpR is one of the most extensively studied TCS (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). EnvZ autophosphorylates upon sensing cognate stimuli and controls the level of phosphorylated OmpR (OmpR-P). Even though the precise signal detected by EnvZ is still unclear, it is known that signals such as increasing osmolarity, temperature or acid pH (among others) induce the activity of the EnvZ-OmpR TCS (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). OmpR directly controls the transcription of several genes, in particular those encoding the major porins in <italic>E. coli</italic>, OmpC and OmpF. While <italic>ompC</italic> expression is activated in conditions of high osmolarity (high OmpR-P), OmpR represses or activates <italic>ompF</italic> expression in high and low osmolarity, respectively (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and references therein). In addition to these two genes, OmpR also directly controls transcription of other genes such as <italic>dtpA</italic> (a.k.a. <italic>tppB</italic>) (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), <italic>flhDC</italic> (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), <italic>csgD</italic> (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and <italic>bolA</italic> (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), that respectively encode an oligopeptide transporter, the regulator for flagella biogenesis, the activator of curli production and a transcriptional regulator also involved in controlling the switch from a planktonic to a sessile lifestyle (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Note that regulation of <italic>dtpA</italic> by EnvZ-OmpR was investigated in detail; interestingly, it is different from regulation of both <italic>ompC</italic> and <italic>ompF</italic> in that <italic>dtpA</italic> transcription does not seem to respond to changes in osmolarity (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Furthermore, OmpR was found to bind to several dozen sites in both <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> in a recent ChIP-on-chip analysis, indicating the existence of more direct targets (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Although the OmpR regulons were found to differ in the two species, with only a few common targets, OmpR controls genes involved in pH homeostasis and acid stress response in both <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic>. In agreement with this, OmpR appears to play an important role in acid resistance (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). At least 4 small RNAs (sRNAs) are also known to be controlled by EnvZ-OmpR: MicC, MicF, OmrA and OmrB (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) (see below).</p><p>Regulatory RNAs have emerged as major regulators of gene expression in recent years, in virtually all organisms. In bacteria, they are typically rather short (a few hundred nts or less) and are therefore referred to as small RNAs (sRNAs). So far, the best characterized class corresponds to sRNAs that can base-pair with target-mRNA(s) encoded by another locus of the genome and, as a result, regulate either positively or negatively, their translation and/or stability (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). This base-pairing is in most cases mediated by short and imperfect sRNA-mRNA duplexes and in several bacterial species, such as <italic>E. coli</italic> for instance, requires the action of an hexameric RNA chaperone called Hfq (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Base-pairing sRNAs are involved in the regulation of diverse cellular functions as crucial as iron homeostasis or quorum-sensing. Interestingly, many sRNAs target genes that encode outer membrane proteins (OMP) or are involved in synthesis of membrane appendages such as curli or flagella (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>); this is true in particular for the various OmpR-dependent sRNAs. MicC and MicF were, for instance, shown to repress expression of <italic>ompC</italic> and <italic>ompF</italic> porin genes, respectively (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In addition, MicC also represses the synthesis of OmpD, another abundant porin in <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). OmrA/B are involved in membrane remodeling as well, since they negatively regulate the synthesis of several OMPs, such as the OmpT protease and the CirA, FecA and FepA receptors for iron-siderophore complexes (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). They also repress the synthesis of several transcriptional regulators such as CsgD (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and FlhD<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), the key regulators for curli formation and flagella biogenesis respectively, as well as the EnvZ-OmpR TCS, their own transcriptional activator (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>sRNAs play major roles in shaping gene expression in bacteria. They are involved in different regulatory circuits, and they most often participate in mixed regulatory networks that combine transcriptional and post-transcriptional controls, mediated by proteins and sRNAs respectively (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). While the occurrence of sRNAs in these circuits is clearly recognized, the properties they can provide are still poorly understood in most cases. sRNAs were in particular reported in feedforward motifs (FFM), where a regulator controls expression of a target gene both directly and indirectly via control of another regulator. The Spot 42 sRNA participates, for instance, in a multioutput coherent FFM with the global regulator CRP to repress expression of multiple genes involved in the use of diverse non-preferred carbon sources. Interestingly, this mixed FFM allowed an accelerated response following circuit deactivation, a dynamic property that had not been observed before with purely transcriptional FFM, suggesting a unique role for sRNAs in these motifs (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). FFM can also involve positively acting sRNAs: RprA sRNA is an activator of the synthesis of RicI, a membrane protein that inhibits conjugation, both by direct base-pairing with the <italic>ricI</italic> mRNA and via positive control of RpoS. Because the resulting mixed coherent FFM operates with an AND-logic (i.e. both RprA and RpoS are required for <italic>ricI</italic> activation), it ensures that synthesis of RicI, and hereby conjugation inhibition, occurs under sustained activation of RprA only, with a delay in comparison to the synthesis of RpoS (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p><p>Another recurrent motif involving sRNAs and regulatory proteins is the feedback circuit where one regulator controls and is controlled by a second regulator. This study focuses on one example of such a feedback: the direct repression of <italic>ompR-envZ</italic> expression by OmrA/B, whose transcription is activated by this TCS. Our findings reveal an exquisite elaboration in the way in which the well-studied EnvZ-OmpR TCS works, which allows for autocontrol of OmrA/B.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Strains and plasmids, general microbiology techniques</title><p>Strains used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1 and their construction is described in supplementary material.

Furthermore, recent OmpR ChIP experiments suggest direct binding of OmpR to these promoters, indicating that activation by OmpR is direct regulation (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). To further investigate this, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription reactions were performed using templates driven from the <italic>omrA</italic> or <italic>omrB</italic> promoter in presence of increasing amounts of OmpR, phosphorylated or not; the <italic>ompC</italic> promoter was included as a positive control for activation by OmpR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). All three promoters, (starting 114 nts upstream of the TSS for <italic>omrA/B</italic> or 437 nts upstream for <italic>ompC</italic>), were cloned in the pRLG770 vector (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), allowing the production of &#x0223c;200 nt-transcripts carrying the first 50 nts of each RNA fused to 5S rRNA. An N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tagged version of OmpR (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) was purified and, when indicated, phosphorylated <italic>in vitro</italic> in the presence of acetylphosphate. The efficiency of the phosphorylation reaction was systemically assessed for each experiment and was reproducibly found to be around 50% (Supplementary Figure S1C). In these experiments, OmpR or OmpR-P was used at 25-, 50- and 125-fold excess over the template DNA (in molar ratio), which corresponds to a concentration of respectively 15, 30, 75 nM; an additional concentration of 250-fold (or 150 nM) was also included for unphosphorylated OmpR. As a comparison, total OmpR cellular concentration was estimated at 3500 OmpR molecules per cell (ca. 3.5 &#x003bc;M) (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) with &#x0223c;25% being phosphorylated in the presence of procaine or sucrose (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The transcription products were separated on a sequencing gel and normalized to the RNA1 transcript (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>; a full representative gel is shown in Supplementary Figure S1). Transcription of <italic>ompC</italic> was, as expected, dependent on OmpR-P, but only at the highest concentration; in this condition, <italic>ompC</italic> transcription was activated by 1.9-fold relative to the control without OmpR. OmpR-P had a stronger effect on the <italic>omr</italic> promoters: a 50-fold excess of OmpR-P allowed activation of transcription from both the <italic>omrA</italic> and <italic>omrB</italic> promoters (by 1.9- and 1.5-fold, respectively, relative to the controls without OmpR) while a 125-fold excess further increased <italic>omr</italic> transcription (by 4.2- and 4.7-fold respectively). In contrast, the unphosphorylated form of OmpR did not significantly activate transcription from these three promoters. As an additional control, transcription driven by two non-OmpR-regulated promoters was studied as well. The first control promoter is a truncated version of P<sub>omrA</sub>, starting only 60 nts upstream of the TSS, which is not sufficient to allow activation by OmpR <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The second control is the promoter of SgrS, another Hfq-dependent sRNA, whose transcription responds to phosphosugar stress via the SgrR activator and is independent of OmpR (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> and see below). Addition of OmpR, phosphorylated or not, had no effect on transcription originating from either control promoter, showing that the <italic>in vitro</italic> activation of <italic>omrA, omrB</italic> or <italic>ompC</italic> transcription is specific (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Altogether, these results strongly suggest that the previously reported control of OmrA or OmrB by EnvZ-OmpR is direct.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>OmpR-P activates <italic>omrA</italic> and <italic>omrB</italic> transcription <italic>in vitro</italic>.

When indicated, OmpR was added at a molar ratio of 25, 50, 125 and 250 with the template DNA, and OmpR-P at a molar ratio of 25, 50 and 125.

For this purpose, we chose to analyze expression of <italic>lacZ</italic> fusions to the promoters of <italic>omrA/B</italic> in strains carrying different mutant alleles of <italic>envZ</italic> or <italic>ompR</italic>.

EnvZ390 was isolated in a screen for EnvZ mutants that were deficient in kinase activity but that retained phosphatase activity (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). With such a mutant, the level of phosphorylated OmpR is therefore expected to be low. In contrast, the EnvZ473 mutant retained kinase activity, but lost its phosphatase activity; the level of OmpR-P should therefore be high (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). This was confirmed <italic>in vivo</italic> through protein electrophoresis in acrylamide gels containing Phos-Tag, a phosphate chelator that allows separation of phosphorylated proteins (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), followed by immunoblotting with an OmpR specific antibody (a kind gift from Dr Ann Stock). In the wt strain, OmpR-P was detected after treatment with procaine, an anesthetic known to activate the EnvZ-OmpR TCS. In the <italic>envZ390</italic> and <italic>envZ473</italic> strains, our results confirmed the respectively low and high levels of OmpR-P, with or without procaine (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>; an independent experiment is shown in Supplementary Figure S2A). In the <italic>envZ473</italic> mutant strain, note that the vast majority of total OmpR was phosphorylated, which differs from what was observed by Barbieri <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). These differences were found to be due to the different strains used in the two studies, an MC4100 derivative in (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and an MG1655 derivative in this study (Supplementary Figure S2B). Another striking result from Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> is that the level of total OmpR was significantly increased in the <italic>envZ473</italic> allele. This result was confirmed when the same extracts were separated on a classical sodium dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel (Supplementary Figure S2C).

The mutant representatives of these two classes used in this study are, for ompR2, <italic>ompR472</italic>, where Val203 is changed to Met and, for ompR3, <italic>ompR107</italic>, where Arg15 is changed to Cys. These two mutants were reported to be defective in dephosphorylation (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). In previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, OmpR107 bound to <italic>ompC</italic> and <italic>ompF</italic> promoters similarly to the wt protein, whereas OmpR472 displayed a higher affinity for the <italic>ompF</italic> promoter region and a weaker affinity for <italic>ompC</italic> (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Again, Phos-Tag electrophoresis confirmed the increase in the OmpR-P/OmpR ratio in these two mutant strains <italic>in vivo</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and Supplementary Figure S2A).</p><p>We then compared the effect of the various mutants on <italic>omrA, omrB, ompC</italic> and <italic>ompF</italic> transcription. For this purpose, we constructed <italic>lacZ</italic> fusions to the promoters of each of these genes, carrying all upstream sequences known to be required for regulation by OmpR (see Supplementary Figure S3 for a schematic representation of the different fusions used in this work, and experimental procedures for details). As expected, expression of the four resulting fusions was strongly dependent on <italic>ompR:</italic> the &#x003b2;-galactosidase activities were decreased from 7- to 78- fold in an <italic>ompR<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> strain in the absence of procaine (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). A similar pattern was observed in the presence of procaine (data not shown).</p><p>The effect of the <italic>envZ390</italic> allele was similar to that of the <italic>ompR</italic> deletion for <italic>omrA, omrB</italic> and <italic>ompC</italic> fusions (compare fold activation in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> to fold repression in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), suggesting that OmpR-P is strictly required for activation at these promoters. While <italic>ompF</italic> transcription was significantly decreased as well in the <italic>envZ390</italic> context (by 3-fold), the effect of this mutant allele was in this case not nearly as strong as the <italic>ompR</italic> deletion strain, that decreased expression of the <italic>ompF</italic> fusion by 78-fold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">C</xref>). This is possibly due to the presence of residual OmpR-P in this mutant that may be sufficient to activate <italic>ompF</italic>. In line with this, OmpR-P is still detectable by Phos-Tag in the <italic>envZ390</italic> background in presence of procaine (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The three other mutants, each of which has increased levels of OmpR-P, activated transcription from both the <italic>omrA</italic> and <italic>omrB</italic> promoters, with <italic>envZ473</italic> being by far the most efficient, since it increased activity of the <italic>omrA</italic> and <italic>omrB</italic> promoter fusions by 62- and 32-fold respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, note logarithmic scale). These effects differed from those observed with the fusions to <italic>ompC</italic> and <italic>ompF</italic> promoters. For instance, activation of <italic>ompC</italic> or <italic>ompF</italic> fusion in the <italic>envZ473, ompR107</italic> or <italic>ompR472</italic> mutants was never more than 2-fold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), and as expected from previous work, <italic>envZ473</italic> and <italic>ompR107</italic> repressed the <italic>ompF</italic> fusion, while <italic>ompR472</italic> repressed the <italic>ompC</italic> fusion (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). The basal level of transcription of OmrA/B is strikingly lower than <italic>ompC/F</italic>. To rule out that those <italic>envZ/ompR</italic> mutants affect OmrA/B via non-specific regulation of poorly transcribed genes, the effect of these mutants was analyzed on control promoter fusions. These controls were <italic>lacZ</italic> fusions to the short version of OmrA promoter or to the SgrS promoter, i.e. the same control promoters as used for the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription reactions. None of these fusions was significantly affected by the different <italic>envZ/ompR</italic> mutants, even though their expression in wt cells is lower than the expression of the Omr promoter fusions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Supplementary Figure S4A). This confirms that the effect of EnvZ-OmpR on OmrA/B transcription is specific and not due to a low transcription level.</p><p>These effects on the <italic>omr</italic> fusions were also different from what was reported with the <italic>dtpA</italic> gene, whose transcription was unaffected in <italic>envZ473</italic> and repressed in <italic>ompR107</italic> and <italic>ompR472</italic> strains (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Therefore, <italic>omrA</italic> and <italic>omrB</italic> are differentially regulated by EnvZ-OmpR in comparison to the other well-studied members of the regulon and they display a stronger dependence on changes in total OmpR and/or OmpR-P levels than <italic>ompC</italic> and <italic>ompF</italic>.</p><p><italic>ompF</italic> and <italic>ompC</italic> have long non-coding leaders and are subject to post-transcriptional regulation by the MicF and MicC sRNAs, themselves OmpR-dependent. While the <italic>ompF</italic> and <italic>ompC</italic> promoter fusions used above did not include the leaders and sites of sRNA interaction, the effects of the different <italic>envZ</italic> and <italic>ompR</italic> alleles were very similar to that shown previously with &#x02018;long&#x02019; transcriptional fusions isolated by Silhavy and coworkers and carrying the leaders together with the beginning of the <italic>ompC/F</italic> ORF (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) (fusions <italic>ompC-lacZ</italic> and <italic>ompF-lacZ</italic>, Supplementary Figure S4, panels B and C, compare to P<sub>ompC</sub>-<italic>lacZ</italic> and P<sub>ompF</sub>-<italic>lacZ</italic> fusions used in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This suggests that the effect of the mutants used here on <italic>ompC/F</italic> is primarily at the level of transcription initiation. As a further confirmation, fusions were created in which P<sub>tet</sub> replaced the <italic>ompF</italic> or <italic>ompC</italic> promoter, but the leader of these genes and the translation start site was retained. These fusions were much less affected by loss of OmpR (Supplementary Figure S4B, P<sub>tet</sub>-<italic>ompC/F-lacZ</italic>). Post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>ompF</italic> expression is further examined later in this study.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-3"><title>OmrA/B-mediated repression of <italic>ompR</italic> does not change OmpR-P levels</title><p>OmrA/B sRNAs regulate the expression of multiple targets through their 5&#x02032; conserved region; one target is the bicistronic operon encoding their own transcriptional regulator, the EnvZ-OmpR TCS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). We showed previously that, when overproduced, OmrA/B directly pair to the <italic>ompR</italic> translation initiation region and repress <italic>ompR</italic> expression as well as the levels of <italic>ompR-envZ</italic> mRNA (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). This control of <italic>ompR-envZ</italic> by OmrA/B also occurs upon induction of expression of OmrA/B from their natural locus.

This repression is specific to <italic>ompR</italic> as it was not observed on another P<sub>BAD</sub>-driven translational fusion (P<sub>BAD</sub>-<italic>phoP-lacZ</italic>). Furthermore, it is clearly due to the induction of the OmrA/B sRNAs, since procaine did not affect the wt fusion in a <italic>&#x00394;omrAB</italic> strain, and it did not affect a fusion carrying the ompRmut2 change that abolished the control by OmrA/B (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Control of <italic>ompR</italic> expression by OmrA/B changes OmpR, but not OmpR-P levels.

A non-specific band revealed with the anti-OmpR antibody was used as a loading control.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkw642fig3"/></fig><p>Interestingly, a mathematical model of OmpR-P levels performed by Batchelor and Goulian predicted that OmpR-P was robust (i.e. insensitive) to changes in <italic>ompR</italic> or <italic>envZ</italic> expression, as long as total OmpR levels remained much greater than EnvZ. This prediction was validated when transcription of <italic>ompC</italic> and <italic>ompF</italic> was followed over a wide range of OmpR or EnvZ levels (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> and personal communication). Therefore, one would predict that modulating expression of <italic>ompR-envZ</italic> by OmrA/B should not affect the level of OmpR-P and regulation of <italic>ompC</italic> and <italic>ompF</italic>. To test whether levels of OmpR phosphorylation changed with changing OmpR levels, proteins were extracted from cells overproducing either wt Omr or a derivative mutated in the 5&#x02032; end (mut2) that no longer repressed <italic>ompR</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). These extracts were then subjected to electrophoresis on a Phos-Tag containing gel followed by a western blot analysis to monitor both unphosphorylated OmpR and OmpR-P levels. The results were in complete agreement with the previously reported robustness: overproduction of wt OmrA/B, but not of the mutant versions, decreased the total amount of OmpR as expected, but the level of OmpR-P remained unchanged (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>; an independent repeat is shown in Supplementary Figure S5). This robustness, however, leaves unexplained what the physiological role of regulating <italic>ompR-envZ</italic> expression by the OmrA/B sRNAs might be.

This indicates that at least some OmpR targets are sensitive to changes in <italic>ompR</italic> expression.

Furthermore, even in the absence of IPTG, this construct synthesizes significantly more OmpR than from the chromosomal wt promoter.

In contrast, overexpression of OmrAmut2 did not significantly change the activity of either fusion in the wt context, but decreased it in presence of the <italic>ompRmut2</italic> variant, clearly showing that the observed repression is due to the down-regulation of <italic>ompR-envZ</italic> by OmrA. Similar results were obtained when OmrB (or OmrBmut2) was overproduced, but with somewhat lower repression factors. Interestingly, repression of either fusion was always higher in the mut2/mut2 situation than in the wt/wt. There are at least two hypotheses that could explain this observation; these models are not mutually exclusive. First, it is possible that the sRNA-mRNA duplex formation and/or stability was increased by the compensatory changes. Alternatively, since all targets of OmrA/B known so far are regulated through the 5&#x02032; end region of these sRNAs (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), it is plausible that, in the context of the compensatory changes, <italic>ompRmut2</italic> is the only target (or at least one among very few) of OmrA/Bmut2. The end result is that, in the absence of other targets, the level of OmrA/Bmut2 available to base-pair with <italic>ompRmut2</italic> is increased compared to the wt/wt situation.</p><p>As expected based on the results of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, this ability of OmrA/B to repress their own synthesis through <italic>ompR</italic> regulation was not paralleled when we looked at the expression of <italic>ompC</italic> and <italic>ompF</italic>. Instead, the activity of both P<sub>ompC</sub><italic>-</italic> and P<sub>ompF</sub><italic>-lacZ</italic> fusions was unaffected, or only very weakly affected, by overexpression of OmrA/B wt or mut2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, lower panels).</p><p>The experiments shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> were performed in LB medium, i.e. under experimental conditions where the activity of EnvZ/OmpR TCS is not expected to be strongly induced and where overproduction of OmrA/B is driven by an inducible promoter, whose activity is completely independent of EnvZ-OmpR. To get a better sense of the effect of OmrA/B when expressed from the chromosome, the activity of the same set of promoter fusions was compared in <italic>omrAB</italic> wt or deleted strains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). This experiment was performed in an <italic>ompR107</italic> background where OmrA/B are induced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In line with results obtained with OmrA/B overproduction, deletion of <italic>omrAB</italic> reproducibly increased the activity of the fusions to the promoters of OmrA/B by &#x0223c;40 to 50%, but did not significantly affect <italic>ompC</italic> or <italic>ompF</italic> expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, the difference in the responses of the <italic>omrA/B</italic>- and <italic>ompC/F</italic>- promoters to changing OmpR levels allows autocontrol of OmrA/B sRNAs through the negative feedback circuit that exists between EnvZ-OmpR TCS and OmrA/B; at the same time, <italic>ompC/F</italic> transcription remains resistant to the effect of OmrA/B.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-6"><title>A role for non-phosphorylated OmpR in activating <italic>omrA</italic> and <italic>omrB</italic> transcription?</title><p>What could explain the sensitivity of non-robust promoters such as P<sub>omrA</sub> or P<sub>omrB</sub> to changing OmpR levels given that the levels of OmpR-P are themselves robust? An obvious hypothesis is that, in contrast to <italic>ompC/F, omrA/B</italic> promoters might be activated not only by OmpR-P, but also by the non-phosphorylated form of OmpR. To address this question, we first worked with mutants of the phosphorylation site of OmpR (D55A or D55N) but found that they were unable to activate <italic>omr</italic> transcription, even when overproduced (data not shown). Because it is difficult to rule out the possibility that these variant OmpR proteins might be inactive, we then decided instead to follow the activity of the different promoter fusions when using strains with a wt OmpR protein but very low level of OmpR-P. This was achieved by working in strains lacking the OmpR kinase EnvZ. However, it is known that in the absence of EnvZ, some OmpR-P is still present and is generated in large part through phosphorylation of OmpR by acetylphosphate (see e.g. <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). The <italic>envZ</italic> deletion was therefore used in conjunction with a deletion of the <italic>ackA-pta</italic> genes, required for synthesis of acetylphosphate. The resulting strains display a low expression of the four OmpR targets, almost as low as in the <italic>ompR</italic> null mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>; note that each wt level is set to 100%, to allow easier comparison between the promoters, although total levels of expression are very different, see wt bars in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). OmpR-P is thus required for expression of all these genes including <italic>omrA/B</italic>, which is consistent with the results obtained in the <italic>envZ390</italic> mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and in the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription reactions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In this <italic>&#x00394;envZ &#x00394;ackA-pta</italic> background, overproduction of OmpR from the Tet-P<sub>lac</sub>-<italic>ompR</italic> allele slightly increased expression of both the <italic>ompF</italic> and <italic>ompC</italic> promoter fusions, compared to the <italic>&#x00394;envZ &#x00394;ackA-pta</italic> strain with <italic>ompR</italic> expressed from its own promoter, suggesting that OmpR-P levels may be slightly higher (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, compare dark gray and black bars). The stronger activation of <italic>ompF</italic> is consistent with the fact that <italic>ompF</italic> is activated at lower OmpR-P levels compared to <italic>ompC</italic><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">(2</xref>). The presence of OmpR-P in these strains is most likely due to cross-phosphorylation by a histidine kinase other than EnvZ or to the presence of acetylphosphate in the LB growth medium. This cross-phosphorylation is relatively inefficient, as judged by the low level of P<sub>ompC</sub>-<italic>lacZ</italic> transcription, compared to a wt strain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, compare black and white bars). Strikingly, overexpression of OmpR in these strains leads to strong activation of both <italic>omrA</italic> and <italic>omrB</italic> transcription relative to the wt strain (by 19- and 10-fold respectively), despite the lower level of OmpR-P (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). This shows that, even though expression of these two genes strictly requires OmpR-P, it can nonetheless be modulated by changes in the levels of unphosphorylated OmpR. While a detailed understanding of the mechanism involved is still lacking, this would set up the basis for the different robustness to OmpR levels that were observed for OmrA/B and <italic>ompC/F</italic>.</p><fig id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Expression of <italic>omrA</italic> and <italic>omrB</italic> can be activated by non-phosphorylated OmpR.

This difference should be due to an OmpR-dependent process controlling <italic>ompF</italic> expression downstream of transcription initiation. In agreement with this possibility, a translational <italic>ompF-lacZ</italic> fusion expressed from a P<sub>tet</sub> constitutive promoter still displayed some dependency on OmpR: expression of this fusion was lower in an <italic>ompR<sup>+</sup></italic> than an <italic>ompR<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> strain (ratio of 0.64, see Supplementary Figure S4B), and was 2-fold repressed when OmpR synthesis was induced with IPTG from the Tet-P<sub>lac</sub>-<italic>ompR</italic> allele (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Most of this post-transcriptional regulation by OmpR appears to be due to MicF under the conditions used here, since deletion of <italic>micF</italic> abolishes the effect of overproducing OmpR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>).

Transcription of <italic>bolA</italic> can originate from two promoters and OmpR was reported to repress transcription from the proximal promoter (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Accordingly, two distinct <italic>bolA</italic> mRNAs were visible by northern blot and only the levels of the shorter transcript increased in an <italic>ompR</italic> deleted strain. When OmpR was overproduced, either from pOmpR or from Tet-P<sub>lac</sub>-<italic>ompR</italic> using IPTG, levels of both <italic>bolA</italic> transcripts remained unchanged, indicating that <italic>bolA</italic> transcription, like that of <italic>ompC/F</italic>, responds only to OmpR-P and is thus robust to changes in OmpR levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). Regarding <italic>dtpA</italic>, transcription was followed using a transcriptional fusion carrying nts &#x02212;201 to +15 of <italic>dtpA</italic> (relative to TSS) upstream of <italic>lacZ</italic> (from nt -17). Consistent with the known regulation of <italic>dtpA</italic> by OmpR (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), expression of this P<sub>dtpA</sub>-lacZ fusion was strongly reduced in the absence of OmpR. Interestingly, activity of the fusion was also decreased upon OmpR overproduction, by 2-fold in presence of pOmpR and by 5-fold when <italic>ompR</italic> expression was induced from Tet-P<sub>lac</sub>-<italic>ompR</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). It seems therefore that <italic>dtpA</italic> transcription is activated by OmpR (or OmpR-P) at low levels but repressed at higher levels, reminiscent of the regulation of <italic>ompF</italic> by OmpR-P. More importantly for the scope of this study, this result shows that <italic>dtpA</italic> is another non-robust OmpR target whose expression is modulated in response to changes in OmpR levels.

However, this is not the case for all OmpR targets as the promoters of <italic>omrA/B</italic> and <italic>dtpA</italic> were found, for instance, to be regulated by changes in OmpR levels as well.</p><p>One prediction that can be made from these findings is that the OmpR regulon is actually composed of at least two subsets of genes. The first group, corresponding to robust targets (gray square in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>), should be sensitive only to signals affecting the level of OmpR-P, e.g. osmolarity. The second group is composed of the non-robust targets whose expression should depend on both the phosphorylation status of OmpR and its expression levels (purple square in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). This is for instance what is observed for OmrA/B, which autoregulate their own synthesis by repressing <italic>ompR</italic> translation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Interestingly, control of <italic>ompR</italic> expression is not limited to the action of the Omr sRNAs, as it was reported that <italic>ompR-envZ</italic> transcription is also regulated by cAMP-CRP (via a complex pattern depending on the transcription start site), inhibited by IHF (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>) and is possibly positively autoregulated by OmpR (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and Supplementary Figure S2). The non-robust control of some OmpR targets is therefore expected to allow integration of multiple signals in controlling only a subset of genes of the OmpR regulon.</p><p>Robustness has been proposed to minimize output variability between cells that are subject to the same input but can present stochastic variations in the concentrations of some cellular components (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Given the importance of the <italic>ompC/F</italic> structural genes that encode the major porins in <italic>E. coli</italic> and whose ratio will impact the entry of various beneficial or harmful compounds, one can understand why keeping their transcription independent of stochastic variations might matter. In contrast, regarding OmrA/B, it seems logical that these OmpR targets involved in feedback control of <italic>ompR</italic> expression are non-robust, which is expected to allow them to keep <italic>ompR</italic> expression levels within a given range and underlies their observed autoregulation.</p><p>Furthermore, our data indicate that <italic>bolA</italic> transcription is robust to OmpR while <italic>dtpA</italic> is not.

Our data strongly suggest that unphosphorylated OmpR is involved in transcription regulation at the Omr promoters, but also possibly at the promoters of other non-robust targets. In some cases, the unphosphorylated form of a response regulator has been shown to specifically activate gene expression at some target-promoters (e.g. <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). However, in the case studied here, our results suggest that at least some OmpR-P is required for transcription activation at the Omr promoters. Indeed, <italic>envZ</italic> or <italic>ackA-pta</italic> mutants that lower OmpR-P reduce OmrA/B transcription as much as an <italic>ompR</italic> deletion allele (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Furthermore, mutants of the phosphorylation site of OmpR (D55A or D55N) failed to activate Omr transcription, even when overproduced (our unpublished results), which also suggests that OmpR-P is essential for transcription activation, even at the Omr promoters.</p><p>A first hypothesis that could explain both the requirement for OmpR-P and the sensitivity to unphosphorylated OmpR is that Omr promoters could simultaneously bind both forms of OmpR. As OmpR phosphorylation has been found to promote dimerization and subsequently DNA-binding (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), OmpR-P presumably binds as a dimer and this binding is likely to be essential for control. Unphosphorylated OmpR may bind as well and promote OmpR-P mediated transcription regulation, for instance by activating OmpR-P binding. It is not clear in what form unphosphorylated OmpR would bind, perhaps as a monomer or in complex with another protein, and what promoter elements would allow this binding. An alternative possibility is that OmpR and OmpR-P could form heterodimers able to control gene expression specifically at the Omr promoters.</p><p>It is also possible that the observed regulation of Omr synthesis by unphosphorylated OmpR is indirect. Instead, OmpR could control the level of another regulator of Omr transcription; both the nature of this regulator and how its levels would be controlled by OmpR remains to be identified to support this hypothesis. Additional studies are required to discriminate between these possibilities, and identify the promoter elements that make Omr sensitive to both unphosphorylated OmpR and OmpR-P.</p></sec><sec id="SEC4-3"><title>Regulating regulators: a recurrent theme in sRNA biology</title><p>Synthesis of base-pairing sRNAs is often controlled by transcriptional regulators and, in turn, base-pairing sRNAs commonly target genes encoding transcriptional regulators (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> for reviews).</p><p>In some cases, sRNAs control expression of their own regulator, thereby creating a feedback circuit, such as the one described here.

However, this circuit could provide other properties to OmrA/B expression. It could, for instance, restrict Omr induction to a shorter time frame following OmpR activation, allow a surge in Omr levels or provide a faster recovery once the inducing signal(s) for OmpR has disappeared. Another possibility is that this feedback could be involved in ensuring that Omr synthesis occurs only in response to sustained stimulation of OmpR and would filter transient signals, or in limiting cell-to-cell variations among the bacterial population.

However, while many transcriptional regulators are subject to direct autoregulation, examples of protein-based negative feedback circuits reminiscent of the one described in this work are extremely rare in purely transcriptional networks (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). Understanding its properties could thus provide important information regarding not only OmrA/B, but also the role of this specific regulatory circuit in gene expression.</p><p>In addition to EnvZ-OmpR TCS, other examples of robustness have been reported such as the phosphorylation of IDH (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase) enzyme by the IDHKP kinase/phosphatase in the glyoxylate bypass pathway (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). Given that prediction of robustness relies on the fact that EnvZ is a bifunctional kinase/phosphatase and that OmpR levels are much greater than those of EnvZ, it is likely that robustness will apply to other TCS as well. In this regard, results obtained with the PhoQ/PhoP TCS suggest that PhoP-P levels might indeed be robust to some changes in total PhoP (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Our results can thus have implications for these other cases and it is therefore of interest to determine whether these systems also have non-robust targets as well.</p></sec></sec>
