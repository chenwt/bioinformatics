    "Two-component systems (TCS) and small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) are both widespread regulators of gene expression in bacteria. TCS are in most cases transcriptional regulators. A large class of sRNAs act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression that modulate the translation and/or stability of target-mRNAs. Many connections have been recently unraveled between these two types of regulators, resulting in mixed regulatory circuits with poorly characterized properties. This study focuses on the negative feedback circuit that exists between the EnvZ-OmpR TCS and the OmrA/B sRNAs. We have shown that OmpR directly activates transcription from the omrA and omrB promoters, allowing production of OmrA/B sRNAs that target multiple mRNAs, including the ompR-envZ mRNA. This control of ompR-envZ by the Omr sRNAs does not affect the amount of phosphorylated OmpR, i.e. the presumably active form of the regulator. Accordingly, expression of robust OmpR targets, such as the ompC or ompF porin genes, is not affected by OmrA/B. However, we find that several OmpR targets, including OmrA/B themselves, are sensitive to changing total OmpR levels. As a result, OmrA/B limit their own synthesis. These findings unravel an additional layer of control in the expression of some OmpR targets and suggest the existence of differential regulation within the OmpR regulon."
