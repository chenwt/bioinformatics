As early as the 1920s, Otto Warburg observed that tumor cells consume glucose at a high rate and undergo fermentation even in the presence of oxygen (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Warburg et al., 1927</xref>). Since then, drugs targeting metabolism have transformed the treatment of certain cancers. In the 1940s, the discovery and application of aminopterin, which was later found to target dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), a cytoplasmic enzyme involved in one-carbon folate metabolism, yielded the first remission in a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Farber et al., 1948</xref>). Other folate derivatives, such as methotrexate, were later developed. More recently, drugs such as 5-fluorouracil and pemetrexed that target thymidylate synthetase, another enzyme involved in one-carbon folate metabolism, were found to be effective therapies for some cancers (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Locasale, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The discovery of germline and somatic mutations that alter metabolic proteins in cancer further supports the role of altered metabolism in cancer pathogenesis. Mutations in genes of the succinate dehydrogenase complex, critical for both the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and electron transport chain, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hereditary paragangliomas (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Baysal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Niemann and M&#x000fc;ller, 2000</xref>), pheochromocytomas (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Astuti et al., 2001</xref>), renal cell cancer (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Vanharanta et al., 2004</xref>), and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Janeway et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Pantaleo et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenases 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) have been found in subsets of gliomas (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Brennan et al., 2013</xref>) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Paschka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013</xref>), among other malignancies. Drugs targeting these mutant proteins have entered the clinic with some successes in early phase trials (Stein et al. 2014. 56th Annual American Hematoligical Society Annual Meeting and Exposition. Abstract 115.). Moreover, as understanding of the metabolic derangements necessary to promote and maintain the malignant state continues to expand, so does the list of potential drug targets. For example, aerobic glycolysis is thought to enable the generation of the nucleotides, proteins, and lipids necessary to maintain the malignant proliferative state, in part through regulation of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Vander Heiden et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, the discovery of the critical importance of glycine and serine in cancer metabolism has led to a resurgence in interest in better understanding the mechanistic relevance of one-carbon folate metabolism (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Jain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Labuschagne et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Ye et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Maddocks et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although drugs targeting metabolism, such as methotrexate and asparaginase (a drug that reduces the availability of asparagine and glutamine), have been critical for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, they are not used in therapy for AML, a hematopoietic malignancy where cure rates are still quite poor despite high-dose cytotoxic chemotherapy, including stem cell transplantation. This is especially true for patients with subtypes of AML characterized by high-risk features, such as the presence of FLT3-ITD mutations. New therapies are urgently needed for the treatment of these patients. In this study, we set out to define common mechanisms critical to the maintenance of AML cells to nominate novel, potentially targetable metabolic pathways for the treatment of this disease. We integrated gene expression signatures generated from the treatment of AML cells with multiple small molecules known to promote AML differentiation and death. Methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2), an NAD+-dependent enzyme with dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase activity, which plays an essential role in mitochondrial one-carbon folate metabolism, was prioritized as a target relevant to AML cell growth and differentiation. Suppression of MTHFD2 impaired AML growth and induced differentiation in vitro and impaired disease progression in multiple mouse models of AML. Additionally, FLT3-ITD mutations are a biomarker of response to MTHFD2 suppression. Mechanistically, MYC directly regulates MTHFD2 expression, and suppression of MTHFD2 leads to marked alteration of the TCA cycle.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="s01"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s02"><title>One-carbon folate metabolism is a core pathway altered with compounds active in AML cells</title><p>We analyzed gene expression signatures of HL-60 cells treated with 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 (Vitamin D), PMA, and all-trans retinoic acid (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Stegmaier et al., 2004</xref>), along with gene expression signatures of THP-1 cells treated with the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Zuber et al., 2011</xref>), and MV4-11 and MOLM-13 cells treated with the DOT1L inhibitor EPZ004777 (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Daigle et al., 2011</xref>), compounds that cause AML differentiation and death. We identified a list of genes significantly down-regulated by the individual agents (fold change expression &#x02265; 1.5, P &#x02264; 0.05, Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate [FDR(BH)] &#x02264; 0.05) and found a core subset of 198 genes that were robustly down-regulated across all five datasets based on the selection criteria mean fold change of expression &#x02265; 1.5 across all datasets and (<italic>ii</italic>) significant fold change of expression &#x02265; 1.5 (P &#x02264; 0.05, FDR(BH) &#x02264; 0.05) in at least four out of the five datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref> and Table S1). We then used this core list of genes to probe for enrichment across the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) curated collection of canonical pathways (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kanehisa et al., 2014</xref>), available from the Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) v4.0 (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>). Three metabolic pathways, One Carbon Pool by Folate, Purine Metabolism, and Pyrimidine Metabolism, along with five other pathways involved in cell cycle, splicing, and DNA mismatch repair, were significantly enriched in the core list of genes (FDR (q value) &#x02264; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). The role of folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism in cancer, especially in the mitochondrial compartment, has been a subject of renewed interest (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Jain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Nilsson et al., 2014</xref>). A recent publication has highlighted the mitochondrial enzyme involved in one-carbon folate metabolism, MTHFD2, as the most differentially expressed enzyme in cancer cells compared with normal cells (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Nilsson et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, across all five treatments there was down-regulation of <italic>MTHFD2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). We thus focused on the relevance of MTHFD2 to AML growth and maturation. We first determined the expression of MTHFD2 across normal myeloid differentiation using a publicly available dataset profiling the transcriptomes of hematopoietic cells across various stages of hematopoietic differentiation (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Novershtern et al., 2011</xref>).

Thus, new therapies are needed for this disease. We set out to identify pathways that are consistently suppressed in AML with AML-directed drugs. The one-carbon folate pathway emerged at the intersection of genes significantly altered by these agents. Given the recent interest in this pathway in cancer metabolism, we focused on its role in AML, with a specific study of MTHFD2, a mitochondrial enzyme involved in folate metabolism that is consistently down-regulated across all of the probed datasets and highly differentially expressed in cancer compared with normal cells.</p><p>One-carbon folate metabolism is a complex network involving several amino acids, nucleotide synthesis, support of cellular methylation reactions via methionine and s-adenosylmethionine production, and support of lipid metabolism (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Locasale, 2013</xref>). In the cytoplasm, serine is converted to formate by the trifunctional enzyme MTHFD1. In the mitochondria, the dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase activities are performed by MTHFD2, whereas the synthetase activities are performed by MTHFD1L (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Christensen and Mackenzie, 2008</xref>).

Although there is a long history of targeting folate metabolism in the treatment of patients with cancer, the precise role of glycine/serine and one-carbon folate metabolism in mitochondria and its potential contribution to cancer metabolic reprogramming, have only recently come to light. Glycine metabolism has been correlated with rates of cancer cell proliferation, and antagonizing glycine synthesis through suppression of SHMT2 was shown to decrease cancer cell growth (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Jain et al., 2012</xref>). In the same year, glycine decarboxylase and other glycine/serine-related enzymes, including SHMT2, were found to promote cellular transformation and tumorigenesis in lung cancer models (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, SHMT2 was found to drive glioma cell proliferation in the presence of ischemia, making the cells sensitive to inhibition of the glycine cleavage system (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). In an analysis of differentially expressed mRNA in cancer tissues, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Nilsson et al. (2014)</xref> identified enzymes of the one-carbon folate pathway to be among the most differentially expressed metabolic enzymes in cancer compared with normal cells, with MTHFD2 ranking at the top of the list. In addition, MTHFD2 expression correlated with poor survival in patients with breast cancer (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Nilsson et al., 2014</xref>). The combination of its high expression in cancer cells and restricted pattern of expression in normal tissues made MTHFD2 an attractive target for further exploration.</p><p>The exact mechanistic role of MTHFD2 in cancer is still a topic of debate. The mitochondrial one-carbon folate pathway and MTHFD2 have been suggested to provide mitochondrial-derived one-carbon units in the form of formate for purine biosynthesis (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Christensen and Mackenzie, 2008</xref>). However, we could not rescue the effects of MTHFD2 suppression in AML cell lines with the addition of up to 10 mM formate concentrations, a similar observation to that of <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Nilsson et al. (2014)</xref>. More recently, several publications supported the role of mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism in redox homeostasis and NADPH production (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Ye et al., 2014</xref>). <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al. (2014)</xref> demonstrated a decrease in the NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> ratio with MTHFD2 knockdown in HEK293T cells, and <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Ye et al. (2014)</xref> demonstrated a decrease in the NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> ratio with SHMT2 knockdown only in hypoxic conditions in neuroblastoma cells (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Ye et al., 2014</xref>). Given that MTHFD2 is an NAD<sup>+</sup> dependent enzyme, we focused on measuring NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio in AML cells after MTHFD2 suppression and did not find a consistent difference in this ratio in the AML cell line setting (unpublished data), possibly due in part to the fact that the whole cell NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio is dominated by cofactor levels in the cytosol, and MTHFD2 knockdown is expected to affect the mitochondrial NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio. Tracing compartmentalized NADPH metabolism (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Lewis et al., 2014</xref>) was also not possible because MTHFD2 suppression resulted in a profound decrease in cellular &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate levels. In fact, levels of all TCA cycle metabolites were suppressed, potentially because loss of MTHFD2 alters mitochondrial redox metabolism. Decreases in TCA intermediates were also observed with impaired mitochondrial NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH metabolism (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Despite a fall in all TCA cycle intermediates, there was a significant increase in the succinate to &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate ratio in MOLM-14 cells after MTHFD2 suppression, a possible metabolic mechanism for the inhibition of stem cell signatures and the induction of differentiation of AML cells. Recent work from <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Carey et al. (2015)</xref> suggests that naive embryonic stem cells maintain an elevated &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate to succinate ratio that promotes pluripotency through histone and DNA demethylation. It will be important, in future studies, to explore the effects of MTHFD2 suppression on the epigenetic state of AML cells.</p><p>The limited expression of MTHFD2 in normal adult tissues, and high level of expression in cancer cells, may in part be explained by the regulation of MTHFD2 expression by MYC. MYC is a master regulator of cell proliferation, affecting regulation of immortality, cell cycle progression, genetic instability, apoptosis and metabolism (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Dang, 2012</xref>). In cancer, pathological activation of MYC commonly plays a key role in disease pathogenesis. MYC stimulates expression of many mitochondrial genes that are encoded in the nucleus and even regulates mitochondrial biogenesis itself (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2005</xref>). In the Connectivity Map, an MTHFD2 knockdown signature recapitulated changes in expression associated with knockdown of MYC. Using publicly available ChIP-Seq data, we identified MYC binding at the promoter sites of <italic>SHMT2</italic>, <italic>MTHFD2</italic>, and <italic>MTHFD1L</italic> and preferential binding of MYC at <italic>MTHFD2</italic> promoter sites in cancer cells compared with nonmalignant cells. We then performed ChIP-qPCR and confirmed this finding in AML cell lines. Previously, MYC has been implicated in controlling the one-carbon folate pathway, especially in the presence of hypoxia (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Nikiforov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Ye et al., 2014</xref>), though this has not been previously studied in AML. In future studies, it may also be informative to perform metabolic profiling with MYC suppression by BET bromodomain inhibitors alone and in combination with MTHFD2-specific suppression.</p><p>Based on the expression level of MTHFD2 in hematopoietic stem cells, MTHFD2 suppression would be expected to have some bone marrow toxicity. Indeed, we observed highly variable suppression of colony formation in normal CD34<sup>+</sup> cells with MTHFD2-directed shRNAs in four independent experiments (unpublished data). The variability likely reflects the challenges of transducing CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, experimental differences in levels of knockdown, and variability in donor CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. However, given the low expression of MTHFD2 in other adult tissues, our expectation is that an MTHFD2 inhibitor would be more selective than other inhibitors of the one-carbon folate pathway, such as methotrexate, on normal adult tissues. Accordingly, MTHFD2 suppression has minimal effect on the growth of 293T or Ba/F3 cells.</p><p>Predictors of response are essential to successful cancer drug development. FLT3-ITD emerged as a biomarker of response to MTHFD2 suppression at the intersection of an shRNA screen and in silico query of genome-wide expression profiling of primary patient AML cells. FLT3-ITD is a gain-of-function mutation and is one of the most common alterations in AML, accounting for &#x0223c;20% of adult AML (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Marcucci et al., 2011</xref>). AML with FLT3-ITD is characterized by higher rates of relapse, leading to poor overall survival of as low as 25% (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Thiede et al., 2002</xref>). Inhibitors of FLT3 have recently been reported to improve survival in combination with chemotherapy in patients with FLT3 mutant AML (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Stone et al., 2015</xref>). It will thus be important to test FLT3 inhibitors in combination with MTHFD2 suppression in future studies. Although the precise mechanism for increased sensitivity to MTHFD2 suppression in FLT3-ITD AML is uncertain, one might speculate that the increased production of reactive oxygen species by internal tandem duplications of FLT3 may render greater sensitivity (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Sallmyr et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Godfrey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Stanicka et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>This work argues that MTHFD2 inhibitors are needed to further examine targeting this enzyme as a novel treatment strategy in AML. All of the previously published work and the studies presented here have relied on shRNA-directed suppression of MTHFD2, a limitation to the studies. It will be critical to validate that enzymatic inhibition of the target reproduces the effects seen with loss of total protein. Moreover, small-molecule probes will empower the mechanistic dissection of this target as the kinetics of shRNA suppression are slower than acute inhibition with a compound.</p><p>In summary, this study defines a critical role for MTHFD2 in AML and nominates FLT3-ITD as a biomarker of response to MTHFD2 suppression. With differential expression of MTHFD2 in cancer tissues, and its preferential expression in embryonic tissues, targeting of MTHFD2 may offer a superior therapeutic window for inhibition in comparison with drugs in current use that target the one-carbon folate metabolism more broadly.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s09"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s10"><title>Cell culture and primary AML cells</title><p>U937, HL-60, and 293T cells were purchased from ATCC.

The goal of GSEA is to identify groups of genes sharing common biological function (gene sets) that are distributed at the top or at the bottom of the ranked list of differentially expressed genes. GSEA assigns to each gene set an enrichment score (ES) calculated as a running sum statistic by walking down across the ranked list of differentially expressed genes, increasing the sum when encountering genes in the gene set and decreasing it when encountering genes not in the gene set. The significance of the ES is estimated based on a permutation p-value and adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing through FDR. Gene sets with an FDR q-value &#x02264; 0.25 and a nominal P &#x02264; 0.05 were considered significant.

The Library of Integrated Cellular Signatures (LINCS)-Connectivity Map (LINCS-CMap) is a catalog of gene expression data collected from human cells treated with chemical compounds and genetic reagents. The LINCS is a National Institutes of Health program (U54 HG006093) that supports the generation of profiles across multiple cell and perturbation types, as well as assay read-outs. The L1000 assay is a novel mRNA expression profiling technique based on a reduced representation of the genome whereby a collection of 1,000 selected transcripts are monitored and used to computationally infer the remainder of the transcriptome. This approach utilizes Luminex beads and provides a high-throughput (384-well based), low-cost method that can enable large-scale profiling efforts.</p><p>The CMap MTHFD2 trt-sh signature was defined based on five hairpins (TRCN0000290804, TRCN0000036550, TRCN0000036551, TRCN0000036553, and TRCN0000290805) in &#x0003e;90 experiments across a panel of cell lines (HEPG2, VCAP, HCC515, HT29, A549, A375, MCF7, PC3, HA1E, and NPC).

The method is also implemented in the GenePrerank module of the GSEA v2.0.14 platform. The ssGSEA method assigns to each individual sample&#x02014;represented as a genome-wide ranked list of genes&#x02014;an ES with respect to each gene set in a given collection of pathways. ssGSEA provides an unsupervised representation of the gene expression data in the space of gene sets, and thus offers potentially more biological interpretability. The ssGSEA gene set representation can be further analyzed with unsupervised or supervised machine learning and statistical tools. ES is calculated as described for MTHFD2 KD GSEA analysis. A positive ES denotes a significant overlap of the signature gene set with groups of genes at the top of the ranked list, whereas a negative ES denotes a significant overlap of the signature gene set with groups of genes at the bottom of the ranked list. For each sample, the ES was further transformed into a z-score by subtracting the mean of the ES&#x02019;s assigned to all other samples and by dividing the result to their standard deviation. ssGSEA projection on the collection of 186 KEGG canonical pathways, collections of MYC target gene set signatures, MTHFD2 signatures and JQ1 treatment effect signatures was applied separately to each of the primary AML transcript datasets&#x02013;TCGA_LAML and Wouters (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013</xref>). ssGSEA projection on gene set signatures for MTHFD2 KD, CMap MTHFD2 trt-sh, MTHFD2 expression z-score, JQ1 treatment (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Zuber et al., 2011</xref>), Consensus_JQ1 signature (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Puissant et al., 2014</xref>), and MYC target gene signatures (MSigDB c2.v04 collection) were performed in each primary tumor dataset.

(2009)</xref> datasets. Consensus clustering is an unsupervised machine learning approach aimed at identifying robust groups of samples that remain clustered together irrespective of small stochastic perturbations, either in the data or in the clustering procedure. For a preselected number of clusters, <italic>k</italic> = 2, 3, consensus clustering applies iteratively (e.g., <italic>n</italic> = 1,000 times), a clustering method (e.g., hierarchical clustering) specific to perturbed instances of the data (e.g., after subsampling 80% of samples and/or 80% of genes), and then splits the data into <italic>k</italic> clusters based on an agreement matrix that describes the robustness of the clustering solutions along the <italic>N</italic> iterations. The agreement matrix is defined as a matrix with rows and columns corresponding to samples that record for each pair of samples the fraction of times (out of the <italic>N</italic> iterations) the samples are clustered together. The agreement matrix is further clustered into <italic>k</italic> consensus clusters. For each consensus cluster, the core is defined by the subset of samples in the cluster with high pairwise agreement scores (e.g., above the cutoff 0.75), and the border is defined by the samples with low pairwise agreement scores (e.g., below the cutoff 0.25). The overall quality of a clustering solution is measured by silhouette scores defined based on the pairwise similarity of samples within each cluster and by the pairwise dissimilarity of samples within different clusters. The optimal number <italic>k</italic> of clusters in the data are assessed based on the maximum quality score for various clustering solutions (<italic>k</italic> = 2, 3, etc.) estimated by a consensus cumulative distribution function (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Monti et al., 2003</xref>). In each of the primary AML datasets, the samples in the two core clusters identified by applying the consensus clustering approach at a level <italic>k</italic> = 2, were found to show very high mean pairwise agreement scores (&#x0003e;0.90) and to remain unsplit as core groups in any subsequent clustering into <italic>k</italic> = 3, 4, 5 clusters. In each primary AML dataset, one of these two core clusters was found to be significantly enriched in the one-carbon pool folate, purine metabolism, and pyrimidine metabolism pathways, and it was called the folate cluster.
