Hallmarks of the disease are large tumors that develop on all aerial parts of the host in which dark pigmented teliospores are formed. We have identified a member of the WOPR family of transcription factors, Ros1, as major regulator of spore formation in <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic>. <italic>ros1</italic> expression is induced only late during infection and hence Ros1 is neither involved in plant colonization of dikaryotic fungal hyphae nor in plant tumor formation. However, during late stages of infection Ros1 is essential for fungal karyogamy, massive proliferation of diploid fungal cells and spore formation. Premature expression of <italic>ros1</italic> revealed that Ros1 counteracts the <italic>b</italic>-dependent filamentation program and induces morphological alterations resembling the early steps of sporogenesis. Transcriptional profiling and ChIP-seq analyses uncovered that Ros1 remodels expression of about 30% of all <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> genes with 40% of these being direct targets. In total the expression of 80 transcription factor genes is controlled by Ros1. Four of the upregulated transcription factor genes were deleted and two of the mutants were affected in spore development. A large number of <italic>b</italic>-dependent genes were differentially regulated by Ros1, suggesting substantial changes in this regulatory cascade that controls filamentation and pathogenic development. Interestingly, 128 genes encoding secreted effectors involved in the establishment of biotrophic development were downregulated by Ros1 while a set of 70 &#x0201c;late effectors&#x0201d; was upregulated. These results indicate that Ros1 is a master regulator of late development in <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> and show that the biotrophic interaction during sporogenesis involves a drastic shift in expression of the fungal effectome including the downregulation of effectors that are essential during early stages of infection.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The fungus <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> is a pathogen of maize which induces tumor formation in the infected tissue.

The resulting disease, the so-called smut disease, is characterized by the formation of large tumors on all aerial parts of the plant. In these tumors fungal hyphae proliferate profusely and eventually produce massive amounts of dark pigmented, diploid teliospores.</p><p><italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> is a dimorphic fungus which can grow by yeast-like budding in the absence of a host. On the leaf surface compatible haploid yeast-like cells mate and generate a dikaryon. The dikaryon switches to a filamentous form which is cell cycle arrested [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Upon perception of surface cues [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] the dikaryon differentiates infection structures and penetrates the maize epidermis. Following penetration, the cell cycle arrest is released [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], the dikaryon invades the plant tissue, proliferates with the help of clamp formation and triggers the development of large tumors [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the late stages of infection, after tumors are formed, the sporogenesis program is initiated. Although the chronology of events leading to teliospore formation is not yet fully understood, the first step is likely to be the fusion of the two haploid nuclei, followed by extensive mitotic divisions of the diploid hyphal cells leading to the formation of large hyphal aggregates [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Concomitantly, a mucilaginous matrix of undefined composition and origin is formed embedding the fungal cells during the subsequent hyphal fragmentation and maturation stages. Eventually, the tumors rupture and release the diploid spores in the environment. The cycle is completed when the teliospores germinate and give rise to haploid progeny after meiosis [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. To overcome PAMP-triggered plant defense responses, and to establish a biotrophic interaction, <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> secretes a large panel of effector proteins which may function in the apoplast (e.g. Pep1) or be translocated to the host cells (e.g. Cmu1, Tin2) [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Expression of the vast majority of the about 300 effectors lacking known protein domains is tied to the biotrophic stage [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. About 25% of all effectors are arranged in gene clusters and many of these affect virulence either generally or in an organ-specific manner [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. So far, the molecular basis for the virulence function of only a few <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> effectors (Pep1, Pit2, Cmu1, Tin2, See1) has been elucidated [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p><italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> pathogenic development requires fusion of haploid cells and is initiated by the <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> mating type genes. Their expression is induced by the pheromone response factor Prf1 in response to pheromone and host derived signals transmitted via a cAMP-dependent and a MAPK pathway. The <italic>a</italic> locus encodes a pheromone/receptor system mediating cell-cell recognition and fusion. The <italic>b</italic> locus encodes two homeodomain proteins which, when derived from different alleles, form the bE/bW heterodimer which acts as master regulator for the switch to filamentous growth, host tissue colonization and tumor induction [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. bE/bW induces a regulatory cascade which influences the expression of over three hundreds genes [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The majority of these genes are regulated via the zinc-finger protein Rbf1, a direct target of bE/bW which acts as a central node in the <italic>b</italic>-regulatory cascade [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Because effector gene expression coincides with pathogenic development, the induction of most effector genes was initially considered to depend on the <italic>b</italic> cascade [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However only few effector genes are subject to direct regulation via components of this cascade. Rbf1 induction in axenic culture leads to activation of only a small subset of effector genes suggesting that plant signals and additional regulators are required for their expression [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The membrane proteins Sho1 and Msb2 induce effector gene expression in response to surface cues prior to penetration. They act via the transcription factors Biz1 and Hdp2, two Rbf1 targets, with a specific function in appressorium development [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Biz1 might also regulate effector gene expression in conjunction with Mzr1 in the later stages of colonization [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Proteins of the WOPR family constitute a novel class of fungal-specific transcriptional regulators that bind DNA via their N-terminal WOPR box. The WOPR box consists of two highly conserved domains, WOPRa and WOPRb, predicted to adopt a globular structure and which are separated by a linker region of variable length and sequence. Both WOPR domains are required for DNA binding activity [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Most fungal genomes contain two paralogous <italic>WOPR</italic> genes that phylogenetically fall into two distinct clades [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To date, WOPR proteins have been studied exclusively in ascomycetes where they fulfill a conserved function in the control of developmental processes. Mit1p in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> is a core regulator of invasive growth in haploid cells as well as pseudohyphal growth in diploid cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Wor1, the best characterized member of the WOPR family, is the master regulator of the white-opaque phenotypic switching allowing <italic>Candida albicans</italic> to adapt to niches in the human host [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Similarly, the Ryp1 protein in <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic> is a key regulator of the temperature-dependent mycelia-to-yeast transition critical for virulence [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Sge1 was the first WOPR protein studied in a plant pathogenic fungus. Sge1 supports parasitic growth of the tomato wilt pathogen <italic>Fusarium oxysporum f</italic>. <italic>sp</italic>. <italic>lycopersici</italic> by inducing the expression of at least four of the <italic>SIX</italic> effector genes [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. WOPR proteins have later been linked to virulence in other ascomycete plant pathogens [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Several members of the WOPR family in plant pathogens also positively regulate the production of secondary metabolites potentially involved in pathogenicity [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In addition to their role in plant colonization, most WOPR proteins regulate sexual/asexual reproduction in phytopathogenic fungi [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Here we investigate the function of a WOPR regulator in the pathogenic development of the basidiomycete pathogen <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic>.

They fail to undergo karyogamy, subsequent mitotic cell divisions and are unable to form the mucilaginous matrix in which teliospores are embedded. We show that Ros1 affects the expression of many genes via direct interaction with their promoter regions. Remarkably, Ros1 triggers a dramatic switch in gene expression of the vast majority of effector genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ros1 is a potential transcriptional regulator</title><p>The genome of <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> is predicted to encode two members of the WOPR family, <italic>pac2</italic> (<italic>UMAG_15096</italic>) and <italic>ros1</italic> (<italic>UMAG_05853</italic>).

Outside of the Ustilaginomycetes, conservation is restricted to the N-terminal part comprising the WOPR box (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005697.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). In Ros1 the N-terminal WOPR box (amino acids 8 to 305) contains both WOPRa (amino acids 8 to 90) and WOPRb (amino acids 240 to 305) domains separated by a rather long linker region of 156 amino acids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005697.s001">S1A Fig</xref>).

To test whether one of these regions is directly bound by Ros1, we carried out electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using a recombinant His-tagged version of Ros1 containing the WOPR domain only (Ros1WOPR-His). As target we used a 237 bp biotinylated probe corresponding to the <italic>ros1</italic> promoter region between 2854 and 3090 bp upstream of the <italic>ros1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005697.g009">Fig 9A and 9B</xref>) containing three putative binding motifs (WT-probe). In presence of Ros1WOPR-His in a molar ratio of 2700:1 of protein to DNA the probe was completely shifted. This shift could be abolished by addition of a 500-fold excess of unlabeled WT-probe competitor, indicating that Ros1 interacts specifically with the WT-probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005697.g009">Fig 9C</xref>).

To narrow down the region bound by Ros1, mutations were introduced in the probe sequence. Two of the predicted Wor1-like binding motifs (m1 and m2) located at the center of the peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005697.g009">Fig 9A</xref>), were mutated in probes mut-m1 and mut-m2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005697.g009">Fig 9B</xref>) and tested for binding by Ros1WOPR-His. For both probes we observed discrete, significantly smaller shifts than for the WT-probe and the interactions could again be competed by an excess of unlabeled WT-probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005697.g009">Fig 9C</xref>). When a fragment containing both mut-m1 and mut-m2 (mut-m1+2) mutations was used, an even less shifted complex was observed which could be competed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005697.g009">Fig 9C</xref>).

It also represses 128 effector genes (126 of the 320 predicted effector genes [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] without functional domain, <italic>cmu1</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and <italic>UMAG_01130</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]) (blue box). Concomitantly, Ros1 induces teliospore formation (Red box). Ros1 triggers karyogamy followed by proliferation of the diploid and matrix formation. This coincides with the upregulation of genes involved in cell cycle, DNA processing and protein synthesis. The gelatinization of the cell wall and subsequent fragmentation of sporogenous hyphae might involve cell wall loosening and membrane lipid synthesis. The two Ros1 induced transcription factors UMAG_02775 and UMAG_01390 regulate spore maturation following the fragmentation stage.

In contrast to wild type strains, <italic>ros1</italic> deletion strains are unable to form such aggregates, fail to accumulate matrix material and remain dikaryotic. This could suggest that karyogamy precedes the formation of hyphal aggregates and may be required to initiate the synthesis of the mucilaginous matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005697.g011">Fig 11</xref>). In wild type strains hyphal aggregates develop within the plant intercellular space and considerably expand over time due to a dramatic increase of fungal biomass which is not observed in plants infected with <italic>ros1</italic> deletion strains. When expressed ectopically in axenic culture, Ros1 triggered mitotic divisions suggesting that aggregate expansion during colonization is due to multiple rounds of mitotic divisions of the diploid cells as was earlier hypothesized [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, the phenotype of cells expressing <italic>ros1</italic> prematurely in hyphae indicates that the resulting cell divisions do not involve clamps.

What glues cells together is presently unknown, but based on the finding that the matrix can be stained with basic fuchsin [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], it is likely that the matrix contains polysaccharides. In addition, it was reported that hyphae containing diploid nuclei are partially refractory to chemical fixation and this was attributed to lysis of the cell wall and its conversion to a gelatinous material [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Incidentally we noticed that during sporogenesis staining of the cell wall, but not of the septa, with wheat germ agglutinin-Alexa Fluor 488 becomes fainter with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005697.g002">Fig 2</xref>, 8 dpi time point) which could reflect chitin degradation or modification of the cell wall. Cell wall loosening might facilitate the changes in cell morphology which are associated with hyphal fragmentation and spore maturation. The matrix could connect the cells and shield them against biotic and abiotic stresses. Among the 255 Ros1-regulated genes belonging to the functional category &#x0201c;C compound and carbohydrate metabolism&#x0201d;, 55 are predicted to be involved in polysaccharide metabolism. Most of them encode glycoside hydrolases. They are enriched in both up and downregulated gene sets. The two most upregulated genes encode enzymes targeting the fungal cell wall, an EXG1 beta-glucanase (FC = 831) and a chitinase A (FC = 441) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005697.s008">S1 Table</xref>), and both could conceivably be involved in the gelatinization process. The strong Ros1-dependent upregulation of an UDP glucose dehydrogenase (<italic>UMAG_00118</italic>) suggests an increased glucuronic acid production at the onset of sporogenesis. Bacterial extracellular matrices as well as the capsule of <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> contain highly polar glycosaminoglycans which are rich in glucuronic acid [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].

This <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> gene is involved in capsule synthesis by supporting polysaccharide export [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. It is conceivable that the related gene in <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> (<italic>UMAG_11017</italic>) could fulfill a similar function in the export of matrix material. We also observed that the repellent gene <italic>rep1</italic>, which is already upregulated in hyphae [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] is further induced by Ros1 during sporogenesis. Repellents are structural proteins forming amyloid fibrils at the cell surface which mediate hyphal adhesion to hydrophobic surfaces [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. These amyloid fibrils could be of importance during sporogenesis, could aid in connecting hyphae with each other and assume a structural function in the formation of the matrix. Consistent with this hypothesis hydrophobins which are functionally similar to repellents [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] play a structural role in the formation of fruiting bodies [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].

Among them were genes encoding ergosterol biosynthetic enzymes, sphingolipid biosynthetic enzymes and fatty acid synthesizing / modifying enzymes like cyclopropane fatty acid synthase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005697.s008">S1 Table</xref>). The likely ensuing alterations of plasma membrane composition might reflect that the plasma membrane in spores has a different composition from that of vegetative cells. In <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, sporulation involves de novo synthesis of the forespore membrane within the cytoplasm of mother cells, which subsequently becomes the plasma membrane of the developing ascospores [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].

In line with this, a gene encoding a caleosin-like protein (<italic>UMAG_02753</italic>) is strongly upregulated by Ros1 (FC = 220). Caleosins are involved in the structural maintenance and turnover of lipid storage organelles, so-called lipid droplets [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The strong upregulation of this gene at 8 dpi might thus indicate lipid storage in spores.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Ros1 and its relation to other members of the WOPR family</title><p>Most WOPR regulators characterized so far in plant pathogenic ascomycetes regulate both plant invasion and sexual / asexual spore production [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

Binding sites for all WOPR proteins characterized to date are conserved [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and we have shown here that Ros1 can also bind the 14 bp consensus sequence identified for Wor1 [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, not all Ros1-bound regions identified by ChIP-seq (765 out of 1913) harbor this motif. This could indicate that Ros1 can recognize additional sequences more distantly related to the Wor1 binding site or that it can bind additional sequences via interaction with other transcription factors. Recent studies in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> and <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> have provided evidence that WOPR proteins can bind promoters in complex with other core regulators and have suggested that the formation of these complexes might be mediated by glutamine-rich regions [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] which serve as protein interaction domains also in other proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The presence of an exceptionally long poly-glutamine tract in the C-terminal domain of Ros1 might reflect such a role. Similarly to Wor1 [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] and based on finding that direct Ros1 targets include both up and downregulated genes Ros1 may function both as an activator and a repressor.</p><p>In <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic>, Wor1, Mit1 and Ryp1 are part of core regulatory networks in which each transcription factor regulates and is regulated by the others [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].

Analysis of Ros1 dependent gene expression revealed that the negative effect of Ros1 on filamentous growth could originate from an alteration of the bE/bW regulatory cascade. About 50% of the 345 genes which are regulated by overexpressing bE1/bW2 in axenic culture [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] were found to be affected by Ros1. 75 genes upregulated by bE/bW are repressed by Ros1 and this includes several regulators of the <italic>b</italic> cascade: Rbf1, the central regulator of pathogenic development responsible for inducing the majority of the 345 <italic>b</italic>-regulated genes, and two of its downstream targets, Biz1 and Hdp1, which modulate the cell cycle and regulate the growth of filaments [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Conversely, 40 genes downregulated by bE/bW are induced by Ros1 and 36 genes upregulated by bE/bW were also induced by Ros1. Among the 170 <italic>b</italic>-dependent genes differentially expressed, Ros1 is likely to directly regulate 71. Interestingly, <italic>bE</italic>, <italic>bW</italic> and <italic>prf1</italic>, the main regulators of the <italic>b</italic> cascade, are only slightly repressed by Ros1, suggesting that the Ros1 induced inhibition of filamentation does not re-establish the budding program This is also apparent when <italic>b</italic>-expressing cells are microscopically observed after premature expression of Ros1. In these cases we observe the formation of septated, compartmentalized cells each containing a single nucleus. Such structures, where cell segments containing a single nucleus become deliminated by thick septa, are reminiscent to structures in sporogenous hyphae [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This suggests that Ros1 targets the <italic>b</italic> cascade at certain nodes without downregulating the entire cascade and this may then be prerequisite for entering this septation program. During infection, inhibition of parts of the <italic>b</italic> cascade would occur at a specific stage of biotrophic development, when the cell cycle has been released and the <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> dikaryon is proliferating in the infected tissue by clamp formation. This developmental stage is different from the filamentous stage achieved by overexpressing <italic>bE1/bW2</italic> in axenic culture. Therefore, data sets generated by Heimel <italic>et al</italic>. (2010) [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and the 8 dpi time point studied here after infection with the dikaryon are not fully comparable.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Ros1 regulates karyogamy and subsequent cell proliferation</title><p>Our studies have illustrated that <italic>ros1</italic> mutants do not initiate nuclear fusion and fail to trigger massive proliferation.

While 168 genes involved in DNA processing and cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005697.g011">Fig 11</xref>) were differentially regulated by Ros1, we did not observe any significant enrichment for these categories in the <italic>ros1</italic> upregulated gene set. One likely explanation is that at the 8 dpi timepoint chosen for the RNA-seq analysis genes involved in karyogamy are already shut off. Among the 89 Ros1 upregulated genes in the category &#x0201c;DNA processing and cell cycle&#x0201d; we detect clear indicators for proliferation like DNA helicases, DNA primase, PCNA and several DNA mismatch repair proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005697.s008">S1 Table</xref>). However, the <italic>ros1</italic> deletion strain is also able to replicate its DNA in the dikaryotic phase, and this could explain why no significant enrichment is observed for the category &#x0201c;cell cycle and processing&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005697.g007">Fig 7</xref>). In line with this interpretation, protein synthesis and mitochondrial function (respiratory chain) were both overrepresented functional categories among the genes upregulated in sporogenous hyphae compared to the dikaryon of the <italic>ros1</italic> mutant. Late proliferation of diploid hyphae might rely primarily on plant sugars as suggested by the strong upregulation of several glycoside hydrolases located at the surface of the cells, e.g. a secreted trehalase (<italic>UMAG_02212</italic>), a membrane located glucoamylase (<italic>UMAG_04064</italic>), the secreted invertase SUC2 and several other non characterized secreted glycoside hydrolases (e.g. <italic>UMAG_00102</italic>, <italic>UMAG_06434</italic>).</p><p>Infection experiments in maize seedlings showed that <italic>ros1</italic> mutants cause significantly fewer dead plants compared to the wild type.

Mutants in two of these transcription factors genes (<italic>UMAG_02775</italic> and <italic>UMAG_01390</italic>) revealed that both mutant strains were able to reach the gelatinization stage and to trigger hyphal fragmentation but failed at discrete subsequent steps of spore maturation. This suggests that these genes are regulators of the spore maturation process downstream of Ros1. Other regulatory proteins previously shown to interfere with teliospore formation are Hgl1, the histone deacetylase Hda1, and the transcription factors Rum1, Ust1, and Tup1 [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].

Ust1 (<italic>UMAG_15042</italic>) is a transcriptional repressor in haploid cells which represses filamentation as well as formation of spore-like structures.

One of the main findings emerging from our transcriptional analysis is that Ros1 in <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> induces a massive switch in the effector repertoire affecting about 60% (194 genes) of the predicted set of effector genes without functional domains [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] as well as 4 genes encoding effectors with functional domain. 82 of the 198 differentially regulated effector genes are likely to be directly targeted by Ros1. These include <italic>cmu1</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], <italic>pit2</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], <italic>mig1</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], 23 genes residing in effector clusters (2A, 2B, 5A, 6A, 10A, 19A, 22A,) [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] as well as 45 of the late-induced effectors. The differential regulation of the genes which are not direct targets likely results from the alteration of the bE/bW cascade by Ros1. Contrary to Sge1 which induces effector genes required for virulence in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>oxysporum</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], Ros1 mostly downregulates effector genes. 26 of the 128 downregulated effector genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005697.g007">Fig 7</xref>) reside in clusters where the cluster deletion causes a virulence defect (5A, 5B, 6A, 10A, 19A) [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and 10 are members of the <italic>eff1</italic> effector family that also contributes to virulence [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Unexpectedly, among the effectors downregulated by Ros1 are also critical effectors involved in the inhibition of plant defense responses like Stp1, Cmu1 and Pit2 [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>].

While it is easy to conceive that <italic>see1</italic>, an effector involved in cell expansion associated with tumor formation [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] is downregulated because tumor formation has happened already at the stage when <italic>ros1</italic> is induced, the downregulation of effectors with critical functions in plant defense suppression is more difficult to explain. Either plant defenses at this late stage of <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> development could be distinct from the early stages of infection and require a different effector set for suppression. Or alternatively the massive production of matrix material which is associated with the formation of the fungal aggregates, could shield the aggregated hyphae from plant detection or from the action of antimicrobial compounds associated with plant defenses. Reduced effector expression could then be sufficient to maintain the inhibition of plant defense at the periphery of the aggregates.</p><p>As a third possibility it could be the combined action of late induced effectors plus matrix that is effective. In total, there are 70 effector genes that are induced by Ros1 (68 without functional domains). Four of them (<italic>UMAG_03138</italic>, <italic>UMAG_05926</italic>, <italic>UMAG_03046</italic>, <italic>UMAG_12258</italic>) exhibited a 50-fold higher expression in infections with wild type compared to the <italic>ros1</italic> mutant strains. 13 of these late-induced effector genes reside in effector clusters (19A, 10A, 2B, 5A, 6A, 9A) including clusters involved in virulence (5A, 6A, 10A, 19A) [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Since the cluster deletions were all generated in a solopathogenic haploid strain [<xref rid="ppat.1005697.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] in which spore formation does not follow the same sequence of events as in the dikaryon, we cannot presently assess whether these late effectors affect processes facilitating <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> sporulation, inhibit late plant defense responses and / or are participating to the formation of the matrix. Alternatively, these late effectors might, together with secondary metabolites induced at that stage, be used as a cocktail to defend the spores against other microbes which could colonize tumor tissue when it dries up and ruptures, releasing the spores. One could also consider that late effectors could fulfill a signaling function inside the aggregates to control the spore maturation process.</p><p>In conclusion, Ros1 emerges as the central regulator of a major developmental reprogramming leading to teliospore production and completion of the life cycle in <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005697.g010">Fig 10</xref>).

The Ros1WOPR-His containing fractions were pooled and loaded on a Superdex75 gel filtration column (SuperdexTM 75 10/300GL, GE Healthcare) equilibrated in gel filtration buffer (20 mM HEPES, 20 mM NaCl, 0.1 &#x003bc;M PMSF and 1 mM DTT). The Ros1WOPR-His containing fractions were pooled and incubated in batch with source 15Q anion exchange beads (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in gel filtration buffer. Ros1WOPR-His remained in the supernatant, which was concentrated via Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugation units with an Ultracel-3 membrane (Merck Millipore). The protein was stored at 4&#x000b0;C for up to five days.</p></sec><sec id="sec031"><title>Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)</title><p>For <italic>ros1</italic> WT-probe and ORF-probes, pC<italic>ros1</italic> was used as template.

For competition reactions, competitor fragment was added in a 500-fold molar excess. Binding reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. In competition experiments Ros1WOPR was incubated for 20 min with the non-labeled competitor prior to addition of the probe. Binding reactions were separated on native 4% polyacrylamide 0.5 X TBE gels. Gels were transferred to a nylon membrane and biotin-labeled DNA fragments were detected using a streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate and a highly sensitive chemiluminescent substrate as recommended by the manufacturer (Thermofischer).</p></sec><sec id="sec032"><title>Accession numbers</title><p>ros1 (<italic>UMAG_05853</italic>): XM_011393913; <italic>UMAG_02775</italic>: XM_011390829; <italic>UMAG_01390</italic>: XM_011388973</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec033"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1005697.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Ros1 belongs to the WOPR family of transcriptional regulators.</title><p>(A) Schematic representation of the domain structure of <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> Ros1 protein (UmRos1, XP_011392215) and other members of the WOPR family including all WOPR proteins which have been experimentally characterized: <italic>Zymoseptoria tritici</italic> Wor1 (ZmWor1, AHH91582), <italic>Cladosporium fulvum</italic> Wor1 (CfWor1, JGI ID: 183744), <italic>Fusarium verticillioides</italic> Sge1 (FvSge1, W7MPI5), <italic>Fusarium oxysporum f</italic>. <italic>sp</italic>. <italic>Lycopersici</italic> Sge1 (FoSge1, AGA55574), <italic>Verticillium dahlia</italic> Sge1 (VdSge1, EGY16897), <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> GTI1 (MoGTI1, ELQ65940), <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> Fgp1 (FgFgp1, I1S5P3), <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> Reg1 (BcReg1, XP_001546736), <italic>Candida albicans</italic> Wor1 (CaWor1, Q5AP80), <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Mit1 (ScMit1, P40002), <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> Gti1 (SpGti1, CAB61447).
