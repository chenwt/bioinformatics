Recent studies suggest involvement in cancer of fatty acid oxidation, a process functionally opposite to lipogenesis. A mechanistic link from lipid catabolism to oncogenic processes is yet to be established. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) is a rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation (FAO) that catalyzes the transfer of long-chain acyl group of the acyl-CoA ester to carnitine, thereby shuttling fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix for &#x003b2;-oxidation. In the present study, we demonstrated that CPT1A was highly expressed in most ovarian cancer cell lines and primary ovarian serous carcinomas. Overexpression of CPT1A correlated with a poor overall survival of ovarian cancer patients. Inactivation of CPT1A decreased cellular ATP levels and induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1, suggesting that ovarian cancer cells depend on or are addicted to CPT1A-mediated FAO for cell cycle progression. CPT1A deficiency also suppressed anchorage-independent growth and formation of xenografts from ovarian cancer cell lines. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21<sup>WAF1</sup> (p21) was identified as most consistently and robustly induced cell cycle regulator upon inactivation of CPT1A. Furthermore, p21 was transcriptionally upregulated by the FoxO transcription factors, which were in turn phosphorylated and activated by AMP-activated protein kinase and the mitogen-activated protein kinases JNK and p38. Our results established the oncogenic relevance of CPT1A and a mechanistic link from lipid catabolism to cell cycle regulation, suggesting that CPT1A could be a prognostic biomarker and rational target for therapeutic intervention of cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation</kwd><kwd>ovarian cancer</kwd><kwd>CPT1A</kwd><kwd>FoxO</kwd><kwd>p21</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>One of the most fundamental changes in cancer is the development of a lipogenic phenotype, mediated by increased expression or activity of key lipogenic enzymes primarily fatty acid synthase (FAS) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Cancer cells rely on hyperactive lipogenesis for cell membrane biogenesis, growth and survival [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In contrast, the role of lipid catabolism via fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation (FAO) in cancer has not been well defined. Although FAO is the major source of ATP production in normal cells, most previous studies of cancer bioenergetics have focused on abnormal glucose metabolism, namely the Warburg effect, whereby cancer cells up-regulate glycolysis to provide quick energy and biosynthetic intermediates [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Recent evidence suggests that fatty acids from neighboring adipose tissues, lipoproteins, membrane phospholipids, and intracellular storage fat have potential to fuel cancer cells [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, unlike glycolytic and lipogenic pathways where specific metabolic enzymes such as hexokinase 2 and FAS are known to be deregulated by oncogene (s) or by inactivation of tumor suppressors [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], there is limited evidence for cancer-associated abnormal expression or activity of the enzymes directly involved in the FAO pathway. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) is a rate-limiting enzyme of FAO that catalyzes the transfer of long-chain acyl group of the acyl-CoA ester to carnitine, thereby shuttling long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. There are three members of the CPT1 family, CPT1A (liver form), CPT1B (muscle form) and CPT1C (brain form) encoded by three paralogous genes [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It has been recently reported that CPT1C is upregulated in lung cancer and is induced by metabolic stress such as hypoxia and glucose deprivation in a p53-dependent manner, potentially contributing to cytoprotection in hypoxic tumors [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the fact that p53 is frequently inactivated in malignancies does not support a general role for the p53-dependent induction of CPT1C in promotion of oncogenesis. Furthermore, the brain-specific CPT1C is enzymatically deficient [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] or only weakly active on membranes of endoplasmic reticulum or microsomes [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Some biochemical studies suggest that CPT1C displays a high binding affinity with malonyl-CoA, a physiological inhibitor of CPT1 enzymes [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus CPT1C could be involved in sequestering malonyl-CoA to reduce its availability to the enzymatically active CPT1A. However, a physiological role for CPT1C in fatty acid metabolism remains controversial [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we examined expression and biological significance of CPT1A, the most widely distributed and enzymatically active form of the CPT1 family, in human ovarian cancer that replicates and spreads within the fat-rich abdomen. Our results indicated that CPT1A is highly expressed in most ovarian cancer cell lines and ovarian serous carcinomas. Overexpression of CPT1A is associated with poor prognosis of ovarian cancer patients. Inactivation of CPT1A in ovarian cancer cell lines by pharmacological inhibition or by lentivirally-mediated knockdown led to growth arrest at G0/G1 and inhibition of tumorigenicity in SCID mice, suggesting that CPT1A-dependent FAO plays an essential role in cell cycle progression of ovarian cancer cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying these cellular outcomes of CPT1A inhibition, we performed a PCR-based cell cycle assay and identified p21<sup>WAF1</sup> (p21) as the most consistently and dramatically upregulated cell cycle regulator upon CPT1A inactivation. We further demonstrated that CPT1A inhibition induced time-dependent phosphorylation and activation of FoxO transcription factors by AMPK, JNK and p38. These results revealed a mechanistic link from CPT1A and CPT1A-dependent FAO to cell cycle regulation in ovarian cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>CPT1A is highly expressed and contributes to poor prognosis in ovarian cancer</title><p>To investigate the role of CPT1 and CPT1-dependent FAO in ovarian cancer, we examined expression of CPT1A in multiple ovarian cancer cell lines.

Patients whose expression levels of CPT1A were one normalized standard deviation above the mean of CPT1A were grouped as CPT1A High. Conversely, those with one normalized standard deviation below the mean were grouped as CPT1A Low. Kaplan Meier survival and the Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test of the two groups using the GraphPad PRISM software indicated that CPT1A High patients had a statistically significant shorter overall survival (medium 1435 days) than that of CPT1A Low patients (medium 1767 days) (<italic>p =</italic> 0.0362) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), suggesting that CPT1A overexpression is associated with poorer prognosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title>Inactivation of CPT1A inhibits cell growth and ATP production</title><p>Previous studies of CPT1A in cancer have been restricted to pharmacological inhibitors such as etomoxir or its combination with inhibitors co-targeting other metabolic, oncogenic or survival cascades [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To elucidate biological functions of CPT1A in cancer cells in a more specific manner, we used lentivirus-mediated shRNA to knockdown its expression in SKOV-3, Caov-3, OVCA-432 and OVCAR-3 that expressed highest levels of endogenous CPT1A (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>, shRNA downregulation of CPT1A efficiently inhibited the rate of FAO, similar to the treatment of these cells with etomoxir.</p><p>There were little or slight increases (&#x0003c; 4%) in apoptotic cells in association with inactivation of CPT1A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). A significant cellular effect we observed was inhibition of cell proliferation and cellular DNA synthesis by CPT1A inactivation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The inhibition of cell proliferation correlated with knockdown efficiency of CPT1A shRNAs. CPT1A-sh2 that essentially eliminated CPT1A expression more dramatically suppressed these cells than CPT1A-sh1 that only partially downregulated CPT1A (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Similar to shRNA knockdown, the CPT1A inhibitor etomoxir also suppressed cellular DNA synthesis and cell proliferation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Furthermore, inhibition of CPT1A and the subsequent FAO by either CPT1A shRNA or etomoxir caused prominent decreases in cellular ATP levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), indicating that FAO contributes significantly to ATP production. Consistent with the drop in cellular ATP, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an energy sensor and regulator of cellular metabolism [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], was activated in CPT1A-inactivated cells as reflected by increased phosphorylation of T172 within the activation domain of the AMPK &#x003b1; subunit AMPK&#x003b1; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Inactivation of CPT1A decreases cellular ATP levels and cell growth</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Growth curves of CPT1A-sh1, CPT1A-sh2 knockdown cells and ctrl-sh cells plated in 12-well plates were constructed from daily quantification of cell numbers with a Z1 Coulter counter (<italic><bold>upper</bold></italic>).

We performed staining for &#x003b2;-galactosidase (&#x003b2;-gal) activity, a biomarker of cellular senescence [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These early emerging, morphologically distinct cells were stained positive for &#x003b2;-gal. Similarly, treatment with etomoxir for 3 days also increased numbers of &#x003b2;-gal-positive and morphologically flattened cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). However, &#x003b2;-gal-positive cells were not detectable in Caov-3 following CPT1A-shRNA knockdown or treatment with etomoxir (data not shown). In addition, the senescent cells became less obvious after initial passaging of CPT1A knockdown cells, suggesting that they were negatively selected and gradually eliminated from culture. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, CPT1A knockdown cells remained to be growth inhibited although they no longer showed evident cellular senescence. Similarly, treatment with etomoxir for only 24 hours was sufficient to inhibit cell proliferation in the absence of senescence.

Interestingly, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (CDKN1A in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) was most drastically and consistently induced by inactivation of CPT1A in both cell lines. The expression pattern of the cell cycle-related genes in CPT1A-silenced cells was strikingly reproduced by treatment with etomoxir, suggesting that the CPT1A inhibitor targeted CPT1A specifically to recapitulate CPT1A knockdown-induced gene expression signature. In addition to p21, there were other genes that showed minor, cell line-specific up- or down-regulation. For example, p16<sup>INK4A</sup> (CDKN2A) was modestly decreased by CPT1A inactivation in SKOV-3 but not in OVCA-432.

However, p38 and JNK could be also activated by other mechanisms in FAO-depleted cells independently of AMPK. Indeed, their activation kinetics was not consistent with AMPK being a sole mediator of p38 or JNK activation in etomoxir-treated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). In Caov-3, phosphorylation of p38 was consistently elevated from 1.5 hours through 24 hours. Phosphorylation of p38 in SKOV-3 and OVCA-432 showed a biphasic pattern where a strong, early signal was detected at 1.5&#x02013;3 hours and a second peak seen at 24 hours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).

To test this, we performed EMSA to determine whether inhibition of CPT1A enhances DNA-binding activity of nuclear FoxO proteins.

While considerable studies based on metabolomics analysis or pharmacological inhibitors have suggested involvement of FAO in cancer cells [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], there is no direct evidence or molecular mechanism supporting the concept that cancer cells indeed rely on FAO for maintaining malignancy. In the present work, we investigated the biological relevance of FAO to ovarian cancer. Our results indicated that CPT1A, the rate-setting enzyme of FAO is abundantly expressed in a high percentage of ovarian serous carcinomas and ovarian cancer cell lines. Based on the analysis of pre-existing expression and patient outcome data, we found that CPT1A overexpression contributed to poor survival of ovarian cancer. Inactivation of CPT1A induced expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and cell cycle arrest at G0/G1. Knockdown of CPT1A expression also suppressed tumorigenicity and aggressiveness of ovarian cancer cells in SCID mice. Mechanistic studies identified FoxO as a key transcription factor responsible for upregulation of p21. As further mechanism upstream of FoxO activation, inhibition of CPT1A stimulated phosphorylation of FoxO through activation of AMPK, p38 and JNK kinases. These results not only showed cellular consequences of blocking FAO but also elucidated a molecular mechanism coupling fatty acid catabolism to cell cycle progression and cancer pathogenicity, suggesting that the FAO pathway could be a viable target for therapeutic intervention in ovarian cancer and probably other human malignancies.</p><p>Previous studies have shown diverse cellular effects of etomoxir in different types of cancer cells [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In the HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells, etomoxir at 1 mM was found to trigger both growth inhibition and apoptotic/necrotic cell death [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Schlaepfer et al. reported that treatment with etomoxir reduced viability of prostate cancer cells. The effects seemed to be associated with decreases in androgen receptor expression and mTOR signaling, as well as an increase in caspase-3 activity [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Another study in multiple myeloma cells by Tirado-V&#x000e9;lez et al. demonstrated that etomoxir inhibited proliferation via G0/G1 arrest [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], similar to the primary cellular effect we observed here in ovarian cancer cells. However, p21 was found to be downregulated by etomoxir in myeloma cells, suggesting that other cell cycle regulators might have mediated the anti-proliferative effect of etomoxir in myeloma cells [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In our study, etomoxir treatment and shRNA knockdown elicited strikingly similar effects on p21 and other cell cycle-related genes. Upregulation of p21 seems to be a major effector of CPT1A depletion although we can't rule out the possibility for involvement of additional unrecognized players in cell cycle arrest of ovarian cancer cells. Most recently, Schoors et al. reported that fatty acid carbon source from CPT1A-dependent FAO was essential for dNTP synthesis in endothelial cells [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Loss of CPT1A led to impaired proliferation of endothelial cells and vascular sprouting defects. This dNTP-mediated function of CPT1A seemed to be specific to endothelial cells, not shared by other cell types including epithelial cells [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In contrast to our observation of ATP downregulation and AMPK activation in ovarian cancer cell lines, these authors did not observe ATP depletion in CPT1A-inactivated endothelial cells [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], suggesting complex roles of CPT1A and FAO in different cell types.</p><p>In physiological conditions, lipogenesis and FAO are mutually exclusive processes, controlled by the level of malonyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA is an intermediate of fatty acid synthesis and meanwhile an allosteric inhibitor of CPT1, preventing fatty acid biosynthesis and FAO from occurring simultaneously. However, this regulation seems to be defective in cancer cells if we and others are right in that both lipid anabolism and catabolism are highly active in cancer. The mechanism subverting the tight control of lipid anabolic and catabolic processes by malonyl-CoA in cancer cells is not fully understood. One possibility is that CPT1C, a subtype of CPT1 lacking enzymatic activity but capable of binding and quenching malonyl-CoA, might be highly expressed, preserving the enzymatically active CPT1A in malignant cells [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the present study, however, we observed abundant expression of CPT1A, but not other CPT1A isoforms in ovarian cancer cells. Increased CPT1A levels could provide a direct means to counteracting the inhibitory effect of malonyl-CoA on activity of CPT1A, allowing active lipogenesis and FAO to take place concurrently.</p><p>We further asked how inhibition of CPT1A culminated in p21 induction. Our experiments provide multilevel evidence pointing to FoxO as an effector downstream of CPT1A inhibition. The FoxO transcription factors are important mediators of not only tumor suppression but also longevity as demonstrated in C. elegans [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. FoxO regulates expression of a broad range of targets including microRNAs [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In addition to phosphorylation-dependent regulation of FoxO, the stability and activity of FoxO could be also modulated by methylation [<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Our study demonstrated that the FoxO transcription factors were required for upregulation of p21 transcription in CPT1A-depleted cells, as suggested by mutational analysis of the p21 gene promoter as well as shRNA silencing of FoxO. Furthermore, we observed that several intracellular kinases including AMPK, p38 and JNK became phosphorylated/activated in response to inhibition of CPT1A. These are kinases known to phosphorylate FoxO proteins at specific sites, leading to activation of their DNA-binding and/or transcriptional activities [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our data indicate that these kinases participate in phosphorylating FoxO transcription factors to enhance FoxO transcriptional activity and p21 expression in CPT1A-depleted cells.</p><p>In sum, CPT1A is abundantly expressed in ovarian cancer. Its overexpression contributes to poor prognosis of the disease. Ovarian cancer cells rely on or are &#x0201c;addicted&#x0201d; to CPT1A activity for maintaining growth and the malignant phenotype. The CPT1A-dependent FAO functions to restrain the FoxO transcriptional activity in ovarian cancer cells. Disruption of such a control leads to phosphorylation and activation of FoxO by AMPK, JNK and p38, and the subsequent induction of p21 and cell cycle arrest at G0/G1. These results reveal oncogenic relevance of CPT1A and a mechanistic link from lipid catabolism to cell cycle regulation in ovarian cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Reagents</title><p>Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from Atlanta Biological (Atlanta, GA).
