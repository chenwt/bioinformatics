molecular profiles for human breast cancers have enabled the identification of features that can predict therapeutic response; however, little is known about how the various data types can best be combined to yield optimal predictors. Collections of breast cancer cell lines mirror many aspects of breast cancer molecular pathobiology, and measurements of their omic and biological therapeutic responses are well-suited for development of strategies to identify the most predictive molecular feature sets.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We used least squares-support vector machines and random forest algorithms to identify molecular features associated with responses of a collection of 70 breast cancer cell lines to 90 experimental or approved therapeutic agents. The datasets analyzed included measurements of copy number aberrations, mutations, gene and isoform expression, promoter methylation and protein expression. Transcriptional subtype contributed strongly to response predictors for 25% of compounds, and adding other molecular data types improved prediction for 65%. No single molecular dataset consistently out-performed the others, suggesting that therapeutic response is mediated at multiple levels in the genome. Response predictors were developed and applied to TCGA data, and were found to be present in subsets of those patient samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results suggest that matching patients to treatments based on transcriptional subtype will improve response rates, and inclusion of additional features from other profiling data types may provide additional benefit. Further, we suggest a systems biology strategy for guiding clinical trials so that patient cohorts most likely to respond to new therapies may be more efficiently identified.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Breast cancer is a clinically and genomically heterogeneous disease. Six subtypes were defined approximately a decade ago based on transcriptional characteristics and were designated luminal A, luminal B, ERBB2-enriched, basal-like, claudin-low and normal-like [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. New cancers can be assigned to these subtypes using a 50-gene transcriptional signature designated the PAM50 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, the number of distinct subtypes is increasing steadily as multiple data types are integrated. Integration of genome copy number and transcriptional profiles defines 10 subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and adding mutation status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], methylation pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], pattern of splice variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], protein and phosphoprotein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and microRNA expression and pathway activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] may define still more subtypes. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project and other international genomics efforts were founded to improve our understanding of the molecular landscapes of most major tumor types with the ultimate goal of increasing the precision with which individual cancers are managed. One application of these data is to identify molecular signatures that can be used to assign specific treatment to individual patients. However, strategies to develop optimal predictive marker sets are still being explored. Indeed, it is not yet clear which molecular data types (genome, transcriptome, proteome, and so on) will be most useful as response predictors.</p><p>In breast cancer, cell lines mirror many of the molecular characteristics of the tumors from which they were derived, and are therefore a useful preclinical model in which to explore strategies for predictive marker development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. To this end, we have analyzed the responses of 70 well characterized breast cancer cell lines to 90 compounds and used two independent machine learning approaches to identify pretreatment molecular features that are strongly associated with responses within the cell line panel. For most compounds tested, <italic>in vitro</italic> cell line systems provide the only experimental data that can be used to identify predictive response signatures, as most of the compounds have not been tested in clinical trials. Our study focuses on breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and extends earlier efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], by including more cell lines, by evaluating a larger number of compounds relevant to breast cancer, and by increasing the molecular data types used for predictor development. Data types used for correlative analysis include pretreatment measurements of mRNA expression, genome copy number, protein expression, promoter methylation, gene mutation, and transcriptome sequence (RNAseq). This compendium of data is now available to the community as a resource for further studies of breast cancer and the inter-relationships between data types. We report here on initial machine learning-based methods to identify correlations between these molecular features and drug response. In the process, we assessed the utility of individual data sets and the integrated data set for response predictor development. We also describe a publicly available software package that we developed to predict compound efficacy in individual tumors based on their omic features. This tool could be used to assign an experimental compound to individual patients in marker-guided trials, and serves as a model for how to assign approved drugs to individual patients in the clinical setting. We explored the performance of the predictors by using it to assign compounds to 306 TCGA samples based on their molecular profiles.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Breast cancer cell line panel</title><p>We assembled a collection of 84 breast cancer cell lines composed of 35 luminal, 27 basal, 10 claudin-low, 7 normal-like, 2 matched normal cell lines, and 3 of unknown subtype (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Fourteen luminal and 7 basal cell lines were also ERBB2-amplified. Seventy cell lines were tested for response to 138 compounds by growth inhibition assays. The cells were treated in triplicate with nine different concentrations of each compound as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The concentration required to inhibit growth by 50% (GI<sub>50</sub>) was used as the response measure for each compound. Compounds with low variation in response in the cell line panel were eliminated, leaving a response data set of 90 compounds. An overview of the 70 cell lines with subtype information and 90 therapeutic compounds with GI<sub>50</sub> values is provided in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. All 70 lines were used in development of at least some predictors depending on data type availability. The therapeutic compounds include conventional cytotoxic agents such as taxanes, platinols and anthracyclines, as well as targeted agents such as hormone and kinase inhibitors. Some of the agents target the same protein or share common molecular mechanisms of action. Responses to compounds with common mechanisms of action were highly correlated, as has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>A rich and multi-omic molecular profiling dataset</title><p>Seven pretreatment molecular profiling data sets were analyzed to identify molecular features associated with response. These included profiles for DNA copy number (Affymetrix SNP6 - EGA accessions EGAS00000000059 and EGAS00001000585), mRNA expression (Affymetrix U133A and Exon 1.0 ST array - ArrayExpress accessions E-TABM-157 and E-MTAB-181), transcriptome sequence (RNAseq - Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession GSE48216), promoter methylation (Illumina Methylation27 BeadChip - GEO accession GSE42944), protein abundance (Reverse Protein Lysate Array - Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>), and mutation status (Exome-Seq - GEO accession GSE48216). The data were preprocessed as described in Supplementary Methods of Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>. Figure S1 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> gives an overview of the number of features per data set before and after filtering based on variance and signal detection above background where applicable. Exome-seq data were available for 75 cell lines, followed by SNP6 data for 74 cell lines, therapeutic response data for 70, RNAseq for 56, exon array for 56, Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) for 49, methylation for 47, and U133A expression array data for 46 cell lines. Information on the overlap in cell lines with both response data and molecular data is provided in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>. The set of 48 core cell lines was defined as those with response data and at least 4 molecular data sets.</p></sec><sec><title>Inter-data relationships</title><p>We investigated the association between expression, copy number and methylation data. We distinguished correlation at the cell line level and gene level. At the cell line level, we report average correlation between datasets for each cell line across all genes, while correlation at the gene level represents the average correlation between datasets for each gene across all cell lines. Correlation among the three expression datasets (U133A, exon array, and RNAseq) ranged from 0.6 to 0.77 at the cell line level, and from 0.58 to 0.71 at the gene level. Promoter methylation and gene expression were, on average, negatively correlated as expected, with correlation ranging from -0.16 to -0.25 at the cell line level and -0.10 to -0.15 at the gene level. Across the genome, copy number and gene expression were positively correlated (0.18 to 0.22 at the cell line level; 0.35 to 0.44 at the gene level). When restricted to copy number aberrations, 22 to 39% of genes in the aberrant regions showed a significant concordance between their genomic and transcriptomic profiles from U133A, exon array and RNAseq after multiple testing correction (see the 'Intra-data relationships&#x02019; section in Supplementary Results in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> and Table S4a-c in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Machine learning approaches identify accurate cell line-derived response signatures</title><p>We developed candidate response signatures by analyzing associations between biological responses to therapy and pretreatment omic signatures. We used the integrative approach displayed in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> for the construction of compound sensitivity signatures. Standard data pre-processing methods were applied to each dataset. Classification signatures for response were developed using the weighted least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] in combination with a grid search approach for feature optimization, as well as random forests (RF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], both described in detail in the Supplementary Methods in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>. For this, the cell lines were divided into a sensitive and resistant group for each compound using the mean GI<sub>50</sub> value for that compound (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). This seemed most reasonable after manual inspection, with concordant results obtained using TGI (concentration required to achieve total growth inhibition) as response measure. Multiple random divisions of the cell lines into two-thirds training and one-third test sets were performed for both methods, and area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated as an estimate of accuracy (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Cell line-based response prediction strategy.

Thresholds for considering a tumor responsive were objectively chosen for each compound from the distribution of predicted probabilities and each patient was assigned to a status of resistant, intermediate or sensitive. WPMV, weighted percent of model variables.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gb-2013-14-10-r110-1"/></fig><p>The candidate signatures incorporated copy number, methylation, transcription and/or proteomic features. We also included the mutation status of <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, <italic>MLL3</italic>, <italic>CDH1</italic>, <italic>MAP2K4</italic>, <italic>PTEN</italic> and <italic>NCOR1</italic>, chosen based on reported frequencies from TCGA breast project. That project sequenced the exomes of 507 breast invasive carcinomas and identified approximately 30,000 somatic mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Each of the 7 genes was mutated in at least 3% of samples with a false discovery rate (FDR) <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c;0.05. Our whole exome sequencing showed that these genes were also mutated in at least 3% of the breast cancer cell lines. Their mutation rate in TCGA and the cell line panel showed a similar distribution across the subtypes (Figure S2 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). We excluded lower prevalence mutations because their low frequency limits the possibility of significant associations.</p><p>These signatures incorporating any of the molecular features are shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>. They predicted compound response within the cell lines with high estimated accuracy (AUC &#x0003e;0.70) regardless of classification method for 51 (57%) of the compounds tested. Concordance between GI<sub>50</sub> and TGI exceeded 80% for 67% (34/51) of these compounds. A comparison across all 90 compounds of the LS-SVM and RF models with highest AUC based on copy number, methylation, transcription and/or proteomic features revealed a high correlation between both classification methods (Spearman correlation coefficient&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.85, <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c;0.001), with the LS-SVM more predictive for 35 compounds and RF for 55 compounds (Figure S3 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). However, there was a better correlation between both classification methods for compounds with strong biomarkers of response (upper third; Spearman correlation coefficient 0.84) and compounds without a clear signal associated with drug response (lower third; Spearman correlation coefficient 0.46). This suggests that for compounds with strong biomarkers, a signature can be identified by either approach. For compounds with a weaker signal of drug response (middle third), there was a larger discrepancy in performance between both classification methods (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.16), with neither of them outperforming the other.</p><p>Thirteen of the 51 compounds (25%) showed a strong transcriptional subtype-specific response (AUC &#x0003e;0.70), with the best omics signature not adding predictive information beyond a simple transcriptional subtype-based prediction (AUC increase below 0.1) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). This suggests that the use of transcriptional subtype alone could greatly improve prediction of response for a substantial fraction of agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], as is already done for the estrogen receptor (ER), ERBB2 receptor, and selective use of chemotherapy in breast cancer subtypes. This is consistent with our earlier report that molecular pathway activity varies between transcriptional subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, deeper molecular profiling added significant predictive information about probable response for the majority of compounds (33/51&#x02009;=&#x02009;65%) with an increase in AUC of at least 0.1 beyond subtype alone. Mutation status of the seven genes introduced above was in general not more predictive than any other dataset, with the exception of tamoxifen and CGC-11144. For tamoxifen response, prediction based on mutation status was substantially better than subtype, driven predominantly by the higher mutation prevalence of <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations in luminal compared to basal breast cancer and therefore an association of <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation with lack of response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].

Here, we limited our analyses to those data types that are available in the TCGA dataset. Specifically, we developed response predictors for the breast cancer cell line panel using profiles for expression (U133A, exon array at the gene level, or RNAseq at the gene level), copy number, and promoter methylation for 51 compounds for which predictive power was high (AUC &#x0003e;0.7; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). We applied these signatures to a set of 369 luminal, 95 basal, 8 claudin-low, and 58 ERBB2-amplified samples from the TCGA project. We used profiles of expression (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;536), copy number (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;306) and promoter methylation (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;318) in our analyses.

Eighteen of these compounds have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, including five for breast cancer.

To obtain a ranking of the importance of the molecular datasets, we compared prediction performance of classifiers built on individual data sets and their combination for 29 common cell lines (with the exclusion of the normal-like cell lines). Importantly, no single data type performed well for all compounds, with each data type performing best for some compounds (Figure S7 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Table S6a,c in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> shows the ranking of the datasets according to the independent classifiers obtained with LS-SVM and RF, respectively. For the LS-SVM classifiers, RNAseq performed best for 22 compounds, exon array for 20 compounds, SNP6 for 18, U133A for 17 and methylation data for 12 compounds (Table S6a in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Similar results were confirmed with the RF approach (Table S6c in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>).

For example, exon array worked best for VX-680 (AUC 0.81), RNAseq for carboplatin (AUC 0.89), and RPPA for bortezomib (AUC 0.87). Data type specificity was in general not related to therapeutic compound class, although there were a few exceptions for LS-SVM with RNAseq performing well for polyamine analogs (CGC-11047, CGC-11144) and mitotic inhibitors (ixabepilone, paclitaxel, vinorelbine), SNP6 for ERBB2/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors (AG1478, BIBW2992, erlotinib, gefitinib, lapatinib), and methylation for CDK1 inhibitors (NU6102, purvalanol A). The full combination of genome-wide datasets yielded a higher AUC value than the best performing individual dataset for only a limited number of compounds (AKT1-2 inhibitor, GSK461364 and PF-4691502). The full combination signatures, however, generally ranked closely to the best signatures based on individual data types.

The fully featured data included transcript- and exon-level estimates for the exon array data and transcript-, exon-, junction, boundary-, and intron-level estimates for the RNAseq data. Overall, there was no increase in performance for classifiers built with 'splice-aware' data versus gene level only. The overall difference in AUC from all features minus gene-level was 0.002 for RNAseq and -0.006 for exon array, a negligible difference in both cases. However, there were a few individual compounds with a modest increase in performance when considering splicing information (Table S8 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Interestingly, both ERBB2 targeting compounds, BIBW2992 and lapatinib, showed improved performance using splice-aware features in both RNAseq and exon array datasets. This suggests that splice-aware predictors may perform better for prediction of ERBB2 amplification and response to compounds that target it. However, the overall result suggests that prediction of response does not benefit greatly from splicing information over gene-level estimates of expression. This indicates that the high performance of RNAseq for discrimination may have more to do with that technology&#x02019;s improved sensitivity and dynamic range, rather than its ability to detect splicing patterns.</p></sec><sec><title>Pathway overrepresentation analysis aids in interpretation of the response signatures</title><p>We surveyed the pathways and biological processes represented by genes for the 49 best-performing therapeutic response signatures incorporating copy number, methylation, transcription, and/or proteomic features (i.e., no mutation status) with AUC &#x0003e;0.7 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). For these compounds we created functionally organized networks with the ClueGO plugin in Cytoscape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] using Gene Ontology (GO) categories and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)/BioCarta pathways (Supplementary Methods in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Our previous work identified transcriptional networks associated with response to many of these compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In this study, 5 to 100% (median 79%) of GO categories and pathways present in the predictive signatures were found to be significantly associated with drug response (FDR <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c;0.05). The majority of these significant pathways, however, were also associated with transcriptional subtype (17 to 100%, median 70%). These were filtered out to capture subtype-independent biology underlying each compound&#x02019;s mechanism of action. The resulting non-subtype-specific pathways with FDR <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c;0.05 are shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>. Eighty-eight percent of the compounds for which we conducted pathway analysis were significantly associated with one or more GO category and 80% were significantly associated with one or more KEGG pathway. The most commonly identified KEGG pathways (six or more compounds) were hedgehog signaling, basal cell carcinoma, glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, ribosome, spliceosome and Wnt signaling. The most commonly identified GO processes (six or more compounds) also included many critical cancer pathways and processes, such as regulation of cell cycle, cell death, protein kinase activity, metabolism, TGF&#x003b2; receptor signaling, cell-cell adhesion, microtubule polymerization, and Wnt receptor signaling. Many of these processes can be linked directly to the known mechanisms of action of their associated compounds. For example, the signature for docetaxel was significantly enriched for microtubule polymerization genes. Docetaxel is known to function by microtubule disassembly inhibition. Similarly, signatures for the AKT1/2 kinase inhibitor, bosutinib SRC kinase inhibitor, TCS PIM-11 kinase inhibitor and four PI3K inhibitors (GSK2119563, GSK2126458, PF-4691502, TGX-221) were all enriched in genes involved in the negative regulation of protein kinase activity. These kinase regulation genes tended to be consistently up-regulated or both methylated and down-regulated, depending on the therapeutic response signature. Many of the genes in this enriched gene set have well-described roles in modulation of the PI3K/MAPK cascades, including <italic>ERRFI1</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], <italic>DUSP6/7/8</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and <italic>SPRY1/2/4</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In particular, we found that high expression of <italic>GADD45A</italic> was associated with resistance to GSK2126458, PF-4691502 and the AKT1/2 inhibitor, which is consistent with the observation that AKT inhibition modulates cell growth via activation of <italic>GADD45A</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The pan-PI3K targeting agent GSK2126458 is reported to function as a competitive ATP binding inhibitor and the signature for this compound was over-represented in ATP metabolic processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Genomic aberrations and transcriptomic/proteomic features played prominent roles in some of the candidate response signatures. For copy number aberrations, ERBB2 amplification was strongly associated with response to the ERBB2 targeting compounds lapatinib (two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic>-value 2.1e-11) and BIBW2992 (1.6e-5) and to EGFR inhibitors AG1478 (2.5e-4) and gefitinib (9.5e-4). In addition to the association of overall mutation status with tamoxifen and CGC-11144 response discussed above, we also found several individual mutations to be relevant for treatment response. The presence of mutations in <italic>TP53</italic> was strongly associated with response to the PI3K inhibitor BEZ235, with 13/25 (52%) of the sensitive cell lines harboring <italic>TP53</italic> mutations compared to 3/19 (16%) for the resistant cell lines (Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, <italic>P</italic>-value 0.025). This may be an indication of synthetic lethality resulting from BEZ235 inhibition of ATR (Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein) leading to replicative stress in TP53-deficient cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Kim <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] showed a similar trend in a study of 310 cell lines across multiple lineages in which co-mutation of <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>PIK3CA</italic> was positively associated with response to BEZ235. In our study, mutation status for <italic>PIK3CA</italic> was associated with response to the PI3K inhibitor GSK1059615B, with 11/27 (41%) sensitive cell lines carrying <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations compared to 2/21 (10%) for resistant cell lines (<italic>P</italic>-value 0.022). These findings are consistent with recent clinical observations in patients with breast and gynecologic malignancies where treatment with similar agents resulted in response for 30% of patients with <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations compared to a response rate of 10% in wild-type <italic>PIK3CA</italic> patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Response signature Toolbox to predict response in individual tumors</title><p>Our long-term goal is to develop a way to select therapeutic compounds most likely to be effective in an individual patient. A shorter-term goal is to test experimental compounds in patients that are most likely to be responsive. Both of these goals require a strategy to order compounds according to their predicted relative efficacy for individual patients. To this end, we developed software to rank order compounds for predicted efficacy in individual patients (see the 'Patient response prediction toolbox in R' section in Supplementary Results in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). The software applies signatures of response developed <italic>in vitro</italic> to measurements of expression, copy number, and/or methylation for individual samples and produces a list of recommended treatments ranked according to predicted probability of response and <italic>in vitro</italic> GI<sub>50</sub> dynamic range. For cases where several compounds are predicted to be equally effective, highest priority is assigned to the compound with highest GI<sub>50</sub> dynamic range in the cell line panel.</p><p>Given the concordance of the predictive signatures for the 51 compounds in gene expression and subtype association between the cell lines and tumor samples from TCGA, we applied our <italic>in vitro</italic> response predictors to the 306 sample subset for which expression, copy number and methylation measurements were all available. This identified 22 compounds with a model AUC &#x0003e;0.7 for which at least some patients were predicted to be responsive with a probability &#x0003e;0.65. In all cases, thresholds for considering a tumor responsive were objectively chosen for each compound from the distribution of predicted probabilities and each patient was assigned to a status of resistant, intermediate or sensitive (see the 'Patient response prediction toolbox in R' section in Supplementary Results in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>, and Table S10 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). The resulting pattern of predicted sensitivity for the 22 compounds is displayed in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. Most of the compounds were predicted to have strong transcriptional subtype specificity (<italic>P</italic>-values 1.5e-70 to 0.02) although gefitinib and NU6102 were exceptions (Table S9 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Not surprisingly, predicted sensitivity to lapatinib, BIBW2992 and to a lesser extent EGFR inhibitors was highly specific to ERBB2+ patients. Similarly, ER+&#x02009;(and also many ERBB2+) patients were more frequently predicted to be sensitive to the PI3K inhibitors, AKT inhibitors, tamoxifen and to a lesser extent fluorouracil (5-FU). Patients in the basal (ER-/ERBB2-) subtype were predicted to be sensitive to cisplatin, PLK inhibitor (GSK461364A), bortezomib, gamma-secretase inhibitor (PF-3084014), paclitaxel and Nutlin 3A. The percentage of patients predicted to respond to any given compound ranged from 15.7% for BIBW2992 to 43.8% for the PI3K alpha inhibitor GSK2119563. Nearly all patients (99.3%) were predicted to respond to at least one treatment and each patient was predicted to be sensitive to an average of approximately six treatments. The predicted response rate to 5-FU was estimated at 23.9% (Figure S8 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>), in agreement with the observed response rates to 5-FU as monotherapy in breast cancer (17% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] to 26% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]).

The molecular features comprising the high quality signatures are candidate molecular markers of response that we suggest for clinical evaluation. In most cases, the signatures with high predictive power in the cell line panel show significant PAM50 subtype specificity, suggesting that assigning compounds in clinical trials according to transcriptional subtype will increase the frequency of responding patients. However, our findings suggest that treatment decisions could further be improved for most compounds using specifically developed response signatures based on profiling at multiple omic levels, independent of - or in addition to - the previously defined transcriptional subtypes. We make available the drug response data and molecular profiling data from seven different platforms for the entire cell line panel as a resource for the community to aid in improving methods of drug response prediction.</p><p>We found predictive signatures of response across all platforms and levels of the genome. When restricting the analysis to just 55 well-known cancer proteins and phosphoprotein genes, all platforms do a reasonable job of measuring a signal associated with and predictive of drug response. This indicates that if a compound has a molecular signature that correlates with response, it is likely that many of the molecular data types will be able to measure this signature in some way. Furthermore, there was no substantial advantage of the combined platforms compared with the individual platforms. Some platforms might be able to measure the signature with slightly better accuracy, but our results indicate that many of the platforms could be optimized to identify a response-associated predictor.</p><p>Conversely, in the genome-wide comparison, the more comprehensive platforms are the ones that overall resulted in better prediction performance. This difference may reflect the fact that for those platforms, we selected the most significant feature per gene. For example, when a gene measured on the Affymetrix microarray is significantly differentially expressed, the chance is high that a particular exon or transcript is even more significant. Thus, the richness of data types like RNAseq offer the chance to identify both the signature and the most useful specific gene regions and junctions for use in a diagnostic (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the more comprehensive genome-wide platforms could be used for discovery, and once identified, significant features can be migrated to alternative platforms for a lab diagnostic.</p><p>Currently, treatment decisions are guided by ER and ERBB2 status. Using the TCGA dataset of 306 samples with expression, copy number and methylation measurements as a hypothetical example (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), a personalized treatment decision would be available for 81% of patients based on ERBB2 or ER status alone (55 ERBB2+, 193 ERBB2-/ER+). However, given reported response rates for trastuzumab (15 to 50%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and tamoxifen (approximately 25%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] we can expect a substantial fraction of these will not respond. The candidate predictors proposed here could inform such clinical decisions for nearly all patients. Therefore, by considering diverse molecular data, we might suggest treatment options for not only the approximately 20% of patients who are ERBB2-/ER- but also secondary treatment options for those who will suboptimally respond to ER or ERBB2 directed treatments.</p><p>While our efforts to develop predictive drug response signatures are quite promising, they come with several conceptual caveats. Although the cell line panel is a reasonable model system, it does not capture several features known to be of critical importance in primary tumors. In particular, we have not modeled influences of the microenvironment, including additional cell types known to contribute to tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], as well as variation in oxygen content, which has been shown to influence therapeutic response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Expanding these experiments to three-dimensional model systems or mouse xenografts would aid in translation to the clinic. Additionally, validating these predictors in independent data sets will be important for determining how robust they are (see Supplementary Results and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>). Despite these limitations, our observation that we could find evidence of these predictive signatures in the TCGA data suggests that our cell line system is likely capturing many of the key elements involved in mediating therapeutic response.</p><p>Of course, the cell line-derived predictive signatures described in this study require substantial clinical validation. One possibility is in neoadjuvant trials like the I-SPY 2 TRIAL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], in which <italic>in vitro</italic>-derived signatures for individual compounds are tested for power in predicting pathologic complete response or change in tumor volume measured with magnetic resonance imaging. An alternative approach for validation of signatures for approved drugs is to compare outcomes in patients assigned compounds according to <italic>in vitro</italic> predictors with outcomes in patients assigned drugs according to physicians&#x02019; first treatment choice. This study constitutes the basis for such a trial, with the development of a portfolio of <italic>in vitro</italic> predictors (for example, the 22 compounds displayed in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) and a computational tool that physicians might use to select compounds from that portfolio for individual patients.</p><p>Regardless of the specific design of the clinical trial, gene expression, methylation and copy number levels should be collected for all patients. High throughput sequencing techniques can provide all three with the additional benefits of alternative splicing information. As outlined in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, measurements of expression, methylation and copy number would serve as input to the predictor toolbox. The output of the toolbox consists of a report for each individualized patient, with the 22 therapeutic compounds ranked according to a patient&#x02019;s likelihood of response and <italic>in vitro</italic> GI<sub>50</sub> dynamic range. The full panel of 22 drug compounds could be tested simultaneously in a multi-arm trial to speed up the validation of the <italic>in vitro</italic> approach.
