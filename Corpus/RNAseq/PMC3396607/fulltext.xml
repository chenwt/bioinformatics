An intact immune system is critical for protection against SCC since organ transplant recipients (OTR) have a 60- to 100-fold higher risk for developing these tumors. The role of the innate immune system in tumor immunosurveillance is unclear. Our aim was to determine the expression of selected innate immune genes in BCC and SCC arising in immunocompetent and OTR patients. Lesional and peri-lesional skin from 28 SCC and 19 BCC were evaluated for mRNA expression of toll-like receptors (TLR) 1&#x02013;9, downstream TLR signaling molecules, and antimicrobial peptides. 11 SCC occurring in OTR patients were included in the analysis. We found that SCC but not BCC showed significantly elevated expression of TLRs 1&#x02013;3, 5&#x02013;8, TRIF and TRAF1. TNF was increased in SCC compared to normal skin. BCC showed increased IFN&#x003b3;. hBD1, hBD2 and psoriasin mRNA and protein expression were significantly higher in SCC than in normal skin and higher than in BCC. SCC from OTR showed only an increase in hBD2 but no increase in hBD1 or psoriasin. We conclude that innate immune gene expression in SCC is distinct from normal skin and BCC. BCC shows lesser induction of innate immune genes. SCC from OTR patients have depressed expression of hBD1 and psoriasin compared to SCC from immunocompetent patients.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are the most frequent non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Lomas1">[1]</xref>.

However, there is evidence that innate immune mechanisms are also important in NMSC. Early studies by William Coley demonstrated spontaneous tumor regression after developing postsurgical infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Coley1">[9]</xref>, and experimental administration of <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> has also resulted in tumor regression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Starnes1">[10]</xref>. Today it is well known that infectious agents can be recognized by keratinocytes and other immune cells through various genes of the innate immune system such as toll-like receptors (TLRs).

The goal of this work was to further understand how our skin responds to the development of tumors and thus gain essential information that can help guide therapy. The candidate genes evaluated represented those such as TLRs that are involved in the innate immune recognition of danger, cytoplasmic molecules such as TRIF and TRAF that transmit information detected by these receptors, and molecules triggered by this process. These last groups of effector molecules are the AMPs and cytokines responsible for mediating the host response once danger is detected. Results show a dramatic difference in expression of many of these critical molecules in SCC, suggesting that this tumor type has enhanced many elements of innate immune response compared to normal skin. Since many of the effector molecules may play a role in the growth of the tumor or resistance to infection, and some are further altered in the immunocompromised host, these may partially explain the natural progression of NMSC.</p><p>Although full coverage of all molecules that participate in innate immunity would involve transcriptional profiling of several thousand gene products, and would be best approached by micro-array analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Pollack1">[27]</xref> or RNASeq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Wang1">[28]</xref>, the approach of real-time PCR analysis used here is the most quantitative and is commonly used for validation of high-throughput transcriptional profiling results. Sample selection from each patient involved the tumor itself, peritumoral tissue and normal skin. Since each tissue specimen represented a heterogenous collection of cell types, our evaluation is limited by the inability to attribute the mRNA measured to specific resident cells, the malignancy itself, or recruited cell types. However, the data obtained reflected expected expression patterns for the tumor. For example, cutaneous SCC typically retains characteristics of squamous differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Hudson1">[29]</xref>, and we found elevated filaggrin and keratin 10 gene expression in the SCC tissue of the tumor center. Expression was not only higher than in normal skin but also higher than in the tumor margin and in BCC. These results underline substantial differences in differentiation between SCC, BCC and normal skin, and served to validate the samples selected.</p><p>Activation of TLRs can result in a wide variety of responses that include apoptosis, inflammatory and non-inflammatory reactions (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Lai1">[11]</xref>). TLRs are known to be expressed on a variety of murine and human cancer cells (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Huang1">[30]</xref>). However, little information is available on TLR expression in SCC, and this has come mostly from cervical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Kelly1">[31]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Lee1">[32]</xref> or head and neck SCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Szczepanski1">[33]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Vahle1">[34]</xref>, but not from cutaneous SCC. Our study showed significantly elevated expression of TLR1,2,3,5,6,7 and 8 in cutaneous SCC. For several TLRs a 5- to 10-fold induction was seen in SCC. Notable responses unique to SCC included TLR5 (responsible for recognition of flagellin), TLR7 (the target of imiquimod), and TLR8, which along with TLR7, can recognize RNA. The TLR8 response was particularly interesting as it also included an induction in the peri-tumoral region. We also observed high TLR2 expression in SCC which could be a characteristic of SCC or a result of a defective skin barrier in SCC. In this way the increase is comparable to the TLR2 upregulation seen in skin wounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Schauber2">[35]</xref>. Equally remarkable was the relatively little change in innate immune gene expression seen in BCC. This may be a pertinent negative response given that some TLR induction would be expected from damaged skin. To define a potential functional role of TLR overexpression in cutaneous SCC, further functional studies are needed.</p><p>TRIF and TRAF are downstream signaling molecules of TLR activation and their expression correlated with increased TLR expression in SCC. Similarly, the cytokine response was highest in SCC and correlated with increased TLR expression and signaling. However, in BCC TNF was significantly elevated compared to normal skin despite a lesser TLR response. Increased IFN&#x003b3; was seen only in BCC. This underlines fundamental differences of innate immune receptor signaling and cytokine expression in BCC and SCC and likely reflects both the local expression of these molecules and expression in recruited inflammatory cells.</p><p>Because of the action of AMPs to alter cell growth and differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Frye1">[36]</xref>, their expression may be highly relevant in cancer. This association has been directly demonstrated for cathelicidin, where in mouse tumor models a lack of cathelicidin resulted in much more rapid tumor growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Buchau1">[21]</xref>. In the present study we found increased hBD1, hBD2, hBD3 and psoriasin in SCC compared to normal skin, but no increase in cathelicidin. Previously, enhanced hBD2 expression was also reported for oral SCC tumor cells and intratumoral vascular endothelia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Hudson1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Kawsar1">[37]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Sawaki1">[38]</xref>. Furthermore, previous studies reported increased hBD3 in <italic>in-situ</italic> and invasive oral SCC, correlating with specific macrophage recruitment to the lesion site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Yoshimoto1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Jin1">[39]</xref>. In contrast, the expression of AMPs in BCCs was much different than SCC. We found a significant decrease of hBD1 expression in the invading tumor margin of BCC but not in the tumor center. A decrease in hBD1 was previously reported in BCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Gambichler1">[40]</xref>. The functional significance of altered hBD expression in cancer is unclear at present. However, treatment of head and neck SCC (HNSCC) cell lines with hBD3 improved resistance against cis-platin, indicating that higher hBD expression may enhance tumor survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Mburu1">[41]</xref>.</p><p>Psoriasin (S100A7) represents a much different type of molecule than the hBDs or cathelicidin and warrents separate discussion. Psoriasin is a much larger protein, is found in much greater abundance in skin, and has different antimicrobial activity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Glaser2">[25]</xref>). It also does not appear to be expressed by bone marrow derived cells as is the case with many antimicrobial peptides. Rather, psoriasin is expressed primarily in a variety of epithelia. The functions of psoriasin in immunity are thus less clear although it has been associated with resistance to skin surface colonization by <italic>E. coli</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Glaser1">[24]</xref>. A previous study described elevated psoriasin mRNA expression in <italic>in-situ</italic> and invasive SCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Moubayed1">[42]</xref>, and thus agreed with our results. Psoriasin overexpression has also been reported for other tumors such as breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Wolf1">[43]</xref>, where persistent expression in invasive tumor areas was associated with poorer prognosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-AlHaddad1">[44]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Leygue1">[46]</xref>. Upregulation of psoriasin at transcriptional and protein level was recently also reported for early oral SCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Kesting1">[19]</xref>. Psoriasin can bind &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;6-integrin to promote invasive behavior in oral SCC cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Morgan1">[47]</xref>. Therefore, as was discussed for TLRs and their signaling intermediates, the current findings validate the need for further study of the functional relevance of these antimicrobial peptides and proteins.</p><p>Immunocompromised patients such as organ transplant recipients (OTRs) have a 60- to 100-fold increased risk for SCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Berg1">[4]</xref>, however the exact mechanisms for how immunosuppressive drugs increase the risk for more frequent and more aggressive SCCs are still largely unknown. Long-term immunosuppressive drug treatment in OTR was recently shown to alter the composition of the SCC peritumoral inflammatory infiltrate. Reduced proportions of CD3&#x0002b;, CD8&#x0002b;, and CD14&#x0002b; (monocytes), FOXP3&#x0002b; (regulatory T cells) and 123&#x0002b; (plasmacytoid dendritic cells) cells but more CD138&#x0002b; plasma cells in SCC of OTR compared to immunocompetent patients have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Krynitz1">[48]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Muhleisen1">[49]</xref>. Most OTRs are treated with several immunosuppressive drugs simultaneously, making it difficult to elucidate the exact mechanisms how an immunosuppressant contributes to the increased SCC risk.</p><p>To investigate if drug-induced immunosuppression altered innate immune gene expression, we included 11 SCC from OTRs for comparison with SCC from immunocompetent patients. All patients in our study were on a treatment regimen with corticosteroids and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin for at least a year before tumor diagnosis and excision. In epidemiological studies, switching from an immunosuppressive therapy with calcineurin inhibitors to the mTOR-inhibitor sirolimus was effective to reduce skin carcinogenesis in renal transplant patients by 50&#x00025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Mathew1">[50]</xref>. In our study, comparison of expression of all innate immune genes revealed that in contrast to immunocompetent patients, SCC in OTR had lower hBD1 and psoriasin expression, but the abundance of expression of other genes measured was similar to SCC from immunocompetent patients. It would be of interest to determine if the lower expression of hBD1 and psoriasin might be functionally relevant and related to the worse outcome in these patients.</p><p>In summary, this study clearly shows that the expression of several genes involved in the innate immune response is different in SCC than normal tissues. There are many possible reasons why skin tumors showed elevated expression of these innate immune genes. Tumor infiltrating immune cells such as CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and FOXP3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells and macrophages secrete soluble effector molecules such as interferons, IL-6 and TNF, and some of these can directly influence innate immune gene expression in keratinocytes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Lai2">[12]</xref>). The higher degree of differentiation in SCC compared to BCC or normal basal keratinocytes might be another reason for overexpression of some innate immune genes, since highly differentiated keratinocytes showed enhanced expression of human &#x003b2;-defensins 2 and 3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Liu1">[51]</xref>. A third driver of innate immune gene expression in SCC could be a defective skin barrier in these tumors. Skin SCCs often rupture and form wounds. Previous studies in non-malignant, sterile wounding experiments showed a strong induction of TLR2 and antimicrobial peptides in the wound edge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Schauber2">[35]</xref>. Furthermore, uncontrolled growth of tumor cells and tissue necrosis lead to release of molecules such as cellular DNA, heat shock proteins and fibrinogen, all of which are danger signals that can activate TLRs and their downstream signaling and effector molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Asea1">[52]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040754-Kuhns1">[53]</xref>. However, even though these mechanisms might be responsible for part of the profile of innate immune gene expression which we found in our study, they provide only an incomplete explanation. Moreover, we believe that expression of some of these innate immune genes is tumor-intrinsic and independent from the tumor environment. Further studies are needed to better understand the exact mechanisms that lead to this distinct innate immune gene expression.</p><p>The approach of sampling tissue from the tumor margin and periphery distinguished expression of some genes of interest and provides an example of how basic research might be integrated in well established standardized clinical surgical procedures such as Mohs surgery. Furthermore, it would be a mistake to overlook the remarkably low response seen in BCC for some gene products. The expression (or lack of expression) of unique elements of the innate immune system provides clues to development of the next generation of targeted immune therapy for NMSC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Patients</title><p>The study was designed to include 10 &#x02013; 20 specimens each from SCC in immunocompetent patients, from SCC in organ transplant recipients and from basal cell carcinomas.
