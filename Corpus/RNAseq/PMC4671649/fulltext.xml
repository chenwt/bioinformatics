It comprises anterior and posterior compartments, each surrounded by glands that secrete proteins into the lumen. Erythrocytes are ruptured as they pass through the compartments and leucocytes are tethered and killed but blood fails to clot. We wanted to identify the proteins secreted from these glands by sequencing the transcriptomes of head and tail preparations to pinpoint those messenger RNAs predominantly or exclusively present only in the heads. We found approximately 50 such proteins, the largest group of 27 being encoded by microexon genes. A second group comprised hydrolytic enzymes that operate at an acid pH. We showed by hybridisation experiments that expression of these genes is indeed localised to either the anterior or the posterior gland. We have suggested that this complex mixture of secreted proteins act together to perform the biological processes that occur in the lumen or, in the case of O-glycosylated membrane proteins, form a protective lining coat. We now want to discover which of them can serve as immune targets in infected animal hosts.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>WCB is supported by a CAPES Special Visiting Reseacher Program Grant 170/2012 that enables RAW to work in his laboratory.

Indeed, their attested longevity in the hepatic portal system (<italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>japonicum</italic>) or the venous plexuses around the bladder (<italic>S</italic>. <italic>haematobium</italic>) illustrates the sophisticated yet poorly understood mechanisms they must deploy to evade the host immune response in such a hostile environment [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The schistosome alimentary tract comprises an oral sucker around the mouth, a short esophagus and an extended gut caecum that runs to the extreme posterior [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The caecum comprises a syncytial gastrodermis that is both secretory and absorptive, and an associated network of muscle fibres responsible for peristalsis. It occupies a larger proportion of body cross section in females (16%) than males (6%) [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], reflecting the disparate balance between nutrient uptake across the body surface and gut in the two sexes [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The proteolytic enzymes responsible for breakdown of ingested proteins in the acidic environment of the gut lumen have been well researched [reviewed in 2]. In addition, a proteomic analysis of the vomitus released by worms in short term culture [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] has revealed the presence of other hydrolases, as well as &#x02018;transport&#x02019; proteins capable of binding lipids (e.g. saposins) and inorganic ions (ferritin, calumenin). In vitro feeding experiments with labelled dextran have demonstrated the occurrence of endocytosis at the gastrodermal surface [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], while laser capture microdissection has been used to identify genes encoding transporters putatively expressed on the luminal surface of the gastrodermis [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In contrast, the role of the esophagus has been under-appreciated and little researched since the first ultrastructural descriptions several decades ago [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, we have recently shown that, instead of being just a conduit, it actually initiates the processing of ingested blood before it reaches the gut lumen [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The esophagus is divided into anterior and posterior compartments, each surrounded by an associated mass of cell bodies and lined by a syncytial layer of cytoplasm continuous with the surface tegument. The posterior mass was designated as a gland decades ago and we have recently shown in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>japonicum</italic> that the anterior cell mass is also a distinct secretory organ [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Both cell masses synthesise proteins for secretion into the lumen. Video recording of feeding [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and in-vitro experiments with membrane-labelled erythrocytes [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] have revealed their lysis in the lumen; the label transfers primarily to the membranes of the posterior compartment. The two observations explain why intact erythrocytes are seldom seen in the lumen [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In contrast host leucocytes accumulate within the posterior lumen as a central plug around which incoming blood flows [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Furthermore, these tethered leucocytes are structurally damaged, as are those which reach the gut lumen. Despite intact platelets being observed in the anterior compartment [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], ingested blood does not clot in the lumen, implying the existence of anticoagulant mechanisms. Collectively, these observations confirm the esophagus as a crucial site for interaction of host blood with parasite products. Specific expression of three microexon genes (MEGs [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]), namely MEG-4.1 [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], MEG-4.2 and MEG-14 [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and one venom-allergen-like (VAL; [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]) gene, VAL-7 [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] was revealed in the posterior esophageal gland of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> by whole mount in-situ hybridisation (WISH). In addition, seven proteins (six MEGs and VAL-7) have been localised to the posterior esophageal gland of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>japonicum</italic> by immunocytochemistry [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, the demonstration of host IgG binding to the esophageal lumen of both mouse and hamster worms in vivo [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] raised the possibility that esophageal proteins might be targets of the host response. Most recently we have obtained evidence that rhesus macaques self-cure from an established <italic>S</italic>. <italic>japonicum</italic> infection by producing antibodies that target esophageal secreted proteins [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The functions of the esophagus are disrupted, leading to cessation of feeding, starvation and ultimately death of established worms [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Clearly, if we are to understand esophageal function better we need more information about the proteins secreted into the esophagus lumen that interact with incoming blood. We have also suggested such proteins represent an entirely new group of targets that might be exploited for vaccine development, due to their critical role in blood feeding and their accessibility to antibodies [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The advent of new and cheaper technologies has made comparative transcriptome analysis by direct sequencing feasible. We have used the massive parallel capacity of ion semiconductor sequencing on an Ion Torrent instrument to investigate differential gene expression in the esophageal region of adult male <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic>. Schistosomes possess epithelia (tegument, gastrodermis) and rudimentary organ systems (muscles, nerves and sense organs, alimentary tract, protonephridial system, parenchyma) present throughout the whole body but the solid acoelomate body plan means they are not readily isolated for analysis. However, the cell masses surrounding the anterior and posterior esophageal compartments, plus the paired cerebral ganglia of the nervous system are unique to the esophageal region. We therefore reasoned that a subtractive comparison of the patterns of gene expression in heads and tails would delineate this unique &#x02018;head&#x02019; subset. We present here the results of that comparison, which highlighted a group of differentially expressed genes, many encoding secretory proteins, and we have validated the expression of representatives to the cell bodies of the anterior or posterior esophageal glands. These data lay the foundations for a deeper understanding of blood processing in the worm esophagus and provide a panel of proteins that can be screened for immunoreactivity against sera from permissive and self-curing hosts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The procedures involving animals were carried out in accordance with the Brazilian legislation (11790/2008).

Approximately 400 male worms were individually viewed at x30 magnification under a dissecting microscope, carefully held with fine watchmakers forceps (Ideal Tek, Chiasso, Switzerland) and the head region detached along the line of the transverse gut using Vannas scissors (John Weiss, Milton Keynes, UK).

Trimmed reads were mapped to version 5.0 of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> genome using Tophat version 2.0.10 with the microexon search option enabled and using the GTF genome annotation file to guide the mapping. Expression values, in reads per kilobase transcript per million mapped reads (RPKM; [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]), were calculated using Cufflinks version 2.1.1 [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and the GTF annotation file for version 5.0 of the genome comprising protein-coding genes. RPKM values normalise the number of mapped reads relative to the length of each transcript so it is possible for a short coding sequence (CDS) with tens of mapped reads to have a higher relative abundance than a longer CDS with hundreds or thousands of mapped reads. Differential expression between the head and tail samples was calculated using Cuffdiff version 2.1.1. Cuffdiff identifies significantly differentially expressed genes and transcripts by modelling the variance in the number of reads for each gene and uses false discovery rate to correct p-values and account for multiple tests. The result is a set of log base 2 fold change values (mean RPKM, head / tail) where positive values indicate higher expression in heads than tails and negative values indicating higher expression in tails than heads. To avoid division by zero errors, 1 was added to all RPKM values before calculating log base 2 fold change values. Scatter plots of abundance (RPKM) on the y axis versus difference on the x axis were used to visualise differential expression.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Identifying novel unmapped genes</title><p>To identify potentially novel transcripts, quality-trimmed reads, as described in the previous section, were assembled <italic>de novo</italic> using Trinity (version r20140413p1) [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

We tested this proposition by comparing the relative expression of genes encoding signature proteins (<xref rid="pntd.0004272.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1D Fig</xref>; <xref rid="pntd.0004272.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). Individual paired RPKM values from the two technical replicates, displayed as a scatter plot, revealed the similarity in gene expression level for heads and tails, with a correlation coefficient of 0.951. The diffuse schistosome nervous system (NS) ramifies through all tissues of the worm body but nerve cells are sparse and the level of expression of NS genes was the lowest for any signature tissue. The mean RPKM score of NS abundance in heads (= 69) thus provides a benchmark for comparison of the levels of transcript abundance of other tissue signatures in the heads. The tegument and gastrodermis are the two principal interfaces with the external environment, where considerable biosynthesis of proteins for export takes place. The mean expression level of genes encoding tegument surface proteins ranged from 7.3 to 10.5 times the NS, apart from those encoding the transporter-linked ATPases at 1.3 times the NS (<xref rid="pntd.0004272.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). The mean relative transcript abundance for proteins secreted by the gastrodermis ranged from 10 to 17 times the NS, indicating a slightly higher level of biosynthetic activity than the tegument cell bodies; genes encoding the extended group of ten saposins, likely involved in lipid binding and transport, were the most active. Muscle and parenchyma are the most abundant tissues in the male schistosome body, with cytoskeletal proteins showing a mean expression level (13.5x NS) similar to the gastrodermis, while the genes encoding cytosolic proteins (e.g. glycolytic enzymes, chaperones) were the most highly expressed of all signature proteins (mean 74x NS). Surprisingly, the genes responsible for glycogen metabolism, indicative of parenchyma, were expressed at only 1.8 times the NS level. The glycosyl transferases, involved in the N or O-linked glycosylation of proteins destined for export, were expressed overall in the same range as the NS genes.</p><fig id="pntd.0004272.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0004272.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Summary of signature protein expression.</title><p>Data from <xref rid="pntd.0004272.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref> plotted to illustrate mean values for signature categories.

Despite the cerebral nerve ganglia being present in the head preparation, there was only a slight bias (x1.1) towards the heads among the 80 genes scrutinised. The other signature groups showed a bias towards greater expression in the tails with ratios ranging from 0.7 to 0.93, apart from the glycosyl transferases. Expression of these was skewed (x1.36) towards the head preparation and suggestive of specialised glycan production in the region. Finally, scatter plots of the signature groups confirmed that the vast majority of the ~250 signature genes lay within a very narrow range either side of the equivalence line (<xref rid="pntd.0004272.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). This allowed us to set a generous margin of fourfold difference either side of the line to define differential expression, and thereby to pinpoint any outliers.

We then interrogated the Trinity data to identify novel differentially expressed protein coding genes not annotated in the genome. We first confirmed that there was no major discrepancy between the results of Tophat/Cufflinks mapping and Trinity de novo contigs by plotting the abundance and differential expression of 12 known MEGs identified by both methods. The correlation coefficient r for comparisons of their RPKM values was 0.88 and for the ratio of heads/tails was 0.93, confirming a strong positive association between the two methods. The Trinity contigs were annotated by BLAST against v5 of predicted genes in the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> genome to obtain identities of known genes.

In this group, the mean RPKM value for abundance (418; 6x the NS), was much lower than for the 92 differentially expressed genes detected by Cufflinks (= 3963). However, this might be anticipated, given that these unannotated contigs encode potential genes not detected by conventional methods. The mean expression ratio of heads to tails (x62) is still very biased towards the heads and 63% were expressed in the heads alone. Sixteen of the novel genes were identified as encoding unannotated MEGs (<xref rid="pntd.0004272.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004272.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>).

One final MEG (MEG-10.1) appears to be an outlier, expressed in tails only and possibly confined to a very scarce tissue.</p><p>Analysis of gene structure of the novel MEGs described here (<xref rid="pntd.0004272.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>) reveals that all of them display the typical characteristics: two long 3' and 5' flanking exons and a central coding portion mostly composed of microexons (&#x0003c;36bp). The portion coding for a signal peptide is mostly or entirely contained in the 5' long exon. Twenty-six of the thirty-three microexons (79%) that encode MEGs 26&#x02013;32 are symmetrical (i.e. have a length divisible by 3), which indicates an evolutionary pressure to favour alternate splicing without disruption of the open reading frame. As with most MEGs, those enriched in the head preparation tend to encode relatively small proteins (average MW ~10 kDa; median MW ~7kDa). Analysis of all the MEG structures using the IUPred program reveals that 13 out of 27 predicted protein products enriched in the head preparation display more than 40% of their length as intrinsically disordered (<xref rid="pntd.0004272.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>; <xref rid="pntd.0004272.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B Table</xref>). These disordered regions are rich in threonine, serine and proline (TSP) residues (<xref rid="pntd.0004272.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5C Table</xref>). Unsurprisingly, nine of these thirteen proteins (MEGs 4.1, 8.1, 8.2, 14, 15, 19, 20, 29 and 32.1) are predicted to be heavily O-glycosylated, with an average of 16.4 sites, 100% of them being located in the putative disordered regions (<xref rid="pntd.0004272.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). A further five MEGs (8.3, 10.2, 22, 32.1, 32.2) are predicted to be O-glycosylated proteins but without extensive regions of disorder (<xref rid="pntd.0004272.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B Table</xref>). In the MEG-8 family members there is a hydrophobic C terminus encoded by the long 5&#x02019; flanking exon (<xref rid="pntd.0004272.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). Clustal comparisons reveal that it contains conserved protein domains with characteristic signatures for each family member across the three schistosome species for which sequence data is available (<xref rid="pntd.0004272.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). This cross-species conservation reveals that the MEG-8 diversity is ancient, arising before speciation of the Genus <italic>Schistosoma</italic> occurred. In addition, MEG-15 also displays a relatively hydrophobic C-terminus. Another group of MEGs (9, 12, 26, 27 and 28) preferentially expressed in the head, encode a small peptide that is predicted by Heliquest to contain an amphipathic helix with a hydrophobic interaction face (<xref rid="pntd.0004272.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>).

Homology searching of NCBI nr indicates that these are likely to be of lysosomal origin. The group of six proteases annotated as subfamily A1A unassigned peptidases (A01 family) located on Chromosome 3, were exclusive to the head preparation, and ranged in transcript abundance from 0.4 to 28 times the NS level. BLAST and Clustal searching revealed they encoded closely related aspartyl proteases, referred to as Cathepsin D homologues. Transcripts for two other hydrolases, annotated as Phospholipase A2, were abundant (3.6x and 9x NS, respectively) and almost exclusively expressed in the heads. The final hydrolase (20x NS), palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 enzyme, removes thioester-linked fatty acyl groups from modified cysteine residues in proteins or peptides. The N terminal sequence of aspartyl protease, Smp_018800, was extended by Clustal mapping (<xref rid="pntd.0004272.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6A Table</xref>) and the updated gene annotation deposited at EMBL under accession number LN898196. The presence of a signal peptide on this and four other group members (Smps 132470, 132480, 136830 and 205390) was confirmed by SignalP. (The sixth protease, Smp_136720, is an incomplete gene model lacking the 5&#x02019; end.) The five proteases also contained one to three copies of the consensus N-X-S/T sequence, indicating suitable sites for N-linked glycosylation. Palmitoyl thioesterase possessed a signal peptide plus N glycosylation sites and we were able to improve the gene models for the two Phospholipases using Trinity assemblies (<xref rid="pntd.0004272.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6B &#x00026; S6C Table</xref>), to reveal the presence of signal peptides and N glycosylation sites in both. These new gene annotations were deposited at EMBL under accession number LN898197 and LN898198.

Only one further gene for VAL-13, came above the &#x0003e;4-fold difference threshold with a score 2.1x the NS level, compared with a mean of 223x for VAL-7. Five other VALs (16, 8, 12, 11 and 6) were more evenly distributed between heads and tails (5B) and it is notable that three of them (6, 11, 16) belong to Group 2, lacking a signal peptide.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Other differentially expressed head genes encode a heterogeneous assemblage of proteins</title><p>The remaining 37 annotated genes mapped by Tophat/Cufflinks fell into two broad groups, 14 that showed a moderate level of differential expression and abundance, and a more compact group of 23 with a low differential; they were classified by putative function (<xref rid="pntd.0004272.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3E Table</xref>). A cytosolic calmodulin-like calcium binding protein (Smp_096390) was the most abundant transcript. A group potentially most relevant to esophageal secretion, and probably located along the secretory pathway, included genes encoding transmembrane emp24 domain containing protein 7 (Smp_140180) involved in vesicular protein trafficking, transmembrane protein 63A (Smp_143750) inserted in the membrane of lysosomes, GPI ethanolamine phosphate transferase 2 (Smp_155490) involved in GPI-anchor formation and Longevity-assurance gene 1 (LAG 1; Smp_122050) that facilitates transfer of GPI-anchored proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Finally, three putative nervous system transcripts at characteristic low abundance, and not in the list of signature NS genes were of note. Neuropeptide F prepropeptide (Smp_088360), tryptophan hydroxylase (Smp_174920) and Catechol-o-methyltransferase (Smp_198020) could represent markers for the cerebral ganglia, although the most skewed is only 16x the level in tails.</p><p>The members of the largest grouping (one third) within the differentially expressed subset were annotated as hypothetical proteins, lacking homology to anything outside the Trematoda. Searching of the longest open reading frame for individual genes, in part hampered by incomplete gene models, yielded few that encoded signal sequences or transmembrane domains, a point dealt with in the Discussion. However, utilising a combination of Trinity assembly data and searching of publicly available EST databases, we were able to extend the models for two genes with abundant and differential expression in the heads, Smp_123100 and Smp_123200, situated on chromosome 6. Moreover, mapping of the exons to the chromosome revealed that both had a central region encoded by microexons; due to their homology we designated them MEG-32.1 and MEG-32.2, respectively (<xref rid="pntd.0004272.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Improved gene annotations for these two MEGs were deposited on EMBL and received accession numbers LN898194 and LN898195. The two proteins are predicted to be membrane-anchored at both N and C termini to form a threonine-rich hairpin loop that is O-glycosylated. This makes a total of 12 previously annotated, 13 novel, and two reassigned MEG genes identified in the head preparation in the present study.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>A smaller subset of genes is differentially expressed in the tails</title><p>Although not the focus of our study, we also analysed the markedly different set of 72 genes expressed more than fourfold higher in the tails than heads (<xref rid="pntd.0004272.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3F Table</xref>). The largest group of 19 were annotated as encoding hypothetical proteins, primarily with homologs only among other Trematoda. Two of these (Smp_177580, Smp_201270) were the most abundant differential transcripts in the tails (771x and 362x the NS level). The second largest group encoded proteins of the extracellular matrix, and adhesion molecules such as protocadherin involved in cell attachment. A collagen (Smp_135560) and a dynein light chain were both abundant (26x and 19x the NS level) and among the most differentially expressed (8.5x and 52x the level in heads, respectively). Seven genes putatively associated with the gastrodermis, including two cathepsins and a saposin, could indicate some regional specialisation of the gut. The group of genes encoding four female-specific proteins in the posterior half of the male worm seems incongruous since they are involved in egg shell formation and predicted to be expressed in vitelline follicles but such follicles with their associated mRNA have been detected in male worms [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; the most abundant transcript was present at 14x the NS level. The remaining annotated genes all with low levels of expression, encoded proteins involved in signalling pathways (6), nuclear function (4) and miscellaneous processes (12).

These are the first identified genes expressed in this region. Expression of the remainder, together with the VAL-7 positive control, was confined to the posterior esophageal gland cell bodies.

Expression of the five MEGs plus aspartyl protease was also detected in the posterior esophageal gland of female worms, whereas only MEG-12 expression was detected in the female anterior esophageal gland. The time for colour development after addition of substrate, and to a lesser extent the intensity of the signal corroborate the estimate of mRNA abundance represented by the RPKM score (<xref rid="pntd.0004272.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>).

The slow developers have log2 RPKMs between 10.4 and 12.7, the medium developers between 8 and 10. The confounding factor is that the length of probe, containing dig-labelled bases to which the detection antibody attaches, was twice as long in the medium as the slow developers.

The difficulties in characterising patterns of gene expression that occur in the discrete organ systems of an acoelomate metazoan with a solid body plan should not be underestimated. Laser capture microdissection [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] has been applied but the amount of tissue obtained and the precision needed to excise the organ of choice without contamination, are major limitations. Moreover, the studies to date have used microarray analysis to detect differences in gene expression between tissues, a technique which has inherent limitations. The fixed design of the array, especially if coverage is partial [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], leaves gaps in the repertoire and furthermore does not permit new genes to be identified. The dynamic range of detection is also limited (typically a maximum of 200-fold), due to high background levels, cross hybridisation and saturation of signals [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Rapid advances in technology have quickly led to the adoption of RNA-Seq as the method of choice to characterise transcriptomes from many sources [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The existence of a well-annotated gene assembly for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] is a singular advantage and RNA-Seq can also identify novel coding sequences. The technology has a very low (if any) background, no upper limit for quantification and a dynamic range of 4&#x02013;5 orders of magnitude [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Our RPKM scores of expression ranging from ~2 x 10<sup>0</sup> to 7.2 x 10<sup>4</sup> for heads and ~2 x 10<sup>0</sup> to 5.3 x 10<sup>4</sup> for tails were of that order. It has been estimated, using stringent criteria, that four million mapped reads of ~35 bases provided 80% coverage of gene expression in yeast [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We achieved 1.65 and 1.9 million mapped reads of mean length 117 bases, for heads and tails respectively, which detected 8856 genes or 82% of the predicted total. As we were not seeking an overview of the complete transcriptome, we deliberately excluded from analysis genes with fewer than five detected transcripts in both samples. This still left ~ 5000 genes, representing 42% coverage, to be evaluated. In comparison, the first qualitative, genome-wide analysis of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] was performed on ~125,000 sequences generated largely from mini-libraries by the ORESTES protocol [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Our subtractive RNA-Seq approach would be equally applicable to characterise differential gene expression in other adult worm tissues such as the testis, ovary, uterus and ootype.</p><p>The core of our strategy was the isolation by microdissection of the entire esophageal region and matching tails from adult male bodies stabilised with RNALater. We then generated the transcript datasets and used the subtractive approach, based on the dual criteria of abundance and differential expression, to delineate the set of genes exclusively or predominantly expressed in the head preparation. Surprisingly, nervous system genes were not prominent in the heads despite the presence of the cerebral ganglia and we must attribute this to the diffuse nature of the schistosome nervous system throughout the whole body. This left us with the proposition that the ~90 differentially expressed genes mapped by Tophat/Cufflinks, plus the novel genes detected by the Trinity assembly, were expressed in the cell bodies of the two esophageal glands. (Note that there is no protein synthetic machinery in the syncytial lining of the esophagus.) That many of the highlighted gene models are partial and that we found new genes in the most intensively studied schistosome species can be explained by two factors. First, the esophageal glands comprise only a tiny fraction of the worm body so their transcripts will be severely under-represented in the whole worm homogenates used hitherto as a source of mRNA, depriving programmes like Evidence Modeller [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] of the resource they need for gene annotation. The second is that de novo gene finding programmes look for patterns of bases not occurring by chance, thus excluding short runs that comprise the microexons of MEGs.</p><p>We compared transcript distribution between heads and tails for signature genes, primarily identified by our previous proteomic studies, to determine whether the major schistosome tissues were equally represented; our data amply confirm this supposition. No outliers were detected in the lists of signature proteins from the cytoskeleton, and cytosol, underlining the ubiquity of muscle and parenchyma in both head and tail preparations. Similarly, no known tegument markers or genes encoding constituent of worm vomitus originating in the gastrodermis were differentially distributed. However, two annexins and two tetraspanins were highly biased. BLAST searching with the most abundant annexin, Smp_155580, indicates that the N-terminus of this protein is missing so no conclusion is possible about whether it is a candidate for release into the esophageal lumen. Similarly, a putative saposin, Smp_028840, was highlighted as possible candidate for esophageal secretion. Unfortunately, evidence for a saposin domain is weak (Prosite &#x00026; NCBI CDD searches) and the sequence lacks a signal peptide; this gene was also detected as differentially expressed by a laser capture study [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The distribution of glycosyl transferase expression was investigated because bioinformatic analysis of MEGs 4.1 and 14 indicated that they were O-glycosylated [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and the presence of O-glycans in the posterior esophageal gland had been demonstrated by lectin staining [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The three differentially expressed transferases, one of them validated by WISH in the posterior gland, raise the possibility that some proteins exported from the esophageal glands are decorated with novel glycan structures not found in other worm tissues, an observation that could have immunological consequences. The importance of the secretory pathway in the esophageal cell masses is also underlined by the enrichment of transcripts from five genes involved in the intracellular vesicle transport pathway.</p><p>A major finding of this study was the marked expression of MEGs in the head preparation, both in term of transcript abundance and differential. A total of 27 transcripts from 22 out of 32 MEG families (two-thirds) was detected in the schistosome head region, making it the most intense site for the expression of this enigmatic group of genes so far discovered. Furthermore, combining the results of this and our previous studies [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] using WISH and immunocytochemistry we can now be confident that three MEGs (12, 16 and 17) are expressed in the anterior gland and nine (4.1, 4.2, 8.1, 8.2, 9, 11, 14, 15 and 22) in the posterior gland. The second and complementary observation was the marked differential expression of nine genes encoding lysosomal hydrolases in the head region, with phospholipase A validated by WISH to the anterior gland, and aspartyl protease and palmitoyl thioesterase to the posterior gland. The mean RPKM scores for the four genes we have shown are expressed in the anterior esophagus and the 12 in the posterior esophagus [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] are 6053 and 24767 respectively. The posterior gland is approximately 2.5 times the volume of the anterior [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] suggesting a roughly equal transcriptional activity on a tissue mass basis. However, the RPKM scores are 10 to 20 times the mean values for tegument cell bodies and gastrodermal epithelium (598 and 1192, respectively). We conclude that the glands are indeed a hotspot for gene transcription in the male worm body, potentially of secretory proteins destined for export into the esophagus.</p><p>Our recent research has provided ultrastructural evidence for the secretion of vesicle contents from both anterior and posterior glands, into the esophageal lumen [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We also noted that the morphology of the &#x02018;light vesicles&#x02019; in the anterior gland was akin to that of primary lysosomes, raising the possibility that lysosomal enzymes were secreted into the esophagus lumen [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Such lysosomal secretion is a well-established feature of the gastrodermis [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Our immunocytochemical observations provide direct evidence for the secretion of five MEG-encoded proteins and VAL-7 into the esophagus lumen [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Moreover, we have now identified two MEG proteins (8.2 and 15) and two lysosomal hydrolases (aspartyl protease Smp_136830 &#x00026; palmitoyl thioesterase) in worm vomitus preparations (WCB &#x00026; LXN, personal communication). In terms of RPKM score, these identities are #s 2 &#x00026; 3 on the MEG list and #s1 and 2 on the hydrolase list, illustrating the relative sensitivity of RNA-Seq versus proteomic detection. The above observations make a strong case that the protein products of the differentially expressed microexon and hydrolase genes identified in this study, are secreted into the esophagus lumen to interact with ingested blood. This poses the question as to their role in the esophageal processes that we have delineated [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These include erythrocyte lysis, leucocyte tethering and killing, disposal of platelets and prevention of clot formation. It should not be forgotten that there are other unannotated genes among the ~140 differentially expressed transcripts that may have a role in these processes.</p><p>Predicting functions and devising assays for proteins with little or no homology to anything outside the Genus <italic>Schistosoma</italic> is a daunting task. However, we can make some inferences from predicted primary and secondary structures. Several of the MEG-4, -8 and -15 families (eight of the esophageal MEGs) possess a central TSP-rich, intrinsically disordered region predicted to be heavily O-glycosylated. We have already demonstrated that the glycosylation of SmMEG-4.1 causes a gel shift of more than 70 kDa above the MW predicted for the protein alone [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We previously showed that the MEG-4 family proteins possessed a conserved C-terminus between schistosome species [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We have now shown that the MEG-8 family members all display a hydrophobic region at their C terminus, each again possessing a motif highly conserved between species. In MEG-4 we suggested that this region might target host leucocytes, e.g. by binding via its C terminus to a pan-leucocyte marker such as CD45 [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The same is true for the MEG-8 motifs and equally, plasma proteins or leucocyte secretions could be the intended ligands. An alternative possibility is that these O-glycosylated proteins might use the C-terminal motifs to organize themselves in a similar way to secreted mucins. There, unstructured, heavily glycosylated chains (the TSP regions) are connected by the interaction of hydrophobic domains, creating a net that confers to the mucus a gel-like consistency with viscoelastic proprieties [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The immuno-localisation of both SjMEG-4.1 [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and SjMEG-8.2 [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] in a cocoon-like association with tethered leukocytes in the lumen of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>japonicum</italic> esophagus provides visual evidence for a mucus-like complex that traps incoming leukocytes. TEM observations have revealed that the parallel arrays of material (0.08 x 0.1&#x003bc;m) contained in the crystalloid vesicles of the posterior esophageal gland are released intact to the esophageal lumen, [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and may cluster into larger aggregates, indicating the self-affinity/assembly of some molecular constituents. The largest aggregate measured to date (1.0&#x003bc;m x 0.6 &#x003bc;m) in an electron micrograph represents a ~50-fold accretion. Moreover, the 40% greater repeating unit in the aggregates, compared to the vesicles [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], indicates an expansion of the electron lucent layers after release, consistent with the swelling of O-glycans. It is thus plausible that the parasite adopts a &#x0201c;capture and defuse&#x0201d; strategy in the esophagus lumen whereby leukocytes are quickly immobilised and isolated by a mucus network, so preventing the diffusion of antibodies and defence proteins away from them.</p><p>In contrast, those MEGs anchored by a transmembrane helix (e.g. 14, 29, 32.1, 32.2), and also predicted to be O-glycosylated, are similar to the cell-associated mucins in humans in lacking the hydrophobic C-terminal region that might facilitate aggregation [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The most likely role for these membrane-anchored MEGs is to provide a protective lining coat of O-glycans for the entire esophagus. This suggestion is corroborated by the detection of a thin layer of neutral muco-substance lining the esophagus of the related blood fluke <italic>Schistosomatium douthitti</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The third obvious category of esophageal MEGs comprises the small peptides (MEGs 9, 12, 26, 27 and 28) that exhibit amphipathic helicoidal regions, with a hydrophobic face. Such peptides are widespread in animals and have both anti-microbial and haemolytic properties (e.g. [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]). In the context of the schistosome esophagus they are capable of interacting with incoming erythrocytes and leucocytes to destabilize their membranes. Our recent observations on the localisation of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>japonicum</italic> MEG-9 confirm its association with the surface of leucocytes <italic>in situ</italic> in the esophagus lumen [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The lysosomal hydrolases we identified all have orthologues in mammals with well characterised properties that provide pointers to their potential function in blood processing. The putative secretion of two phospholipases, at least one of them from the anterior gland, strongly suggests a role in the lysis of erythrocytes as these cells pass through the two compartments. The transfer of the lipophilic dye PKH2 from labelled erythrocytes starts in the anterior compartment and is completed in the posterior [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. TEM and confocal microscope images of intact erythrocytes in the anterior compartment and only a few ghosts in the posterior [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] are consistent with these observations. The palmitoyl thioesterase may also participate in the process of erythrocyte lysis via its ability to cleave the lipid anchor from proteins on the cytoplasmic face of plasma membranes. One such palmitoylated protein, p55/MPP1 [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], found in the erythrocyte is an important component of the ternary complex that attaches the spectrin-based skeleton to the plasma membrane [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Thus we can envisage a cascade where short amphipathic MEG peptides such as MEG-9 or MEG-12 bind to and destabilise the erythrocyte membrane, enhancing the interaction of the two phospholipases with their plasma membrane substrates. Increased permeability then permits the palmitoyl thioesterase to enter and disrupt the cytoskeleton; the erythrocyte loses shape, leaks haemoglobin and is destroyed. Judging from our videos of worm feeding [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] the whole process takes only seconds.</p><p>The secretion of six aspartyl proteases, at least one from the posterior compartment, indicates a powerful attack is also made on proteins in the plasma or on the external surface of host blood cells. Note that these enzymes are distinct from the one already described for the worm gut (Smp_013040) [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The number of homologs suggests either redundancy of function, potentially as a means of immune evasion, or the existence of subtly different substrate specificities in the target proteins. The most obvious candidates are the components of the clotting cascade since clot formation does not occur in the worm esophagus. However, we have now detected fibrin localised in oval deposits in the anterior esophagus [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], some of it coincident with host antibody, which may contribute to block secretion. A role for the aspartyl proteases in preventing this would require one or more to be synthesised by the anterior gland cells. A second potential function for these proteases could be the destruction of defence proteins released from the leucocytes that are, as revealed by TEM [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], trapped and ultimately destroyed in the posterior lumen. One obvious corollary of the secretion of these lysosomal hydrolases is that they function at an acid pH optimum. The lumen of the schistosome gut has long been known to have a pH of ~4.5 [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and now it appears that the process of acidification may begin in the esophagus. Nothing is known about the mechanism in schistosomes but in lower animals acidification of both the lysosomal interior and transepithelial compartments is effected by V-ATPases [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The transcripts of the genes encoding the complex of ~8 proteins that comprise this pump were all detected in our dataset, but were not differentially expressed&#x02014;unsurprising given that both gut and esophagus may be acidified by the same process. If acidification of the esophagus lumen is confirmed, it would imply that the co-secreted MEG proteins also operate at an acidic pH.</p><p>MEG hotspots described in our previous work were the head gland of the migrating schistosomulum (MEG-3 family) and the subshell envelope of the mature egg (MEG-2 and MEG-3 family) [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. It has been suggested that the role of these egg- and larval-secreted MEG proteins is to interact with and modify vascular endothelial function [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In parenthesis, the only representative of the MEG-2 and 3 families found in the esophageal transcriptome was MEG-3.4, not identified in the egg or larval secretions. It is plausible that the group of five non-differentially expressed MEGs (1, 5, 6, 13, 24) comprise a tegument hotspot since one of their number, MEG-5, was previously detected in tegument fractions by proteomics [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The identification of a major hotspot of MEG expression in the worm esophagus, together with the expression of a group of lysosomal hydrolases, confirms the complexity of function that we have previously highlighted [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We have also observed binding of host IgG to the esophageal lumen, first in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> worms from permissive mice and hamsters [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and more recently in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>japonicum</italic> worms from rhesus macaques undergoing self-cure [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this last host the antibodies appear to target structures in both anterior and posterior compartments to alter morphology and disrupt function, potentially causing worm starvation and death [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Although we have suggested that the alternative splicing of MEGs generates a heterogeneous mixture of proteins that serve to confuse the immune system [<xref rid="pntd.0004272.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], it appears that such a ploy can be circumvented by a host like the rhesus macaque. Collectively, the esophageal secretions that we have identified provide a novel and untested panel of vaccine candidates. With many available targets, the task is to discover the worm&#x02019;s Achilles heel.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec027"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0004272.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Reproducibility of the Ion Torrent sequencing on replicate samples.</title><p>A, Frequency distribution of mean RPKM scores for heads and tails on a log 2 scale reveals an almost identical pattern of expression in the two tissues.
