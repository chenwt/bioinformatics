Hence signatures of both positive and balancing selection are expected in immune genes. Because both overall selective pressure and specific targets may differ between species, large-scale population genomic studies are useful in detecting functionally important immune genes and comparing selective landscapes between taxa. Such studies are of particular interest in amphibians, a group threatened worldwide by emerging infectious diseases. Here, we present an analysis of polymorphism and divergence of 634 immune genes in two lineages of <italic>Lissotriton</italic> newts: <italic>L. montandoni</italic> and <italic>L. vulgaris graecus</italic>. Variation in newt immune genes has been shaped predominantly by widespread purifying selection and strong evolutionary constraint, implying long-term importance of these genes for functioning of the immune system. The two evolutionary lineages differ in the overall strength of purifying selection which can partially be explained by demographic history but may also signal differences in long-term pathogen pressure. The prevalent constraint notwithstanding, 23 putative targets of positive selection and 11 putative targets of balancing selection were identified. The latter were detected by composite tests involving the demographic model and further validated in independent population samples. Putative targets of balancing selection encode proteins which may interact closely with pathogens but include also regulators of immune response. The identified candidates will be useful for testing whether genes affected by balancing selection are more prone to interspecific introgression than other genes in the genome.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>balancing selection</kwd><kwd>positive selection</kwd><kwd>immune genes</kwd><kwd>demographic model</kwd><kwd><italic>Lissotriton</italic></kwd><kwd>newts</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pressures exerted by diverse pathogens are the source of selection resulting in rapid evolutionary changes of host molecules, components of both innate and adaptive immunity (<xref rid="evw236-B15" ref-type="bibr">Boehm 2012</xref>; <xref rid="evw236-B72" ref-type="bibr">Quintana-Murci and Clark 2013</xref>). Evidence for adaptive evolution of immune genes is ample (<xref rid="evw236-B64" ref-type="bibr">Obbard et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evw236-B80" ref-type="bibr">Spurgin and Richardson 2010</xref>) and both experimental (<xref rid="evw236-B25" ref-type="bibr">Eizaguirre et al. 2009</xref>) and correlational (<xref rid="evw236-B31" ref-type="bibr">Fumagalli et al. 2011</xref>) studies point to pathogens as causal factors. However, establishing direct and robust links between genetic variation and immunity to pathogens is challenging and requires laborious experiments. Promising candidates for such in-depth studies may be identified by examining patterns of variation within and divergence between species in many genes. A clear advantage of such genomic scans is their ability to screen a large number of potential targets, even if their functions are incompletely understood. Two other advantages of genomic scans are equally important. First, because signatures generated by selection are persistent, targets of historical selection can also be identified providing insights over evolutionary timescales. Second, genomic scans allow meaningful comparison of selection targets and overall selective landscapes between species.</p><p>The mode of natural selection can be inferred from patterns of sequence variation and the inferred mode of selection correlates with functional relevance of genes (<xref rid="evw236-B72" ref-type="bibr">Quintana-Murci and Clark 2013</xref>). Strong purifying selection characterizes molecules indispensable for functioning of the immune system, whereas weak purifying selection is a signature of functional redundancy (<xref rid="evw236-B8" ref-type="bibr">Barreiro et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evw236-B37" ref-type="bibr">Harpur and Zayed 2013</xref>). Pathogens can exert directional pressures on host resistance molecules leaving signatures of positive selection in the genome. Most evidence comes from studies on primates and other mammals, where positive selection has been detected, e.g., in Toll-like receptor (TLR) genes (<xref rid="evw236-B8" ref-type="bibr">Barreiro et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evw236-B97" ref-type="bibr">Wlasiuk and Nachman 2010</xref>), chemokine receptor genes (<xref rid="evw236-B59" ref-type="bibr">Metzger and Thomas 2010</xref>), defensins (<xref rid="evw236-B21" ref-type="bibr">Das et al. 2010</xref>) or genes involved in resistance to malaria (<xref rid="evw236-B38" ref-type="bibr">Hedrick 2011</xref>). However, the influence of pathogens can be more complex if adaptations are costly, pathogen genes respond to host evolution and vice versa, leading to coevolutionary arms-races, or if interactions with the host are temporary. Hence also balancing selection (BS) is expected to operate and maintain high variation in some immune genes through mechanisms of overdominance, negative frequency-dependent selection or temporally and spatially fluctuating selection. Some studies suggest a major role of BS in the evolution of immunity-related genes (reviewed in <xref rid="evw236-B5" ref-type="bibr">Azevedo et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="evw236-B88" ref-type="bibr">T&#x0011b;&#x00161;ick&#x000fd; and Vinkler 2015</xref>) and good examples of genes under BS exist in a wide spectrum of taxa (<xref rid="evw236-B18" ref-type="bibr">Cagliani et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evw236-B38" ref-type="bibr">Hedrick 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evw236-B54" ref-type="bibr">Linnenbrink et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evw236-B84" ref-type="bibr">Tarazona-Santos et al. 2013</xref>). However, genome-wide scans, e.g., in humans identify relatively few examples (<xref rid="evw236-B49" ref-type="bibr">Leffler et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="evw236-B22" ref-type="bibr">DeGiorgio et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evw236-B85" ref-type="bibr">Teixeira et al. 2015</xref>), and most evidence comes from MHC genes which are somewhat atypical with extreme and unambiguous signatures of long-term BS. It is thus possible that in any given species BS affects only a handful of genes.</p><p>In spite of a wide interest in adaptive evolution of immune genes, population genomic studies are underrepresented in nonmodel organisms including vertebrates (<xref rid="evw236-B15" ref-type="bibr">Boehm 2012</xref>). Studies looking at the impact of selection on vertebrate immune genes have focused so far on expression changes after pathogen infection (<xref rid="evw236-B76" ref-type="bibr">Savage et al. 2014</xref>), comparison of immune repertoires between vertebrate taxa (<xref rid="evw236-B98" ref-type="bibr">You et al. 2014</xref>) or inferences of selection based on sequence divergence between taxa (<xref rid="evw236-B26" ref-type="bibr">Ekblom et al. 2010</xref>). Despite the importance of the clawed frogs of genus <italic>Xenopus</italic> as a model for evolutionary and comparative immunobiology (<xref rid="evw236-B74" ref-type="bibr">Robert and Cohen 2011</xref>), patterns of variation and selective landscapes in amphibian immune genes are poorly known. This is unfortunate as amphibians are undergoing a huge biodiversity crisis caused in no small part by emerging infectious diseases, in particular chytridiomycosis (<xref rid="evw236-B30" ref-type="bibr">Fisher et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="evw236-B56" ref-type="bibr">Martel et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evw236-B13" ref-type="bibr">Berger et al. 2016</xref>). Not all species (<xref rid="evw236-B56" ref-type="bibr">Martel et al. 2014</xref>) or even regional amphibian faunas (<xref rid="evw236-B10" ref-type="bibr">Bataille et al. 2013</xref>) appear equally vulnerable and variation in susceptibility clearly has a genetic component (<xref rid="evw236-B77" ref-type="bibr">Savage and Zamudio 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evw236-B11" ref-type="bibr">Bataille et al. 2015</xref>). As a consequence, there has been an interest in identifying targets of selection by experimental and comparative studies (<xref rid="evw236-B11" ref-type="bibr">Bataille et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="evw236-B27" ref-type="bibr">Ellison et al. 2015</xref>). However, population genomic analyses of selection acting on immune genes, which are invaluable for setting such efforts in a broader context, have lagged behind. The few studies performed so far have been limited in scope and focused on MHC genes (<xref rid="evw236-B61" ref-type="bibr">Nadachowska-Brzyska et al. 2012</xref>), antimicrobial peptides (<xref rid="evw236-B86" ref-type="bibr">Tennessen and Blouin 2008</xref>) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) genes (<xref rid="evw236-B7" ref-type="bibr">Babik et al. 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we examine sequence polymorphism and divergence in hundreds of genes involved in immune response and infer patterns of selection in two evolutionary lineages of <italic>Lissotriton</italic> newts. <italic>Lissotriton montandoni</italic> (Lm) and <italic>L. vulgaris graecus</italic> (Lvg) have allopatric distributions in the Carpathians and southern Balkans, respectively. There is little evidence for genetic exchange between them after the divergence dated to the Pliocene (<xref rid="evw236-B61" ref-type="bibr">Nadachowska-Brzyska et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="evw236-B68" ref-type="bibr">Pabijan et al. 2015</xref>). <italic>Lissotriton montandoni</italic> has however exchanged genes with other evolutionary lineages of <italic>L. vulgaris</italic> (Lv, <xref rid="evw236-B6" ref-type="bibr">Babik et al. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="evw236-B61" ref-type="bibr">Nadachowska-Brzyska et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="evw236-B100" ref-type="bibr">Zieli&#x00144;ski et al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="evw236-B99" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, <xref rid="evw236-B101" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The higher MHC class II variation in Lm has been attributed to introgression from Lv (<xref rid="evw236-B61" ref-type="bibr">Nadachowska-Brzyska et al. 2012</xref>). Lm and Lvg show similar variation in TLR genes but selective regimes in these genes differ between the species with both purifying and positive selection stronger in Lvg (<xref rid="evw236-B7" ref-type="bibr">Babik et al. 2015</xref>). If TLRs are representative of other immune genes, we expect to find evidence for stronger overall selective pressures in Lvg than in Lm. We also predict that, because host&#x02013;pathogen interactions may lead to the maintenance of polymorphism, targets of BS would be found among the analyzed genes. We aimed specifically to: (i) identify immune genes in <italic>Lissotriton</italic> transcriptomes with emphasis on single copy genes; (ii) examine levels of polymorphism within and divergence between Lm and Lvg using targeted resequencing; (iii) characterize patterns of selection and constraint in these genes within and between species; and (iv) identify targets of positive and balancing selection, whereas controlling for the confounding effects of demography.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Identification of Immune Genes in the newt Transcriptome</title><sec><title><italic>Lissotriton</italic> Reference Transcriptome</title><p>Coding sequences (ORFs) of newt immune genes were identified in de novo assembled <italic>Lissotriton vulgaris</italic> reference transcriptome.

Additional 22 immune genes identified in the chicken genome and 5 genes identified in the <italic>Anolis</italic> lizard genome were also included. For each species, the longest protein per gene was retrieved from Ensembl and within species self BLASTp was used to remove the remaining redundancy: only one of the proteins exhibiting &#x0003e; 90% amino acid identity was retained. Datasets from the four species were merged so that a given set of putative orthologs was represented by <italic>X. tropicalis</italic> when available, otherwise by the human protein, and in a few cases, when no ortholog was found in human or <italic>X. tropicalis</italic>, by chicken or the <italic>Anolis</italic> lizard proteins. The final set, used as the database of tetrapod immune genes against which the newt reference transcriptome was searched, comprised 1,990 protein sequences. We used rather inclusive criteria for classifying genes as &#x0201c;immune&#x0201d;, as some genes assigned to the broad GO category &#x0201c;Immune response&#x0201d; may affect immune system only indirectly. However, such approach minimized the risk of missing genes important for the function of salamander immune system, which is poorly understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of Putative Immune Genes in the <italic>Lissotriton</italic> Reference Transcriptome</title><p>Putative newt orthologs of the tetrapod immune genes were identified in the newt transcriptome as best reciprocal BLAST hits. BLASTx searches used newt transcripts as queries and tBLASTn searches used tetrapod immune proteins as queries, both at the <italic>E</italic> value threshold of 10<sup>&#x02212;20</sup>. Only queries having a unique best hit in the database were retained. The hit was defined as unique if the bitscore (summed across all hsps) of the second best hit was not higher than 0.75 &#x000d7; bitscore value of the best hit. In such approach, most immune gene families comprising recently diverged members were probably excluded from the analysis. In principle, this is undesirable as many genes important for the immune response do form families characterized by a considerable rate of gene duplication. However, given limitations of the currently available technologies, large scale analysis of such gene families would not be possible without a high quality newt genome which is not available. Therefore, we focused on putatively single copy immune genes; 775 complete ORFs of the total length of 1.39 Mb were identified (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw236/-/DC1">supplementary table S1</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw236/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online).

Newts form discrete demes corresponding to breeding ponds, such demes undergo extinction and recolonization, and thus the regional population can be considered a metapopulation (<xref rid="evw236-B79" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Green 2005</xref>). It has been shown (<xref rid="evw236-B92" ref-type="bibr">Wakeley 2004</xref>) that if one gene copy per locus is sampled per deme in a metapopulation consisting of many demes, the ancestral process producing such sample is identical to the unstructured coalescent process, if time is rescaled appropriately.

This dataset, further referred to as ungenotyped, formed the basis of most analyses.</p><p>Identification of genes under BS (see below) involved the McDonald&#x02013;Kreitman (MK) test. This test is normally performed on counts of synonymous and nonsynonymous polymorphisms and fixed differences obtained from called genotypes. A reasonable genotype quality requires substantial coverage so a large amount of potentially useable data is discarded if coverage is variable as was in our case. More precise information about polymorphism is available for ZFD and FFD sites but these are just approximation for synonymous and nonsynonymous sites. As neither of these approaches is ideal, we present results from both to extract as much information as possible from the MK test. Genotypes for each site were inferred using SAMtools mpileup and VCFtools, positions with the minimum genotype quality of 20 and minimum coverage 8&#x000d7; were retained and exported to fasta alignments. Numbers of segregating polymorphisms and fixed differences at synonymous and nonsynonymous positions were calculated using mstatspop (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.cragenomica.es/numgenomics/people/sebas/software/software.html">http://bioinformatics.cragenomica.es/numgenomics/people/sebas/software/software.html</ext-link>; last accessed October 6, 2016).

A third population (Lh, of constant size 10<sup>5</sup>) was added to our two-population divergence model to simulate divergence from an outgroup. We used the time of Lh divergence of 18.4 <xref rid="evw236-B68" ref-type="bibr">Ma (Pabijan et al. 2015</xref>) or 4.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> generations ago, assuming generation time of 4 years (<xref rid="evw236-B60" ref-type="bibr">Nadachowska and Babik 2009</xref>).

This method estimates mutation rates, divergence, constraint and selection effects simultaneously using genome-wide data without referring to any specific demographic model. The method models parameters using counts from the MK table, i.e., P<sub>N</sub>, D<sub>S</sub>, P<sub>S</sub> and D<sub>N</sub>, where P and D denote the numbers of polymorphisms within species and fixed differences between species, whereas N and S refer to nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations, respectively. For this analysis, we used numbers of segregating sites and fixed differences from Lh estimated per gene at ZFD and FFD sites.

In this approach, all nonsynonymous mutations are assumed to be deleterious, and the strength of purifying selection has gamma distribution. No underlying demographic model is assumed, any effect of demographic change on frequency spectra influences synonymous and nonsynonymous sites identically.

Signatures left in genetic data by BS are difficult to identify unambiguously as they can be confounded with other forms of selection, nonequilibrium demography or can result from stochasticity of the genealogical process (<xref rid="evw236-B29" ref-type="bibr">Fijarczyk and Babik 2015</xref>). Scans for BS should therefore rely on statistics or composite tests which simultaneously consider different lines of evidence. We performed two composite tests to identify candidate BS genes, each separately for Lm and Lvg. The final set of candidates is the sum of those identified by test 1 and test 2. We tested for enrichment of GO categories among candidate genes using GOrilla (<xref rid="evw236-B23" ref-type="bibr">Eden et al. 2009</xref>).</p><p>Test 1 identified genes showing an excess of nonsynonymous polymorphisms segregating at intermediate frequencies which is expected under BS. Hence two conditions had to be met simultaneously: (i) an excess of nonsynonymous polymorphisms and (ii) no excess of rare nonsynonymous polymorphisms (this removes the effect of slightly deleterious variants segregating at low frequencies). The MK test was performed to evaluate the first condition. Its result can be summarized with a neutrality index, NI = P<sub>N</sub>/P<sub>S</sub>&#x000d7; D<sub>S</sub>/D<sub>N</sub>. A significant MK test with NI &#x0003e; 1 indicates an excess of nonsynonymous polymorphisms and thus either balancing or purifying selection. The MK test was conducted on genotyped and ungenotyped data and its statistical significance was assessed with the Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. The second condition was imposed by filtering out genes with significantly negative Tajima&#x02019;s D in ZFD sites. Results from test 1 on ungenotyped data were compared with an alternative approach in which low-frequency variants (singletons and doubletons) were removed prior to the MK test. We observed large overlap between the approaches and thus present only the results of test 1. Test 2 identified genes with a high ratio of polymorphism to divergence, showing at the same time an excess of polymorphisms segregating at high frequencies. Thus, candidates identified in test 2 were those genes which showed significantly high &#x003c0;/d<sub>xy</sub> ratio and significantly positive values of any of the three statistics: Tajima&#x02019;s D, Fu and Li&#x02019;s F or Fu and Li&#x02019;s D. <italic>P</italic> values of all statistics were determined with 10<sup>4</sup> coalescent simulations as described above. Test 2 was conducted separately for ZFD and FFD sites.</p><p>We further evaluated evidence for BS in candidate genes by analyzing patterns of variation in high quality resequencing data from population samples and comparing them with control genes (CR) randomly selected from the transcriptome. One Lm and one Lvg population sample (19 individuals each) were analyzed. Resequencing was performed with Molecular Inversion Probes (MIP, <xref rid="evw236-B62" ref-type="bibr">Niedzicka et al. 2016</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw236/-/DC1">supplementary table S3</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw236/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). MIPs were designed from transcripts with exon boundaries identified through BLAST searches against <italic>X. tropicalis</italic> gene models (<xref rid="evw236-B62" ref-type="bibr">Niedzicka et al. 2016</xref>). Because many vertebrate exons are short, to maximize the length of the target available for MIP design in candidate BS genes, sequence capture reads were assembled into contigs using Trinity (release v2.0.4). Such contigs contained exons and flanking intron fragments (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw236/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). One to three nonoverlapping MIPs (112&#x02013;336 bp) per gene were resequenced in 88 CR genes (175 MIPs, 19.6 kb). We aimed to cover as much ORFs of BS genes as possible and finally resequenced 270 MIPs (18.4 kb) in 32 candidate genes. Reads were mapped to their respective references (i.e., transcripts or sequence capture contigs) using bwa-mips (<xref rid="evw236-B69" ref-type="bibr">Pedersen 2014</xref>). Reads mapped to sequence capture contigs were extracted and mapped back to the ORFs using local alignment in Bowtie 2. Within-gene alignments were subsequently merged. MIPs with coverage &#x02265; 12&#x000d7; in at least 85% of individuals in a population were considered successfully resequenced. Genotypes were called using GATK UnifiedGenotyper (<xref rid="evw236-B57" ref-type="bibr">McKenna et al. 2010</xref>) with the following settings: -T UnifiedGenotyper -dfrac 1 -pcr_error 5.0E-3 -mbq 20 -stand_call_conf 20.0 -out_mode EMIT_ALL_SITES -gt_mode DISCOVERY. Haplotypes were inferred with PHASE (<xref rid="evw236-B82" ref-type="bibr">Stephens and Donnelly 2003</xref>) and unphased positions were resolved randomly. Positions with &#x0003e; 25% missing data per population were removed. We applied stringent filters to remove paralogs which might have escaped primary quality filters in sequence capture data. Firstly, the number of heterozygotes within populations was compared with the Hardy&#x02013;Weinberg expectation using the Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, and genes with excess of heterozygotes significant at FDR 0.05 were flagged as putative paralogs. Secondly, because all positions within a single MIP target have very similar coverage, presence of more than two alleles per individual could be detected by looking at differences in allele counts between polymorphic positions located in a single MIP. Significant differences in allele counts indicate the difference in the number of gene copies between positions and thus paralogy. Thirdly, MIPs were also resequenced in two laboratory hybrid families (<italic>L. montandoni</italic>/<italic>L. vulgaris</italic> F1 hybrids and 111/114 F2 progeny in two families) to test for Mendelian segregation. The presence of positions departing from Mendelian expectations at FDR 0.05 and showing an excess of heterozygotes was considered a sign of paralogy. Taken together, these paralog filters were very strict with a potential to remove, e.g., genes showing even modest copy number variation. These strict filters were necessary to exclude as many putative paralogs as possible, as they are likely to generate false signals of BS.</p><p>Tajima&#x02019;s D, &#x003c0;, d<sub>xy</sub>, number of segregating and shared polymorphisms were calculated in mstatspop. Sliding window estimates of Tajima&#x02019;s D along genes and number of haplotypes were obtained in DnaSPv5 (<xref rid="evw236-B53" ref-type="bibr">Librado and Rozas 2009</xref>). To compare selective pressures between species in BS genes, we used a population genetics-phylogenetics gammamap method which relies on information about polymorphism within and divergence between species (<xref rid="evw236-B95" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al. 2011</xref>). The method infers distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of nonsynonymous mutations within species as well as variation in selection coefficients along genes. Priors of model parameters were set as in <xref rid="evw236-B95" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al. (2011)</xref>. Each lineage (Lm, Lvg and Lh) was assigned a separate prior for sliding window smoothing parameter (p), transition:transversion ratio (&#x003ba;), branch length (T) and DFE. &#x003ba; and T had improper log-uniform priors and p had uniform prior within interval (0, 1). Uninformative, symmetric Dirichlet prior was set on DFE, with 12 equally likely classes corresponding to different levels of fitness, from inviable to highly beneficial (<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> = &#x02212;500, &#x02212;100, &#x02212;50, &#x02212;10, &#x02212;5, &#x02212;1, 0, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100). Log-normal priors were set on population-scaled mutation rate (&#x003b8;) for each lineage and each gene, with hyperparameters mean &#x003bc; (improper uniform prior) and standard deviation &#x003c3; (log-normal prior with mean 0 and standard deviation 2). Posterior probabilities of population-scaled selection coefficient &#x003b3; (&#x003b3; =P*Ne*s, where P is ploidy, Ne is effective population size and s is selective advantage of a derived nonsynonymous mutation) were collected from 4 MCMC runs, each 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> steps long excluding 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> steps of burn-in. Separate chains were investigated for convergence, and final estimates were derived from merging all runs together. Codons in which posterior probability of &#x003b3; &#x02265; 1 was &#x02265; 0.75 were considered under positive selection.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Sequence Capture and Patterns of Variation</title><p>The ORFs of 634 immunes genes used for sequence capture ranged from 300 to 10,671 bp, averaging 1,560 &#x000b1; (SD) 1,055 bp; the total target length was 989.3 kb (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw236/-/DC1">supplementary table S1</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw236/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online).

Median coverage after discarding duplicates was as high as 11 &#x000b1; 3.3&#x000d7; (mean 38.5 &#x000b1; 8.9&#x000d7;), we noted however a substantial variance in coverage along the reference, probably due to variation between probes in capture efficiency (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw236/-/DC1">supplementary table S4</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw236/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). Lh alignment contained reads from three individuals and included RNAseq data, thus the total coverage was high, with a median of 39&#x000d7; and 99% the target covered. SNPs with an excess of heterozygotes were found in 109 Lvg and 120 Lm genes, mostly common to both species. These 135 putative paralogs were excluded from further analyses. Two additional genes were excluded due to the lack of outgroup information.</p><p>Patterns of diversity were thus examined in 497 putative single copy genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw236-F1">fig. 1</xref>). Average nucleotide diversity (&#x003c0;) was comparable in the two species at all sites (&#x003c0;<sub>Lm</sub> = 0.0061 &#x000b1; 0.0049, &#x003c0;<sub>Lvg</sub> 0.0060 &#x000b1; 0.0044) as well as at ZFD and FFD sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw236-F1">fig. 1<italic>a</italic></xref>). This agreed with similar long-term effective population sizes of both species inferred from the demographic model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw236-F2">fig. 2</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw236/-/DC1">supplementary tables S5a and c</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw236/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). The average divergence (d<sub>xy</sub>) from the outgroup was ca. 2% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw236-F1">fig. 1<italic>b</italic></xref>). Tajima&#x02019;s D was negative in both species at all site classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw236-F1">fig. 1<italic>c</italic></xref>), which may be attributed to population expansions. Tajima&#x02019;s D was 3 times lower in Lvg (D<sub>Lvg</sub> = &#x02212;0.67 &#x000b1; 0.74, D<sub>Lm</sub> = &#x02212;0.22 &#x000b1; 0.83) and private polymorphisms (Sx) were more numerous in this species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw236-F1">fig. 1<italic>d</italic></xref>). The inspection of SFS indicates that the surplus of polymorphisms in Lvg can be attributed solely to singletons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw236-F2">fig. 2</xref>). Moreover, interspecific differences in Tajima&#x02019;s D and in the number of Sx were most pronounced at ZFD sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw236-F1">fig. 1<italic>c</italic> and <italic>d</italic></xref>). These patterns are consistent with stronger demographic expansion in Lvg suggested by the demographic model and resulting differences in intensity of purifying selection. At all site classes, shared polymorphisms (Ss) were over 4 times more abundant than fixed differences (Sf) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw236-F1">fig. 1<italic>d</italic></xref>). Since we found no evidence of post-divergence gene flow between Lvg and Lm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw236/-/DC1">supplementary fig.

The fraction of shared polymorphisms was a little lower in ZFD than in FFD sites, consistent with purifying selection on nonsynonymous variants.

The selection effect allows to detect positive selection or negative selection acting on mildly deleterious alleles. Most genes were classified as neutral while the remaining 20% in Lm and 40% in Lvg appeared to evolve under negative selection, suggesting that selection on mildly deleterious mutations affects twice as many genes in Lvg as in Lm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw236-F3">fig. 3<italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic></xref>). Consequently, genome-wide estimates of population selection coefficient were significantly more negative in Lvg (&#x003b3;<sub>Lvg</sub> = &#x02212;0.48 &#x000b1; (SD) 0.28, &#x003b3;<sub>Lm</sub> = &#x02212;0.33 &#x000b1; 0.27; Mann&#x02013;Whitney paired test, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 2.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>). When the distribution of selection effect was taken at the face value, no gene appeared under positive selection. However, the power to detect such genes can be significantly reduced due to genome-wide effects of negative selection. It is therefore justified to compare gene-specific selection effects relative to the genome-wide average (<xref rid="evw236-B24" ref-type="bibr">Eilertson et al. 2012</xref>). Lower bounds of selection effect were above the genome-wide average for 12 Lm and 16 Lvg genes, which are thus plausible candidates for positive selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw236-F3">fig. 3<italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic></xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw236/-/DC1">supplementary table S7</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw236/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). The constraint effect, a function of the fraction of nonlethal nonsynonymous mutations (<italic>f</italic>) and the population selection coefficient, is useful to identify cases of strong purifying selection. In both species, the constraint effect was negative in almost all genes, suggesting widespread purifying selection against strongly deleterious mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw236-F3">fig. 3<italic>c</italic> and <italic>d</italic></xref>).

Test 1 revealed 15 candidates in Lm and 19 in Lvg, 5 of them were common to both species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="evw236-T1">table 1</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw236/-/DC1">supplementary table S8</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw236/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). Test 2 detected 7 candidate genes in Lm and only one in Lvg, all species-specific. In total, we found 35 candidates for BS, 20 genes in each species, but only 5 common to both species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="evw236-T1">table 1</xref>).

Balancing selection causes high diversity and excess of variants at intermediate frequencies, the pattern expected also if similar paralogs were lumped together. Hence paralogs overlooked at earlier steps of quality control were likely be overrepresented among BS candidates. Indeed, using stringent paralog filters, we found that as much as 66% candidate BS genes were actually similar paralogs, over twice as many as CR genes (29%). After paralog removal, the dataset included 11 BS candidates (9.1 kb resequenced) and 57 CR genes (11.1 kb resequenced). We compared Tajima&#x02019;s D and the ratio of polymorphism to divergence between these two gene sets to see whether the results from species-wide sequence capture data hold in resequenced population samples. Seven BS candidates were identified as such only in Lm, three only in Lvg and one in both species, but below we used all 11 BS candidates in each species.</p><p>In Lm, Tajima&#x02019;s D was positive and significantly higher in BS candidates than in CR genes, both at synonymous and nonsynonymous sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw236-F5">fig. 5<italic>a</italic></xref>; Mann&#x02013;Whitney test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.02). On the contrary, in Lvg Tajima&#x02019;s D did not differ between BS candidates and CR genes (Mann&#x02013;Whitney test, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). Other tests based on SFS revealed a similar pattern (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw236/-/DC1">supplementary fig.

The similar tendency was also seen for synonymous sites but was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw236-F5">fig. 5<italic>b</italic></xref>). Thus, the candidate genes indeed exhibit on average more even SFS and excess of nonsynonymous polymorphism to divergence. None of the GO categories were enriched in candidate genes.

Variation in newt immune genes has been shaped predominantly by widespread purifying selection and strong evolutionary constraint, implying long-term importance of these genes for functioning of the immune system. This prevalent constraint notwithstanding, we identified 23 candidates for positive selection and 11 genes possibly evolving under BS.</p><p>Genome scans use diverse approaches to identify targets of positive selection and often find immune genes among the candidates, but overlap between candidates detected in various studies is limited (<xref rid="evw236-B20" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="evw236-B46" ref-type="bibr">Kosiol et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evw236-B49" ref-type="bibr">Leffler et al. 2013</xref>). In newts, a large proportion of immune genes, similarly to most protein-coding genes in vertebrates, evolve under purifying selection and many genes are strongly constrained. Distribution of fitness effects of nonsynonymous mutations in newt immune genes is skewed towards strongly deleterious and lethal, similarly to protein-coding genes in chimpanzees (<xref rid="evw236-B12" ref-type="bibr">Bataillon et al. 2015</xref>) and murid rodents (<xref rid="evw236-B36" ref-type="bibr">Halligan et al. 2013</xref>). In the face of high constraint, positive selection is expected to be limited to a small number of genes and codons, decreasing the power to detect such signatures. Indeed, candidates for positive selection were identified in this study only using the average genome-wide selection effect as the baseline and should not be considered as strongly supported. We identified 16 outliers in Lvg, and 12 outliers in Lm; these are genes which exhibit significantly higher positive selection effects than average genes.</p><p>The candidates for positive selection carry out various immune functions and are not restricted to the components of the adaptive immune system. Assuming functions in newts similar to their mammalian counterparts, candidate genes participate in innate pathways, such as the complement cascade (<italic>CFI, C4A, C9</italic>), Fc epsilon receptor (FCERI) signaling (<italic>CSF2RB, FOS, IL2RB</italic>), Toll-like receptor cascades (<italic>FOS</italic>), cytosolic sensing of pathogen-associated DNA (<italic>ZBP1</italic>), as well as pathways connected with the adaptive immune system (<italic>CD226</italic>). Several of the candidate genes sense and directly fight pathogens. Two examples include nucleoporins encoded by <italic>NUP153</italic> and <italic>NUP214</italic>. Nucleoporins are part of the nuclear pore complex, which modulates transcript transport between cell and nucleus upon contact with a virus. Another pathogen-interacting protein is the collectin sub-family member 12 (COLEC12). COLEC12 is a cell surface glycoprotein and a scavenger receptor, which binds and directs bacteria and yeast for phagocytosis (<xref rid="evw236-B65" ref-type="bibr">Ohtani et al. 2001</xref>). Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) is a cytosolic sensor of pathogen DNA, triggering cytokine production. Finally, there are complement component 9 proteins (C9) which do not directly identify microbes, but constitute part of the membrane attack complex destroying bacteria. The complement complex is part of the innate immune system, which initiates a cascade of immune response at the site of infection and activates a mechanism for destroying the pathogen. Interestingly, several members of the complement complex have already been recognized as targets of positive selection in mammals (<xref rid="evw236-B46" ref-type="bibr">Kosiol et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evw236-B94" ref-type="bibr">Webb et al. 2015</xref>), including two genes that were among candidates also in newts: <italic>CFI</italic> and <italic>C9</italic>. Linking specific molecular adaptations with immunity to pathogens is essential for planning conservation actions in amphibians in the face of quickly spreading emerging diseases (<xref rid="evw236-B56" ref-type="bibr">Martel et al. 2014</xref>). This could be done by looking at associations between allelic variation and prevalence of various pathogen species and also by examining changes in gene expression level following the pathogen challenge in experimental conditions.</p><p>A clear advantage of our study lies in examination of a large number of immune genes, which increases the probability of finding targets of positive selection. However, many immune genes form families characterized by high rates of genomic duplication, which are technically challenging to analyze in nonmodel species without sequenced and well-assembled genomes (<xref rid="evw236-B48" ref-type="bibr">Larsen et al. 2014</xref>). Although we intended to focus on single-copy genes, &#x0003e;20% of studied genes turned out to have closely related paralogs in the newt genome and had to be excluded from the analyses. Gene duplication is an important source of novel or refined functions in the immune system (<xref rid="evw236-B41" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evw236-B91" ref-type="bibr">Vilcinskas 2013</xref>). Novel gene copies released from the constraint of purifying selection, readily acquire molecular changes which can be of evolutionary importance (<xref rid="evw236-B39" ref-type="bibr">Hellgren and Ekblom 2010</xref>). Therefore, we suspect that the amount of adaptive evolution found in this study could have been underestimated due to exclusion of families of closely related paralogs. Several immune gene families are characterized by high levels of gene duplication, e.g., interferons, defensins, interleukins, chemokine receptor proteins, and their members were shown to follow different evolutionary trajectories, including species-specific adaptations (<xref rid="evw236-B59" ref-type="bibr">Metzger and Thomas 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evw236-B55" ref-type="bibr">Manry et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evw236-B89" ref-type="bibr">Vasseur et al. 2012</xref>). In addition, our analysis of Toll-like receptors in <italic>Lissotriton</italic> newts found species-specific signatures of positive selection in at least three members of this family (<xref rid="evw236-B7" ref-type="bibr">Babik et al. 2015</xref>). A group of genes important in amphibian immune defense but missing from this study are antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). The numerous AMPs apparently play an essential role in amphibian immunity against fungi and bacteria and may be important targets of positive selection (<xref rid="evw236-B87" ref-type="bibr">Tennessen et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evw236-B75" ref-type="bibr">Roelants et al. 2013</xref>). Unfortunately, there is only very little information about AMPs in urodeles (<xref rid="evw236-B58" ref-type="bibr">Meng et al. 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction of Demography and Selection</title><p>The two evolutionary lineages differ in the overall strength of purifying selection acting on immune genes. On the one hand, more genes are under purifying selection in Lvg, but on the other, strong purifying selection appears more prevalent in Lm. The former is in line with larger current effective population size in Lvg, which makes selection against mildly deleterious mutations more efficient (<xref rid="evw236-B34" ref-type="bibr">Gazave et al. 2013</xref>). The latter observation is however difficult to explain by simple differences in Ne between the two lineages unless SnIPRE erroneously interprets patterns of nonsynonymous polymorphism as evidence for stronger constraint in Lm. One possibility is that indeed immune genes are more constrained in Lm, e.g., due to stronger long-term pathogen pressure. It is also possible that nonsynonymous polymorphisms maintained by BS may mislead inferences. There are however other plausible explanations not necessarily involving differences in selection regimes. Inferences of selection from patterns of molecular variation in nonequilibrium populations are complicated by the differences between neutral sites and those under purifying selection in the time needed for reaching an equilibrium (<xref rid="evw236-B16" ref-type="bibr">Brandvain and Wright 2016</xref>). Moreover, if demographic expansion is accompanied by spatial expansion, as was likely in Lvg (<xref rid="evw236-B68" ref-type="bibr">Pabijan et al. 2015</xref>), deleterious mutations can increase in frequency forming the so called expansion load (<xref rid="evw236-B70" ref-type="bibr">Peischl and Excoffier 2015</xref>) further complicating inferences. Clearly joint reconstruction of demography and selection, a subject of intensive ongoing work (<xref rid="evw236-B52" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 2012</xref>), would be desirable to disentangle the effect of nonequilibrium demography from actual differences in selection regimes.</p></sec><sec><title>Targets of Balancing Selection</title><p>We put special emphasis on identification of possible targets of BS among newt immune genes. Variation in such genes, often involved in host&#x02013;pathogen coevolution, may be of considerable adaptive significance and understanding molecular underpinnings of amphibian resistance is key to planning conservation strategies. Detection of BS is however not straightforward, except in cases when it maintains extreme variation and transspecies polymorphism as in MHC genes. Often genetic signatures left by this mode of selection are subtle and easily confounded by various nonselective processes (<xref rid="evw236-B29" ref-type="bibr">Fijarczyk and Babik 2015</xref>). Here identification of outliers was based on composite tests employing the reconstructed demographic model and the results were validated by comparing variation in candidate genes with that of control genes in independent population samples. The use of composite tests should decrease the rate of false positives due to multiple tests; unfortunately it is unclear how to calculate false discovery rate in this case.</p><p>Altogether 11 candidates for BS were detected, mostly encoding proteins that may interact closely with pathogens. Sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1) is an adaptor protein which recognizes ubiquitin coated proteins and targets them for degradation through autophagy. This mechanism can be used by the cell to eliminate intracellular bacteria or virus RNA (<xref rid="evw236-B50" ref-type="bibr">Levine et al. 2011</xref>). Nibrin (NBN) forms part of the complex that is responsible for the recognition and repair of DNA double stranded breaks, but some studies show that it can be used for the benefit of a virus for its efficient replication (<xref rid="evw236-B3" ref-type="bibr">Anacker et al. 2014</xref>). The ubiquitin-specific protease encoded by <italic>USP7</italic> interacts with herpes simplex virus type-1 immediate early protein ICP0 through processes of deubiquitinization and ubiquitinization. Expression of ICP0 is necessary for reactivation of viral genome and is stabilized via recruiting USP7 to remove ubiquitin (<xref rid="evw236-B4" ref-type="bibr">Antrobus and Boutell 2008</xref>). Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) is another protein, which can be exploited by pathogens. By boosting expression of <italic>SOCS3</italic>, viruses downregulate cytokines and inhibit proinflammatory response of the host, facilitating their replication (<xref rid="evw236-B66" ref-type="bibr">Okumura et al. 2015</xref>). Another interesting gene <italic>APP</italic> encodes amyloid beta (A4) precursor protein. APP is cleaved to form a number of amyloid peptides, which are known to be associated with many human diseases, however some beta amyloid products exhibit antimicrobial properties similar to antimicrobial peptides (<xref rid="evw236-B93" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2012</xref>). Interestingly, another candidate gene, <italic>ELK1</italic> encodes a transcription factor, which inhibits transcription of genes responsible for processing of APP proteins (<xref rid="evw236-B14" ref-type="bibr">Besnard et al. 2011</xref>). Although <italic>ELK1</italic> and <italic>APP</italic> were identified as BS candidates in different species (Lm and Lvg, respectively), nevertheless signatures of selection within these two genes suggest that production of amyloid peptides can be influenced by interaction with pathogens. Signatures of BS were also detected in aquaporin 9 (AQP9), a water-selective membrane channel responsible for remodeling of cell shape. Bacteria induce expression of <italic>AQP9</italic> leading to changes in size and morphology of macrophages, which affects the outcome of infection (<xref rid="evw236-B40" ref-type="bibr">Holm et al. 2015</xref>). The Red Queen hypothesis predicts that co-evolutionary arms race between host and pathogen molecules should involve mostly host genes responsible for sensing pathogens. We found examples of genes involved in pathogen recognition among candidates for BS (<italic>APP, SQSTM1</italic>) and positive selection (e.g., <italic>COLEC12, ZBP1</italic>). However, among BS candidates, we also found genes which regulate important cell processes and control immune response (<italic>NBN, USP7, SOCS3, AQP9</italic>). Pathogens may target cell signaling, compromising the host&#x02019;s ability to defend and increasing their own replication (<xref rid="evw236-B2" ref-type="bibr">Alto and Orth 2012</xref>). Balancing selection is not confined only to host ability to recognize foreign and harmful factors, but the conflict between host and pathogen interest can also drive molecular evolution of host regulators of immune response or other basic cell processes (<xref rid="evw236-B96" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al. 2006</xref>).</p><p>Recently, new model-based tests aiming at identification of targets of BS have been proposed (<xref rid="evw236-B22" ref-type="bibr">DeGiorgio et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evw236-B33" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al. 2015</xref>). They have good statistical properties and could be used to further validate candidates identified in this study. These tests however require information from continuous genomic regions around the putative targets of BS. Unfortunately, currently obtaining such long range genomic information in urodele amphibians is challenging as their huge genomes are still refractory to sequencing and assembly (<xref rid="evw236-B43" ref-type="bibr">Keinath et al. 2015</xref>). Until these challenges are overcome, an interesting option would be to identify the regions of interest in large insert (BAC or fosmid) libraries, resequence them and use this data to test for BS.</p><p>The BS candidates identified in the current study will be useful for testing whether genes affected by BS are more prone to interspecific introgression than other genes in the genome. Two rationales underlie this hypothesis: (i) theory predicts that, because introgressed alleles are initially rare, BS operating through rare-allele advantage facilitates their establishment in the recipient species (<xref rid="evw236-B78" ref-type="bibr">Schierup et al. 2000</xref>) and (ii) scant evidence suggests plausibility of the process but its generality and evolutionary importance are unknown (<xref rid="evw236-B19" ref-type="bibr">Castric et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evw236-B1" ref-type="bibr">Abi-Rached et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evw236-B35" ref-type="bibr">Grossen et al. 2014</xref>). Patterns of allele sharing and allele frequency differentiation among populations are consistent with adaptive introgression of MHC class II genes between Lm and Lv in central Europe (<xref rid="evw236-B61" ref-type="bibr">Nadachowska-Brzyska et al. 2012</xref>). It remains however unknown, whether adaptive introgression is a peculiar feature of MHC genes or is it more widespread among genes evolving under BS. The Lm/Lv system is particularly well suited to test this hypothesis, because patterns of relationships and gene flow in this group allow formulation of predictions that facilitate distinguishing the effect of introgression from incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), expected to be prevalent in BS genes (<xref rid="evw236-B61" ref-type="bibr">Nadachowska-Brzyska et al. 2012</xref>). Introgression of genes under BS in amphibians may be important for both their adaptive potential and conservation. Amphibians often show old intraspecific genetic structure and reproductive isolation develops relatively slowly in this group (<xref rid="evw236-B90" ref-type="bibr">Vences and Wake 2007</xref>). Range changes triggered by, e.g., climatic fluctuations, create opportunity for episodic contact and genetic exchange. As long as reproductive isolation is not complete, adaptive variants introgress easily between the differentiating lineages (<xref rid="evw236-B9" ref-type="bibr">Barton 1979</xref>). Such lineages may thus effectively share a common pool of adaptive variation (<xref rid="evw236-B73" ref-type="bibr">Rieseberg et al. 2004</xref>). Variants that emerged during periods of isolation would contribute to the pool through episodes of hybridization and this process should be particularly efficient in genes evolving under BS. Secondary contact followed by hybridization would thus boost adaptive potential of interacting lineages and alleviate the effects of past bottlenecks.</p><p>In conclusion, this first population-genomic study of amphibian immune genes showed that an overwhelming majority of immune genes in two <italic>Lissotriton</italic> newts are characterized by high evolutionary constraint. Patterns of synonymous and nonsynonymous variation indicate more widespread selection against mildly deleterious mutations in <italic>L. vulgaris graecus</italic>. In spite of the overall sequence conservation, we find signatures of positive and balancing selection in genes, which are involved both in pathogen recognition and in regulation of immune response. We provide a list of candidate genes potentially involved in resistance and defense against pathogens, which are worth further exploration in newts and other amphibians.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw236/-/DC1">Supplementary tables S1&#x02013;S10</ext-link>, text and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw236/-/DC1">figures S1&#x02013;S5</ext-link> are available at <italic>Genome Biology and Evolution</italic> online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbe.oxfordjournals.org/">http://www.gbe.oxfordjournals.org/</ext-link>).</p>
