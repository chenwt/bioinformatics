Despite the fact that drugs targeting the function of key epigenetic factors have been approved in the context of hematopoietic disorders<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and the recent identification of mutations affecting chromatin modulators in a variety of leukemias<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, &#x0201c;epigenetic&#x0201d; drugs are not currently used for TALL treatment. Recently, we described a tumor suppressor role of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in this tumor<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Here we sought out to delineate the role of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylases, JMJD3 and UTX. We show that JMJD3 is essential for initiation and maintenance of disease, as it controls important oncogenic gene targets through the modulation of H3K27 methylation. In contrast, UTX acts a tumor suppressor and frequently genetically inactivated in T-ALL. Moreover, we demonstrate that the small molecule inhibitor GSKJ4<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> affects T-ALL growth, by targeting JMJD3 activity. These findings show that two proteins with similar enzymatic function can play opposing roles in the context of the same disease and pave the way for the use of a new category of epigenetic inhibitors in hematopoietic malignancies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">In recent studies others and we revealed a key tumor-suppressor function for PRC2 that catalyzes methylation of H3K27<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Since net H3K27me3 levels are dictated by the balance between histone methylation and active demethylation, we hypothesized that removal of methyl groups from H3K27 is also an important process in T-ALL progression. We therefore investigated possible roles for H3K27 demethylases in T-ALL (see also Supplementary File 1 for extended Introduction); Ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide Repeat X-linked Protein (UTX<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, official symbol KDM6A) is a ubiquitously expressed protein that controls basal levels of H3K27me3 and induction of ectoderm and mesoderm differentiation<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and is essential for reprogramming<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.

However, the roles of these two demethylases as direct modulators of the oncogenic state are largely uncharacterized<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">We have generated and studied NOTCH1-induced T-ALL animal models<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), as activating mutations of NOTCH1 are a defining feature of this disease<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. <italic>Jmjd3</italic> mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly higher in leukemic cells when compared to untransformed CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> control T cells that exhibit low levels of active Notch1 whereas <italic>Utx (and Ezh2</italic><sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>) expression did not change significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b, c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary File 2/Table 1</xref>) upon transformation. It was previously shown that NFkB controls <italic>JMJD3</italic> expression during inflammation<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and that NOTCH1 induces the NFkB pathway in T-ALL<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Here, we were able to show increased expression of the p65 (Rela) subunit of NFkB and its binding-but not Notch1- on <italic>Jmjd3</italic> control elements in T-ALL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1a, b</xref>). Modulation of the levels of intracellular NOTCH1 or activity of NFkB pathway decreased significantly the amounts of NFkB bound on the <italic>Jmjd3</italic> elements, as well as <italic>Jmjd3</italic> mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1b&#x02013;f</xref>). We then probed for Jmjd3 binding on specific oncogenic loci, previously shown to be important in T-ALL<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. We found that Jmjd3 binding was highly enriched on the <italic>Hes1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, left), depended on the activation of the Notch1 pathway and negatively correlated with H3K27m3 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1g, h</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Analyses of human leukemia cases<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> showed that JMJD3 is more highly expressed in T-ALL compared to normal T cell progenitors<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and other types of leukemia<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, similarly to the classical NOTCH1 target <italic>HES1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Genes co-expressed with JMJD3 in human primary samples were found to exhibit loss of H3K27me3 during leukemia progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1i</xref>), suggesting a connection between expression of JMJD3 and H3K27me3 levels on specific targets.</p><p id="P6">ChIP-Seq studies in T-ALL cells (CUTTL1) showed that JMJD3 binds to important NOTCH1 targets with oncogenic function (like <italic>HEY1, NRARP</italic> and <italic>HES1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). There is a statistically significant co-occupancy of JMJD3 with NOTCH1<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> (33% of top JMJD3 peaks are occupied by NOTCH1, 6.9-fold enrichment over control, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>), the NOTCH1 partner RBPJk and the activating mark H3K4me3<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1j</xref>). The majority of JMJD3 binding sites were localized around the transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1k</xref>) in a fashion similar to NOTCH1<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. These results suggest a key role for JMJD3 in oncogenic programs in T-ALL through interaction with NOTCH1. Protein immunoprecipitation studies in 293T cells as well as T-ALL lines showed that JMJD3 is part of the NOTCH1 transcriptional complex as it interacts directly with NOTCH1 and MAML1 whereas there was no NOTCH1 interaction with EZH2 or UTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2a&#x02013;c</xref>). As JMJD3 has been shown to be member of MLL complexes<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, we tested whether it interacts with WDR5, a key subunit of MLL complex. We show here that JMJD3 interacts with WDR5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>), suggesting a potential NOTCH1:JMJD3:MLL complex on target promoters.</p><p id="P7">To clarify the role of JMJD3 and UTX in the maintenance of leukemia, we performed genomic knockdown of <italic>JMJD3</italic> in human T-ALL using two different short hairpin RNAs (sh<italic>RNA</italic>s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig 2d</xref>). Treatment with sh<italic>JMJD3</italic> but not sh<italic>UTX</italic> affected the viability of leukemic cells, as shown by loss of representation studies and apoptosis assays, in contrast to myeloid leukemia lines used as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2e, f</xref>). Expression of NOTCH1 targets was negatively affected by sh<italic>JMJD3</italic>, accompanied by loss of JMJD3 and gain of H3K27me3 on their promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3 a&#x02013;e</xref>). Genome-wide expression analysis showed that more transcripts were significantly down-regulated than upregulated (749 protein-coding genes vs 297, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref> top panel and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3f</xref>), in agreement with the JMJD3 role as a transcriptional activator. The down-regulated genes were found significantly enriched in genes that gained H3K27me3 on their promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, bottom panel, <italic>P</italic>=1.015673e-07). sh<italic>UTX</italic> downand up-regulated gene signatures were reversed in terms of gene numbers (46 down-regulated and 189 upregulated protein-coding genes, when compared to both sh<italic>Renilla</italic> and sh<italic>JMJD3</italic>). Intriguingly, <italic>JMJD3</italic> expression itself is significantly upregulated upon <italic>UTX</italic> silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data 3a</xref>).

Interestingly, silencing of UTX leads to enhanced proliferation in many cases, suggesting a possible tumor suppressor function <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figure 4g</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To examine the potential roles for Utx and Jmjd3 in the induction of T-ALL, we performed transplantation of bone marrow using hematopoietic stem cells from Utx and Jmjd3 germiline knockout mice.

These experiments provide the first <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis of the tumor suppressor role of UTX in any tumor type.</p><p id="P9">To delineate the potential mechanism behind Utx action we performed gene expression analysis in sorted leukemic blasts of wild-type (<italic>Utx</italic><sup>+/<italic>y</italic></sup>/<italic>Utx</italic><sup>+/<italic>y</italic></sup>) or knockout (<italic>Utx</italic><sup>&#x02212;/<italic>y</italic></sup>) background from the spleen or bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). This analysis showed that Utx positively controls important tumor suppressor genes, like the Retinoblastoma binding protein 6 (<italic>Rbbp6</italic>), the inhibitor of the Notch1 pathway activity <italic>Fbxw7</italic> and the PRC2 member <italic>Suz12</italic> whereas genes with oncogenic role in T-ALL-including <italic>Jmjd3</italic>-were up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig 5i</xref>). These studies strongly suggested that UTX might act as a tumor suppressor in human T-ALL. We thus screened a panel of primary pediatric T-ALL samples<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> for genetic alterations of the <italic>UTX</italic> locus. Analysis of primary human samples of pediatric T-ALL using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays identified two patients with focal deletions of the <italic>UTX</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>).

Subsequently, for each genomic window enriched in at least one of the two samples, the total number of reads was determined, and the window read counts were normalized using quantile normalization across biological replicates and samples before comparison. Finally, for each window, the fold-change between the two samples was calculated (GSKJ4 versus control and vice versa). To estimate the false discovery rate, the distribution of observed H3K27me3 fold-changes was compared against the distribution of fold-changes between replicates of the same treatment. This comparison was performed independently at different H3K27me3 read density levels to control for artificially high fold-changes due to low read counts in the denominator.

Pearson correlation on log-transformed values attempt to balance the expression distribution and allow contributions from genes of lower expression, and therefore provides a more realistic genome-wide reproducibility metric.
