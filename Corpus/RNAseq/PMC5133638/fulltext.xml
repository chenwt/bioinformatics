Here, we resolve genome-wide 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in glioblastoma through parallel processing of DNA with bisulfite and oxidative bisulfite treatments. We apply a statistical algorithm to estimate 5-methylcytosine, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and unmethylated proportions from methylation array data. We show that 5-hydroxymethylcytosine is depleted in glioblastoma compared with prefrontal cortex tissue. In addition, the genomic localization of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in glioblastoma is associated with features of dynamic cell-identity regulation such as tissue-specific transcription and super-enhancers. Annotation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine genomic distribution reveal significant associations with RNA regulatory processes, immune function, stem cell maintenance and binding sites of transcription factors that drive cellular proliferation. In addition, model-based clustering results indicate that patients with low-5-hydroxymethylcytosine patterns have significantly poorer overall survival. Our results demonstrate that 5-hydroxymethylcytosine patterns are strongly related with transcription, localizes to disease-critical genes and are associated with patient prognosis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

Similar to other tumour types, glioblastomas exhibit patterns of genome-wide 5&#x02009;mC loss and genomic context-specific DNA hypermethylation when compared with healthy nervous tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Epigenomic patterns in cancer are often heterogeneous and can be substantially influenced by the presence of genetic alterations. For example, gliomas that carry mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (<italic>IDH1</italic> and <italic>IDH2</italic>) genes have been shown to harbour a pattern of DNA hypermethylation at certain promoter regions which results in a glioma CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. The epigenomic phenotype of G-CIMP tumours has been associated with distinct copy number alterations, molecular subgroups and a survival advantage in patients with glioblastoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p><p>While the glioblastoma DNA methylome has begun to be described, additional modifications to DNA that modulate normal gene function have been implicated in disease development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Indeed, the ten&#x02013;eleven translocation (TET) family of proteins have been shown to function as enzymes capable of altering the methylation status of DNA by converting 5&#x02009;mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5&#x02009;hmC)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Emerging evidence has suggested that 5&#x02009;hmC: localizes to sites of DNA damage, may act as a transient intermediate in the process of 5&#x02009;mC demethylation, and may serve as a functional epigenetic mark for regulating transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. In cell lines, 5&#x02009;hmC has been shown to recruit DNA-binding proteins and 5&#x02009;hmC production has been reported to be essential for glioblastomagenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. However, the aetiologic, distribution and prognostic significance of 5&#x02009;hmC levels in glioblastoma remains unclear. Accordingly, a portrait of both 5&#x02009;mC and 5&#x02009;hmC patterns at a nucleotide resolution is necessary for a more complete understanding of the cytosine modifications in glioblastoma.</p><p>Use of sodium bisulfite (BS) treatment followed by hybridization to the Infinium DNA methylation arrays (that is, 450&#x02009;K array) is a common method for interrogating DNA methylation at the single base level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. However, sample treatment with sodium BS does not allow disambiguation of 5&#x02009;mC from 5&#x02009;hmC. Oxidation of 5&#x02009;hmC to 5-formylcytosine (5&#x02009;fC) is achievable with potassium perruthenate treatment, and subsequent sodium BS treatment (oxBS) converts 5&#x02009;fC and cytosine to uracil and ultimately thymine while only 5&#x02009;mC remains unconverted by the coupled oxBS treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. As a result, the selective oxidation step enables disambiguation of 5&#x02009;hmC from 5&#x02009;mC measurements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Recently, it has been demonstrated that use of paired BS and oxBS treatment on the same samples followed by hybridization to the Infinium DNA methylation array reliably permits accurate quantification of 5&#x02009;hmC and 5&#x02009;mC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p><p>Here, we present the characterization of 5&#x02009;mC and 5&#x02009;hmC levels from paired BS and oxBS 450&#x02009;K assays in thirty glioblastomas.

We demonstrate that the glioblastoma genome is globally depleted of 5&#x02009;hmC and its distribution is dependent on genomic context. We also observe an enrichment of 5&#x02009;hmC at glioblastoma-specific enhancer elements, alternative mRNA splicing events, and localization of 5&#x02009;hmC to several genes significantly mutated in glioblastoma. In contrast to the more commonly described repressive nature of 5&#x02009;mC, 5&#x02009;hmC levels in our cohort are primarily positively associated with gene expression and open chromatin. Finally, we find that pattern-specific loss of 5&#x02009;hmC is associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with glioblastoma.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Estimation of 5&#x02009;mC and 5&#x02009;hmC</title><p>We adapted the BS&#x02013;oxBS technology to DNA from 30 glioblastomas and applied a novel algorithm, OxyBS, to obtain genome-wide 5&#x02009;hmC and 5&#x02009;mC estimates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. All samples were primary tumours, fresh frozen and <italic>IDH1</italic> and <italic>IDH2</italic> wild type. Patient demographic, tumour characteristics and survival data are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. Here, we focused on the identification of 5&#x02009;hmC distribution and abundance to better understand the role of 5&#x02009;hmC in glioblastoma pathobiology. Our approach to investigate potential functions of 5&#x02009;hmC included assessment of five aims (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>): (1) to characterize genomic abundance and distribution of 5&#x02009;hmC and 5&#x02009;mC, (2) to delineate high 5&#x02009;hmC CpGs in glioblastoma, (3) to determine functional annotation of regions with high 5&#x02009;hmC, (4) to assess the impact of 5&#x02009;hmC on gene expression (5) and to apply a machine learning algorithm to cluster patients by 5&#x02009;hmC profiles.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Global content and genomic distribution of 5&#x02009;hmC and 5&#x02009;mC</title><p>First, to qualitatively assess the extent of deregulation in the glioblastoma epigenome we compared the total genomic content of 5&#x02009;hmC among glioblastoma samples with levels of 5&#x02009;hmC in the prefrontal cortex. Although we were unable to obtain matched disease-free cortex samples in our own cohort, we accessed publicly available prefrontal cortex data using the same BS&#x02013;oxBS protocol in an independent population of individuals that presented with no evidence of neurological impairment (GSE74368, <italic>n</italic>=5). To avoid limitations due to the presence of multiple cell types (that is, glial and neuronal) in the prefrontal cortex samples we did not compare CpG-specific differences in 5&#x02009;hmC. However, to provide a global perspective on 5&#x02009;hmC differences we examined the overall proportion of 5&#x02009;hmC in total cytosine content (that is, summed 5&#x02009;hmC beta-values across all CpGs within each sample divided by total number of CpGs profiled) between the two tissues. We observed an average 3.5 fold reduction (<italic>P</italic>=6.2E-06, Wilcoxon rank sum test) in the total 5&#x02009;hmC content in glioblastoma samples when compared with cortex samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2A</xref>). While all glioblastoma samples exhibited a decreased level of total 5&#x02009;hmC there was high variability in total 5&#x02009;hmC loss across tumours. Potential biological explanations that may account for the variability of total 5&#x02009;hmC include sample differences in cellular proportions and differences in the expression of the TET enzymes. To this end, we estimated putative cellular proportions from DNA methylation data (&#x02018;Methods' section) using a non-negative matrix factorization approach (RefFreeEWAS) and found that there were stable estimates of tumour purity across samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref>). Thus, differences in 5&#x02009;hmC levels across tumours may be more strongly associated with the molecular alterations across tumours rather than tumour purity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3B</xref>). We next tested whether the overall proportions of 5&#x02009;hmC in total cytosine content were associated with the expression of TET enzymes and additional epigenetic enzymes (that is, <italic>TET1, TET2, DNMT3A, IDH1</italic>, <italic>e</italic>tc). Again, we did not observe any significant relationships (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05, Spearman's rho test, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) consistent with prior studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Finally, we note that the levels of 5&#x02009;hmC were not significantly associated with total 5&#x02009;mC content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2B</xref>, <italic>P</italic>=0.18, linear regression). 5&#x02009;hmC has been implicated in the DNA demethylation pathway and may suggest functionality of 5&#x02009;hmC outside simply removal of 5&#x02009;mC.</p><p>At the nucleotide level, the dynamic range of 5&#x02009;hmC detection was between 0.00 and 0.99 on the beta-value scale. Empirical cumulative density plots for both mean 5&#x02009;hmC and 5&#x02009;mC across all subjects revealed near zero 5&#x02009;hmC levels in a majority of CpGs and revealed the well-established bimodal distribution for 5&#x02009;mC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). To assess the site-specific relationship between 5&#x02009;hmC and 5&#x02009;mC levels we computed Spearman correlation coefficients for each CpG and observed that moderate negative correlations exist for a large majority of CpGs, and that &#x0003c;20&#x00025; of CpGs demonstrated weak positive correlations between 5&#x02009;hmC and 5&#x02009;mC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). There are known differences in the distribution of DNA methylation based upon by genomic context<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. The dependency of 5&#x02009;mC levels upon CpG density was observed in glioblastoma and the CpG islands and CpG island shores exhibited demonstrably lower levels of 5&#x02009;mC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). To determine whether potential CpG density specific patterns also exist for 5&#x02009;hmC we next computed the proportions of CpG-specific mean 5&#x02009;hmC across the four strata of CpG Island, Shores, Shelves and Ocean. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1d</xref> displays the distributions of mean 5&#x02009;mC and 5&#x02009;hmC as well as statistical assessment over each of the CpG strata. Generally, the patterns of 5&#x02009;hmC levels were similar to 5&#x02009;mC and the lowest levels of 5&#x02009;hmC were found across CpG islands and CpG Island shores. Similar to observations in 5&#x02009;mC, CpG Island shelves and Ocean regions also harboured the highest levels of 5&#x02009;hmC. The role of 5&#x02009;mC in regulating gene expression has best been described for promoter regions and it is known that TET1, which catalyzes the oxidation of 5&#x02009;mC to 5&#x02009;hmC, is enriched for binding to DNA at CpG island promoters<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. To examine the overall distribution of mean 5&#x02009;mC and 5&#x02009;hmC across the promoter regions for both cortex tissue and glioblastomas we averaged the cytosine modifications over a four kilobase pair window near transcriptional start sites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. We noted the occurrence of hypermethylation (5&#x02009;mC) across glioblastoma promoter regions and a consistently lower level of glioblastoma 5&#x02009;hmC proximal to promoter regions when compared with healthy tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>5&#x02009;hmC is uniquely distributed in the glioblastoma genome</title><p>To determine which 5&#x02009;hmC sites had the highest potential functional relevance we calculated the mean 5&#x02009;hmC for each CpG across all thirty tumours to identify CpG sites with the highest proportion of 5&#x02009;hmC alleles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). In glioblastoma, a large number of CpGs demonstrated mean 5&#x02009;hmC values near zero while signals &#x0003e;5&#x00025; 5&#x02009;hmC were found in &#x0223c;35,000&#x02009;CpGs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). However, to be confident in distinguishing signal from background we then defined CpGs as high 5&#x02009;hmC CpGs if they were in the highest 1&#x00025; of mean 5&#x02009;hmC level; resulting in 3,876&#x02009;CpGs with a mean value of at least &#x0223c;9.0&#x00025; 5&#x02009;hmC that we described here as &#x02018;high 5&#x02009;hmC CpGs' and are used in subsequent analyses. Among high 5&#x02009;hmC CpGs, 60&#x00025; were recurrent across a majority of the thirty glioblastomas (2,347/3,876&#x02009;CpGs with at least 15 tumours displaying &#x0223c;9&#x00025; 5&#x02009;hmC at a given CpG) while 30&#x00025; (1,162/3,876&#x02009;CpGs) were also among the 1&#x00025; most variable 5&#x02009;hmC probes suggesting greater inter-individual variability at these locations. The complete list of the high 5&#x02009;hmC CpGs with genomic location, CpG-specific mean and s.d. is provided as a resource in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>. The dynamic regulation of DNA methylation for cell-identity is a balance between methylation and demethylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Here, we visualized the CpG-specific relationships between high 5&#x02009;hmC and 5&#x02009;mC at these high 5&#x02009;hmC CpGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>) and observed that the highest levels of 5&#x02009;hmC track to sites with intermediate levels of 5&#x02009;mC. These results are consistent with the notion that 5&#x02009;hmC may function as an intermediate in the DNA demethylation process at dynamically regulated regions. Together, the observed loss of 5&#x02009;hmC that occurs in glioblastoma may also reflect disruption of regulated genomic DNA methylation patterns.</p><p>Previous sequencing studies in non-diseased tissue have shown that 5&#x02009;hmC marks tend to reside in intronic and gene regulatory regions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. However, the localization of 5&#x02009;hmC in the glioblastoma genome remains obscure and may influence disease-critical gene expression programs. The genomic distribution of high 5&#x02009;hmC CpGs relative to canonical transcriptional start sites (TSS) is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref> and reveals that &#x0223c;75&#x00025; of high 5&#x02009;hmC were found beyond the 5&#x02009;kb region upstream of the TSS. To determine whether elevated levels of 5&#x02009;hmC were associated with genomic features, we used a Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test with binary outcomes (for example, genomic region of interest versus other) to provide a measure of enrichment that permitted stratification by CpG density (that is, CpG islands, shores, shelves and ocean). We observed that high 5&#x02009;hmC CpGs were more likely to be found in intronic regions (2.12 odds ratio (OR), <italic>P</italic>=1.7E-112, Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>) as well as depleted in promoter regions (OR=0.69, <italic>P</italic>=4.8E-21, Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>) when the genomic regions of the 450&#x02009;K array were used as a background. These findings concur with previous observations in non-diseased tissue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Leveraging publicly available histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) genome-wide maps, which marks active enhancers, from three primary glioblastomas we observed substantial enrichment for enhancer regions among the high 5&#x02009;hmC CpGs for all three tumours (median OR=3.1, <italic>P</italic>=1.9E-211, Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Interestingly, we also found a significant enrichment of high 5&#x02009;hmC CpGs at glioblastoma cell line (U87) defined enhancers (OR=2.2, <italic>P</italic>=1.7E-46, Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>) and super-enhancers (OR=3.00, <italic>P</italic>=9.7E-63, Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Super-enhancers are a subset of enhancers that have critical functions in defining cell-identity and are frequently found at key oncogenic drivers providing support that 5&#x02009;hmC may play key roles in disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. We also noted that there was a modest enrichment among high 5&#x02009;hmC CpGs for glioblastoma DNase hypersensitivity sites, a marker of open chromatin (OR=1.32, <italic>P</italic>=5.34E-7, Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>).

A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for age at diagnosis and patient sex resulted in a significantly increased hazard of death related with membership in the low-5&#x02009;hmC cluster independent of age (Hazard Ratio=3.3, CI 95&#x00025; 1.3&#x02013;8.2, <italic>P</italic>=0.03, Cox proportional hazards regression, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b,c</xref>).

Use of 5&#x02009;hmC and 5&#x02009;mC profiling has permitted us to observe that the glioblastoma genome is relatively depleted of 5&#x02009;hmC when compared with healthy cortex tissue, a finding consistent with studies that used less sensitive techniques<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>.

However, traditional BS treatment of DNA profiled on 450&#x02009;K arrays alone is unable to disambiguate 5&#x02009;hmC from 5&#x02009;mC abundance. Existing methods to quantify the abundance of 5&#x02009;hmC range from immunohistochemistry (IHC) to liquid chromatography&#x02013;mass spectrometry (LC&#x02013;MS) to sequence-based approaches. Both immunohistochemistry and LC&#x02013;MS approaches have demonstrated that there is a depletion of 5&#x02009;hmC in glioblastomas, but these techniques are unable to discern the genomic location of the 5&#x02009;hmC conservation or loss<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. In contrast, sequencing-based approaches have the ability to detect 5&#x02009;hmC at the single base resolution genome-wide, but suffer from high costs that limit applicability in larger studies. To date, we are not aware of any genome-wide sequencing data for 5&#x02009;hmC in glioblastoma.

The application of the oxBS and BS protocol for 450&#x02009;K arrays represents an opportunity to strike a balance between genomic resolution of 5&#x02009;hmC and sample throughput. Importantly, the use of paired oxBS and BS 450&#x02009;K arrays has consistently been shown to distinguish 5&#x02009;hmC from both 5&#x02009;mC and 5&#x02009;C (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>).</p><p>Genome-wide loss of 5&#x02009;hmC in cancer has been a widely observed, yet poorly characterized biological phenomenon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>.

Importantly, several studies have noted that loss of 5&#x02009;hmC is associated with increased expression of proliferation markers and with increasing tumour grade suggesting that loss of epigenetic regulation via 5&#x02009;hmC may contribute to disease progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. The link between decreasing 5&#x02009;hmC with increasing tumour aggressiveness has been explained, in part, by the delayed generation of 5&#x02009;hmC on newly synthesized DNA and the high proliferative rates of aggressive tumours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Recent reports have also revealed that 5&#x02009;hmC may have roles beyond transcriptional regulation. For example, 5&#x02009;hmC has previously been shown to localize to DNA damage in experimental conditions and its role as an epigenetic marker of DNA damage has been shown to promote genome stability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>.

In contrast with prior studies, we did not observe a significant association between total 5&#x02009;hmC levels and patient survival. While our method for total 5&#x02009;hmC measurement was distinct from previous estimations, a lack of association between survival and global 5&#x02009;hmC levels suggests that this relationship is more nuanced than previously thought. Indeed, we found that subject clusters determined by the application of RPMM to 5&#x02009;hmC profiles demonstrated differences in patient survival time with the low-5&#x02009;hmC tumours having a significantly worst prognosis independent of subject age. Together, our analysis provides a more complete understanding of dynamic cytosine modifications that may contribute to disease phenotypes and genomic instability.</p><p>Not considered by previous studies is the possibility that cancer cell conservation of 5&#x02009;hmC may also be critical for glioblastomagenesis and tumour growth as suggested by Takai <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.

Prior work has demonstrated that 5&#x02009;hmC modulates enhancer activity and regulates gene expression programs during cellular differentiation suggesting that 5&#x02009;hmC deregulation may impact the dedifferentiation observed in glioblastoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. The enrichment of cellular identity pathways in our GREAT analysis and the binding sites of transcription factors that drive cellular proliferation further supported the link between 5&#x02009;hmC and disease-critical gene expression programs. Indeed, the enrichment of immune response and somatic stem cell maintenance may reflect cellular subpopulations (that is, glioblastoma stem cells and infiltrating immune cells) necessary for continued tumour growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. Across this cohort, the consistent genomic localization of 5&#x02009;hmC suggests a role for 5&#x02009;hmC in genomic regulation of glioblastoma cells that merits future investigation.</p><p>In summary, we have generated nucleotide resolution maps of 5&#x02009;hmC in thirty glioblastomas and linked 5&#x02009;hmC with gene regulatory regions.

In particular, we classified each CpG by genomic context (CpG island, shore, shelf or ocean)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>.</p><p>We moved to delineate the level at which we could confidently call a genomic location as possessing <italic>bona fide</italic> 5&#x02009;hmC. In our analysis, we defined the locations within glioblastoma that have the 1&#x00025; highest mean 5&#x02009;hmC level to be considered high 5&#x02009;hmC CpGs. Next, each CpG was assigned a classifier for high 5&#x02009;hmC (that is, 0 or 1), putative enhancer regions, open chromatin, Polycomb group target genes, and gene regions (that is, four separate vectors for promoter, exons, introns or intergenic) as well as the CpG's relationship to a CpG island (that is CpG island, shore, shelf and ocean). Typically, a Fisher's test is used to test for enrichment of these features; however, we decided to use the Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test as this approach permits stratification by CpG island probe type, which we demonstrated has a substantial impact of the level of 5&#x02009;hmC.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>RNA extraction and gene expression</title><p>Tumour RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini tissue kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Previously, this algorithm has been shown to reasonably estimate the number of constituent cell types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>. Moreover, RefFreeEWAS is a variant of non-negative matrix factorization and is similar to approaches that use gene expression levels to estimate the proportion of normal tissue cells in a tumour sample. Briefly, we used the 10,000 most variable CpGs in terms of their DNA methylation values across all samples (that is, oxBS estimates alone) and identified the optimal number of cell types to be three. We then used the RefFreeCellMix function across all 387,617&#x02009;CpGs to define sample-specific estimates of cellular proportions. Notably, the glioblastoma samples demonstrated significant proportions of two distinct putative cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref>).
