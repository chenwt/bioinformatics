The molecular processes that drive the development of ILC are still largely unknown. We have performed a comprehensive genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of a large ILC patient cohort and present here an integrated molecular portrait of ILC. Mutations in <italic>CDH1</italic> and in the PI3K pathway are the most frequent molecular alterations in ILC. We identified two main subtypes of ILCs: (i) an immune related subtype with mRNA up-regulation of <italic>PD-L1, PD-1</italic> and <italic>CTLA-4</italic> and greater sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents in representative cell line models; (ii) a hormone related subtype, associated with Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), and gain of chromosomes 1q and 8q and loss of chromosome 11q. Using the somatic mutation rate and eIF4B protein level, we identified three groups with different clinical outcomes, including a group with extremely good prognosis. We provide a comprehensive overview of the molecular alterations driving ILC and have explored links with therapy response. This molecular characterization may help to tailor treatment of ILC through the application of specific targeted, chemo- and/or immune-therapies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and has traditionally been subdivided into distinct histological subtypes based on cell morphology. About 60&#x02013;75% of breast cancers are invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The next most common subtype is invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), representing 5&#x02013;15% of all breast cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. ILC can be subdivided into five more specific histological subtypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. ILCs are typically oestrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone (PR) positive and exhibit frequent loss of expression of the cellular adhesion molecule E-cadherin (CDH1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. A subset of ILCs is HER2 positive. ILCs have very similar survival to IDCs at both five and 10 years, but despite this similar survival, the clinical course is distinct: ILCs are three times more likely to metastasize to the peritoneum, gastrointestinal tract, and ovaries and are more frequently bilateral<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, pointing towards differences in underlying biology.</p><p>Gene expression-based molecular subtypes have been used as a reference to describe breast cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Such subtypes are relatively well reflected in the immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based diagnosis used in the clinic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. However, they were mainly defined based on IDCs. Some molecular studies have been performed on ILC, using comparative genomic hybridization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> or gene expression profiling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, and more recently targeted DNA sequencing in advanced disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Two recent studies extensively characterizing large breast cancer cohorts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> contain ILCs, but are dominated by IDCs, leaving ILC largely uncharacterized<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consortium recently analysed 127 ILC tumours in comparison to 490 IDC tumours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Focusing on 106 luminal A ILC samples, they defined three subtypes termed Reactive-like, Immune-related and Proliferative. Most of their molecular analyses focused on contrasting ILC to IDC tumours.</p><p>Treatment decisions made by oncologists for breast cancer are mainly based on results obtained in large trials, in which ILCs are only a minor subgroup. It is, therefore, not always the case that the conclusions from &#x0201c;breast cancer&#x0201d; trials also apply to ILC.</p><p>As part of the Rational Therapy for Breast Cancer (RATHER) consortium (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ratherproject.com">www.ratherproject.com</ext-link>), we set out to improve the molecular characterization of ILCs by searching for potential molecular subtypes and oncogenic driver events. In addition, we aimed to understand the molecular events leading to different clinical outcomes. We collected a large cohort of 144 ILC patients with complete clinical data and long follow-up, and performed comprehensive molecular profiling of their primary tumour. The integration of multiple molecular data reveals two distinct molecular subtypes of ILC and provides new insights into the molecular factors associated with this disease.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Molecular profiling of ILCs</title><p>To explore the biology of invasive lobular carcinomas (ILCs), we performed comprehensive molecular profiling of 144 untreated tissue samples from primary ILC tumours with 6.8 years median clinical follow-up (Additional file 1) using (i) targeted DNA sequencing to study somatic variants on a set of 613 genes (518 protein kinases and 95 additional cancer genes, Additional file 2); (ii) SNP6 arrays to study somatic copy number alteration (CNA) profiles; (iii) DNA microarrays to study gene expression and (iv) reverse-phase protein arrays (RPPA) to measure the expression of 168 selected proteins and phospho-proteins (Additional file 3). For 131 samples (91% of samples profiled), we obtained DNA sequencing, CNA and gene expression data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1A</xref>), 112 of which also have RPPA data (85%). Most of the samples are ER/PR positive based on immunohistochemistry and only one sample does not show evidence of hormone receptor expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification of two subtypes of ILC</title><p>Extensive stability analysis of clustering of the gene expression data using a variety of clustering approaches identified two robust expression subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S3</xref>). Based on a gene sub-sampling analysis, we could stably classify 71% (102/144) of the samples into one of two subtypes comprising 63 and 39 samples, respectively. Among these 102 samples, 89 have mutation, CNA and gene expression data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1B</xref>) and are represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>.</p><p>Pathway analysis revealed specific biological processes associated with each subtype (Additional file 4). The first, referred to as Immune Related (IR), shows up-regulation of genes characteristic of cytokine/chemokine signalling. Representing the enriched pathways as nodes in an Enrichment Map<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, we identified a striking enrichment for chemokines, cytokines and innate immune signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). The IR subtype shows up-regulation of a range of lymphoid signalling molecules at the mRNA level (e.g. TGFBR2, IL11RA, TNFRSF17, CCL15, CCL14, CCR2, CD27, XCL2, IFNAR2, CD40LG are the 10 most up-regulated genes in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway), suggesting alterations in either the composition or functional activity of immune cells within these tumours. Interestingly, negative regulators of the immune response <italic>PDCD1</italic> (PD-1), <italic>CD274</italic> (PD-L1) and <italic>CTLA4</italic> (CTLA-4) are expressed at higher mRNA levels in the IR subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). The IR subtype is associated with METABRIC IntClust 4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, characterized by lymphocytic infiltration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref>). In addition, pathology assessment of all the slides showed that the IR subtype shows intermediate to severe lymphocytic infiltration in 78% of the samples, as compared to 55% for the other subtype (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.022, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Moreover, T-cell markers <italic>CD4</italic> and <italic>CD8A</italic> are significantly up-regulated at the mRNA level in the IR subtype, while the B-cell marker <italic>CD19</italic> does not seem to be expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>), suggesting that the immune infiltrate in the IR subtype is enriched in T-cells, which was further supported by CD4 and CD8 staining data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S4</xref>).</p><p>The second subtype, referred to as hormone related (HR) subtype, shows higher levels of oestrogen (<italic>ESR1</italic>) and progesterone (<italic>PGR</italic>) receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>) and up-regulation of cell cycle genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>) and oestrogen receptor (ER) target genes (Additional file 4, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S9</xref>). We also observed higher expression of luminal B signature genes, consistent with up-regulation of cell cycle genes. Using a set of ER-responsive genes identified in MCF-7 cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, we found that 685 of the 1902 signature genes were differentially expressed, many more than expected by chance (binomial test, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1e-6). This finding was supported by mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>) and protein epitope analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>), which confirmed higher expression of ER, PR, and phosphorylated ER (Ser118). Even though almost all tumours are ER and PR positive by IHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1E</xref>), we find a higher level of hormone receptor expression in the HR subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). In addition, GATA3, an important player in ER signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, shows up-regulation at both gene expression and protein levels in the HR subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>B). Collectively, these findings support elevated levels of hormone receptor signalling in the HR subtype.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The two ILC subtypes are validated in two independent datasets</title><p>To validate the existence of IR and HR ILC subtypes, we investigated the ILC samples of the METABRIC consortium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> and the TCGA breast cancer. Using the same clustering approach <italic>de novo</italic> on the validation gene expression data, we also identified two robust subtypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S5</xref>). We found that differential gene expression between these subtypes was correlated with differential gene expression between the IR and HR subtypes in the RATHER dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S6</xref>). Moreover, both METABRIC and TCGA subtypes displayed similar differences in biological processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S7</xref>). In particular, processes up-regulated in METABRIC subtype 1, which is most similar to the IR subtype, include cytokine receptor interaction, collagen-related processes, adhesion and extra-cellular matrix (Additional file 4). We also found negative regulators of immune response up-regulated in this subtype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S8</xref>). Cell cycle, <italic>ESR1</italic> targets and luminal B signature genes were up-regulated in METABRIC subtype 2, consistent with our findings in the HR subtype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S9</xref>).</p><p>We investigated the overlap between the IR/HR subtypes and the subtypes defined by TCGA (Reactive-like, Immune-related and Proliferative) on the TCGA and METABRIC samples. On the TCGA samples, the Reactive-like subtype is associated with the IR subtype, while Immune-related and Proliferative subtypes are associated with the HR subtype (p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1e-6). On the METABRIC samples, the subtypes do not show this association (p-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.47) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S3A</xref>). The differences could come from the fact that the TCGA subtypes were derived on luminal A ILCs specifically. However, luminal A samples were equally distributed between IR and HR subtypes and clustering only the luminal A samples, we recovered the IR and HR subtypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S4</xref>).

To identify candidate therapeutic options, we profiled a set of 15 ILC-like cell lines. Since there are relatively few good ILC breast cancer cell lines, we gathered the best available cell lines. More specifically we selected cell lines with inactivating mutations in CDH1 (E-cadherin) and CTNNA1 (&#x003b1;-catenin) resulting in inactivation of the complex these proteins belong to. We also employed gene expression profiles to verify that the cell lines resemble the subtypes and used these profiles to map the cell lines to the IR and HR subtypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S16</xref>). We then used the response data for 88 drugs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> on a subset of these cell lines to test for differential drug sensitivity between the subtypes (Additional file 8).

Next, we performed a gene set enrichment analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> to determine the biological processes associated with each factor. The first factor is associated with progesterone receptor (PR) signalling and correlates well with the PR levels in the RPPA data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>). This supports the validity of the HR subtype we identified. Not surprisingly, we find that samples in the HR subtype have higher values of this factor.

Tumours with a high number of non-silent somatic mutations were associated with poor survival (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S18</xref>), with an adjusted Hazard Ratio of 1.26 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.45). Notably, at 10 years after diagnosis, approximately 80% of the patients with low mutation rates are alive, compared to only 45% of the patients with high mutation rates. In addition, 18 proteins and phospho-proteins were found to be associated with survival (Additional file 9).

During the internal cross-validation of the different models, the same features (mutation rate and eIF4B level) were selected by the decision tree in most folds and performed well (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S20</xref>), highlighting their robustness. After adding commonly used clinical variables to the inputs, we found a similar tree with lymph node count as an additional predictive feature, which identified a few patients with a very high number of positive lymph nodes and poor survival.

We integrated genomic, proteomic, transcriptomic and clinical data for this specific subgroup of breast cancers. Unsupervised clustering of the genome-wide gene expression revealed two subtypes: an immune related subtype, characterized by lymphocytic infiltration and up-regulation of &#x0201c;checkpoint proteins&#x0201d;, and a hormone related subtype, characterized by active ER/PR signalling and EMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). Similar to the recent TCGA study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, we found that ILCs frequently carry mutations that inactivate <italic>CDH1</italic> and that activate the PI3K pathway. Thus, PI3K pathway inhibitors may represent a plausible treatment option for ILC patients. We also found low frequency mutations in a number of signalling molecules including <italic>ERBB2, MAP3K1</italic>, and <italic>MAP2K4</italic> and low frequency inactivating mutations in <italic>TP53</italic> and the transcription factor <italic>GATA3</italic>, which is critically important for ER signalling.</p><p>ILCs often show a characteristically diffuse pattern of growth and clinical samples often have a relatively low tumour content. To rule out the possibility that the two identified subgroups were consequence of different tumour cellularity, we repeated the clustering using samples with high tumour cellularity (&#x0003e;50%). This analysis robustly identified the two subtypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S7</xref>). In addition, we find that the noise level is similar in the subtypes and that we detect sizeable CNAs in both HR and IR subtypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S13</xref>). To investigate whether the tumours with high immune gene expression (as represented by CD8A expression) show low levels of GATA3, ESR1 and PGR, we scattered each of these proteins against CD8A RNAseq counts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S23</xref>). We observe both high and low protein expression at both high and low CD8A mRNA expression levels. Thus, while CD8A, ESR1, PGR and GATA3 are all individually associated with the subtypes, this association does not arise due to the different levels of immune cells in the subtypes.</p><p>The IR subtype showed high expression of numerous cytokine/chemokine signalling pathway components found in lymphoid cells, and over-expression of <italic>CD4</italic> and <italic>CD8A</italic>. In both ER-negative and ER positive/HER2 positive breast cancer, the presence of CD8+ T cells was shown to be associated with a significant reduction in the relative risk of death from disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. However, the IR tumours also had high expression of the negative regulators of immune response <italic>PDCD1</italic> (PD-1), <italic>CD274</italic> (PD-L1) and <italic>CTLA4</italic> (CTLA-4). We observed some diffuse staining in both tumour and immune cells in some of the samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S24</xref>). These IR tumours likely have an immune infiltrate and blocking these active checkpoints might reactivate the immune response. Antibodies targeting PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA4 have recently shown promise in the context of metastatic melanoma and cancers with mismatch repair deficiency and are now entering trials for breast cancer. We note that some tumours in the HR subtype show high lymphocytic infiltration and may also benefit from immune-based therapy. Interestingly, we find that cell lines representing the IR subtype show better response to DNA-damaging agents. As the limitations of cell lines as models for tumour drug response are well known, this finding requires further validation. Interaction between therapy and the immune system has been shown to result in better clinical outcome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Lymphocytic infiltration and tumour-infiltrating-lymphocytes were associated with better response to (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. This suggests that the immune component of the IR subtype could positively interact with chemotherapy and benefit the patients. Since it remains unclear which ILC patients will benefit the most from chemotherapy, this may have implications for the selection and dosing of therapy for these patients. It is tempting to speculate that the IR subtype may further benefit from combined treatment with DNA damaging agents and immunomodulatory agents.</p><p>In addition to the two ILC subtypes that we characterized, we also found associations between molecular features of ILC and clinical outcome: based on the mutation rate and eIF4B level of the tumours, we were able to distinguish three subgroups with different prognosis. Together, these characterizations may help to guide the treatment of ILC through the identification of patients that may benefit from specific targeted, chemo- and/or immune-therapies. Broader genomic profiling will be important to understand the molecular factors contributing to the high mutation rate observed in some patients.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><p>Some more details are given in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Information</xref> file and data access is provided in the Data availability section.</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>Clinical data</title><p>All patients with an ILC treated in the NKI-AVL since 1980 and in the Addenbrookes Hospital Cambridge UK since 1997 with available fresh frozen (FF) material were extracted from the hospital database. We also sourced FF tissue from adjacent matched normal tissues when available (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;55). Subsequently, we collected matched formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks for TMA construction. The NKI-AVL and Cambridge medical ethical committees approved the study and the use of anonymized archival tissue in this study. All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. For the Cambridge samples, the study was approved by &#x02018;NRES, Cambridgeshire 2 Research Ethics Committee&#x02019; (project number 07/H0308/161). Following the Dutch national guidelines on the use of left-over tissue and exceptions/clarifications in Dutch national law, the NKI-AVL ethical committee allowed performing the study without collecting informed consent, provided that patient data would be anonymized (decision letter July 29th 2010). This decision was reviewed by ethical expert Prof. Elaine Kay. Following the WHO definition of ILC, we used a morphological diagnosis to select the samples. Tumour samples were centrally revised for tumour percentage of the FF material, histological grade on FFPE and ILC sub-classification<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> on FFPE. TMAs were stained for ER, PR and HER2. Samples were defined to be ER-positive or PR-positive when 10% or more of the tumour cells showed positive staining of ER or PR respectively based on immunohistochemistry. We note that this was the standard European threshold at the time the samples were collected. Using a cut-off of 1% would change the ER and PR status of one and 12 tumours, respectively (quantitative values are available in the data availability section). One sample (not in the subtypes) was HER2 positive (intensity of 3) and four samples (2 in IR, 2 in HR) were uncertain (intensity ~2). For survival analysis, we considered only breast cancer specific survival, due to the presence of competing events and (distant) recurrence free survival. For patient stratification in Kaplan-Meier plots, we used Kaplan-Meier estimator and calculated p-values with the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression model was stratified by biobank and, unless otherwise specified, fitted with commonly used clinical variables: tumour size, grade, number of positive lymph nodes, treatment and age at diagnosis. Association of a variable with survival was tested with a likelihood-ratio test comparing a model including clinical variables over a model including clinical variables and the variable tested.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays</title><p>As presented earlier<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, each sample was preprocessed using the PennCNV pipeline for Affymetrix arrays<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>.

Performance of the tree was assessed by partial likelihood deviance based on leave-one-out cross-validation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S20</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Data availability</title><p>Public data access to the raw data is available with the following DOIs:<list id="l1" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Clinical data: <list id="l2" list-type="order"><list-item><p><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1301848">http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1301848</ext-link></p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p>Immunohistochemistry data: <list id="l3" list-type="order"><list-item><p><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1360201">http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1360201</ext-link></p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p>Variants data:<list id="l4" list-type="order"><list-item><p><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1373846">http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1373846</ext-link></p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p>Copy number data: <list id="l5" list-type="order"><list-item><p><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1314577">http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1314577</ext-link></p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p>Gene expression data:<list id="l6" list-type="order"><list-item><p>Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession GSE68057</p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="NCBI:geo" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68057">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68057</ext-link></p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p>RPPA data:<list id="l7" list-type="order"><list-item><p>Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession GSE66647</p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="NCBI:geo" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66647">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66647</ext-link></p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Michaut, M. <italic>et al.</italic> Integration of genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data identifies two biologically distinct subtypes of invasive lobular breast cancer. <italic>Sci.
