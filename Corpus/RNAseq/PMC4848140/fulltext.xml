Here, we generated a genome for <italic>Miniopterus natalensis</italic> and performed RNA-seq and ChIP-seq (H3K27ac, H3K27me3) on its developing forelimb and hindlimb autopods at sequential embryonic stages to decipher the molecular events that underlie bat wing development. Over 7,000 genes and several lncRNAs, including <italic>Tbx5-as1</italic> and <italic>Hottip</italic>, were differentially expressed between forelimb, hindlimb and different stages. ChIP-seq identified thousands of regions that are differentially modified in forelimb versus hindlimb. Comparative genomics found 2,796 bat-accelerated regions within H3K27ac peaks, several of which cluster near limb-associated genes. Pathway analyses revealed multiple ribosomal proteins and known limb patterning signaling pathways as differentially regulated, and implicated increased forelimb mesenchymal condensations with differential growth. Combined, our work outlines multiple genetic components that contribute to bat wing formation, providing a genomic blueprint for this morphological innovation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The order Chiroptera, commonly known as bats, is the only group of mammals to have evolved the capability of flight. They are estimated to have diverged from their arboreal ancestors ~51 million years ago<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Their adaptions for flight include a radical specialization of the forelimb, characterized by the dramatic extension of digits II to V, a decline in wing bone mineralization along the proximodistal axis, and the retention and expansion of interdigital webbing which is controlled by a novel complex of muscles<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Bat hindlimbs are comparatively short, with free symmetrical digits, providing an informative contrast that can be used to highlight genetic processes involved in bat wing formation. Previous studies that examined gene expression in developing bat forelimbs and hindlimbs reported differential expression of several genes, such as <italic>Tbx3</italic>, <italic>Brinp3, Meis2</italic>, the 5&#x02032; <italic>HoxD</italic> genes and members of the Shh-Fgf signaling loop, suggesting that multiple genes and processes are involved in generating these morphological innovations<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Gene regulatory elements are thought to be important drivers of these changes; for example, the replacement of the mouse <italic>Prx1</italic> limb enhancer with the equivalent bat sequence resulted in elongated forelimbs<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. However, an integrated understanding of how changes in regulatory elements, various genes and signaling pathways combine to collectively shape the bat wing remains largely unknown.</p><p id="P3">To characterize the genetic differences that underlie the divergence of bat forelimb and hindlimb development, we used a comprehensive genome-wide strategy. We generated a <italic>de novo</italic> whole-genome assembly for the vesper bat, <italic>Miniopterus natalensis</italic>, which has a well characterized stage-by-stage morphological comparison between developing bat and mouse limbs<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. In this species, the developing forelimb noticeably diverges from the hindlimb from stages CS15 and CS16 with strong morphological differences seen at a subsequent stage, CS17<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. This developmental window is equivalent to embryonic day (E) 12.0 to E13.5 in the mouse<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. <italic>M. natalensis</italic> embryos were obtained and transcriptome (RNA-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) for both an active H3K27ac<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and a repressive H3K27me3<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> mark were generated for these three developmental stages (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The <italic>Miniopterus natalensis</italic> genome</title><p id="P4">High-coverage genomes for three bat species (<italic>Pteropus alecto</italic><sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, <italic>Myotis davidii</italic><sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>

However, the evolutionary distance of these species from <italic>M. natalensis</italic> (43 million years since the last common ancestor) precludes their use in RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data analyses. We thus generated a draft genome from an adult <italic>M. natalensis</italic> male at 77X coverage, named Mnat.v1. The quality of Mnat.v1 is comparable to the high coverage bat genomes (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). It has an estimated heterozygosity level of 0.13%, with repetitive regions making up 33% of the genome. We annotated 24,239 genes (this includes protein coding genes and long noncoding RNAs) in Mnat.v1. Of the highly conserved genes used by the Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach (CEGMA)<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, 92.7% were found in their entirety with an additional 3.3% partially detected, further confirming Mnat.v1 to be a reliable substrate for subsequent genomic analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Differentially expressed limb transcripts</title><p id="P5">To identify the gene expression differences that could be involved in the morphological divergence of bat limb development, we examined the transcriptomes of whole autopod tissue from the forelimbs and hindlimbs of three sequential developmental stages (CS15, CS16, and CS17). Principle component analysis (PCA) showed an expected segregation pattern, with component one reflecting the developmental stage and component two the tissue type (forelimb or hindlimb; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). We found 2,952 genes differentially expressed between forelimbs and hindlimbs and 5,164 genes differentially expressed between any two sequential stages (adjusted p-value &#x02264; 0.01; see methods). Pairwise tests for differential expression directly comparing the forelimb and hindlimb at each stage (i.e. CS15 FL vs CS15 HL) contributed an additional 1,596 genes. Combined, these analyses identified 7,172 differentially expressed genes (adjusted p-value &#x02264; 0.01; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>; <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Differentially expressed genes were grouped by their expression profile across the samples, into 38 manually defined clusters using hierarchical clustering (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). These clusters were functionally annotated revealing several terms to be correlated with their differential expression (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>; <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Grouping the top differentially expressed genes based on biological functions of interest (e.g. DNA binding and transcriptional regulation, limb morphogenesis, bone morphogenesis, apoptotic process and others) identified both genes with known roles in limb development and potentially novel functions in bat wing development (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). For example, genes differentially expressed between forelimbs and hindlimbs involved in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation included <italic>Hoxd10</italic>, <italic>Hoxd11</italic>, <italic>Meis2</italic>, <italic>Pitx1</italic>, <italic>Tbx4</italic> and <italic>Tbx5</italic>; all genes that were previously shown to be differentially expressed in bats<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> along with several genes showing higher forelimb expression that have not yet been characterized (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). We also observed hindlimb-specific increased expression for several genes notably <italic>Msx1</italic> and <italic>Msx2</italic>, both key genes involved in apoptotic activity during interdigital tissue regression<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">A limited number of differentially expressed genes of interest were characterized in both mouse and bat embryos using whole mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (WISH) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Among these, <italic>Mllt3</italic> was chosen for its strong forelimb expression at CS15 and CS16 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>) and was found to be uniquely expressed in bat forelimbs in a region restricted to the distal edge where digits III&#x02013;V are slated to develop (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). <italic>Mllt3</italic> is thought to be a <italic>Hox</italic> gene regulator, with <italic>Mllt3</italic>-null mouse mutants exhibiting axial defects<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, however no gross skeletal limb abnormalities were observed in homozygous knockout mice (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>; see methods). <italic>Lhx8</italic>, a known regulator of neuronal development<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, had higher expression in CS16 and CS17 forelimbs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). WISH analysis showed localized <italic>Lhx8</italic> expression in the posterior portion of the wrist region, specifically in the junction between the base of digit V and the plagiopatagium, while no expression was detected in mouse limbs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). Together, these experiments support our RNA-seq analyses and highlight genes that have previously uncharacterized roles in limb development.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Bat-specific lncRNAs</title><p id="P8">Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to be important developmental regulators in several tissues including the limb<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. To identify potential lncRNAs associated with bat limb development, we annotated transcripts that did not show similarity to known protein-coding genes, identifying 227 potential lncRNAs (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Amongst these, 188 exhibited some sequence conservation across mammals, 12 of which were similar to characterized lncRNAs in lncRNAdb v2.0<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Five putative lncRNAs were identified as being conserved only in bats and 34 were only present in <italic>M. natalensis</italic>. Within this dataset, 8 known lncRNAs showed differential expression between forelimbs and hindlimbs, including <italic>Hottip</italic> and an uncharacterized lncRNA, <italic>Tbx5-as1</italic> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). <italic>Hottip</italic> is thought to be required for the activation of <italic>5</italic>&#x02032; <italic>HoxA</italic> genes, important regulators of autopod patterning during limb development<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Both <italic>Hottip</italic> and <italic>HoxA13</italic> showed elevated hindlimb expression in all three stages examined (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). A comparison of their expression patterns revealed both to be more strongly expressed in the interdigital tissue of the bat hindlimb. While <italic>Hottip</italic> expression was concentrated in the distal interdigital tissue, <italic>HoxA13</italic> was more apparent in the digit tips (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). The bat <italic>Tbx5-as1</italic> transcript maps close to <italic>Tbx5</italic> (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>), in an antisense direction and shares similarity with human <italic>Tbx5 antisense RNA1-as1</italic> transcript (Genbank NR_038440). <italic>Tbx5-as1</italic> was the most differentially expressed lncRNA, with elevated expression in the forelimb relative to hindlimb across all stages (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). While its role is unknown, its associated gene <italic>Tbx5</italic>, is required for forelimb bud initiation with its inactivation in mice abolishing forelimb skeletal formation<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. In support of a coupled activity for these transcripts, the expression patterns of <italic>Tbx5</italic> and <italic>Tbx5-as1</italic> were similar, being restricted to the base of digits I to V at CS16L and CS17, with clear expression in the proximal inter-digital tissue (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d,e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>ChIP-seq reveals forelimb regulatory regions</title><p id="P9">Changes in gene regulatory elements have been shown to be important drivers of morphological adaptations<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, including the bat wing<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. To identify regulatory elements that could be involved in controlling gene expression in developing bat limbs, we performed low-cell ChIP-seq using antibodies for both H3K27ac (active regions<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>) and H3K27me3 (repressed regions<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>) on autopods from CS15, CS16 and CS17 forelimbs and hindlimbs, identifying numerous putative regulatory regions (<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Using the Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>), after converting peaks to the mouse genome, we found significant enrichment for several limb development associated categories for the H3K27ac peaks in GO morphological process, mouse phenotypes and MGI expression (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). To further validate our ChIP-seq results, we also examined gene loci known to be specifically expressed in the forelimb (<italic>Tbx5</italic>) or hindlimb (<italic>Pitx1</italic>) and observed a correspondence with H3K27ac and H3K27me3 peak presence and RNA expression (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a,b</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We next set out to analyze differences between forelimb and hindlimb active and repressed ChIP-seq peaks. Differential enrichment analysis was carried out on H3K27ac or H3K27me3 separately identifying 14,553 and 19,352 differentially enriched regions for each mark, respectively (pairwise FDR&#x02264;0.05; see methods; <xref rid="SD7" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). Of these, 2,475 were differentially enriched between forelimbs and hindlimbs for both H3K27ac and H3K27me3 marks. These regions were analyzed using hierarchical clustering based on H3K27ac and H3K27me3 enrichment (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>), finding 17 manually defined clusters with distinct H3K27ac and H3K27me3 enrichment patterns (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). GO term enrichment analysis of the nearest gene showed a strong enrichment for terms associated with limb development. For example, cluster 9 showed an increase in H3K27ac in forelimbs and H3K27me3 in hindlimbs while cluster 11 showed the opposite effect. The regulatory marks of both clusters had a general correspondence with RNA-seq expression levels of the neighboring genes and included fitting GO biological term enrichment for developmental processes (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>; <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Bat accelerated regions</title><p id="P11">To identify genomic changes that may be associated with the innovation of the bat wing, we utilized a comparative genomics approach<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> that leveraged the growing number of bat genomes<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Whole-genome alignments were generated using repeat masked genomes of eighteen other species, including six bats, nine non-bat mammals and three non-mammal vertebrates. We next used phyloP<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> to test for accelerated sequences in the common ancestor of the bat lineage in conserved vertebrate sequences that were marked by H3K27ac in all ChIP-seq experiments. This analysis identified 2,796 bat accelerated regions (BARs; FDR &#x02264; 0.05) with an average size of 240 bp (<xref rid="SD9" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). Genomic regions overrepresented for BARs were identified by comparing to vertebrate conserved regions overlapping H3K27ac. Genes contained within these regions were subject to functional annotation clustering, revealing enrichment for categories relating to transcription factors, chromatin conformation and DNA-binding (FDR&#x02264;0.05; <xref rid="SD9" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 8</xref>).

Overall, we found that multiple genetic components are likely to contribute to the development of the bat wing. These include numerous gene expression changes, both in known limb developmental regulators and newly characterized ones, such as <italic>Mllt3</italic> and <italic>Lhx8</italic>. lncRNAs could also have a strong influence on wing development, with observed forelimb/hindlimb expression differences for <italic>Hottip</italic> and <italic>Tbx5-as1</italic>, an uncharacterized lncRNA. A combined pathway analysis found numerous signaling pathways to be differentially activated. These include ribosomal proteins, whose alteration has been shown to result in limb malformations<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Suppression of the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway in the forelimb is consistent with the condensation of larger fields of digit mesenchymal cells in the developing bat wing. In contrast, Wnt-PCP signaling, which maintains the polarity of proliferating chondrocytes in the growth plate, was more active in the forelimb (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>) and may set the foundation for extended digit growth. Interestingly, the BMP signaling pathway showed two distinct phases with the inhibitors <italic>Gremlin</italic> and <italic>Bmp3</italic> expressed at high levels early in the hindlimb and at later stages in the forelimb with different tissue and temporal identity of BMP activators, fitting with its diverse roles in chondrogenesis, osteogenesis and apoptosis. Combined, the differential activation of these pathways is consistent with the changes in expression of key genes in long bone development, including enhanced expression of chondrogenic markers (e.g. <italic>Sox6</italic>, <italic>Aggrecan</italic>, <italic>Mmp9</italic>) across CS15-CS17 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>).

As bats are not currently amenable to transgenic experimentation, future functional characterization of the genes, lncRNAs and regulatory elements identified here could be performed in the mouse, with the potential to further our understanding of their functional importance in the limb.

Sections were incubated with 100 &#x003bc;g/ml FITC-conjugated PNA (Sigma L7381) in 3% BSA/PBS at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. Control slides were incubated in 3% BSA/PBS only. All slides were washed in PBS, stained for 10 minutes in 1 &#x003bc;g/ml Hoechst nuclear stain, before another three PBS washes. ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Life Technologies) was used to mount coverslips. Sections were photographed on a Nikon Ti-E inverted fluorescent microscope using the same standardized camera setting for all sections.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S20"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS766301-supplement-1.doc" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e1477" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>10</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS766301-supplement-10.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e1481" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>2</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS766301-supplement-2.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e1485" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>3</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS766301-supplement-3.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e1489" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>4</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS766301-supplement-4.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e1493" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>5</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS766301-supplement-5.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e1497" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>6</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS766301-supplement-6.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e1501" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD8"><label>7</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS766301-supplement-7.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e1505" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD9"><label>8</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS766301-supplement-8.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e1509" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD10"><label>9</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS766301-supplement-9.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e1513" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><p>We thank the Broad Institute Genomics Platform, Vertebrate Genome Biology group and Kerstin Lindblad-Toh for making the data for <italic>Eptesicus fuscus</italic> available.

RNA-seq and ChIP-seq tracks are represented as forelimb (FL) coverage minus hindlimb (HL) coverage in 100 bp intervals for each stage. For RNA-seq, intervals with FL minus HL expression &#x0003e;0 are shown in dark blue and &#x0003c;0 in light blue. Likewise, for ChIP-seq, intervals with FL minus HL enrichment are colored in dark green (H3K27ac) or dark red (H3K27me3) and &#x0003c;0 in light green (H3K27ac) or light red (H3K27me3). (<bold>c</bold>) Heat map of H3K27ac (green) and H3K27me3 (red) enrichment scores, including a dendrogram of region-wise hierarchical clustering. The heat map shows all regions with differential enrichment between forelimbs and hindlimbs in both marks in at least two stages per mark (2,475 such regions at adjusted p-value &#x02264; 0.05). The Z-score is the mean subtracted log<sub>2</sub> of the signal-to-noise normalized enrichment score plus one. The hierarchical clusters of the regions were segregated into 17 separate clusters; two such clusters are shown as examples, cluster 11 (purple; N=258 peaks) with higher hindlimb H3K27ac and H3K27me3 forelimb and cluster 9 (light blue; N=108 peaks) with higher forelimb H3K27ac and H3K27me3 hindlimb.
