We characterized the features of mammalian tissue transcriptomes at the gene level through analysis of RNA deep sequencing (RNA-Seq) data across human and mouse tissues and cell lines. We observed that roughly 8,000 protein-coding genes were ubiquitously expressed, contributing to around 75&#x00025; of all mRNAs by message copy number in most tissues. These mRNAs encoded proteins that were often intracellular, and tended to be involved in metabolism, transcription, RNA processing or translation. In contrast, genes for secreted or plasma membrane proteins were generally expressed in only a subset of tissues. The distribution of expression levels was broad but fairly continuous: no support was found for the concept of distinct expression classes of genes. Expression estimates that included reads mapping to coding exons only correlated better with qRT-PCR data than estimates which also included 3&#x02032; untranslated regions (UTRs). Muscle and liver had the least complex transcriptomes, in that they expressed predominantly ubiquitous genes and a large fraction of the transcripts came from a few highly expressed genes, whereas brain, kidney and testis expressed more complex transcriptomes with the vast majority of genes expressed and relatively small contributions from the most expressed genes. mRNAs expressed in brain had unusually long 3&#x02032;UTRs, and mean 3&#x02032;UTR length was higher for genes involved in development, morphogenesis and signal transduction, suggesting added complexity of UTR-based regulation for these genes. Our results support a model in which variable exterior components feed into a large, densely connected core composed of ubiquitously expressed intracellular proteins.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>A variety of genes are active within the nuclei of our cells. Some are needed for the day-to-day maintenance of cell functions, while others have roles that are more specific to certain tissues or particular cell types; for example, only the pancreas produces insulin. As a result, every tissue has its own profile of gene activity. Since active genes produce RNA, tissue differences in gene activity can be probed by characterizing the RNA they contain. Essentially the entire set of RNAs or &#x02018;transcriptome&#x02019; has been sequenced from various tissues, and we used these data to compare the degree of specialization of different tissues and to investigate the set of &#x02018;core&#x02019; genes active in every tissue. A central observation was that there are an abundance of such core genes, and that these genes account for the majority of the transcriptome in each tissue. These findings will aid in the understanding of what makes tissues, and cell types, different from each other and what each requires to function.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>A fundamental question in molecular biology is how cells and tissues differ in gene expression and how those differences specify biological function. A related question is what part of the cellular machinery represents housekeeping functions needed by all cells and how many genes encode such functions. The transcriptomes of mammalian tissues have been extensively studied using methods such as reassociation kinetics (Rot) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Bishop1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Velculescu1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, microarrays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Schena1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Lipshutz1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, and sequencing of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and full length transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Kawai1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Reassociation kinetics was used early on to study and compare global properties of tissue transcriptomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Bishop1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Hastie1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. From those studies it was concluded that &#x0223c;20,000 mRNAs are expressed in each cell or tissue, and that roughly 90&#x00025; of all mRNAs are common between two tissues, drawing the first conclusions on tissue transcriptome compositions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Sagerstrm1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Later studies of tissue transcriptomes using SAGE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Velculescu2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> identified &#x0223c;1,000 ubiquitously expressed genes (i.e. expressed in all cell types examined) and concluded that tissue-specific transcripts make up roughly 1&#x00025; of mRNA mass of cells. Focusing on colorectal cancer cell lines, for which the deepest coverage was available, it was estimated that half of all mRNA transcripts in these cells came from the 623 most highly expressed genes. Comparing mRNA expression levels across panels of human and mouse tissues by microarrays, Su and coworkers identified tissue-specific genes for each tissue, and estimated that &#x0223c;6&#x00025; of genes were ubiquitously expressed, and that individual tissues express 30&#x02013;40&#x00025; of all genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Su1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Using additional microarray data, expression of &#x0223c;8,000 genes was detected in each tissue but as few as 1&#x02013;3&#x00025; of these were detected in all tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Su2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Similar conclusions were drawn from a second mouse tissue atlas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Zhang1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> that identified &#x0223c;1,800 genes as ubiquitously expressed. Altogether, microarrays and SAGE have been quite successful in identifying tissue and cell specific genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Velculescu2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Doyle1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the discrepancy between estimates of the composition and characteristics of tissue transcriptomes obtained by microarray and SAGE methods on the one hand and reassociation kinetics studies on the other has not been explained.</p><p>Deep sequencing of RNAs (RNA-Seq) has recently been used to quantify gene and alternative isoform expression levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Mortazavi1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Sultan1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In RNA-Seq, all RNAs of a sample (or, more often, polyA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNAs) are randomly fragmented, reverse transcribed, ligated to adapters and then these fragments are sequenced. Gene expression levels can then be estimated from the number of sequence reads deriving from each gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Wang2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Expression estimates from RNA-Seq are quantitative over five orders of magnitude and replicates of mouse tissues are highly reproducible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Mortazavi1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Compared to microarrays, RNA-Seq is more sensitive, both in terms of detection of lowly expressed and differentially expressed genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Wang2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Marioni1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, and expression values from RNA-Seq correlate better with protein levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Fu1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. The greater accuracy and coverage of the expressed transcriptome makes this method suitable for addressing global features of transcriptomes.</p><p>We recently studied alternative isoform expressions across tissues using RNA-Seq and found both a very high frequency of alternative splicing and extensive tissue regulation of the expression of alternative mRNA isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Wang1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we instead focused on a gene-centric analysis of transcript composition and complexity. The highly quantitative nature of RNA-Seq has motivated us to revisit the longstanding questions regarding the composition of tissue transcriptomes, as well as the expression of long non-coding RNAs, the variability in 3&#x02032;UTR length, and the association between these features and gene function.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Excluding 3&#x02032; UTR reads yields more accurate gene expression estimates</title><p>We investigated the transcriptomes of a diverse collection of human and mouse tissues and five breast and breast cancer cell lines that were recently sequenced at a depth of roughly 20 million short reads per sample using RNA-Seq protocols (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000598.s001">Table S1</xref>). Gene expression was initially estimated by calculating read density as &#x02018;reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads&#x02019; (RPKM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Mortazavi1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. These estimates are typically performed using common gene annotations (e.g., RefSeq) with the entire annotated transcript representing the &#x02018;exon model&#x02019;. These expression level estimates may however be confounded by the expression of shorter isoforms due to alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000598.s002">Figure S1A and S1B</xref>). We found that excluding annotated 3&#x02032;UTRs &#x02013; which will sometimes vary between mRNA isoforms as a result of alternative cleavage and polyadenylation &#x02013; enabled estimation of expression levels that correspond more closely with quantitative RT-PCR measurements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000598.s002">Figure S1C</xref>). We noted that removing the 3&#x02032;UTR from calculation of gene expression yields a &#x0003e;2-fold change for over one thousand genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000598.s002">Figure S1D</xref>), and that the effect of 3&#x02032;UTRs on expression estimates does not seem to be a technical issue caused by secondary structure in the 3&#x02032;UTR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000598.s003">Figure S2</xref>). We therefore advocate excluding UTRs from such estimates, and all subsequent gene expression estimates described here excluded 3&#x02032;UTR regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Ubiquitous expression of &#x0223c;8,000 human genes</title><p>We next sought to answer how many genes are expressed in a tissue or cell type. A comparison between the expression levels of exons and intergenic regions was used to first find a threshold for detectable expression above background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000598-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, algorithm in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000598.s004">Figure S3</xref>), yielding a threshold RPKM value of 0.3 which balances the numbers of false positives and false negatives. For individual samples, we obtained threshold values between 0.2 and 0.8. As it is difficult to identify untranscribed DNA regions with confidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Birney1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Guttman1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, it is very possible that the background was overestimated. Applying the threshold 0.3 RPKM, the number of genes expressed in most human and mouse tissues varied from 11,000 to 13,000, corresponding to roughly 60&#x02013;70&#x00025; of RefSeq protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000598-t001">Table 1</xref>). These gene number estimates were stable across different sequencing depths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000598-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and therefore represent bona fide tissue differences. Testis was a clear outlier, expressing more than 15,000 different genes (84&#x00025; of RefSeq genes). As many as 7,897 genes (42&#x00025;) were observed to be expressed in all tissues and cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000598.s008">Dataset S1</xref>). The corresponding number for Ensembl annotation was 8,214, or 38&#x00025; of protein-coding genes (Ensembl is an automated gene annotation system, whereas RefSeq is manually curated). Each ubiquitous gene was typically expressed at roughly the same order of magnitude in all tissues, suggesting that there were few problems with genes being considered ubiquitous when they were really specific to one or a few tissues but had a leaky, non-functional expression elsewhere (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000598.s005">Figure S4</xref>). While we observed small numbers of reads for 8 genes known to have leaky transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Chelly1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Sarkar1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> in several tissues, these genes were all too weakly or narrowly transcribed outside their main tissue to be detected as ubiquitous. The estimated number of ubiquitously expressed genes appeared to plateau as the number of samples used was increased to the full set of 24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000598-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The detection threshold used affects the number of genes detected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000598-t001">Table 1</xref>), and the number of detected ubiquitous genes can vary by up to &#x0223c;2,000 genes depending on threshold used. The number of samples is large enough that background is unlikely to cause relatively tissue-specific genes to be detected in every sample. These differences between thresholds therefore most likely reflect the presence of low-abundance RNA species. The number of ubiquitous genes we detected is much greater than the &#x0223c;1,000 shared genes identified by SAGE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Velculescu2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> and the 1&#x02013;6&#x00025; of genes from microarrays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Su1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Zhang1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, but is in relatively good agreement with the &#x0223c;10,000 shared genes estimated by reassociation kinetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Hastie1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> and the 3,140 to 6,909 estimated from ESTs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Zhu1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> (the higher number came from a cutoff of presence in 16 out of 18 tissues, used to remedy uneven EST sequencing across tissues). The increased number of ubiquitously expressed genes compared to SAGE and microarrays most likely results from the increased depth of mRNA-Seq data and improved detection of lowly expressed genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Chelly1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. The number of genes expressed in a tissue ranged from 11,199 to 15,518 genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000598-t002">Table 2</xref>), so a majority of the genes expressed in a specific tissue or cell type are ubiquitously expressed genes.

genes we had identified, we looked for functional enrichment compared to genes expressed only in a subset of the tissues analyzed (hereafter called non-ubiquitous). The protein products of human ubiquitously expressed genes were more likely to have intracellular localization and to be involved in metabolism and other core cellular functions such as macromolecule synthesis, general transcription and vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000598-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Genes that were expressed in only one or a few tissues were more often secreted or membrane-bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000598-g001">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000598.s009">Dataset S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000598.s010">S3</xref>), suggesting that cellular contacts and communication are mediated more often by specialized tissue-specific components. Interestingly, an exception to this inside-outside rule was sequence-specific DNA binding proteins, which are nuclear yet seldom ubiquitously expressed. Among these transcription factors we found that POU, homeobox and forkhead genes had the fewest ubiquitously expressed members, consistent with roles in specifying cell and tissue identity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Briscoe1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas e.g. basic-leucine zipper factors were more often ubiquitous (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000598-t004">Table 4</xref>). Functional characterization of housekeeping genes has been done in the past <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Lehner1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Freilich1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> (and indirectly by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-CohenGihon1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>), with comparable results, although transporters were found to be relatively tissue-specific in one study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Lehner1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Rather than looking at ubiquitous expression, that study compared the mean number of tissues where the genes were expressed, which could explain the difference. Ubiquitous genes often had CpG islands near their promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000598-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), as has been observed previously for ubiquitous and developmental genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Mikkelsen1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. The set of ubiquitous genes with CpG-poor promoters were not enriched for any GO category compared to all ubiquitous genes, nor were those with CpG-rich promoters. These observations suggest that ubiquitous expression is a better indicator of housekeeping functions than promoter CpG content. Together, these analyses suggest that much of the internal cytoplasmic machinery and most nuclear functions are common to most or all tissues, and that a large portion of the differences between tissues lie primarily in expression of receptors and ligands that mediate communication, and in a subset of sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factors.</p><table-wrap id="pcbi-1000598-t004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000598.t004</object-id><label>Table 4</label><caption><title>Expression of sequence-specific transcription factors.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi-1000598-t004-4" xlink:href="pcbi.1000598.t004"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Transcription factor classification</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of genes</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fraction non-ubiquitous</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">POU</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.93</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Homedomain</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">239</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.89</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Forkhead</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">41</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.78</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ETS</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.71</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Helix-loop-helix</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">86</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.67</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">p53 family</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">42</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.67</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Other</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">152</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.66</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nuclear hormone receptor</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">47</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.66</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Zinc finger, C2H2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">623</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.61</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">High mobility group</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">39</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.59</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">IPT/TIG<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt112">1</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.47</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Basic-leucine zipper</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.42</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt112"><label>1</label><p>IPT: Immunoglobin-like fold shared by Plexins and Transcription factors; TIG: Transcription factor ImmunoGlobin.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Estimating the fraction of the transcriptome devoted to specific functions</title><p>As RNA-Seq expression measurements are highly quantitative, we also explored tissue transcriptome composition in terms of mRNA abundance classes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Bishop1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> and the extent to which mRNA populations are dominated by a few highly expressed genes.

Other tissue transcriptomes were more complex, with the ten most highly expressed genes contributing only 5&#x02013;10&#x00025; of the mRNAs in brain, kidney and testis. The remaining tissues had intermediate levels of complexity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000598-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The breast cancer cell lines had similar or greater complexity than normal breast tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000598-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Biological replicates in both human and mouse tended to have highly similar complexity distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000598-g002">Figure 2C, 2D</xref>). Mouse tissues had somewhat similar profiles to corresponding human tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000598-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), although a much higher expression of several acute-phase genes in both human liver samples shifted their curves toward lower complexity compared to mouse liver. We conclude that kidney, testes and brain tissues have more complex transcriptomes due to the expression of more genes and with less dominance of a few highly expressed genes, whereas liver and muscle tissues are the least complex and express fewer genes, with more dramatic contributions of highly expressed genes.</p><p>We next asked what fractions of total cellular mRNA are allocated to genes involved in different biological processes across the different tissues and cell lines. For this purpose, we developed a tool called FRACT (<underline>F</underline>unctional <underline>R</underline>elative <underline>A</underline>llo<underline>c</underline>ation of <underline>T</underline>ranscripts) that assesses relative gene expression from RNA-Seq read density for arbitrary sets of genes or broad gene ontology (GO) categories (results for a subset of tissues are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000598-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). This analysis provided a perspective on the functional priorities of cells in each tissue, since allocating a large fraction of the polyA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNA content in a cell (and likely of translational capacity) to one functional category represents a major investment of cellular resources. For some categories, including &#x02018;metabolic process&#x02019;, &#x02018;transport&#x02019;, and also &#x02018;regulation of cell proliferation&#x02019;, FRACT allocation varied relatively little across the tissues and cell lines (as measured by the coefficient of variation, CV, of the transcriptome fraction), consistent with the expected &#x02018;housekeeping&#x02019; functions of these gene categories. Other categories had a far higher fraction of transcripts allocated to them in one tissue than in others, e.g. immune response (high in lymph node), muscle contraction, heart development and electron transport (all high in heart), and signal transduction and G protein-coupled receptor signaling (both high in brain). These examples, representing more specialized activities expected to be of increased importance in the corresponding tissues, provided a molecular-level validation of the integrity of the tissue samples and protocol used. In some cases, differences not readily apparent from the broad GO categorization shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000598-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, could be detected by finer sub-classification of categories &#x02013; an example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000598-g003">Figure 3B</xref>.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000598-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000598.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>FRACT analysis of tissue transcriptomes.</title><p>(A) Pie graphs show estimated fraction of cellular transcripts deriving from genes belonging to a set of top-level Gene Ontology Biological Process categories for 7 human tissues and 1 cell line.

When different tissues were compared (e.g. human brain vs. mouse muscle) substantially weaker correlations were observed (Pearson correlations in the range 0.47 to 0.61).

Weighting each gene by the expression level to obtain length estimates for the bulk mRNA population in tissues to obtain the average mRNA length in each tissue, we found that brain mRNAs have longer 3&#x02032;UTRs on average than liver and muscle mRNAs, by 300&#x02013;400 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000598-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><fig id="pcbi-1000598-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000598.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Variation in tissue transcriptome structures.</title><p>(A) Read density in RefSeq gene annotation in the untranslated regions (UTRs) divided by that in the coding region (CDS) for the samples with least 3&#x02032; bias (mouse brain, muscle, embryonic stem cell and embryoid body; human adipose tissue and heart).

Transcripts coding for proteins involved in metabolism and RNA processing had the shortest UTRs (medians below 500 bp), while the longest median UTR lengths were observed in transcripts encoding proteins involved in development, morphogenesis and signal transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000598-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). The median lengths in the longest categories ranged between 1000 and 1500 nt, i.e. two- to three-fold longer than for typical metabolism- or RNA processing-associated transcripts. Some of these differences might reflect an increased role for 3&#x02032;UTR sequences in localization of proteins to specific membrane locations, likely to be more common for proteins involved in signal transduction and morphogenesis than for metabolic or RNA processing-associated proteins, which are typically cytoplasmic or nuclear, respectively. These differences could also reflect differences in the complexity of translational regulation among these classes of genes.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000598-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000598.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Associations between UTR lengths and protein functions.</title><p>(A) The length distribution of 3&#x02032;UTRs for genes in categories with the shortest respectively longest UTRs.

This pattern suggests that tissue identity derives less from expression of distinct sets of genes in different tissues than was previously thought. Ubiquitous genes can still vary in relative expression levels between tissues however, and in expression of alternative mRNA isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Wang1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Although a still limited set of tissue and cell lines was available for this meta-analysis (24 in total), the observation appears robust to inclusion of additional tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000598-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Many genes had a low and rather constant expression across tissues. This could mean our expression detection was affected by subpopulations of cells, limiting the extent our conclusions can be extrapolated to single cells, but it could also indicate the existence of a large population of lowly but universally expressed genes. One subpopulation that could potentially impact these estimates would be organism-wide cell types. For example, blood-related cells may be found in all vascularized tissues and genes specific to these cells may be detected as ubiquitous. Our study limited this effect by requiring ubiquitous genes to also be detected in cell lines. Future analyses of pure cell populations could definitely assess the contributions of common cell types. When single-cell transcriptomes (like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Tang1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>) are available for multiple cell types, it will be possible to identify the core set of genes expressed in every mammalian cell. Still, our analyses of tissue transcriptomes points to a higher number of core genes even in individual cells than previously inferred.</p><p>Transcriptome complexity varied substantially across tissues, with brain, kidney and testis having higher complexity in that they expressed more genes and had more diverse mRNA populations. This increased transcriptome complexity may stem from the presence of more heterogeneous cell types in brain and testis or from a need for more diverse protein repertoires. The lower complexity observed in liver, muscle and heart presumably reflects more specialized functions of these tissues. Our FRACT analysis estimated the fraction of mRNA populations devoted to biological processes that are more specific for muscle and liver cells, such as muscle contraction, metabolism, electron transport and acute-phase response. At this point we have only static pictures of the functional allocation of mRNA resources across tissues and cell lines. Following the dynamic regulation of mRNA allocations during developmental or disease progression would therefore be of great interest, and might lead to robust gene expression signatures that are diagnostic of cellular state.</p><p>Many studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Carninci1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Nygaard1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>) cite the existence of three distinct abundance classes of mRNAs, originally observed by reassociation kinetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Bishop1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Hastie1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Sagerstrm1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>). Although we detected mRNA expression levels that varied across several orders of magnitude, we observed no separation of mRNAs into distinct expression level classes, instead finding a continuum of expression levels. Similarly, no separation into distinct expression classes was observed in SAGE data (Figure 4 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Hanriot1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>), although the authors discussed the larger impact of sequencing errors.

The short read sequencing data allowed us to estimate the average lengths of transcripts in different tissues and we found that brain expressed mRNAs with 3&#x02032;UTRs 300&#x02013;400 bp longer on average than in other tissues. An important factor seems to be the brain-specific expression of genes with long 3&#x02032;UTRs (data not shown). Perhaps this is required in a tissue where many mRNAs are transported far away from the nuclei, or the variety among neurons requires a large regulatory capacity housed in the UTRs. Interestingly, transcripts coding for specific protein functions seem to require longer 3&#x02032;UTRs and 5&#x02032;UTRs, including proteins involved in axon guidance which have on average almost three times the UTR length of ribosome biogenesis genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Stark1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting extensive UTR-based regulation, e.g. of translation and/or mRNA localization, in this class of genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Steward1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000598-Moore1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It was striking how many protein-coding genes were expressed in all samples studied, even including many transcription factors.
