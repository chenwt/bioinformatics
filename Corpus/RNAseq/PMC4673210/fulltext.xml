Understanding the mechanisms underlying E-cadherin repression during EMT may provide insights into the development of novel targeted therapeutics for cancer. Here, we report on the chemical probe, ML327, which de-represses E-cadherin transcription, partially reverses EMT, and inhibits cancer cell invasiveness and tumor cell migration <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Induction of E-cadherin mRNA expression by ML327 treatment does not require <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that ML327 treatment significantly alters expression of over 2,500 genes within three hours in the presence of the translational inhibitor, cycloheximide. Network analysis reveals Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4-alpha (HNF4&#x003b1;) as the most significant upstream transcriptional regulator of multiple genes whose expressions were altered by ML327 treatment. Further, small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of HNF4&#x003b1; markedly attenuates the E-cadherin expression response to ML327. In summary, ML327 represents a valuable tool to understand mechanisms of EMT and may provide the basis for a novel targeted therapeutic strategy for carcinomas.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>small molecule</kwd><kwd>E-cadherin</kwd><kwd>EMT</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cancer is a leading cause of death in the United States, and the vast majority of these cancers are of epithelial cell origin, or carcinomas [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Over 90% of cancer deaths related to solid malignancies are due to metastatic dissemination of cancer to secondary organs [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A hallmark of tumor malignancy and a requirement for metastasis is the acquired ability of cells to detach from the primary tumor mass and invade into surrounding stromal tissues. Epithelial-cadherin (E-cadherin, encoded by the <italic>CDH1</italic> gene) is a key component of the adherens junction complex and plays a pivotal role in epithelial tissue architecture and cell differentiation. Since most solid tumors are carcinomas that are derived from epithelial cells/tissues that predominantly express E-cadherin, the capacity of these cells to undergo neoplastic transformation and to metastasize is often associated with the loss of expression of this protein [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Loss of E-cadherin expression can be due to mutational inactivation of the <italic>CDH1</italic> gene (as in familial gastric cancer syndrome) [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], but more frequently the loss of expression is due to transcriptional inhibition or epigenetic silencing. EMT is a developmentally regulated process whereby epithelial cells undergo coordinated reprogramming of their gene expression and lose the epithelial characteristics of tight cell-cell adhesiveness and apical-basal polarity while gaining mesenchymal properties that include increased motility and capacity for invasion through the basement membrane [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Several developmentally important transcriptional regulatory proteins, such as ZEB1, ZEB2, Snai1, Snai2/SLUG, TWIST 1, and E47/TCF3, induce EMT and are directly involved in repression of E-cadherin expression [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Because of the strong association of decreased E-cadherin expression and EMT, we undertook a phenotypic small molecule screen to identify compounds that could elevate E-cadherin in an E-cadherin-low, and metastatic, colon cancer cell line as we have previously reported [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A focused medicinal chemistry optimization effort generated over three hundred analogs of the parent phenotypic screening hit that increased E-cadherin expression. Secondary and tertiary screening assays demonstrated that the optimized compound, herein referred to as ML327, de-represses E-cadherin expression in human SW620inv colon and H520 lung cancer cells and inhibits cell invasion in culture with little to no cytotoxicity at effective concentrations. Importantly, ML327 reverses TGF-&#x003b2; induced EMT in cell culture and inhibits cancer cell motility <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, we find that ML327 alters expression of numerous genes in addition to <italic>CDH1</italic>, and functional gene enrichment analysis shows that HNF4&#x003b1; is significantly implicated as the upstream regulator for numerous differentially expressed genes. Thus, we have developed ML327 from a phenotypic screen, and determined multiple mechanistic features of its activity. We conclude that ML327 provides a new direction for probing the biological process of EMT and may yield therapeutic benefit by disrupting carcinoma progression through a unique mechanism of action.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Small-molecule ML327 inhibits tumor cell invasion, but not tumor cell viability</title><p>Our previous studies identified novel pharmacology for a series of isoxazole-based compounds in restoring E-cadherin protein to the surface of selected aggressive colon and lung cancer cells and inhibiting cancer cell invasion [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, this first generation of compounds lacked the physiochemical properties to enable mechanistic studies. Additional optimization resulted in a new sub-series of compounds with improved potency and efficacy as well as more suitable physicochemical properties. The new analog sub-series is exemplified by <italic>N</italic>-(3-(2-hydroxynicotinamido) propyl)-5-phenylisoxazole-3-carboxamide, which we have named ML327, a Molecular Libraries Probe Center Network (MLPCN) probe (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The medicinal chemistry effort also uncovered structurally related molecules with minimal E-cadherin de-repression activity, such as the phenylpyrrole 266Y, (2-(5-phenyl-1<italic>H</italic>-pyrazole-3-carboxamido) ethyl) isonicotinamide trifluoroacetate), which serves as a negative control besides vehicle DMSO in our experiments described below.</p><p>To increase the signal to noise ratio in our experiments, we utilized SW620 colon cancer cells (herein referred to as &#x0201c;SW620inv&#x0201d;) that were selected for high invasive potential and low E-cadherin expression by passage through Matrigel, and all the selected clones shown E-cadherin restoration by Trichostatin A (TSA), a known histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, as parental SW620 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).

We found no differences in the DNA content of these treatment groups, indicating that ML327 has no measurable effect on cell viability in either the SW620inv or H520 cells in 2D culture conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).

Here, we extended these studies to determine the effect of ML327 at the transcriptional level. We found that ML327 induced significant increases in E-cadherin mRNA levels by as early as 3 hours after treatment in the SW620inv cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).

In contrast, the chromatin-containing transcriptionally silenced or repressed genes are enriched with binding of histone repressive marks, including H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me2, or H3K9me3) [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Since binding of specifically modified histones and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) are markers of active gene transcription, we determined whether ML327-induced E-cadherin expression is associated with increased Pol II and activated histone marks in chromatin associated with the promoter of <italic>CDH1</italic> gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed using antibodies against Pol II, H3K4me3, H3K9Ac, and H3K27me3 in SW620inv cells treated with DMSO, 266Y or ML327 for 4 hours. We observed significantly enriched binding of Pol II (4.6-fold), H3K4me3 (2.1-fold), and H3K9Ac (3.4-fold) to the <italic>CDH1</italic> promoter after treatment of SW620inv cells with ML327, and there was no significant difference in H3K27me3 binding after treatment of cells with ML327 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). In contrast, the inactive compound 266Y did not show any effect on Pol II occupancy on the <italic>CDH1</italic> proximal promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). In the same experiment, there was no difference binding of Pol II to the GAPDH promoter after treatment of cells with ML327 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).

Using a cutoff of FDR &#x0003c; 0.0001, we found that expression of 5658 genes was significantly altered in SW620inv cells (2881 upregulated genes, 2777 down-regulated genes) and that expression of 3667 genes was significantly altered in H520 cells (1792 upregulated genes, 1875 down-regulated genes) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary data report 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">2</xref>). To further control for false-positive discoveries and focus on a common mechanism in both SW620inv and H520 cells, we took the intersection of the lists of differentially expressed genes in these two cell lines to derive a list of 2578 differentially expressed genes that were in common for both cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).

Interestingly, we inhibited SNAIL1 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated depletion in SW620inv cells, then treated with DMSO or ML327 for 24 hours and observed that E-cadherin protein levels were not increased after marked depletion of SNAIL1. E-cadherin protein levels were increased similarly by ML327 treatment regardless of SNAIL1 depletion by siRNA. ML327 treatment increased Snail1 protein levels in the presence of Snail1 siRNA, but the level of Snail1 protein increase was reduced in comparison with the scrambled siRNA control conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6B</xref>).

Loss of HNF4&#x003b1; also significantly diminished the effect of ML327 on the E-cadherin protein levels as shown by Western blot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that the HNF4&#x003b1; protein level was elevated after 6 hours ML327 treatment, comparing the control siRNA treated with DMSO, or ML327 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>).

We have previously described a series of experiments using high throughput whole cell screening to identify and characterize a chemical compound that restores E-cadherin in colon cancer and lung cancer cells in which E-cadherin is transcriptionally repressed [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In the current report, we find that an efficacy-improved compound, ML327, induces E-cadherin transcription and inhibits cell invasion in culture, with little to no toxicity at effective concentrations in SW620inv and H520 cells. ML327 E-cadherin inducing responses were observed in a variety of cancer and non-transformed cells, including the HMEC1 cells that are endothelial in origin. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that ML327 treatment alters the transcription of multiple genes without the need for <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis. This suggests that the direct intracellular target of the compound is an important central regulatory node that coordinates or modulates the activation of several downstream transcriptional networks.</p><p>Tumor cell dissemination is critical in cancer progression and involves multiple processes that lead to the dissemination of metastases to remote loci. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition is characterized by decreased cell-cell adhesion, increased motility, and invasive properties that may allow carcinoma cells to detach from the primary tumor and invade surrounding tissue, through collective or individual cell migration [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. To examine the effect of ML327 on EMT, we studied its activity in the classical model system of TGF-&#x003b2; induced EMT in NMuMG mouse mammary epithelial gland cells. Our data indicated that ML327 partially reverses typical molecular features of established EMT in this experimental system.</p><p>Cell migration and metastasis are key features of aggressive tumors that are difficult to study <italic>in vivo</italic>, as they not readily accessible within the body of a cancer patient or an experimental animal. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies such as invasion assays and migration assays can model some aspects of these processes, but have inherent limitations that may miss important aspects of the processes as they occur <italic>in vivo</italic>. The CAM assay is a quantifiable <italic>in vivo</italic> model to study metastases and tumor cell migration that overcomes many limitations of the <italic>in vitro</italic> studies [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We determined that ML327 inhibits cancer cell motility <italic>in vivo</italic> as reflected by both reduced colony size and a pronounced inhibition of single cell migration from metastatic colonies forming in the chick embryo.</p><p>Epigenetic regulation (DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNAs) has been shown to play a key role in controlling EMT processes. Epigenetics is an important area for potential therapeutic targeting in cancer [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The inhibitors of DNMT and HDAC have been shown in preclinical studies to selectively target cancer cells with suppression of metastasis that has been experimentally correlated with E-cadherin upregulation [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In fact, we observed increased levels of E-cadherin in response to the HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A (as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). In this study, we observed significantly enriched binding of histone active marks (H3K4me3 and H3K9Ac) to the <italic>CDH1</italic> promoter after treatment of SW620inv cells with ML327. Suspecting that ML327 was functioning as a direct HDAC inhibitor, we screened ML327 activity in HDAC inhibition assays (HDAC class I, II, and IV) [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and sirtuin (HDAC class III) (H.A., unpublished results), but found no evidence for direct inhibition by ML327. We have also shown that ML327 can restore E-cadherin expression in human microvascular endothelial cell-HMEC-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Figure 3</xref>), but E-cadherin expression could not be restored by treatment with DNMT inhibitor, 5-azacytidine in the HMEC-1 cells (unpublished observations, H.A.). Even though our observations suggest either direct or indirect regulation of epigenetic processes, further research will be required to identify the direct target of ML327.</p><p>In this study, RNAseq analyses were conducted to evaluate the effect of ML327 on global gene expression patterns in SW620inv and H520 and to provide inferential clues as to the direct intracellular target of the compound. Functional enrichment analysis by IPA showed that HNF4&#x003b1; was the top significantly implicated upstream transcriptional regulator for common differentially expressed genes found in this analysis, including <italic>CDH1</italic>. HNF4&#x003b1; has previously been reported to be a central regulator of cell adhesion protein expression in the liver parenchyma of the mouse [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Expression of HNF4&#x003b1; has also been linked to regulation of E-cadherin expression in previous studies [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We identified twenty-one potential HNF4&#x003b1; binding sites within 1000 bp upstream and downstream of the <italic>CDH1</italic> transcription initiation site using TRANSFAC <italic>in silico</italic> analysis. We found that ML327 increased HNF4&#x003b1; binding to the <italic>CDH1</italic> promoter within a time-frame consistent with the induction of E-cadherin mRNA. Importantly, RNAi knockdown of HNF4&#x003b1; expression significantly, but incompletely, diminished the effect of ML327 on the E-cadherin mRNA and protein levels. However, we observed that knocking down HNF4&#x003b1; had no effect on the increases in Snail1 or NFATc2 mRNAs that were induced by ML327 treatment. Taken together, these data lead us to conclude that HNF4&#x003b1; is not likely to be the direct intracellular molecular target of ML327, but its actions are downstream of the direct target. Ongoing research is aimed at identifying the direct molecular target of ML327 upstream of the multiple genes that are transcriptionally activated in response to the chemical probe.</p><p>Identification of the direct molecular target for ML327 is likely to yield important information regarding coordinated regulation of broad transcriptional networks. We anticipate that it will also enable improved understanding and targeting of the pathological EMT process that could be exploited for therapeutic potential in cancer. Therefore, ML327 represents a novel chemical structure with potential for continued pharmacological optimization toward the development of novel therapeutics.

The cells were washed 3 times with PBS and then mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images were captured on an Olympus FV-1000 fluorescent microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4_9"><title>CAM tumor growth assay</title><p>Fertilized eggs were obtained from Tyson Foods. Embryonated eggs were handled in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines. The head and neck carcinoma cell HEp3 expressing GFP (100,000 in 100&#x003bc;l PBS) was injected into the allantoic vein of day 10 chick embryos. At 24 hours post injection the chicks were randomized and treated with either compound ML327 or 266Y. Each compound was applied by intra-allantois injection of the compound emulsified into corn oil. Colony formation was imaged at 4, 6 and 8 days post-injection using a fluorescent stereoscope at 50X magnification. Quantitative comparison of colony size was performed at 6 days post injection by measuring the diameter of the colony.</p></sec><sec id="s4_10"><title>RNAseq analysis</title><p>RNA from SW620inv and H520 cancer cells (n = 3 per group) exposed to either DMSO or ML327 in the presence of cycloheximide for 3 hours was collected using RNeasy kits. Processing of RNA using a TruSeq Stranded mRNA sample prep kit was conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Approximately 27-36 million 50 base pair single-end reads were generated, per sample. We mapped the reads to the human genome hg19 using TopHat-2.0.10 [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. About 96% or more of the reads were mapped to the genome. Then, following the method of Anders [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], we counted the number of reads that fall into annotated genes by samtools-0.1.19 [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and HTSeq-0.5.4p5 [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Finally, we performed count-based differential expression analysis using edgeR_3.4.2 [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] which implements general differential analyses based on the negative binomial model.</p></sec><sec id="s4_11"><title>Inhibition of HNF4&#x003b1;</title><p>RNAi studies were performed using SNAIL1 and HNF4A-specific ON-target plus SMART pool siRNA or ON-target plus Non-targeting Pool (Thermo Scientific).
