Most of these follicles remain in the resting state until either their degeneration or their activation and growth towards the primary, secondary and tertiary stages (with an antral cavity). The gradual exit of primordial follicles starts shortly after formation of the primordial follicle pool and continues throughout the reproductive years [<xref rid="pone.0141482.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This early follicular development is therefore important as it regulates the size of the remaining stock of primordial follicles and their fate, which in turn affects fertility and the reproductive life span.</p><p>Early follicular development is accompanied by an increase in oocyte diameter, a progressive acquisition of competence [<xref rid="pone.0141482.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and proliferation of granulosa cells (GCs). Early follicular development requires the appropriate expression of numerous genes at different developmental stages and orchestrated communication between the two main compartments (oocytes and granulosa cells) [<xref rid="pone.0141482.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0141482.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These compartments regulate follicle growth in an autocrine and paracrine manner via secreted factors and direct gap junctional communication.</p><p>Therefore, any integrated study of folliculogenesis must include changes in gene expression in all cell types, but such studies are faced with two major problems: restricted access to isolated stages and the limited supply of RNA. Indeed, the presence of all follicular stages in the ovary and the small size of preantral follicles, render the isolation of each early follicular stage even more problematic. As a result, relatively little is known about the key molecular mechanisms that underlie the complex biological processes of <italic>in vivo</italic> early folliculogenesis.</p><p>Until now, some transcriptomic studies focused on primordial-primary transition from neonatal rodent ovaries on day 0&#x02013;2 and day 4 that were respectively enriched in primordial and primary follicles [<xref rid="pone.0141482.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0141482.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], or from pure populations of oocytes from human primordial, intermediate and primary follicles [<xref rid="pone.0141482.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Only two mouse studies explored the breadth of early follicular development from oocytes and whole follicles, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0141482.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0141482.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. They showed that the principal change in expression in mouse species occurs at oocyte primordial-primary transition [<xref rid="pone.0141482.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. They revealed an over-representation of differentially expressed genes involved in protein synthesis and the cell cycle, in particular M-phase, throughout the early growth phase [<xref rid="pone.0141482.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The differential expression of oocyte-secreted ligands involved in NOTCH, SHH, EGF, TGF&#x003b2;, PDGF signaling pathways [<xref rid="pone.0141482.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0141482.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] also suggests that multiple signaling pathways operate during follicular development. Nevertheless, these results obtained in poly-ovulating species cannot be fully exploited in mono-ovulating species (sheep, human), so recent studies addressed this issue in the latter. A first study focused on secondary and small antrum follicles in goat species and highlighted three main metabolic pathways: lipid, cell death and hematological pathways [<xref rid="pone.0141482.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, our previous studies had been the first to describe differential gene expression between two isolated compartments, granulosa cells and oocytes, in sheep ovarian follicles [<xref rid="pone.0141482.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0141482.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We identified enriched functional categories that reflect two distinct cell fates. We revealed the involvement of granulosa cell pathways such as SHH, WNT and RHO GTPase. Other signaling pathways such as VEGF, NOTCH and IGF1 suggested the existence of complex cell-cell interactions. The expression and the specificity of the two cell types are now characterized in sheep species [<xref rid="pone.0141482.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Nevertheless, until now no studies had been able to describe the gene expression changes that occur during early follicular growth and in each compartment of the follicle. Consequently, the aim of the present study was to: 1- focus and decipher gene expression and functions that might be associated with early folliculogenesis from a developmental point of view (from primordial, primary, secondary and small antrum follicles) in sheep species, and 2- produce a set of biomarkers that are able to predict early follicular growth and could be used as <italic>in vivo</italic> signatures of early folliculogenesis.</p><p>For this purpose, we used the previous dataset of 15,349 gene expressions obtained by RNA-seq technology [<xref rid="pone.0141482.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] in order to analyze the spatio-temporal gene expression. We were able to show that major changes in gene expression occur during the primary-secondary transition. We compiled a detailed description of the molecular mechanisms underlying early folliculogenesis in sheep which are probably transposable to other large mammals including humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>RNA-seq experiment</title><p>This study was carried out in strict accordance with the institutional guidelines for research studies.

For each compartment, the expression value of each gene was then compared between each follicular stage using pairwise comparison (nbinom Test).

Lastly, our findings suggest the involvement of BMPER as an oocyte regulator during primary transition to secondary follicles (<xref rid="pone.0141482.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8D</xref>). BMPER has been reported to antagonize the activities of BMP2-4-3-6 [<xref rid="pone.0141482.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and displays significant affinity with another BMP antagonist, chordin (CHRD) [<xref rid="pone.0141482.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].

In mice, the <italic>bmper</italic> gene is expressed from the primary follicles but is not detected in oocytes [<xref rid="pone.0141482.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. This gene is described here for the first time as being mainly expressed in sheep oocyte and up-regulated from the secondary stage (<xref rid="pone.0141482.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>).

SPLS-DA analysis is a partial least squares regression technique applied to categorical variables (here the stages of follicles).

The two analyses showed some structure of variables without clearly separating the stages.

Later, at antral stages, it was also shown that autophagy process is also implicated in follicular atresia in different species [<xref rid="pone.0141482.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0141482.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] and may be regulated through cross talk with apoptosis proteins [<xref rid="pone.0141482.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p><p>At the primary stage we identified expression of the <italic>tectorin alpha (TECTA)</italic> gene in sheep oocytes. TECTA protein is one of the major noncollagenous components of the tectorial membrane and plays a role in intracochlear sound transmission. This gene was not documented in other tissues.</p><p>At the secondary stage we highlighted the expression of the <italic>cannabinoid receptor 1</italic> (<italic>CNR1)</italic> gene in granulosa cells. This gene encodes one of cannabinoid receptors known to regulate spermatic differentiation. Its invalidation influences sperm chromatin remodelling by reducing the displacement of histones [<xref rid="pone.0141482.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Its role in granulosa cells still needs to be defined.</p><p>Finally at the small antral stage we highlighted the granulosa cell expression of the <italic>synapse differentiation inducing 1</italic> (<italic>SYNDIG1)</italic> gene and the oocyte expression of the <italic>SPO11</italic>, <italic>WEE2</italic> and <italic>B-cell translocation gene 4</italic> (<italic>BTG4)</italic> genes. <italic>SYNDIG1</italic> encodes the SYNG1 protein that belongs to the interferon-induced transmembrane family of proteins. This protein is a regulator of excitatory synapse maturation and induces synapse maturation [<xref rid="pone.0141482.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Its role during follicular development requires further investigation. Surprisingly, during this study, we identified a preferential expression of <italic>SPO11</italic> in small antrum oocytes. It is assumed that SPO11 is necessary to generate chromatin breaks during leptotene of the first meiotic prophase in yeast and mammals [<xref rid="pone.0141482.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0141482.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In early ovarian follicles, this process is completed and germ cell meiosis is arrested at the diplotene stage. The function of <italic>SPO11</italic> after DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) has been little studied and it would be interesting to investigate its role as from the end of prophase I. Thus Houmard et <italic>al</italic> showed in the human fetal ovary that the number of <italic>SPO11</italic> transcripts was elevated after 12 weeks of gestation (corresponding to the end of meiosis) and remained elevated up to 18 weeks (initiation of follicle formation at 12&#x02013;14 weeks) [<xref rid="pone.0141482.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The detection of <italic>SPO11</italic> expression in sheep oocytes of small antrum follicles was in line with this previous human study so we can hypothesize new roles for SPO11 during oocyte development. Wee2 is responsible for phosphorylating the CDK1 inhibitory site and maintaining meiotic arrest in oocytes. In macaque monkeys species, and as seen during our study, <italic>WEE2</italic> mRNA appears to accumulate during folliculogenesis, reaching the highest level in preovulatory follicles [<xref rid="pone.0141482.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. BTG4 belongs to the PC3/BTG/TOB family of cell-cycle inhibitors. It is able to induce G<sub>1</sub> arrest, and is highly expressed in the testis, oocytes, and preimplantation embryos [<xref rid="pone.0141482.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. <italic>BTG4</italic> is also highly expressed in bovine testis and ovary/oocyte, which suggests a role for BTG4 in meiosis [<xref rid="pone.0141482.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0141482.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>].</p><p>This biomarker set thus offers an &#x0201c;<italic>in vivo&#x0201d;</italic> reference to predict follicular development by a useable qRT-PCR technology.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec032"><title>Conclusions</title><p>For the first time, a detailed and comprehensive spatio-temporal transcriptome for the developmental stages of early folliculogenesis has been presented in this study. Substantial changes in gene expression occur in both oocytes and granulosa cells as the follicles develop. We have described the specific gene expression dynamic during follicular development for each compartment. We identified more gene expression change in oocytes than in granulosa cells, and revealed important differential expressions between primary and secondary stages in sheep. Gene expression was little affected in granulosa cells at the last studied stage (small antrum stage).</p><p>Our analysis highlighted the <italic>in vivo</italic> molecular course of a number of processes. As early as the primary stage, a significant number of genes involved in the cell cycle regulation were found to be differentially expressed in oocytes, illustrating initiation of the acquisition of meiotic competence. Other changes in gene expression affected oocyte migration and cellular organization. At the secondary stage, genes related to cell migration signaling pathways such as integrins, WNT or Rho were mainly down-regulated in oocytes. In neighboring cells (granulosa cells), an interesting subset of genes was found to be involved in the adhesion and formation of cytoplasmic projections. The expression of integrin family members, involved in cell morphology, was notably affected in both compartments. At the small antral stage, the acquisition of meiotic competence progressed with an over-expression of genes required to stabilize mouse oocyte meiotic arrest. We demonstrated an increase in the expression of genes already known to participate in lipid and steroid biosynthesis in granulosa cells. Lastly, some important pathways were found to be associated with early follicular development, such as FGF signaling in oocytes and WNT and BMP signaling in both compartments.</p><p>Numerous questions remain regarding the mechanisms governing the regulation of early follicular growth. Our findings proposed the new involvement of a number of molecules such as KLF9 and BMPER in gene regulation during this growth. We also generated a data set of 24 biomarkers that could be useful to predict follicular growth. They also are likely to play important roles in the process of follicular growth. They enabled discrimination between early follicular stages and thus offer a molecular signature for early follicular growth. They are of importance to determining the quality and correct development of <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> protocols for the study of early folliculogenesis, the production of embryos or estimation of the cryogenic preservation of the ovarian cortex.</p><p>This study has therefore highlighted new arguments that enable a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in early ovarian follicular development and new insights into both reproductive biology and regenerative medicine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec033"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0141482.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Analysis of changes in expression during stage transition.</title><p>This Figure shows the number of differentially expressed genes (under- and over-expressed) in oocyte (A) and granulosa cells (B) at each follicular transition: primordial/primary, primary/secondary, secondary/small antrum.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0141482.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0141482.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Functional enrichment during early follicular development.</title><p>Genes differentially expressed during early development were evaluated <italic>in silico</italic> using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) for each compartment (FDR &#x0003c;5%).
