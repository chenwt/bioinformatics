Depending on the environmental conditions isogenic <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> cells can split into a competent and non-competent subpopulation. The origin of this population heterogeneity has not been experimentally determined and it is unknown how the two QS systems are connected. We developed a toolbox of single and dual fluorescent reporter strains and systematically knocked out key genes of the competence signaling cascade in the reporter strain backgrounds. By following signal propagation on the single cell level we discovered that the master regulator of competence, the alternative sigma factor SigX, directly controls expression of the response regulator for bacteriocin synthesis ComE. Consequently, a SigX binding motif (cin-box) was identified in the promoter region of <italic>comE</italic>. Overexpressing the genetic components involved in competence development demonstrated that ComRS represents the origin of bimodality and determines the modality of the downstream regulators SigX and ComE. Moreover these analysis showed that there is no direct regulatory link between the two QS signaling cascades. Competence is induced through a hierarchical XIP signaling cascade, which has no regulatory input from the CSP cascade. CSP exclusively regulates bacteriocin synthesis. We suggest renaming it mutacin inducing peptide (MIP). Finally, using phosphomimetic <italic>comE</italic> mutants we show that unimodal bacteriocin production is controlled posttranslationally, thus solving the puzzling observation that in complex media competence is observed in a subpopulation only, while at the same time all cells produce bacteriocins. The control of both bacteriocin synthesis and competence through the alternative sigma-factor SigX suggests that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> increases its genetic repertoire via QS controlled predation on neighboring species in its natural habitat.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>
<italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> is a bacterium of the human dental plaque that contributes to caries development. It controls two important survival mechanisms via a cell-density dependent communication system (quorum sensing): The synthesis of peptide antibiotics, and of a membrane apparatus for genetic competence, i.e. the ability to take up external DNA and integrate it into its own genome. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> synthesizes two different signalling peptides to this end. It has remained elusive, how exactly these signals are propagated within the cell and why only a fraction of the population becomes competent. To actually observe under the microscope which bacterium in the population is activated, and which genes are required for the activation, we constructed strains of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> that reported on the transcription of a gene by starting to fluoresce green. We even constructed strains that reported on two genes simultaneously, by fluorescing either green or blue or both. With these tools, and by additionally knocking out or modifying key genes as needed, we investigated the complete signaling cascade under various conditions. Thus we discovered a central regulatory switch. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> makes sure that external DNA is available when it becomes genetically competent&#x02013;by killing cells in the environment.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The German Ministry for Research and Technology (BMBF) funded MR in the program e:bio (grant number 031 A299).

Studying those mechanisms in detail is needed because they are among the reasons for the spread of antibiotic resistance and virulence determinants between bacteria [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Natural transformation, i.e. the uptake of extracellular DNA from the environment via genetic competence, is a powerful process able to expand and modify the gene inventory in both Proteobacteria and Firmicutes [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It requires a multi-protein complex localized in the cell membrane, many elements of which are highly conserved, and was studied in most detail in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In streptococci competence is a tightly controlled transient state whose activation involves detection of quorum sensing (QS) signaling peptides, which in streptococci are termed pheromones. In all streptococci studied so far the proximal master regulator of competence, and final receiver of the transduced signals, is the alternative sigma factor SigX (previously termed ComX). SigX binding to the RNA polymerase activates transcription of a core set of ~ 20 &#x0201c;late&#x0201d; competence effector genes [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. They carry a nine bp cin-box in their promoter region and mediate the synthesis of proteins for DNA uptake and recombination [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The SigX regulon has been found in all streptococci sequenced to date, suggesting that genetic competence is ubiquitous in streptococci, although until now it could only be demonstrated experimentally in very few [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Although all streptococci use peptide pheromones for density dependent activation of <italic>sigX</italic> expression as well as bacteriocin synthesis, the details of signal transduction and integration differ widely between the different species. Two principal types of pheromones and signal detection mechanisms have been found [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]: Pheromones derived from pre-peptides carrying a double-glycine leader sequence are cleaved and exported by the membrane localized ComAB complex, and after an additional processing step the mature pheromone is detected in the extracellular environment through the transmembrane sensor histidine kinase of a two component signal transduction system that phosphorylates its corresponding response regulator. The phosphorylated response regulator induces transcription of the alternative sigma-factor <italic>sigX</italic>. The competence-stimulating peptide (CSP) of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> belongs into this group. The second type of pheromones was recently discovered and shown to be conserved in streptococci [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A pre-peptide is synthesized, exported and processed to yield a short hydrophobic mature peptide termed XIP (<italic>sigX</italic> inducing peptide), which is then re-imported by a permease. Its detection occurs by an intracellular transcription factor that interacts directly with the peptide signal [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The activated, dimeric regulator induces transcription of <italic>sigX</italic> by binding to its promoter region [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], much like the LuxR type QS regulators that are activated by binding of acylated homoserine lactons (AHLs), the QS signals of Proteobacteria.</p><p>In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> competence is regulated via both types of QS signaling peptides and the medium composition determines which signal is active. Moreover the medium also determines whether competence is induced uni-modally [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] or only in a subpopulation of cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The current understanding of competence development in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> is shown in <xref rid="pgen.1005353.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>. In complex media competence can only be induced by CSP (<xref rid="pgen.1005353.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). The 46 amino acid CSP precursor is encoded by the <italic>comC</italic> gene and processed and exported by the <italic>comAB</italic> encoded ABC transporter, yielding the extracellular 21 residue CSP-peptide [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This is cleaved to its biologically active form by the protease SepM, thereby removing the 3 C-terminal amino acids [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Binding of CSP-18 to the histidine kinase ComD induces autophosphorylation of the protein and results in the transfer of the phosphorylgroup to a conserved aspartic acid residue of the cognate response regulator ComE. Phosphorylated ComE binds to two direct repeats in the promoter regions of genes encoding bacteriocins and their corresponding immunity proteins resulting in transcription of the &#x0201c;early competence genes&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

Two quorum sensing pathways regulate competence in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic>. Components of the ComDE circuit with the autoinducer CSP are shown in green while components of the ComRS circuit and the autoinducer XIP are illustrated in red color. Inactive elements of the circiuts are shown in grey. The two QS pathways are operating in parallel and converge on the central comRS system. Both circuits are connected via an unknown link between ComDE and ComRS in complex medium. The medium determines which autoinducer is biologically active and whether competence is induced bimodally or unimodally across the population. This is illustrated by the gene expression shemes (grey box in the right). The modality of the expression of involved genes is illustrated in the same coloring as used for the gene symbol. The output of the systems, bacteriocin expression and competence, are symbolized below the bacteriocin encoding genes and the late competence genes in yellow. Bacteriocin expression is exclusively observed in complex medium while competence development in defined medium is not coupled to bacteriocin expression.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1005353.g001"/></fig><p>In the peptide free chemically definde medium (CDM), competence can only be induced by XIP, the second autoinducer of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005353.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>), via the ComRS system, that is also present in other mutans, pyogenic and bovis group streptococci [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It consists of an Rgg type transcriptional regulator (ComR) and a small XIP peptide, encoded by the <italic>comS</italic> gene [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The XIP pre-peptide is processed and the active seven residue pheromone is secreted into the environment by an unknown process. After accumulation extracellular XIP is internalized, most likely via the Opp permease, and binds to ComR in a proposed stoichiometry of 2:1 (XIP:ComR) [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Resulting conformational changes promote dimerization of the XIP2/ComR complex and binding to DNA targets containing the ComR binding motif. In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> binding motifs for ComR were found upstream of the <italic>comS</italic> and the <italic>sigX</italic> gene [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus XIP controls its own expression in a positive auto-regulatory feedback loop. XIP mediated competence induction is exclusively observed in chemically defined media and results in uni-modal expression of competence.</p><p>The effect of the medium is hypothesized to be caused by differences in transport and degradation, respectively, of the autoinducers. In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> it was shown that CSP is degraded by the membrane bound protease HtrA, and that this degradation is reduced in the presence of unfolded proteins [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the homologous HtrA of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> might be inhibited from CSP degradation by small peptides present in complex medium, resulting in active CSP in complex but not in minimal medium [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Conversely, XIP is active in defined, but not in complex media. It was suggested that the import of XIP might be inhibited in complex media due to the clogging of the Opp permease [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Small amounts of peptides that are added to the cultivation medium completely eliminate the activity of XIP [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, it remains unclear how under CSP induced conditions ComR might be activated by XIP, if this signal cannot be imported into the cell (<xref rid="pgen.1005353.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>).</p><p>Bacteria often respond to environmental stimuli in a non-uniform manner; even in isogenic cultures and under homogenous conditions the appearance of multiple phenotypes (phenotypic variation) is observed [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Phenotypic variability has strong implications for the treatment of bacterial infections and is relevant for cellular differentiation [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Two distinct phenotypes occurring simultaneously are referred to as bimodal and were observed e.g. for lactose utilization, chemotaxis and persister cell occurence in <italic>E</italic>.<italic>coli</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and for competence development and sporulation in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It was previously shown that phenotypic heterogeneity enhances the overall fitness of the population under fluctuating conditions and helps bacteria to colonize different ecological niches within an ecosystem [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Thus phenotypic variability can be considered as a bet-hedging strategy and an evolvable trait.</p><p>Signaling in bacteria is never discrete since stochastic fluctuations of the components that determine a cellular state occur [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This phenomenon is called noise and it is most pronounced for processes involving a limited number of molecules such as transcription and translation [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Noise is one critical determinant for the establishment of phenotypic variation [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Phenotypic heterogeneity can also be a result of the architecture of regulatory networks comprising positive feedback loops or toggle switches (two regulators that negatively regulate each other) which can amplify signals and respond nonlinearly to stimuli [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Noisy gene expression in conjunction with such networks can convert a graded signal into a bimodal response which is stably maintained in the population.</p><p>An intriguing feature of the competence cascade in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> is its bimodality under CSP induced conditions in THBY medium. It was hypothesized to be caused by the auto-regulatory feedbackloop of ComS [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A different hypothesis was developed by Lemme <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] who found that the entire population expressed the bacteriocin related genes in an uni-modal way, while only a subpopulation expressed <italic>sigX</italic> and entered the competent state. However, bimodal expression of <italic>comE</italic> was observed at the same time. Since <italic>comE</italic> is supposed to act upstream of ComRS signaling, it was therefore hypothesized that <italic>comE</italic> expression might be the origin of bimodality [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Finally, an intriguing question is the autolysis of a fraction of the population after stimulation by XIP [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] or CSP [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic>, it is the non-competent subpopulation which is killed by the competent siblings, a phenomenon termed fratricide [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The CbpD murein hydrolase which is responsible for this process has a homologue termed LytFsm in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic>. It has however been shown that lysis occurs in a fraction of the competent cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and that LytFsm is a self-acting autolysin, not a fratricin [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>The QS signaling cascade of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> thus comprises two different signals, one that is detected in the external environment (CSP), and one that is detected intracellularly (XIP). They are linked with each other in different ways in different media. The system has a temporal dimension (&#x0201c;early&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;late&#x0201d; competence genes), and it can result in phenotypic heterogeneity of the population. Here we asked (1) At which level in the competence signaling cascade is bimodal gene expression triggered? (2) How is the ComE signaling cascade connected to the ComRS signaling cascade? (3) How can bacteriocin expression be unimodal, although <italic>comE</italic> expression is bimodal? (4) How is the medium effect on signaling mediated&#x02014;is CSP really degraded in CDM, and how can an active XIP/ComR complex be formed in THBY?</p><p>To answer these questions, it was necessary to follow the activation of the key genes along the signaling cascade on the single cell level. We developed a tool-box of integrative reporter plasmids carrying a fusion of the promoter of interest with a fluorescent protein. Those constructs were integrated into the chromosome of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic>. We used the wild-type, as well as strains that had key genes of the signaling cascade deleted, over-expressed, or modified. To monitor co-expression of &#x0201c;early&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;late&#x0201d; competence genes, we developed dual-fluorescent reporter strains that clearly demonstrated which of the cells induced upstream became finally competent. Population heterogeneity was observed directly under the microscope or using flow cytometry. RNA sequencing was used to determine gene expression of all involved components during the first 30 min post induction. The data result in a new understanding of the QS regulatory circuit of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> that resolves the discordant observations described above.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Signal propagation through the competence cascade</title><p>The construction and experimental verification of all single and dual fluorescent reporter strains used in this study is described in detail in <xref rid="pgen.1005353.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005353.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005353.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005353.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref> Figs.

The analysis was conducted 2.5 h post induction because the expression of the late competence genes reaches its maximum after 2 h [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and the full maturation of the fluorescent proteins requires additional 30 minutes [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. <xref rid="pgen.1005353.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> shows that the <italic>comE</italic> gene is co-expressed with <italic>comS</italic>, <italic>sigX</italic> and the late competence gene <italic>lytFsm</italic>.

We suggest that CSP induces import of XIP in an indirect way by inducing expression of bacteriocins, resulting in permeabilization of the cell. As relatively high XIP concentrations are required, it is likely that the import of the small XIP peptide is ineffective in THBY.

It was speculated that CSP might be proteolytically degraded by the HtrA protease in CDM, while in complex medium this protease was thought to be saturated by small peptides that are constituents of the medium, thus protecting CSP from degradation [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

CSP causes medium independent unimodal expression of bacteriocins, as also shown above. We have also shown above, that addition of CSP to THBY allows XIP signaling, but not because of a direct regulatory link as previously hypothesized. Instead an indirect effect is operating. We suggest that bacteriocins make the cells permeable and thus allow reimport of XIP into the producing cell. Thus in our experiment here, bacteriocin synthesis is induced by CSP, likely resulting in permeabilzation of the cell and reimport of XIP that is endogeneously produced. XIP then activates <italic>sigX</italic>, resulting in transcription of <italic>comE</italic> via binding of the SigX-RNA-Polymerase complex to the cin-Box. This explains why <italic>comE</italic> expression is delayed in THBY by about 90 min in comparison to CDM.</p><p>
<xref rid="pgen.1005353.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref> clearly shows that the bacteriocin encoding gene <italic>cipB</italic> was strongly and instantaneously induced upon CSP stimulation in CDM in an unimodal way (blue density plots).

The two signals CSP and XIP control different traits: CSP signaling (green box) mediates bacteriocin expression while XIP signaling induces competence development (red box). The model contains three different temporal layers of signaling: (I) Fast post transcriptional activation of the response regulator ComE and the transcription factor ComR induced by their respective signals within the first 5 min after detection. ComE is activated by phosphorylation, and ComR is activated by binding of XIP. (II) Early transcriptional response of the activated regulators resulting in bacteriocin synthesis (CSP signaling) and transcription of the <italic>comRS</italic> genes and the alternative sigma-factor <italic>sigX</italic> (XIP signaling). (III) Late transcriptional response mediated by the alternative sigma-factor SigX. Transcription of the gene encoding the regulator of bacteriocin synthesis, <italic>comE</italic>, is controlled by SigX. In such a way both QS systems are connected.

Our model discriminates between post-transcriptional and transcriptional regulation, which has not been taken into account by previous modeling approaches.</p><fig id="pgen.1005353.g010" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1005353.g010</object-id><label>Fig 10</label><caption><title>Model of competence development in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic>.</title><p>Two quorum sensing pathways are operating in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic>. Bacteriocin expression is regulated via CSP signaling and the ComDE two-component system (green box). CSP should be renamed MIP (mutacin inducing peptide). Competence development is regulated via XIP signaling and the ComR regulator (red box). Both systems are connected via the alternative sigma-factor SigX which controls <italic>comE</italic> transcription (red arrow). Competence regulation proceeds in three successive steps: (1) Instantaneous post-transcriptional activation of the regulator ComR.

(3) Late transcriptional response: Transcription of the SigX regulon, including the competence genes and the <italic>comE</italic> response regulator. Upon competence development the medium determines via which mechanism XIP is imported into the cell. In defined medium XIP is specifically imported via the Opp permease, leading to unimodal competence development. XIP import in complex medium requires bacteriocin activity and might be mediated via permeabilization of the cells. In complex medium, competence development is bimodal. Active bacteriocins and CSP areexclusively observed in complex medium. Post transcriptional mechanisms must be operating in the defined medium, e.g. down-regulation of bacteriocin translation, lack of secretion, or degradation, since the cells sense externally added CSP and transcription of bacteriocin encoding genes is induced.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1005353.g010"/></fig><p>Instead of two QS systems operating in parallel connected through a hypothetical regulator as assumed before (<xref rid="pgen.1005353.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>), we have two QS systems operating independently, triggered by their respective signals CSP and XIP. The competence cascade, however, is linked to bacteriocin synthesis through the alternative sigma-factor SigX which controls <italic>comE</italic>. Thus, SigX induces competence, and with a time delay, also bacteriocin synthesis. Typically QS networks are organized hierarchically (e.g. in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].

The type of network architecture found here comprises two different input channels which are connected by the alternative sigma-factor SigX. SigX is stimulated directly by XIP and indirectly by CSP. This type of network architecture has not been found before.</p><p>A hierarchical cascade mediates competence. XIP is the signal inducing competence, independent from the growth medium. However the medium determines via which way XIP is imported into the cell. We hypothesize that bacteriocin expression is required to induce permeability of the cell for external XIP. CSP signaling is independent from XIP signaling and is mediated via phosphorylation of ComDE. CSP-induced unimodal activation of bacteriocin synthesis is regulated post-transcriptionally and occurs before the transcription of <italic>comE</italic> which is mediated via XIP signaling. CSP induces competence only indirectly. It is therefore not a competence inducing peptide and should be renamed MIP (mutacin inducing peptide). CSP signaling is also in principle independent from the cultivation medium, but in defined medium bacteriocin excretion is inhibited.The new model simplifies our understanding of QS in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> and resolves the open questions initially formulated. We will subsequently discuss them point by point.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Bimodality of competence development</title><p>Lemme <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] postulated <italic>comE</italic> being the origin of bimodality upon CSP induced competence development. Here we clearly show that this not the case since strong overexpression of <italic>comE</italic> independent of its native promoter did not enhance the percentage of competent cells. For <italic>comS</italic> a positive feedback loop was identified, which is a prerequisite for bimodality to occur [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and thus a model assuming bistable expression of <italic>comS</italic> was developed [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, here we show that neither <italic>comR</italic> nor <italic>comS</italic> alone can induce unimodal competence development when they are strongly overexpressed. Both genes or rather their gene products are required. Bistable expression of <italic>comS</italic> is not necessarily required. How then is the bimodality established in the system? Besides a positive feedback loop, noise is the second critical determinant for bimodality [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We suggest that noise in <italic>comR</italic> and <italic>comS</italic> expression accounts for bimodality since the overexpression analysis showed that both are limiting factors for unimodal competence development. Bimodality would then be a feature of the quorum sensing network, and not necessarily the result of bistable expression of one component [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>XIP is a secreted factor, and thus it is unclear how phenotypic heterogeneity can be stably established if all cells are able to sense XIP, not only the overproducers.

Here we show that this regulator does not exist. If a regulator would be required for transmitting the CSP induced signal to ComRS, then it would be possible to overcome its effect by overexpression of <italic>comRS</italic>, which should result in unimodal competence development. However, here we show that overexpression of <italic>comRS</italic> does not induce competence at all in complex media.</p><p>We suggest that CSP induces competence only indirectly by allowing XIP to be imported into the cell in complex media. The following findings support this hypothesis: 1. Competence is not induced in CDM by CSP, although externally added CSP is fully active and not degraded as previously thought. 2. A small quantity of CSP is required to induce unimodal competence development in THBY in a strain overexpressing <italic>comRS</italic>. 3. An increase in the concentration of CSP does not increase the percentage of competent cells in this experiment, suggesting that CSP triggers a process required for competence to occur and is not inducing it directly. 4. The time-lag of 60&#x02013;90 min between CSP addition and <italic>sigX</italic> transcription in THBY clearly supports an indirect activation mechanism. 5. Deletion of CipB completely abolished CSP and CSP/XIP induced expression of the late competence gene <italic>lytFsm</italic>. Our findings are in accordance with a recent study showing that deletion of the bacteriocin encoding gene <italic>cipB</italic> almost completely abolishes competence development through CSP stimulation [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Thus it was suggested that the CipB bacteriocin itself might act as a regulator of competence [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This scenario is highly unlikely, because a regulatory role for a bacteriocin has never been demonstrated. Moreover, bacteriocins are secreted into the environment and thus can hardly exert intracellular regulatory roles. Based on our findings we suggest that bacteriocins are required to induce permeability of the producer cell for external XIP.</p><p>It was shown that deletion of Opp has no influence on CSP induced competence development in complex medium in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thus XIP import upon bacteriocin expression in complex medium is not mediated via Opp and its precise mechanism remains to be elucidated. Pore formation is the mode of action of many bacteriocins [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Via these pores the small XIP molecule might enter the cell. Alternatively some of the bacteriocin exporters might allow XIP import. Cell wall and membrane alterations which confer immunity to the bacteriocin producer cells against their own bacteriocin [<xref rid="pgen.1005353.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] may also account for the altered permeability of the cell for XIP.

This process is not affected by transport processes across the membrane and therefore it is independent of the cultivation medium. By contrast, the transcription of the <italic>comE</italic> gene is controlled by SigX, which is regulated via the XIP signaling cascade.

In all cases the second integration results in reporter strains carrying TagBFP2 and gfp+, each under the control of the LytFsm promoter.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1005353.s003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1005353.s004"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>The <italic>lytFsm-gfp+</italic> reporter strain showed the highest signal to noise fluorescence ratio of all tested single fluorescent reporter strains specific for late competence genes.</title><p>Microscopic overlay images of GFP+ reporter strains for late competence genes <italic>smu_498</italic>, <italic>smu_625</italic>, <italic>smu_644</italic>, <italic>lytFsm</italic>, <italic>smu_1001</italic> and <italic>smu_1987</italic> are shown.
