It is a multi-step process involving invasion and migration of primary tumor cells with a subsequent colonization of these cells at a secondary location. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of thioredoxin (Trx1) in the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells and to assess the strength of the association between high levels of Trx1 and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1) expression with breast cancer patient survival. Our results indicate that the expression of both Trx1 and TrxR1 are statistically significantly increased in breast cancer patient cells compared with paired normal breast tissue from the same patient. Over-expression of Trx1 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines enhanced cell invasion in <italic>in vitro</italic> assays while expression of a redox inactive mutant form of Trx1 (designated 1SS) or the antisense mRNA inhibited cell invasion. Addition of exogenous Trx1 also enhanced cell invasion, while addition of a specific monoclonal antibody that inhibits Trx1 redox function decreased cell invasion. Over-expression of intracellular Trx1 did not increase cell migration but expression of intracellular 1SS inhibited migration. Addition of exogenous Trx1 enhanced cell migration while 1SS had no effect. Treatment with auranofin inhibited TrxR activity, cell migration and clonogenic activity of MDA-MB-231 cells, while increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Analysis of 25 independent cohorts with 5910 patients showed that Trx1 and TrxR1 were both associated with a poor patient prognosis in terms of overall survival, distant metastasis free survival and disease free survival. Therefore, targeting the Trx system with auranofin or other specific inhibitors may provide improved breast cancer patient outcomes through inhibition of cancer invasion and migration.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p><fig id="f0050" position="anchor"><alt-text id="at0055">fx1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Over expression of thioredoxin in MDA-MB-231 cells enhanced cell invasion in vitro.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Thioredoxin inhibition reduced cell invasion and migration of MDA-MB-231 cells.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Addition of thioredoxin enhanced migration of MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Auranofin treatment inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell migration and clonogenic activity.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>High Trx1 and TrxR1 expression is associated with a poor breast cancer prognosis.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>ATL, adult T-cell leukemia</kwd><kwd>CI, confidence interval</kwd><kwd>FBS, fetal bovine serum</kwd><kwd>DFS, disease free survival</kwd><kwd>DMFS, distant-metastasis free survival</kwd><kwd>DTNB, 5,5&#x02032;-Dithio-Bis (2-Nitrobenzoic Acid)</kwd><kwd>DTT, dithiothreitol</kwd><kwd>GFP, green fluorescent protein</kwd><kwd>H2DCF-DA, 2&#x02032;,7&#x02032;-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate</kwd><kwd>HR, hazard ratio</kwd><kwd>HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells</kwd><kwd>MMP, matrix metalloproteinase</kwd><kwd>MTT, 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide</kwd><kwd>OS, overall survival</kwd><kwd>RFU, relative fluorescence units</kwd><kwd>ROS, reactive oxygen species</kwd><kwd>TCGA, the cancer genome atlas</kwd><kwd>TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase</kwd><kwd>TNB, 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate anion</kwd><kwd>TPM, transcripts per million</kwd><kwd>Trx, thioredoxin</kwd><kwd>TrxR, thioredoxin reductase</kwd><kwd>TXNIP, thioredoxin interacting protein</kwd><kwd>VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Thioredoxin</kwd><kwd>Breast cancer</kwd><kwd>Cell invasion</kwd><kwd>Cell migration</kwd><kwd>Patient survival</kwd><kwd>Auranofin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Oxidative stress is a characteristic feature of many cancers, including breast cancer, and has been implicated in cancer development and progression <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated through the increased metabolic activity of cancer cells, enhanced signaling pathways or mitochondrial dysfunction <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. As a consequence many antioxidants and redox control systems are up-regulated, suggesting that a balance of ROS levels is important to maintain cancer cell function <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. One of the most important cellular cytoplasmic redox systems is the thioredoxin (Trx) system, comprised of Trx1, thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1) and NADPH <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and it is highly expressed in many cancer cells, including breast tumors <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Thioredoxins are small (12&#x000a0;KDa) redox active proteins with a highly conserved active dithiol containing site of &#x02013;Cys&#x02013;Gly&#x02013;Pro&#x02013;Cys&#x02013;, which participates in redox reactions through a reversible oxidation cycle <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The reduced Trx protein is a very effective protein disulfide reductase and through this action it is able to effect disulfide-dependent structural changes in other molecules, causing the activation or inhibition of target proteins. The oxidized Trx is then reduced by the NADPH dependent TrxR <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Multiple protein substrates have been identified for Trx1, including ribonucleotide reductase <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, various transcription factors <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, peroxiredoxins <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and the methionine sulfoxide reductases <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Furthermore Trx1 can also act as a direct scavenger of ROS <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and reduced Trx1 inhibits apoptosis by binding to ASK-1 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Involvement of Trx1 in protecting cells from apoptosis has many consequences for cancer, in terms of maintaining cell viability and protection from various chemotherapeutic treatments <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Over recent years the Trx1 system has been linked with tumor development and cancer. Both Trx1 and TrxR1 are highly expressed in many cancer cell lines, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and in patient tumors compared to corresponding normal tissue <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Significant evidence links the expression of the Trx1 system with the proliferative capacity and the apoptotic resistance of different cancers. An <italic>in vivo</italic> study observed a positive correlation between Trx1 over-expression and cancer cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis in primary gastric carcinomas, which correlated with a poor clinical outcome <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Other studies have shown similar correlations with high Trx1 levels and decreased patient survival levels in non-small cell lung carcinoma <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and colorectal cancer <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. An association between high levels of Trx1 expression and the aggressiveness of tumors in human lung cancer <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, prostate carcinoma <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and in skin cancers and mammary tumors <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> has also been observed.</p><p>An increase in Trx1 levels does not occur just as a consequence of cancer growth but rather, Trx1 has an active functional role in cancer metastasis and progression <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Several studies have been conducted using breast cancer cells to assess the role of Trx1 in cancer development and invasive processes. An early study showed that transfection of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with the gene encoding a redox inactive mutated Trx1 protein (with both active site cysteines mutated) reversed the transformed phenotype of cancer cells with the expressed protein acting in a dominant negative manner. When the transfected MCF-7 cells were inoculated into <italic>scid</italic> mice, tumor formation was almost completely suppressed with only microscopic tumor cell deposits being observed and no evidence of metastasis to other organs <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>Trx1 expression has also been associated with the regulation of other molecules that are necessary for breast cancer cell invasion, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Transfection of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with a construct that over-expresses Trx1 increased VEGF production and secretion <italic>in vitro</italic> while transfection of constructs expressing the redox-inactive Trx1 protein resulted in a decrease of VEGF expression <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Transfection of the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line with a Trx1 expressing construct resulted in an increase of MMP-9 expression and also enhanced cell invasion of these transfected cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, while transfection with a construct expressing the redox inactive protein resulted in decreased MMP-9 expression and decreased cancer cell invasion <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. A previous study had shown that Trx1 preferentially inhibits the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) so that MMP activity is favored, leading to extracellular matrix degradation and an increase in cancer cell invasion <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. These results suggest that Trx1 plays an active role in regulating processes that lead to increased cancer cell invasion.</p><p>Trx1 also has extracellular functions. Trx1 can be secreted by cells by a non-classical pathway <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and can act as an autocrine growth factor as well as displaying co-cytokine activity augmenting the effects of other cytokines <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Extracellular Trx1 may be bound to the external cell membrane where it may participate in and regulate cell to cell contact and contribute to redox regulation in the extracellular space <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Redox processes in the extracellular environment that involve Trx1 have also been linked to regulation of cellular processes that encompass cell differentiation, proliferation and death <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. This leads to the possibility that Trx1 may also control the progression or metastatic pathways of cancer cells through an extracellular activity <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. A recent study showed that Trx1 is present at high levels in the serum of breast cancer patients <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and it is therefore feasible for Trx1 to have extracellular roles in breast cancer.</p><p>This study defines the active site of Trx1 as required for stimulating cancer cell invasion and migration. Inhibition of the Trx1 system through the addition of auranofin, an inhibitor of TrxR1, also decreased the cell migration capacity of the breast cancer cells. We also show that tumor tissue isolated from breast cancer patients has higher Trx1 and TrxR1 expression than from the paired normal tissue. Patients with high Trx1 and TrxR1 expression levels were also shown to have poor outcomes in terms of overall survival, distant-metastasis free survival, and disease free survival.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Cells and reagents</title><p>The human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231 was obtained from Prof. Erik Thompson (Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane Australia).

At the start of each experiment, the distance migrated by cells for each scratch-closure was designated as 0. The distance migrated was calculated for 24 and 48&#x000a0;h based on the reduction of the scratch width with respect to the 0&#x000a0;hour time point.

We prepared a forest plot (<xref rid="f0045" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>) to identify any association between the Trx1 system and the overall survival (OS) of patients, distant-metastasis free survival (DMFS) and disease free survival (DFS) in each of these independent cohorts. Overall survival refers to the time interval until breast cancer associated death whereas disease free survival refers to time before recurrence of breast cancers. DMFS refers to the time before any distant metastases are detected. In general, high levels of Trx1 and TrxR1 are associated with poor outcomes.

It is the process by which tumor cells detach from their primary tissue, migrate and establish secondary tumors <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, which can be far from the original tumor site and thus difficult to detect. The first stage of metastasis is the detachment of cells from the primary tumor and attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM), which requires chemotactic migration of cancer cells <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Subsequently there is degradation of the ECM and entry of the cells into the bloodstream <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. The next step is the extravasation of the cells from the circulation, degradation of the ECM of the secondary tissue and establishment of a tumor colony with subsequent proliferation <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. In this paper we have shown that the Trx1 system plays a role in cancer cell invasion, migration and colony formation.</p><p>The Trx1 system is highly expressed in breast tumors <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> and Trx1 has previously been suggested as a suitable serum marker and diagnostic marker for breast cancer <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Our paper extends these previous studies by using data obtained from a RNAseq database to show that both Trx1 and TrxR1 are expressed at statistically significant higher levels in breast tumor tissue compared to the paired normal tissue from the same patient (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). By limiting our analysis to the 114 patient samples that have paired data, a stronger association can be made between the higher expression of both Trx1 and TrxR1 in tumor tissue compared to normal tissue. This data suggests a role for the Trx1 system in breast cancer carcinogenesis. Since high expression levels of Trx1 protein had been previously correlated with the most aggressive and metastatic breast tumors <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> this current study was focused on refining the role of Trx1 in cancer cell invasion and migration.</p><p>Intracellular Trx1 had previously been shown to have a role in breast cancer cell invasion using <italic>in vitro</italic> invasion assays <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Our data confirms the role of intracellular Trx1 in invasion since decreasing the levels of Trx1 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells using either an antisense approach or through expressing a redox inactive Trx1 protein (1SS) resulted in decreased cell invasion. This current study also extended previous results by showing that there is a role for extracellular Trx1 in breast cancer cell invasion. Addition of wild type recombinant human Trx1 to the bottom well of the invasion chamber resulted in increased cell invasion in a bell-shaped dose response. This shows that Trx1 enhances the motility of breast cancer cells.</p><p>Our results also suggest that the redox active site of Trx1 is important for its extracellular role in cancer cell invasion. A specific monoclonal antibody (9G9) that binds to Trx1, and inhibits its redox function, resulted in significantly decreased cell invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells. A specific monoclonal antibody (2B1) that binds to Trx1, but does not interfere with its redox function did not have any effect on cell invasion. The 9G9 antibody was able to inhibit cell invasion when added to either the top or the bottom well of the chamber, with no exogenous Trx1 added (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). When added to the bottom chamber it is likely that the antibody is inhibiting the action of secreted Trx1, thereby reducing breast cancer cell motility. When added to the top well the antibody may be acting on either secreted Trx1 or on any cell surface bound Trx1. Extracellular Trx1 has also been shown to destabilize the basement membrane by reducing laminin and affecting its interaction with galectin-3 in Matrigel based assays, thereby promoting endothelial cell proliferation and spreading <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. This effect was found to be dependent on the Trx1 redox activity and was not observed when the 1SS redox inactive Trx1 mutant was added <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. In the extracellular environment Trx1 was also shown to tip the balance towards MMP function <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. This suggests that extracellular Trx1 could be a therapeutic target to reduce the invasion and therefore metastasis of breast cancer cells.</p><p>Cell migration is an important part of the metastatic process and since Trx1 was shown to have a role in invasion, we therefore investigated whether Trx1 could be implicated in the migration of breast cancer cells. A low dose of a Trx1 inhibitor, PX-12, resulted in decreased cell migration of colorectal cancer cells <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, raising the possibility that Trx1 may have a role in regulating cancer cell migration. Whether this role involves either intracellular or extracellular Trx1 in cancer cell migration was not established in the previously published study <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. However, PX-12 is not a suitable drug for testing against MDA-MB-231 cells <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. We therefore modulated the levels of intracellular Trx1 through the transfection of constructs that over-expressed wild type Trx1 and also the redox inactive 1SS. Over-expression of intracellular Trx1 had no statistically significant effect on cell migration, but intracellular expression of 1SS resulted in statistically significantly decreased cell migration. It is possible that the endogenous Trx1 levels were sufficient to stimulate the migration of cells and therefore the Trx1 protein over-expressed from the transgene did not exhibit any additional effect on the cell migration. This may be the reason why the distance migrated by pGFP-Trx cells as well as the ROS levels in these cells were similar to those observed for the pIRES-EGFP control cells. Furthermore, 1SS over-expression may be blocking the endogenous Trx1 by acting as a competitive inhibitor for TrxR1 in the intracellular environment. Therefore, a decrease in cell migration was observed compared to cells transfected with only the vector.</p><p>Extracellular Trx1 levels were modified by adding either recombinant human wild type Trx1 or 1SS. Addition of wild type Trx1 enhanced migration while addition of the equivalent concentration of 1SS had no effect on migration of cells. This result correlates with the chemotactic properties exhibited by Trx1, but not by 1SS, towards monocytes and polymorphonuclear neutrophils <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Exogenously added 1SS has previously been shown to be incapable of binding to the cell surface of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells, whereas wild type Trx1 was able to bind, suggesting that a disulfide bond is involved in cell surface binding <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Therefore, exogenously added 1SS may have failed to enhance cell migration because it lacks the ability to interact with Trx1 cell surface targets. Overall these data suggest that the redox site of Trx1 is required for both its intracellular and extracellular functions with respect to cell migration.</p><p>Auranofin is a gold-containing compound known to inhibit TrxR activity <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> and has previously been shown to inhibit proliferation of cancer cell lines, including the MDA-MB-231 cell line <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Currently auranofin is being tested in phase I/II clinical trials for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic leukemia and prolymphocytic lymphoma <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. Auranofin was reported to decrease VEGF mRNA levels of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and decreased endothelial cell migration in monolayer scratch assays. In a separate study, auranofin was shown to down-regulate the VEGFR3-mediated migration of endothelial cells <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. We therefore tested auranofin on the migration of breast cancer cells. Addition of auranofin was shown to inhibit the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells, compared to untreated cells, at the 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M concentration, at which TrxR activity was inhibited without an effect on cell proliferation. This result suggests that inhibiting TrxR activity is a possible therapeutic strategy for targeting the cell migration component of the cancer metastatic process.</p><p>Clonogenic assays were also performed to assess if pre-treatment with auranofin has any effect on the ability of breast cancer cells to form secondary colonies in a drug-free environment. Pre-treatment with auranofin resulted in an inhibition of colony formation at the higher concentration (2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M), which correlated with the concentration of auranofin that inhibited cell migration. Therefore, auranofin can target two components of the metastatic pathway, cell migration and colonization.</p><p>We showed that high levels of Trx1 and TrxR1 expression are correlated with poor patient outcomes in terms of survival and metastases formation. A previous study showed that TrxR1 and thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) are associated with prognosis in breast cancer <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. High levels of TrxR1 were associated with worse metastasis free survival, disease free survival and overall survival. In contrast high levels of TXNIP were associated with better metastasis-free survival <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Our results were based on the analysis of data from a much larger sample size comprising 25 independent cohorts containing a total of 5910 patient samples, including 1071 RNA seq samples from the TCGA database. We found similar results to the previous study in that high levels of TrxR1 are associated with a poor patient prognosis. TrxR1 is strongly associated with poor outcomes in terms of overall survival, disease free survival and distant metastasis free survival in all of the independent cohorts. We also assessed the link between Trx and breast cancer prognosis. Our results support the previous smaller study in showing that Trx was associated with worse metastasis free survival <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, although not all independent cohorts were statistically significant in our study. In addition to the metastasis free survival reported in the previous study, we also assessed disease free survival and overall survival, with high levels of Trx again associated with a poor prognosis. However statistical significance associating Trx 1 with a poor prognosis was obtained for a lower number of cohorts than that observed for TrxR1, indicating that TrxR1 may be a better prognostic indicator.</p><p>The association of high levels of Trx1 and TrxR1 expression with both survival and formation of distant metastases correlates with its roles in <italic>in vitro</italic> cancer cell invasion and migration as shown in this current study.
