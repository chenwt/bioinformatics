This integration is hypothesized to mediate sensing of ECM rigidity, but parsing the function of nucleus-cytoskeleton linkage from other mechanisms has remained a central challenge. Here we took advantage of the fact that the LINC (linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton) complex is a known molecular linker of the nucleus to the cytoskeleton, and asked how it regulates the sensitivity of genome-wide transcription to substratum rigidity. We show that gene mechanosensitivity is preserved after LINC disruption, but reversed in direction. Combined with myosin inhibition studies, we identify genes that depend on nuclear tension for their regulation. We also show that LINC disruption does not attenuate nuclear shape sensitivity to substrate rigidity. Our results show for the first time that the LINC complex facilitates mechano-regulation of expression across the genome.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Mechanical rigidity of the extracellular matrix regulates cell spreading, migration, proliferation and differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.

SUN1L was selected for LINC perturbation instead of GFP-KASH4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> due it its increased efficacy in inducible stables (data not shown). We confirmed the successful perturbation of the LINC complex based on observed mislocalization of nesprin-3 at the nuclear envelope compared with KDEL and non-induced SUN1L cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). By pulling directly on the nucleus with nanoNewton forces in living, adherent fibroblasts, and quantifying the extent of nuclear deformation, we have previously shown that the elastic linkage between the nucleus and the cytoskeleton is altered in fibroblasts upon expression of SUN1L<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. We chose NIH 3T3 fibroblasts as they are a well-established model system for cellular sensing of substrate rigidity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. To expose cells to a controlled mechanical stimulus, we used the approach in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> of culturing cells on gels of controlled rigidity (a stiffness of 1&#x02009;kPa was termed &#x02018;soft&#x02019; and that of 308&#x02009;kPa was termed &#x02018;stiff&#x02019;). We have recently demonstrated with this system that fibroblasts sense substrate rigidity and not differences in surface ligand presentation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.

These interacting genes have two attributes: (1) they are mechanosensitive, and (2) their mechanosensitivity (<italic>MS</italic><sub><italic>gene</italic></sub>) is altered upon SUN1L expression. We further classified these genes based on how their mechanosensitivity, <italic>MS</italic><sub><italic>gene</italic></sub>, changed upon LINC disruption, by computing the ratio of mechanosensitivities in SUN1L cells over KDEL cells (<inline-formula id="d33e405"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e406" xlink:href="srep38063-m1.jpg"/></inline-formula>).

Inhibiting non-muscle myosin II caused significant changes in several genes in KDEL (control) cells (identified by requiring a minimum two-fold change, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 16</xref>). We compared this list with the list of genes that change by at least two-fold in response to SUN1L expression in cells cultured on the stiff substrate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The intersection of these two sets identifies genes that change similarly (in terms of direction and a minimum magnitude) in response to the two perturbations- myosin inhibition and LINC disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 17</xref>). These myosin tension-dependent genes likely require an intact LINC complex for their regulation.</p><p>We performed a further intersection analysis of LINC and myosin-dependent genes with the 194 genes that interact between substrate rigidity and SUN1L expression. We found a few interacting genes that change similarly (in direction and a minimum magnitude) in all three perturbations (LINC disruption, Y27, and blebbistatin treatment), which we further classify as genes that depend on actomyosin forces on the nucleus for their mechanosensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 21</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification of LINC-dependent miRNAs</title><p>It is becoming increasingly clear that there are mechanosensitive miRNAs which mediate cellular responses to mechanical stimuli like shear stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and matrix strain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. We explored the role of the LINC complex in mediating miRNA sensitivity to substrate rigidity by performing miRNA-sequencing. Upon SUN1L expression, the number of miRNAs that changed were four-fold larger on the soft substrate compared with the stiff substrate (compare <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 10</xref>).</p><p>We integrated the miRNA and the mRNA datasets from the same samples by performing gene target analysis between experimentally observed differentially expressed mRNAs and miRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 11&#x02013;12 and 18&#x02013;19</xref>) using IPA software.

To test whether changes in overall nuclear shape correlated with LINC-dependent changes in gene expression, we measured nuclear shapes in SUN1L and KDEL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A and B</xref>) by confocal microscopy according to our previous methods<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.

Mechanical stresses on the nucleus whether generated within the cytoskeleton or transmitted through the cytoskeleton from the cell membrane, have been shown to induce chromatin remodeling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, promote DNA repair<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, promote motion of intranuclear organelles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> and cause direct dissociation of protein complexes inside nuclei<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. These studies suggest that extracellular mechanical cues might regulate gene expression in part by impacting stresses on the nuclear surface. This hypothesis has proven difficult to test, owing to the lack of methods to interfere with nuclear mechanical stresses.</p><p>Here we showed that an integrated nucleus-cytoskeleton regulates genome-wide transcriptional response to substrate rigidity. What explains the observed dependence of gene mechanosensitivity on the LINC complex? One possibility is that nuclear shape affects chromatin conformation mechanically (as chromatin is linked to the nuclear lamina<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>), and therefore affects accessibility of genes to transcription factors. Healy and coworkers have demonstrated for example that nucleus shapes correlate with the expression of two genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>; although a causal linkage between nucleus shape and gene expression has never been directly established. As we showed here, while nucleus shape is sensitive to the rigidity of the substrate, there are only weak effects of SUN1L expression on this sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A and B</xref>). It appears unlikely that the subtle differences in nuclear shape on a given substrate due to SUN1L expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>) causes mechanical modulation of the large number of genes because of chromatin distortion at a global level. These results of course do not rule out the general possibility that nuclear shape changes may impact gene expression in other contexts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>.</p><p>We note that Khatau <italic>et al</italic>. and Kim <italic>et al</italic>. have suggested that the formation of the actin cap governs nuclear shaping, and the actin cap itself is dependent on the LINC complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Li <italic>et al</italic>. have shown that nuclear flattening occurs early during cell spreading when apical stress fibers are absent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Moreover, this flattening is independent of myosin activity. They showed that the extent of nuclear flattening is proportional to the extent of cell spreading; any perturbation which prevents cell spreading will prevent nuclear flattening on stiff substrates. In the experiments reported here, SUN1L expression did not affect cell spreading on stiff substrates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>), and predictably nuclear shape was not substantially changed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>). LINC disruption did not necessarily cause rounded nuclear shapes consistent with previous findings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p><p>An alternative possibility is that <italic>direct</italic> mechanical force transfer to the nucleus impacts genome organization and affects gene expression.

We therefore speculate that local force transfer from the cytoskeleton to the nucleus may enable regulation of at least a sub-set of the genes reported here.</p><p>The LINC complex could alternatively regulate transcriptional regulation through non-mechanical mechanisms, such as changes in signaling pathways putatively mediated by the LINC complex. However, our identification of genes that are common to myosin inhibition and LINC disruption suggests a list of genes that likely depend directly on actomyosin tension exerted on the nucleus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref> for their mechanosensitivity. We have previously shown that SUN1L expression softens the integrated nucleus-cytoskeleton in fibroblasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, which likely indicates altered forces on the nucleus. A softer nucleo-cytoskeleton may thus play an important role in gene expression.</p><p>Our findings that LINC disruption affects genes in a broad class of cellular processes, including adhesion, motility, ion transport and wound healing highlight the physiological role of the LINC complex. Cytoskeletal, adhesion and nuclear genes are altered upon LINC disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 3 and 4</xref>) which is consistent with the primary function that is attributed to the LINC complex- of linking the cytoskeleton to the nucleoskeleton. It is possible that the LINC complex reinforces nucleus-cytoskeletal linkage in response to mechanical cues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref> which leads to an upregulation of key components of the cytoskeleton and the nucleus. This is also significant because disruptions in the LINC complex can lead to functional mechanical defects at the tissue and organismal levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Generation of stable cell lines</title><p>By PCR cloning we generated pRetroX.Tight.puro retroviral vectors containing either the SUN1L<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> or KDEL, the latter in which GFP replaced the HA-SUN1L protein to serve as a control.
