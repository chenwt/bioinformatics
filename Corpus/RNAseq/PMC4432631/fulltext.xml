To overcome this limitation, here we generate <italic>E. coli</italic> strains capable of recognizing heterologous promoters by expressing heterologous sigma factors. Among seven sigma factors tested, RpoD from <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> (<italic>Lpl</italic>) appears to be able of initiating transcription from all sources of DNA. Using the promoter GFP-trap concept, we successfully screen several heterologous and metagenomic DNA libraries, thus enlarging the genomic space that can be functionally sampled in <italic>E. coli</italic>. For an application, we show that screening fosmid-based <italic>Lpl</italic> genomic libraries in an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain with a chromosomally integrated <italic>Lpl rpoD</italic> enables the identification of <italic>Lpl</italic> genetic determinants imparting strong ethanol tolerance in <italic>E. coli</italic>.

With fewer than 1&#x00025; of the organisms having being successfully cultured in the laboratory so far<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, this enormous genetic diversity can be harvested best in the form of metagenomic libraries<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Effective functional screening of metagenomic libraries can unlock the hidden potential of the genetic diversity in nature and lead to the identification of novel or potent enzymatic activities as well as cellular programs, which could be used to engineer superior strains for biotechnological applications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Effective screening of metagenomic libraries &#x02018;is grossly limited by the ability of the organism that is hosting the metagenomic library to express genes from anonymous organisms represented in the library'<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. This is largely attributed to the inability of the transcriptional machinery of the host organism to recognize promoters from the metagenome and possibly also translate metagenomic transcripts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. A similar situation prevents expansion of the genomic space that can be explored in the context of genome engineering<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, whereby, so far, the genomic diversity that can be generated and screened for developing useful strains is confined to mutational perturbations of single genomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. As a result, novel genes, genetic programs or pathways outside single genomes are largely not accessible.</p><p>A larger functional sample space (defined as the fraction of expressed genes from a given genomic space) is a prerequisite for successful activity-based or trait-based screening. Large-insert libraries, such as fosmid-based and bacterial artificial chromosome-based genomic libraries, maximize the genomic space<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, but only if those heterologous genes are expressed in the host. Due to its well-developed genetic toolbox, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is the preferred host for screening large-insert genomic libraries. However, expression of heterologous DNA in <italic>E. coli</italic> is limited<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> and depends mostly on the recognition of the foreign promoter by the sigma factor subunits of the RNA-polymerase (RNAP) of <italic>E. coli</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Thus, enabling <italic>E. coli</italic> to recognize a larger fraction of heterologous promoters would increase the functional sample space and enable efficient screening of heterologous DNA libraries, a strategy identified as an important goal for enabling efficient screening of metagenomic libraries<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. While a known and long standing issue, no reports have described success to this end, to the best of our knowledge.</p><p>Here we report a strategy to enable effective screening of heterologous genomic libraries in <italic>E. coli</italic> by expressing heterologous sigma factors. Our hypothesis is that, when expressing heterologous sigma factors, the core RNAP of the host (here <italic>E. coli</italic>) can be recruited to initiate the transcription from heterologous promoters. We show that the expression of the <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> (<italic>Lpl</italic>) RpoD increases the functional genomic space in <italic>E. coli</italic>, as quantified by green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression using five heterologous genome-wide, promoter GFP-trap libraries. <italic>Lpl</italic> RpoD increases the GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> population in all the five libraries tested, which were constructed from phylogenetically diverse genomes, namely, those of <italic>Lpl</italic>, <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<italic>Bsu</italic>), <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic> (<italic>Dra</italic>), <italic>Clostridium pasteurianum</italic> (<italic>Cpa</italic>) and <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic> (<italic>Cac</italic>). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the concept works well for a metagenomic library composed of DNA extracted from soil. As a proof of concept for how such effective screening of heterologous genomic libraries can be applied to generate novel complex traits, we expressed a fosmid-based <italic>Lpl</italic> genomic library with large inserts and then screened for genetic loci imparting ethanol tolerance to <italic>E. coli</italic>. We show increased transcripts from heterologous genes located on a fosmid imparting ethanol tolerance. Ethanol tolerance is a complex trait of industrial importance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> that has attracted considerable attention<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, and has been also employed as a model phenotype for the tool development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. <italic>Lpl</italic> is one of the most ethanol, butanol and generally alcohol and solvent-tolerant organisms known<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>.

To this effect, for each of five phylogenetically diverse genomes, we constructed promoter GFP-trap libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), similar to what was previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. The five genome-wide heterologous libraries were LPL-trap, BSU-trap, DRA-trap, CPA-trap and CAC-trap libraries, which were constructed from the <italic>Lpl</italic>, <italic>Bsu</italic>, <italic>Dra</italic>, <italic>Cpa</italic> and <italic>Cac</italic> genomes, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). For clarity, we describe the construction and properties of these libraries based on the LPL-trap and LPL<sup>lac</sup>-trap libraries. The latter was constructed from the <italic>Lpl</italic> genome as a positive control to quantify transcriptional termination within the genomic fragments, and serves as a validation for the proposed concept (described below and in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>).</p><p>LPL libraries were constructed from randomly sheared fragments of genomic <italic>Lpl</italic> DNA with an eightfold genomic coverage (Methods). Sequencing of 10 randomly selected inserts confirmed an average insert size of 726&#x02009;bp (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>), purposefully chosen to be smaller than the average gene size in prokaryotes (of about 924&#x02009;bp (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>)) to maximize the number of DNA fragments that contain promoters that are not followed by transcriptional terminators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>). The library insert was fused in front of a promoterless GFP gene (<italic>gfp</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), which was optimized for translation by incorporating three frame stop codons and a ribosomal binding site in front of the gene. Thus, transcription initiated inside a library insert leads to expression of <italic>gfp</italic> and the resulting green fluorescence is used as a direct measure of transcription from <italic>Lpl</italic> promoters. Flow cytometry (FC) analyzes this fluorescent signal from individual library clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>) and, thus, the expression profile of the libraries can be acquired in a high-throughput fashion to quantify the fraction of <italic>Lpl</italic> promoters recognized by <italic>E. coli.</italic> Random fragmentation of genomic DNA (gDNA) generates a collection of different inserts containing promoters, terminators as well as DNA of open-reading frames (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). We first tested the validity of our FC assay by analysing the GFP expression profile of the LPL<sup>lac</sup>-trap library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Here the isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG)-inducible <italic>E. coli lac</italic> promoter, P<sub>lac</sub>, is placed upstream of the library insert to initiate transcription leading to GFP expression if no terminator is present in the insert. We performed a simulation based on the LPL-trap and LPL<sup>lac</sup>-trap libraries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>) and we estimated that 62&#x00025; of the LPL<sup>lac</sup>-trap fragments would lead to GFP expression on IPTG induction. Experimentally, we observed that the fraction of GFP-expressing cells increased steadily to a maximum of 54&#x00025;, 7&#x02009;h post induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). While lower than predicted (see discussion in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>), this demonstrates that our FC assay is conservatively valid.</p><p>To establish the baseline of <italic>Lpl</italic> promoter expression in unmodified <italic>E. coli</italic>, we determined the fraction of library inserts containing an <italic>Lpl</italic> promoter that is recognized by the native <italic>E. coli</italic> RNAP following the GFP expression profile of the LPL-trap library when co-transformed with the control plasmid (pControl). A maximum of 6.5&#x00025; of the library population became GFP-positive 7&#x02009;h post induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), indicating that some <italic>Lpl</italic> promoters are recognized by the native <italic>E. coli</italic> RNAP.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Heterologous sigma factors enable recognition of foreign promoters</title><p>Using the LPL-trap library, we investigated whether expressing the major sigma factor of <italic>L. plantarum</italic> (RpoD) can increase the fraction of <italic>Lpl</italic> promoters recognized by <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). <italic>Lpl rpoD</italic> is one of only three sigma factor genes in the <italic>Lpl</italic> genome and whose regulon encompasses 99&#x00025; of all <italic>Lpl</italic> genes The LPL-trap library was co-transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> together with the <italic>Lpl rpoD</italic> expressing plasmid (pLPL&#x003c3;) and the GFP profile of the resulting library population was followed after induction of <italic>Lpl rpoD</italic> expression. <italic>Lpl rpoD</italic> expression was verified via PCR with reverse transcription (RT&#x02013;PCR; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). A steady increase of GFP-positive cells was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>) reaching, 7&#x02009;h post induction, a maximum of 23&#x00025;, which represents a 3.5-fold increase of GFP-expressing cells compared with the plasmid control strain (pControl; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Simulation analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>) estimates that 25&#x00025; of all inserts in LPL-trap library carry an <italic>Lpl</italic> promoter upstream of <italic>gfp</italic>, which, if recognized by the host, would result in GFP expression. Thus, this 23&#x00025; fraction compares favourably with the predicted maximum of 25&#x00025; (see above and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>) and suggests that most of the <italic>Lpl</italic> promoters in the library can be recognized by the engineered <italic>E. coli</italic> strain. To rule out the possibility that the <italic>Lpl</italic> RpoD initiates transcription from the backbone of the GFP-trap library vector, we tested GFP-trap plasmids that contained random synthetic DNA fragments as inserts, which contained neither a promoter nor a terminator and the GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> population was small (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>To investigate whether this increased promoter recognition is the specific result of expressing <italic>Lpl rpoD</italic> or whether overexpression of any sigma factor could have the same effect, expression plasmids containing the major sigma factors from <italic>E. coli</italic> (pECO&#x003c3;, expressing the <italic>E. coli rpoD</italic>), <italic>Cac</italic> (pCAC&#x003c3;, expressing the <italic>Cac sigA</italic>) and <italic>Bsu</italic> (pBSU&#x003c3;, expressing the <italic>Bsu sigA</italic>) were individually transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> together with the LPL-trap library and the GFP profiles examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Overexpression of either <italic>E. coli</italic> RpoD or <italic>Cac</italic> SigA resulted in decreased <italic>Lpl</italic> promoter recognition. However, expression of <italic>Bsu</italic> SigA together with the LPL-trap library led to increased GFP expression up to 11&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). While not as substantial an increase as with pLPL&#x003c3;, this suggests that cross recognition of heterologous promoters by different sigma factors is possible; this is pursued further below. We also demonstrated that chromosomal integration of <italic>Lpl rpoD</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 4 and 5</xref>) leads to enhanced <italic>Lpl</italic> promoter recognition, although fractionally less than what was achieved by plasmid-based <italic>Lpl rpoD</italic> expression. Furthermore, we found that expression of an alternative <italic>Lpl</italic> sigma factor (RpoN, with a 21 gene regulon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) slightly but not significantly (<italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>-value=0.089) further increased <italic>Lpl</italic> promoter recognition in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cross species promoter recognition</title><p>Metagenomic libraries generated from a mixed population of organisms contain a large genomic diversity of promoters. Thus, effective screening of such libraries requires the recognition of a large set of such diverse promoters. We examined whether <italic>E. coli</italic> transcription from heterologous promoters from multiple organisms (<italic>Lpl</italic>, <italic>Bsu</italic>, <italic>Cpa</italic>, <italic>Dra</italic> and <italic>Cac</italic>) could be initiated by expressing one or a few foreign sigma factors; this would require substantial promoter cross recognition. To do so, we co-transformed a sigma factor expression plasmid (pLPL&#x003c3; or pBSU&#x003c3;) along with an individual library (BSU-trap, CPA-trap, CAC-trap and DRA-trap) and monitored GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b&#x02013;e</xref>). We observed a large range in the baseline of the GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> population with the control (empty) pControl strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b&#x02013;e</xref>), likely due to the phylogenetic distances between these organisms (including their G&#x0002b;C content) and the average library insert size (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, discussion in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 6</xref>). However, in each case, the strain expressing <italic>Lpl rpoD</italic> showed a large increase in promoter recognition compared to control.

The <italic>Lpl rpoD</italic> expressing strain outperformed the <italic>Bsu sigA</italic> except for equivalent performance on BSU trap.</p><p>In addition, we also tested the impact of expressing the main sigma factors from <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic>, <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> subsp. <italic>lactis</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus brevis</italic> (the latter two containing only three sigma factors each, like <italic>Lpl</italic>). In each of these cases, however, no increased GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> population was observed for any of the GFP-trap libraries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>) showing the unique capabilities of <italic>Lpl</italic> RpoD.</p><p>Overexpressing multiple heterologous sigma factors did not provide a benefit in terms of expanding promoter recognition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 7</xref>), and significantly, had a profound negative effect on <italic>E. coli</italic> growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p>To generalize the concept and its impact, using DNA extracted from soil, we constructed a metagenomic GFP-trap library, which contained prokaryotic and fungal DNA and had a high (61&#x00025;) G&#x0002b;C content (Methods).

This powerfully demonstrates that the <italic>Lpl</italic> RpoD sigma factor can be used to access a wide range of promoters originating from different species.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Expression of <italic>Lpl rpoD</italic> alters <italic>E. coli's</italic> transcriptional program</title><p>Our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>) show that <italic>Lpl</italic> RpoD recruits the <italic>E. coli</italic> RNAP components to initiate transcription from <italic>Lpl</italic> and other heterologous promoters. We observed a negative effect on growth in the <italic>Lpl rpoD</italic> expression strain, similar to what was observed with overexpression of the native RpoD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 8</xref>). This suggests that <italic>Lpl</italic> RpoD competes with native <italic>E. coli</italic> sigma factors to recruit the RNAP complex. One would expect that this competition would affect the native <italic>E. coli</italic> transcriptome. We investigated whether this would affect primarily the regulon of the <italic>Lpl</italic> RpoD counterpart, <italic>E. coli</italic> sigma factor 70, or all sigma factor regulons. Microarray-based transcriptional analysis was carried out to compare the transcriptional programs of <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 strains carrying pLPL&#x003c3; and pControl, respectively. The two strains were grown in parallel under IPTG induction, and samples were taken in exponential, transitional and stationary culture phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>) for microarray analysis, whereby significant expression differences were identified via a one-class time course SAM analysis (Methods).

After 12&#x02009;h of exposure to ethanol, 10&#x02009;ml of cultures were transferred into fresh media and allowed to recover for 12&#x02013;24&#x02009;h until the next ethanol exposure. Serial dilutions were plated after each phase to isolate individual clones and growth as well as ethanol concentrations were monitored throughout the serial enrichment. Two culture replicates of the control strain MG1655(FosC/pLPL&#x003c3;-2) died out after the second or third exposure. Clones with increased survival were isolated after the third exposure phase from the MG1655(FosLp/pLPL&#x003c3;-2) culture. Among 18 clones tested (15 of which showed increased tolerance, 2 sequenced and found unique) for survival in 7&#x00025; v/v ethanol (Methods), clone 10T31 (Fos10T31) consistently showed the highest survival. Sequencing Fos10T31 revealed a 30-kb insert spanning the <italic>Lpl</italic> chromosomal locus 3,176,475-3,206,327 (NCBI Ref-Seq accession code NC_004567) containing several annotated genes with a potential role in ethanol tolerance. Ethanol tolerance is a complex phenotype involving several potential mechanisms, including mechanisms involving stress proteins, molecular pumps, DNA-repair proteins, altered membrane properties and energy metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Here we found genes encoding transporters (<italic>araP</italic>, lp_3563 and lp_3565), two membrane proteins (lp_3575 and lp_3577), proteins associated with energy metabolism (<italic>lox</italic> and <italic>pox4</italic>), as well as two proteins (catalase (<italic>kat</italic>)) and a heat-shock protein (<italic>clpL</italic>)) involved in stress response.</p><p>To verify that the observed ethanol tolerance is not the result of spontaneous mutations introduced during the ethanol exposure, Fos10T31 and FosC were retransformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 <italic>lacZ::rpoD</italic> (<italic>rpoD</italic> integration was to ensure stable strains for tolerance assays) never exposed to ethanol. Ethanol survival of <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 <italic>lacZ::rpoD</italic> expressing Fos10T31 was 5.7-fold and 13.9-fold higher after a 24 and 48&#x02009;h exposure to 7&#x00025; (v/v) ethanol, respectively, than the control strain expressing FosC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Thus, the observed ethanol tolerance is a specific effect of the genes on Fos10T31. Furthermore, the effect of Fos10T31 was tested in the WT MG1655. Without <italic>Lpl rpoD</italic> expression, the increase in tolerance of the Fos10T31 strain compared with the FosC strain to 7&#x00025; ethanol was reduced to 1.3-fold and 1.4-fold (statistically insignificant, <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>-value&#x0003e;0.05, ) at 24 and 48&#x02009;h, respectively. Thus, <italic>Lpl rpoD</italic> expression greatly increases the screening sensitivity to identify beneficial genomic loci. Note that the absolute survival in MG1655 <italic>lacZ::rpoD</italic> for both Fos10T31 and FosC is lower than in the WT strain. This reflects the impact of <italic>Lpl rpoD</italic> expression in competing with the <italic>E. coli</italic> sigma factors, and notably with &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> (RpoS), which protects the cells from many toxic-chemical stresses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. We found that overexpression of <italic>Lpl rpoD</italic> has a significant effect on growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 8</xref>), which we hypothesized derives from the competition for the remaining RNAP components between the native and <italic>Lpl</italic> RpoD. To test this hypothesis, we examined the impact of <italic>Lpl</italic> RpoD expression on the expressed regulons of the native <italic>E. coli</italic> sigma factors. Indeed, <italic>Lpl</italic> RpoD expression affected the expression of over a third of the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome, spread evenly over all sigma factor regulons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b&#x02013;d</xref>). This is not, however, a problem in developing the tolerant phenotype in that once the specific <italic>Lpl</italic> genes that impart tolerance are identified with further subcloning, they can be expressed off native <italic>E. coli</italic> promoters without the need for <italic>Lpl rpoD</italic> expression in final strain.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>RNA-seq shows expression of <italic>Lpl</italic> genes is enabled by <italic>Lpl</italic> RpoD</title><p>The data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref> show that <italic>Lpl</italic> RpoD enables superior expression of genes from <italic>Lpl</italic> libraries, and that increased expression of <italic>Lpl</italic> genes from Fos10T31 imparts ethanol tolerance. To confirm and detail these conclusions, we performed strand-specific RNA-seq transcriptome analysis of <italic>Lpl</italic> genes in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Four cultures were grown in LB in biological duplicates: MG1655(FosC), MG1655(Fos10T31), MG1655 <italic>lacZ::rpoD</italic>(FosC) and MG1655 <italic>lacZ::rpoD</italic>(Fos10T31). These cultures were induced for 6&#x02009;h with IPTG at which time samples were taken for RNA-seq analysis. RNA was used to make strand-specific RNA-seq libraries, which were sequenced using HiSeq 2500 (Illumina). Reads were aligned to both the <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 and <italic>Lpl</italic> WCFS1 genomes and normalized reads per kilobase per million (RPKM) calculated. A negligible number of reads aligned to the <italic>Lpl</italic> genome from samples with FosC (with the exception of MG1655 <italic>lacZ::rpoD</italic>(FosC), where reads aligned to <italic>Lpl rpoD</italic>, as expected).</p><p>Out of the 29 <italic>Lpl</italic> genes (most of which are coded on the negative strand) on the Fos10T31 insert, 18 were expressed higher (based on coding strand RPKM, <italic>q</italic>-value&#x0003c;0.05) in MG1655 <italic>lacZ::rpoD</italic>(Fos10T31) compared with MG1655(Fos10T31) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Only one gene, <italic>Lpl araP</italic>, was expressed higher in MG1655. Compared with MG1655, three times as many Fos10T31 genes in MG1655 <italic>lacZ::rpoD</italic> had above average RPKM (19.6) values; this is consistent with LPL-trap data where 3.5 times as many clones were GFP positive in the strain expressing <italic>Lpl</italic> RpoD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). <italic>Lpl</italic> RpoD enables transcription from both coding and noncoding strands of the Fos10T31 insert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). This is not unusual and takes place natively in most prokaryotic genomes as has been recently reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. These data also will make possible to select a subset of Fos10T31 genes (those with the highest differential expression between the two strains; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>) for screening to identify those responsible for the tolerant phenotype.</p><p>We also examined the change in the <italic>E. coli</italic> transcriptome when the <italic>Lpl</italic> RpoD was expressed from a single chromosomal copy. Using our strand-specific RNAseq data, we compared the transcription profiles of MG1655(Fos10T31) and MG1655 <italic>lacZ</italic>::<italic>rpoD</italic>(Fos10T31). Similar to above, we observed differential expression of 41&#x00025; of <italic>E. coli</italic> genes (1767 genes, <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>-value <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Of those, 20&#x00025; (346 genes) had greater than twofold change in either direction (118 upregulated and 228 downregulated). To address whether expression of <italic>Lpl</italic> RpoD results in different sites of transcription of foreign DNA, we asked whether there were a large number of novel and different transcripts observed in the <italic>Lpl</italic> RpoD expression strain compared with the control. To test, we randomly selected multiple 6-kb regions on the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome and documented the transcription profile from the <italic>Lpl</italic> RpoD expression strains compared with control strains (pre-normalized read density output from RNAseq experiments, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). While the quantitative output of RNAseq reads varies, the two strain types show extremely similar transcripts and transcription patterns with respect to where transcription is initiated and terminated. That is, the relative abundance of the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) was significantly altered between the two strains, but the same mRNA transcripts were present in both populations.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We demonstrated that, for the first time, the transcription machinery of <italic>E. coli</italic> (and in principle of any other host organism) can be engineered to recognize a large set of heterologous promoters, thus leading to increased expression of heterologous genes.

On the basis of the genome sizes of these organisms, we calculated that we require 13,820, 7,505, 13,350, 26,850 and 46,337 clones for 95&#x00025; coverage of LPL, BSU, DRA, CPA and CAC. Thus, based on the entry library clone count (the coverage limiting step), we estimate an 8.0-fold, 2.9-fold, 3.7-fold, 8.2-fold and 5.2-fold genome coverage for the LPL, BSU, DRA, CPA and CAC-trap libraries. The number of clones obtained after recombination was higher than the number of entry clones, thus genome coverage in the GFP-trap libraries was maintained. Finally, when the libraries were transformed into strains expressing sigma factors, we ensured that the transformants exceeded the number of clones in the entry library to prevent loss of genomic coverage. mgDNA was obtained from soil surrounding Delaware Biotechnology Institute using the PowerSoil DNA Isolation kit from MoBio. Isolated mgDNA was sheared with a Nebulizer kit (Invitrogen) and 500&#x02013;1,000-bp fragments were isolated via agarose gel purification. The META-trap library was constructed in the same manner as above. The average insert size was 609&#x02009;bp and the total library size was 6,350 clones</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Construction of the <italic>L. plantarum</italic> fosmid library</title><p>An <italic>Lpl</italic> fosmid library with inserts of about 35&#x02009;kb as well as a control fosmid, designated FosC, were constructed with the CopyControl Fosmid Library Production Kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA) yielding a library size of 4,679 clones, which corresponds to a 16.5-fold 95&#x00025; genome coverage (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).

DNA fragments were first end-repaired, and fragments of about 35&#x02009;kb (selected from an agarose gel) were ligated into the pCC1Fos backbone.

A total of 4,679 clones were obtained for this initial fosmid library.

On the basis of the c.f.u. of a serial dilution plated after pooling, the library was estimated to contain 1.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> clones.

The enrichment protocol was performed in parallel for the two cultures: the fosmid-library culture (MG1655(pLPL&#x003c3;-2, FosLp), squares and solid lines) and the control culture (MG1655(pLPL&#x003c3;-2, FosC), triangles and dashed lines). A clone (MG1655(pLPL&#x003c3;-2, Fos10T31)) with increased ethanol tolerance was isolated after plating a serial dilution following the third exposure phase.
