the PPR superfamily to participate in post-transcriptional processing of organellar RNA.
Loss of PPR8522 from maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) confers an
<italic>embryo-specific</italic> (<italic>emb</italic>) phenotype. The
<italic>emb8522</italic> mutation was isolated in an active <italic>Mutator</italic>
(<italic>Mu</italic>) population and co-segregation analysis revealed that it was
tightly linked to a <italic>MuDR</italic> insertion in the first exon of
<italic>PPR8522</italic>. Independent evidence that disruption of
<italic>PPR8522</italic> caused the <italic>emb</italic> phenotype was provided by fine
mapping to a region of 116kb containing no other gene than <italic>PPR8522</italic> and
complementation of the <italic>emb8522</italic> mutant by a <italic>PPR8522</italic> cDNA.
The deduced PPR8522 amino acid sequence of 832 amino acids contains 10 PPR repeats and a
chloroplast target peptide, the function of which was experimentally demonstrated by
transient expression in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>. Whereas mutant endosperm
is apparently normal, mutant embryos deviate from normal development as early as 3 days
after pollination, are reduced in size, exhibit more or less severe morphological
aberrations depending on the genetic background, and generally do not germinate. The
<italic>emb8522</italic> mutation is the first to associate the loss of a
<italic>PPR</italic> gene with an embryo-lethal phenotype in maize. Analyses of mutant
plantlets generated by embryo-rescue experiments indicate that <italic>emb8522</italic>
also affects vegetative plant growth and chloroplast development. The loss of chloroplast
transcription dependent on plastid-encoded RNA polymerase is the likely cause for the lack
of an organized thylakoid network and an albino, seedling-lethal phenotype.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words:</title><kwd>chloroplast</kwd><kwd>embryogenesis</kwd><kwd>Mutator</kwd><kwd>pentatricopeptide repeat</kwd><kwd>plastid-encoded RNA polymerase</kwd><kwd>Zea mays</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Maize is a crop species that presents a tremendous agronomic and economic interest. Today
60% of the world&#x02019;s nutrition is provided by the three cereals wheat, maize, and rice,
maize being the highest yielding species. Consequently the maize kernel has been at the
heart of substantial research efforts aimed at the understanding and manipulation of the
molecular mechanisms governing both its development and the accumulation of important
reserve substances such as oil in the embryo and starch in the endosperm. The mature embryo
consists of the embryo axis comprising the shoot and root primordia, which give rise to the
seedling, and the scutellum, a massive storage organ which is functionally equivalent to
cotyledons in dicots (<xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Sosso <italic>et al.</italic>,
2011</xref>). The highly differentiated embryo is elaborated from the single-celled zygote
in three major developmental events, which are the establishment of an apical-basal
polarity, the differentiation of the protoderm, and the formation of the shoot and root
meristems (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan and Cooke, 1997</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Maize embryo mutants have been collected and characterized since the
beginning of the last century (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Demerc, 1923</xref>;
<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Mangelsdorf, 1923</xref>) and have served as a
powerful tool for the identification of genes required for seed development (<xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">Vernoud <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Within the
large category of <italic>defective kernel</italic> (<italic>dek</italic>) mutants, which
show defects in either the embryo or the endosperm or both (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Demerc, 1923</xref>), the class of <italic>embryo-specific</italic>
(<italic>emb</italic>) mutants, in which only the embryo but not the endosperm is
affected, has attracted particular interest (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Clark and
Sheridan, 1991</xref>). In theory, mutations affecting only the embryo and not the
endosperm are less likely to concern housekeeping genes involved in basic cellular functions
or primary metabolism, because the loss of this type of gene should affect both the embryo
and the endosperm. Consequently the focus on <italic>emb</italic> rather than
<italic>dek</italic> mutants supposedly increases the likelihood of identifying genes
involved specifically in embryo development rather than in basic cellular metabolism.
Whereas numerous <italic>emb</italic> mutants have been isolated in maize (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Clark and Sheridan, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Sheridan and Clark, 1993</xref>), only 17 have been subject of a detailed
phenotypic characterization (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Sheridan and Thorstenson,
1986</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Heckel <italic>et al.</italic>,
1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Elster <italic>et al.</italic>,

2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Sosso <italic>et al.</italic>,
2011</xref>). The causal mutations have been identified for two <italic>emb</italic>
mutants, <italic>emb8516</italic> and <italic>lem1</italic>. Contrary to the expectation, in
both cases the mutations were found to affect housekeeping genes and more precisely nuclear
genes encoding subunits of plastid ribosomes (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Ma and
Dooner, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Magnard <italic>et al.</italic>,
2004</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Plastids are well known to play an important role in embryo
development, since in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> approximately 30% of all
<italic>embryo-defective</italic> (<italic>emb</italic>) mutations concern
plastid-targeted proteins (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Devic, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Bryant <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Among them, a
great number carried lesions in pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins, which are
characterized by the presence of the homonymous motif. The PPR motif is a degenerate 35
amino acids repeat sequence that is found in animal, fungal, and plant proteins (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Small and Peeters, 2000</xref>). The PPR protein family is
particularly large in plants, where the majority of the family members are predicted to be
targeted to mitochondria or chloroplasts (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Lurin
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) and to play a major role in the processing of
organellar RNAs (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Schmitz-Linneweber and Small,
2008</xref>). Chloroplast-targeted PPR proteins have also been functionally characterized
in maize, but the reported mutant phenotypes never concerned the seed. The
<italic>ppr2</italic> mutant shows an albino phenotype and lacks plastid rRNA and
translation products (<xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">Williams and Barkan, 2003</xref>).
Likewise, the <italic>ppr5</italic> mutant is deficient in chloroplast ribosomes and dies as
an albino seedling (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Beick <italic>et al.</italic>,
2008</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Lesions in other classes of chloroplast-targeted proteins have also
been shown to cause embryo lethal phenotypes. Among the first ones were the mutations in
glycyl-tRNA synthetase and chaperonin-60alpha, which lead to embryo lethality in the
<italic>embryo-defective development1</italic> (<italic>edd1</italic>) and
<italic>schlepperless</italic> (<italic>slp</italic>) mutants, respectively (<xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">Uwer <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Apuya <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Recently, a
comprehensive compilation of 119 genes coding for chloroplast-targeted proteins required for
embryo development suggested that three groups of proteins were frequently encountered: (i)
enzymes required for the biosynthesis of amino acids, vitamins, nucleotides, and fatty
acids, (ii) proteins required for the import, modification, and localization of essential
proteins in plastids and (iii) proteins required for plastid translation (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Bryant <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">In maize, embryo lethality has been reported for mutations in the
nuclear-encoded plastid ribosomal proteins PRPS9 and PRPL35, which cause an
<italic>embryo-specific</italic> phenotype affecting only the embryo and not the endosperm
(<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Ma and Dooner, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Magnard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). However, not all mutations
affecting plastid translation are lethal in maize. For example, the <italic>crs2</italic>,
<italic>caf1</italic>, or <italic>caf2</italic> mutants impaired in the splicing of the
plastid-encoded <italic>rpl16</italic>, <italic>rps16</italic>, and/or
<italic>rps12</italic> mRNAs produce viable albeit ivory seedlings (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Ostheimer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, all
non-photosynthetic maize mutants analysed so far produce viable seedlings and have not been
associated with embryo lethality (<xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Stern <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). The current report presents the molecular and phenotypic
characterization of <italic>emb8522</italic>, in which a mutation in
<italic>PPR8522</italic> causes an <italic>embryo-specific</italic> phenotype. The data
show that PPR8522 is a chloroplast-targeted PPR protein that is necessary for the
transcription of nearly all plastid-encoded genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Plant material and culture</title><p>The isolation of the <italic>emb8522</italic> mutation in stock R-scm2 (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Clark and Sheridan, 1991</xref>) and subsequent

line B73 provided by the Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://maizecoop.cropsci.uiuc.edu/">http://maizecoop.cropsci.uiuc.edu/</uri>). To

heterozygotes were always used as males and self-pollinated in parallel to the backcross
and scored for ears with a segregation ratio of 3:1 for wild-type:<italic>emb</italic>
phenotype kernels. For co-segregation and mapping, plants were grown under field
conditions at the ENS-Lyon (Lyon, France) or the SMH INRA field station (St. Martin de
Hinx, France). For all other purposes, plants were grown in a S2 greenhouse (authorized
for the culture of transgenic plants) with a 16/8 light/dark cycle (100 Wm-2) at 24/19
&#x000b0;C without control of the relative humidity. Seeds were germinated in 0.2 l Favorit
MP Godets substrate (Eriterre) and were transferred between 14 and 21 days after sowing to
10 l Favorit Argile substrate (Eriterre). For embryo-rescue experiments, immature embryos
were excised from caryopses at 16 days after pollination (DAP) and cultivated in the dark
at 22 &#x000b0;C on one of the following media: medium 1 (1% sucrose, 2.2g/l Murashige and
Skoog salts, 1% agar-agar), medium 2 (6% sucrose, 2.2g/l Murashige and Skoog salts, 1%
agar-agar), and medium 3 (6% sucrose, 2.2g/l Murashige and Skoog salts, 3g/l Phytagel).
After reaching a mesocotyl length of 2cm, the rescued embryos were transferred to a
different medium (5% sucrose, 1.1g/l Murashige and Skoog salts, 8g/l agar-agar) and grown
with a 16/8 light/dark cycle at 25 &#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Light microscopy of cytological sections</title><p>Immature wild-type and mutant kernels were harvested from the ear of a self-pollinated

structure of seemingly undifferentiated cells, which was not observed during normal
embryogenesis. This structure possessed apical-basal polarity but did not differentiate
into embryo proper and suspensor. In A188, mutant embryos showed most of the
characteristics seen in wild-type embryos but were severely retarded in their development.

in both the R-scm2 and A188 backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). At
3 DAP, <italic>emb8522</italic> embryo morphology had already diverged from the wild type
in R-scm2 with only 2&#x02013;3 cells observed in the mutant embryo and 4&#x02013;5 cells in
the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). At 5 DAP, the difference in cell number (on average, 15 for the mutant

pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>). At 9 DAP, the <italic>emb8522</italic> phenotype was somewhat more variable
among sister kernels than described by <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Heckel

were not always equal between the upper and lower domains of the embryo, suggesting that
apical/basal differentiation was taking place at least in some of the embryos. Although
not representative of the majority of mutant embryos at 9 DAP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref> was chosen to illustrate this onset of a differentiation into
embryo proper and suspensor with smaller apical and larger basal cells. Between 9 DAP and
18 DAP no further development occurred in mutant embryos, although they generally showed a
slight increase in length and a more marked increase in width at the base of the suspensor
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>). At 24 DAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2J</xref>) the embryos were morphologically similar to those found at 18 DAP, but
the cell walls had started to degrade and the cells had started to undergo necrosis, never
achieving a full differentiation into embryo proper and suspensor, the formation of a
protoderm, or the elaboration of shoot and root meristems.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F2" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Developmental profile of <italic>emb8522</italic> embryos. Longitudinal sections of

instance the closest publicly available polymorphic simple sequence repeat markers ZCT131,

Despite some efforts, this study was not able to find polymorphisms between the

reported to interact with SIG6 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Chi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Most examined

lower than in wild-type leaves of genotypes A188 and B73, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). This decrease was likely the consequence of
increased transcript degradation triggered by incomplete translation due to the
interruption of the <italic>PPR8522</italic> open reading frame by the

from the <italic>Mu</italic> element (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Barkan and

transcript. It needs to be emphasized that, in a first instance, the stronger decrease in
A188 does not provide a plausible explanation for the stronger phenotype in A188, since in
neither genotype a functional protein is likely to be produced. Interestingly, the
expression of the closely related gene <italic>GRMZM2G059449</italic> was increased in
mutant leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>), possibly compensating the

structural differences between wild-type and mutant proplastids. Nevertheless, two
differences were observed between wild-type and mutant cells. The number of starch grains,
a differentiated form of proplastids, was increased in the mutant whereas the number of

this developmental pathway (<xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">Tzafrir <italic>et

because certain enzymatic steps in vital metabolic pathways such as the biosynthesis of
fatty acids or phytohormones (gibberellic acid, abscisic acid, and jasmonate) are
exclusively accomplished in this organelle (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Bryant
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Nucleus-encoded factors play essential roles in
the regulation of plastid development, which requires the coordinated expression of both
nucleus-encoded and plastid-encoded genes. One of these factors is the nucleus-encoded,
chloroplast-targeted pentatricopeptide repeat protein PPR8522 of maize, since its loss leads
not only to a strong downregulation of chloroplast genes transcribed by PEP, lack of
chlorophyll, and compromised chloroplast ultrastructure in leaves, but also to a pronounced
delay or even deviation of embryo development, impairing germination in most genotypes.</p><sec id="s23"><title>Embryo lethality and plastid-targeted proteins in maize</title><p>After <italic>emb8516</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Magnard <italic>et

RNC1, and WTF1 are required for the splicing of group II introns in chloroplasts, PPR4
facilitates the <italic>trans</italic>-splicing of the chloroplast <italic>rps12</italic>
pre-mRNA, PPR5 is bound <italic>in vivo</italic> to the unspliced precursor of trnG-UCC,
WHY1 is associated with DNA from the plastid genome and with a subset of plastid RNAs, and
PPR2 functions in the synthesis or assembly of components of the plastid translation
machinery. One possibility to reconcile the data sets is to propose that not only the
mutation under investigation but also the genetic background influences the viability of
the mutant embryos. This hypothesis is corroborated by the <italic>emb8522</italic>
mutation, which is embryo lethal in genotypes R-scm2 and A188 but not in genotype B73.
Keeping in mind that genotype B73 was frequently used in the analysis of viable mutants,
such as the ones listed above, it would be interesting to introgress these mutations into
R-scm2 or A188 and to check the germination frequencies.</p><p content-type="indent">Since PPR8522 is required for embryo viability at least in certain
genotypes, it is tempting to speculate that it targets the RNA of one or more plastid
genes that are essential for survival. Such genes have been identified in dicots where the
plastid genomes encode four open reading frames that cannot be knocked out, at least in
tobacco: <italic>accD</italic>, <italic>ycf1</italic>, <italic>ycf2</italic>, and
<italic>clpP</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Drescher <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Kuroda and Maliga,
2003</xref>), and plastid translation in dicot embryos may simply be required to produce
these proteins. In particular, <italic>accD</italic> involved in fatty acid biosynthesis
is considered as the single, most important chloroplast gene required for embryo
development in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Bryant
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). However, <italic>accD</italic> as well as
<italic>ycf1</italic> and <italic>ycf2</italic> are missing in the plastid genomes of
cereals and the essential status of <italic>clpP</italic> has been questioned by the
<italic>Arabidopsis clb19</italic> mutant in which the lack of <italic>clpP</italic>
editing is not accompanied by an embryo-lethal phenotype (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Chateigner-Boutin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). This leaves one
more chloroplast gene that is possibly essential in both monocots and dicots,
<italic>trnE</italic> (tRNA-Glu). Beyond its role in translation, tRNA-Glu is also a
metabolite needed for 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) biosynthesis in plastids (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Huang and Wang, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Masuda and Fujita, 2008</xref>). ALA is the starting point for the
biosynthesis of tetrapyrrole and haem, an essential prosthetic group of proteins involved
in electron transport not only in plastids but also in mitochondria (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Kanamaru and Tanaka, 2004</xref>) In addition, tRNA-Glu is a regulatory
molecule inhibiting the transcriptional activity of NEP and mediating the switch in RNA
polymerase usage from NEP to PEP during chloroplast development. (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Hanaoka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Consequently PPR8522 may be
needed for the PEP-dependent transcription or stabilization of this tRNA.</p></sec><sec id="s24"><title>The role of PPR8522 in embryo development</title><p>Independently of the genetic background, embryo development and in particular embryo size
is clearly affected in the <italic>emb8522</italic> mutant. Although the phenotypic
analyses are based on the observation of a single allele due to the lack of additional
alleles in sequence indexed reverse genetics collections, they lead to the conclusion that
intact plastids are indeed required for normal embryo development in maize and that
genetic backgrounds only influence the severity of the phenotype, including the fact
whether the embryos are viable or not. The morphological and size differences of the
embryos also suggest that the function of PPR8522 extends beyond photosynthesis and raises
the question of the type of defect involved. The fact that the parallel development of the
endosperm is not affected by the impaired plastids may be a hint for a signalling rather
than metabolic defect, since the endosperm shares with the embryo not only the same
genetic structure but also a rather similar heterotrophic metabolism.</p><p content-type="indent">Another consideration concerns the biogenesis of chloroplasts, more
precisely the proplastid&#x02013;chloroplast transition. In maize embryos, photosynthesis
does not occur and plastid development is blocked at the proplastid stage, when the first
thylakoid membranes are formed and the photosynthetic complexes are translated, but not
yet assembled (<xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">Vothknecht and Westhoff, 2001</xref>).
Light is the signal that triggers the assembly of the thylakoid network and chlorophyll
production after germination (<xref rid="CIT0067" ref-type="bibr">Waters and Langdale,
2009</xref>). In the <italic>emb8522</italic> mutant, the ratio between the two types of
proplastids is altered, since there are around 3-times more amyloplasts (sugars storage
organs) than etioplasts (future photosynthetic organs), reversing the ratio seen in the
wild type. This observation hints at a particular defect in early biogenesis of
chloroplasts but not amyloplasts. Taking into account that, in the endosperm, proplastids
turn essentially into amyloplasts, the altered transition into chloroplasts may have
consequences only in the embryo but not the endosperm.</p></sec><sec id="s25"><title>Genotype-dependent variability of <italic>emb8522</italic> embryo morphology</title><p>The developmental profile of <italic>emb8522</italic> embryos shows fundamental
differences depending on the genetic background. In R-scm2 the mutant embryos are atypical
tubular structures not seen during normal embryo development that undergo early necrosis
(<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Clark and Sheridan, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Heckel <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>), in A188 the
mutant embryos have quite normal morphology, but are retarded in their development and
severely reduced in size, and in B73 mutant embryos have a similar developmental delay as
in A188, but are 3&#x02013;4-times bigger and the majority of them are able to germinate as
albino seedlings. The differences between the genetic backgrounds are independent of the
direction of the pollination, ruling out cytoplasmic effects. Expression differences do
not provide a plausible explanation either because qRT-PCR experiments revealed comparable
<italic>PPR8522</italic> expression levels in the three genotypes. Copy number
variation, a frequently observed phenomenon in the ancient tetraploid maize (<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Schnable <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">Springer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), cannot
completely be ruled out as a possible explanation. Whereas B73, the least affected
genotype, does not carry a second copy (near isogenic paralogue) of
<italic>PPR8522</italic> in its published sequence, the sequence is estimated to cover
only 96% of the genome (<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Schnable <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Consequently the possibility remains that B73 carries a
second copy that would be missing in the other two genotypes.</p><p content-type="indent">The most likely explanation of the phenotypic variability resides
in the action of one or several modifier gene(s). Genotypes A188 and R-scm2 may either
carry less efficient alleles of such a modifier gene or simply lack it. Maize is renowned
for both its high level of single nucleotide polymorphisms within coding regions (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Gore <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Chia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) and a

<italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). With respect to the type of modifier gene which
might be involved, one obvious possibility is another member of the vast PPR family, which
comprises more than 450 members in both <italic>Arabiodpsis</italic> and rice (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Lurin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Toole <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). A
potential candidate is the predicted gene <italic>GRMZM2G059449</italic>, the closest
neighbour of PPR8522 in phylogenetic trees. On one hand, the presence of
<italic>GRMZM2G059449</italic> in B73, A188, and R-scm2 and the comparable expression
levels in wild-type plantlets of the three genotypes seem to argue against a role as a
modifier gene. On the other hand, the increased expression of
<italic>GRMZM2G059449</italic> in white <italic>emb8522</italic> plantlets compared to
green wild-type plantlets in background B73 hints at a compensatory role that may vary
between genotypes. Obviously, other types of modifier genes acting either in the nucleus

analysis, which identified PPR8522 as a member of the PPR protein superfamily. The PPR
motif is generally recognized as a RNA binding domain and the function of most
characterized family members is related to the stability, splicing, editing, or
translation of organelle RNAs (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Schmitz-Linneweber and
Small, 2008</xref>). The tandem arrangement of the 10 PPR domains and the absence of
distinctive E, E+, or DWY domains at the C-terminus suggest that PPR8522 belongs to the P
subclass of PPR proteins, commonly thought to be involved in RNA stabilization, splicing,
and translation rather than editing (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Toole
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Both <italic>in silico</italic> predictions and experimental
evidence in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves clearly indicate that PPR8522 acts in
plastids and not in other organelles such as mitochondria. Within plastids, the protein is
located in a subdomain that may be the nucleoid. The nucleoid, which contains the plastid
DNA and is the place of transcription, represents a possible destination for PPR proteins
depending on their precise role in RNA metabolism. The presence of PPR8522 (under its
previous ID AC185612.3_FGP001) in highly enriched nucleoid fractions of maize proplastids
and mature chloroplasts (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Majeran <italic>et

other hand, the co-localization experiments with the nucleoid marker PEND (<xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">Terasawa and Sato, 2005</xref>) revealed only partial
overlap between PPR8522 and PEND signals. Beyond experimental pitfalls such as a
differential penetration of the various fusion proteins into the compact nucleoid or
contamination of the nucleoid fraction in the work by <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Majeran <italic>et al.</italic> (2012)</xref>, the co-localization data could possibly
be reconciled with the proteome data by the assumption that nucleoids are spatially
complex, dynamic structures and that PEND and PPR8555 were either localized in different
parts or different forms of the nucleoid. Alternatively, PPR8522 may not be part of the
nucleoid.</p><p content-type="indent">Finally, sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses identified
PPR8522 as the orthologue of DG1 from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Chi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), which shows 44% sequence

plantlets remain albino and die after a few weeks, rescued <italic>dg1</italic> plantlets
eventually turn green and develop normally (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Chi
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In addition, DG1 was found to interact in
yeast-two-hybrid, pull-down, and BiFC experiments with SIG6, a sigma factor necessary for
the transcription of plastid genes by PEP. Genetic experiments based on the analysis of
double mutants and over-expressing plants did not reach clear-cut conclusions and seem to
indicate partially overlapping functions of DG1 and SIG6. As suggested for DG1 (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Chi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), PPR8522 may
associate with SIG6 to stabilize its binding to promoter elements, and the lack of this
stabilization may readily explain the strong downregulation of PEP-transcribed genes in
<italic>dg1</italic> and <italic>emb8522</italic> mutants. However, this appealing
hypothesis addresses only the function of the C-terminal protein&#x02013;protein
interaction domain in DG1 (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Chi <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), but not that of the central PPR domain that likely acts as
an RNA binding domain. In fact DG1 and consequently PPR8522 may have two functions, one
related to its binding to SIG6 and a second one to its binding to one or several yet
unknown RNA target(s). These functions may be interconnected, for example SIG6 may direct
PPR8522 to nascent RNA molecules. Keeping in mind the opposite trends for PEP- and
NEP-transcribed plastid genes in the <italic>emb8522</italic> mutant, one may postulate
that the target of PPR8522 is a transcript coding for one of the PEP subunits (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Pfannschmidt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), a
transcript coding for a ribosomal protein, since translation of PEP subunits is limited in
ribosome-deficient mutants (<xref rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr">Zubko and Day,
2002</xref>), or the above-mentioned <italic>trnE</italic> gene for tRNA-Glu. RIP-Chip or
RIP-Seq experiments and parallel yeast-two-hybrid experiments will allow to clarify the
type(s) of macromolecules bound by PPR8522.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s27"><title>Supplementary material</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/07/27/jxb.ers232/suppl/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link>.
