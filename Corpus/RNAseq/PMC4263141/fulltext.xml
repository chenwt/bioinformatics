Here we demonstrate that the gastrointestinal nematode <italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus</italic>, which infects mice, secretes vesicles containing microRNAs (miRNAs) and Y RNAs as well as a nematode Argonaute protein. These vesicles are of intestinal origin and are enriched for homologues of mammalian exosome proteins. Administration of the nematode exosomes to mice suppresses Type 2 innate responses and eosinophilia induced by the allergen <italic>Alternaria.</italic> Microarray analysis of mouse cells incubated with nematode exosomes <italic>in vitro</italic> identifies Il33r and Dusp1 as suppressed genes, and Dusp1 can be repressed by nematode miRNAs based on a reporter assay. We further identify miRNAs from the filarial nematode <italic>Litomosoides sigmodontis</italic> in the serum of infected mice, suggesting that miRNA secretion into host tissues is conserved among parasitic nematodes. These results reveal exosomes as another mechanism by which helminths manipulate their hosts and provide a mechanistic framework for RNA transfer between animal species.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="i1" xlink:href="ncomms6488-i1.jpg"/>Mammalian cell-derived exosomes can carry RNA and proteins from cell to cell, but this mode of transport has not been shown in nematodes.

Within the mouse host, the parasite life cycle is exclusively intestinal: following ingestion, the larvae invade the small intestine, moult into adult worms and emerge into the lumen of the duodenum to mate and to produce eggs expelled in the faeces. The infection induces Type 2 innate and adaptive (Th2) immune responses in parallel with a large expansion of regulatory cells that mediate immunosuppressive effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, some of which have beneficial properties in allergy and auto-immunity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Immune suppression has been shown to be mediated in part by a suite of immunomodulatory proteins actively secreted by the nematodes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Given the burgeoning body of data detailing extracellular small RNAs in mammalian systems, and emerging evidence that these can mediate cell-to-cell communication<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, it is intriguing to think this mechanism could also be used by parasites. Small RNAs derived from bacteria, plants and parasites have been detected in human body fluids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>; however, the mechanism by which these are secreted or excreted is unknown, and the meaning of their extracellular existence unclear<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. We show here that <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> secretes a specific set of miRNAs and full-length Y RNAs that are stabilized against degradation by encapsulation within vesicles. The vesicles are of intestinal origin and are enriched for homologues of mammalian proteins found in exosomes, including heat shock proteins, tetraspanins and ALIX, a protein associated with exosome biogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> as well as a nematode Argonaute (Ago) protein. Local administration of the nematode exosomes to mice by the intranasal route suppresses Type 2 innate responses and eosinophilia induced by the allergen <italic>Alternaria in vivo</italic>. The nematode vesicles are internalized by mouse intestinal epithelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and suppress genes involved in inflammation and immunity, including the receptor for the alarmin IL-33 and a key regulator of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling, DUSP1. This work identifies exosomes as a new class of immunomodulatory complex produced by helminths and provides the first steps towards a mechanistic framework for RNA-mediated communication between animal species.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Small RNAs in <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> secretory products</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from the secretory products of <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> and compared with the profile of small RNAs in adult nematodes, eggs and infective larvae. A heterogeneous population of small RNAs &#x0003c;25 nucleotides (nt) was observed in all samples and several additional species between 25 and 30 nt were apparent in the secretion product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Small RNA sequencing (&#x0003c;30 nt) identified miRNAs as the dominant class of secreted parasite small RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>) and also identified RNA fragments mapping to nematode stem-bulge RNAs, herein referred to as Y RNAs based on their recognized homology to this class of small RNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In contrast, piRNAs (or &#x02018;21-U&#x02019; RNAs) were exclusively identified in the adult library (~14% of reads; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data set 1</xref>) with no evidence of secretion. RNAs between 70 and 100 nt were also present in the secreted product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>) and sequencing identified full-length Y RNAs as the major component of this fraction, with two predominant classes of structure identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>A total of 263 &#x02018;high confidence&#x02019; miRNAs were classified from the combined libraries based on representation of reads from both 5p and 3p arms of the hairpin and/or homology with known miRNAs in other nematodes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data set 1)</xref>. Each of these matches DNA sequences in the <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> whole genome currently under assembly. Many also show stage-specific expression patterns: for example, miR-35 family members are exclusively expressed in the egg library, consistent with their functions in embryogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, boxed). The secretory products are dominated by miRNAs with identical seed sites to mouse miRNAs, many of which are ancient: six are shared among Eumetazoa (lin-4/miR-125 and five miR-100 family members, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, red) and five among Bilatera (miR-79/miR-9, miR-83/miR-29, miR-263/miR-183 and two let-7 family members, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, blue). In addition, five bantam family members dominate the secretory products along with miR-87 and miR-60, which also are shared among Protostomia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, green) and three miRNAs that evolved in the nematode lineage: miR-63, miR-239 and miR-77 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, orange). miR-63 shares an identical seed site to mammalian miR-425, although it is not of common ancestry<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>. On the basis of their sequences, many of the secreted parasite miRNAs could therefore hijack existing mouse miRNA target networks if taken up by host cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Nematode vesicles are associated with secreted RNA</title><p>In mammalian systems, miRNAs have been found in body fluids in association with specific proteins or in extracellular vesicles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. To determine whether these RNAs could be present in vesicles, the <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> secretory products were ultracentrifuged and quantitative reverse transcription&#x02013;PCR (qRT)&#x02013;PCR used to measure miRNA levels in the pellet and supernatant, revealing the majority to be present in the pellet (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) identified vesicle-like structures between 50 and 100&#x02009;nm in diameter in the pelleted material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Label-free quantification of proteins in the vesicles and supernatant by liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry LC-MS/MS identified 362 proteins, of which 139 were specifically enriched in the vesicle fraction (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data set 2</xref>) including homologues of mammalian proteins present in exosomes: heat shock proteins, Rab proteins, tetraspanins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> and Alix, which is associated with exosome biogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The venom allergen-like proteins (members of the CAP superfamily, Pfam00188), which were previously identified as the dominant proteins in the <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> secretory products<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, are almost exclusively in the supernatant fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>, orange), further demonstrating specificity in the molecular composition of the vesicles and possibly indicating distinct routes of secretion. On this note, nematode intestinal proteins are enriched in the vesicle fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>, green and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data set 2</xref>) and, consistent with an intestinal origin of the nematode exosomes, vesicles of similar size are observed in the intestinal tissue of adult <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> analysed immediately <italic>ex vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). One Argonaute protein was identified in both vesicle and supernatant fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>, red) that belongs to the clade of Worm-specific Agos (WAGO). Phylogenetic analysis suggests that homologues to this WAGO are present in many parasitic nematodes but may have been lost in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Nematode RNAs are protected from degradation by exosomes</title><p>To determine which RNAs identified in the total secretion product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>) are specifically associated with vesicles, small RNA sequencing of replicate vesicle and nonvesicle (supernatant) fractions of the secretion product was carried out. Results from three biological replicates demonstrate that the parasite miRNAs are enriched in the vesicle fractions (75% of reads compared with 10% in supernatant, which is dominated instead by rRNA and Y RNA fragments, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). This analysis also identified three mouse miRNA homologues: miR-193, miR-10 and miR-200, within the top five most abundant secreted miRNAs. These were ranked much lower in the initial Illumina analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) likely because of the sequencing bias of the different kits and platforms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, underscoring the importance of comparing both approaches. Overall the three replicates showed the same profile of miRNAs in each vesicle sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) and neither vesicle nor supernatant contained intact large ribosomal RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Northern blot analysis confirmed the specificity of small RNA biotypes in vesicles versus supernatant, showing miR-100 to be exclusively present in the vesicles and the Y RNA fragment to be exclusively present in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Notably, on the same blot the full-length Y RNA was detected in the vesicles and both the miRNA and full-length Y RNA were largely resistant to degradation by RNases in untreated samples but became susceptible in the presence of Triton-X-100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that mature miRNAs and full-length Y RNAs are secreted by a parasitic nematode and are protected through encapsulation within vesicles of intestinal origin that share similar size and protein composition to mammalian exosomes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>H. polygyrus</italic> exosomes suppress innate immunity <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Helminths are well known to suppress pathogenic immune responses in both the gastrointestinal tract and airways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. To examine the functionality of the parasite-derived exosomes <italic>in vivo</italic>, they were administered intranasally in combination with extracts of the allergenic fungus <italic>Alternaria</italic>, which induces rapid IL-33 release as part of the Type 2 Th2-like innate immune response that leads to lung eosinophilia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Pre-treatment with parasite-derived exosomes before <italic>Alternaria</italic> extract administration led to a sharp reduction in bronchoalveolar lavage eosinophilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>), and suppressed expression of the Type 2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-13 by innate lymphoid cells (ILCs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b,c</xref>). Neutrophilia, which does not depend on Type 2 cytokines, was undiminished by exosome administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Intriguingly, the overall expression of the IL-33 receptor (also known as ST2) was also suppressed in recipients of exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Internalization of nematode exosomes and RNAs by mouse cells</title><p>To determine whether the nematode-derived exosomes can enter mammalian cells, uptake was examined in mouse small intestinal epithelial cells, a cell type that is naturally in direct contact with <italic>H. polygrus in vivo</italic>. Exosomes were labelled with the lipid dye PKH67 and incubated with MODE-K cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Uptake was analysed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and confocal microscopy. Over 60% of the cells were PKH67-positive after 1&#x02009;h of incubation with <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> vesicles compared with 1.5% when incubated with background dye (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). These results are unlikely to be due to nonspecific association with the cell membrane as treatment with trypsin did not eliminate the signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Confocal analysis confirmed uptake to the cytoplasm and demonstrates that this requires physiological temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). qRT&#x02013;PCR analysis of the treated cells detects the parasite-specific miRNAs in cells after 20&#x02009;h of incubation, with no change in the endogenous miR-16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). The full-length parasite-derived Y RNA could also be detected by northern blot analysis in cells which were treated directly with exosomes followed by washing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Regulation of mouse genes by nematode exosomes</title><p>To determine the function of these vesicles in mouse cells, gene expression analyses were carried out on MODE-K cells following incubation with <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> exosomes. A total of 128 genes were differentially expressed upon treatment (false discovery rate (FDR) <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Relatively subtle changes in gene expression were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>); however, the most strongly downregulated gene was <italic>Dusp1</italic> (also known as <italic>MKP-1</italic> in human), a key regulator of MAPK signalling associated with dampening the type 1 pro-inflammatory reaction to Toll like receptor (TLR) ligands. Another gene significantly downregulated by exosomes is <italic>Il1rl1</italic> (also known as <italic>IL33R</italic> in human and so referred to here as <italic>Il33r</italic>), the ligand-specific subunit of the receptor for IL-33, a key alarmin cytokine required for protection against multicellular parasites, which is produced by innate cells to drive early type 2 immune responsiveness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> and is suppressed by the exosomes in ILCs <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>). The effects of the exosomes on <italic>Dusp1</italic> and <italic>Il33r</italic> were validated by RT&#x02013;qPCR and are unlikely to reflect a nonspecific response to vesicle uptake as exosomes derived from mouse intestinal cells showed similar uptake but did not alter <italic>Dusp1</italic> and <italic>Il33r</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>There are a number of potential mechanisms that could mediate the decrease in <italic>Dusp1</italic> and <italic>Il33r</italic> levels. The 3&#x02032;untranslated region (UTR) of <italic>Dusp1</italic> is highly conserved and contains 7mer binding sites for the parasite homologues of mouse miR-200 (aka miR-8) and let-7 as well as a 6mer site for miR-425 (aka miR-63) in between these sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). We therefore examined whether the parasite miRNAs could suppress translation of a reporter vector containing the 3&#x02032;-UTR of <italic>Dusp1</italic> fused to luciferase. Synthetic parasite miRNAs were transfected into MODE-K cells, resulting in 1.2- to 2.0-fold reduction in luciferase levels for the <italic>Dusp1</italic> reporter but not control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). Notably, transfection of a cocktail of three of the miRNAs (at the same total RNA concentration) resulted in an increased reduction in luciferase activity (3.1-fold). This is consistent with enhanced repressive effects of miRNA sites in close proximity and suggests that secreted parasite miRNAs could work in cooperation to exert maximal effects on host genes. In contrast, the 3&#x02032;-UTR of the IL33R-encoding gene <italic>Il1lr1</italic> is not conserved and, although binding sites for some of the secreted miRNAs were identified, we did not observe repression of a <italic>Il1rl1</italic> 3&#x02032;-UTR reporter by transfection of miR-71, which contained two 7mer sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Circulating nematode miRNAs in serum</title><p>To establish whether the secreted nematode miRNAs naturally circulate in host tissues <italic>in vivo</italic>, we examined serum from mice infected with <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> (which resides in the gut lumen) or the filarial nematode <italic>L. sigmodontis</italic> (which resides in the pleural cavity). No <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> miRNAs were detected in the serum; however, a total of 1,188 reads mapped perfectly and unambiguously to the <italic>L. sigmodontis</italic> draft genome and 761 of these derived from 16 nematode miRNAs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Although we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the miRNAs in serum could derive from dying worms, the most abundant miRNAs detected are homologues of those found in <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> exosomes, including miR-100, bantam, miR-71 and miR-263 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). These data confirm the <italic>in vivo</italic> secretion of parasite miRNAs and are consistent with the idea that exosomes and associated RNAs operate locally in the host&#x02019;s body such that their detection in body fluids will be dictated by the life stage and localization of the parasite in the host.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In summary, we have shown that nematode parasite-derived miRNAs and Y RNAs are transported into mammalian host cells via exosomes that regulate host genes associated with immunity and inflammation and suppress an innate Type 2 response <italic>in vivo</italic>. Extracellular vesicles are emerging as a central mechanism for cell-to-cell signalling within mammalian systems, and our report of their secretion by a nematode species is within the setting of vesicle secretion by an increasingly diverse range of pathogens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. We have demonstrated for the first time that nematode-derived RNAs are a key component within exosomes that can be transferred to host cells. Nematodes are ubiquitous pathogens of both plants and animals and we anticipate that RNA secretion is a conserved phenomenon, supported by the fact that we detect miRNAs from the filarial nematode <italic>L. sigmodontis</italic> in host tissue, consistent with a recent report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. In fact, RNA secretion may be a ubiquitous feature across a range of parasites; an initial report suggests that miRNAs are also associated with vesicles in the trematode <italic>Dicrocoelium dendriticum</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.</p><p>Given that many of the nematode miRNAs are homologues to mouse miRNAs, it is tempting to speculate that these could tap into existing miRNA regulatory networks in host cells. In support of this, we show with a reporter assay that three of the secreted nematode miRNAs that have identical seed sites to mouse miRNAs can together downregulate DUSP1 through conserved sites in its 3&#x02032;UTR. Many questions remain, however, regarding the mechanism by which the nematode miRNAs can operate in host cells. The exosome is a functional ensemble and immune suppression is likely to require a combination of protein and miRNAs for fusion and gene regulation. It will be challenging, therefore, to pin point the individual contributions of each. For example, a nematode Ago protein is secreted with the miRNAs that may be required for functionality. This Ago belongs to the WAGO clade of Agos that evolved in the nematode lineage. The WAGOs mediate diverse RNA interference mechanisms in nematodes and can operate at epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>; it is intriguing to now consider how these possibilities could extend to their hosts.</p><p>An exciting finding in this study is the fact that the exosomes can suppress an innate Type 2 response <italic>in vivo</italic>, identifying vesicles as another class of immunomodulator used by the parasite and opening the door to further exploitation of exosomes in a therapeutic context. Our previous work has shown that <italic>H. polygyrus</italic>-secreted material suppresses IL-33 release and it is likely that a combination of soluble proteins and exosomes together suppress this important pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. From analyses <italic>in vitro</italic> we identify <italic>Il33r</italic> and <italic>Dusp1</italic> as host genes directly suppressed by the exosomes. Although DUSP1 has been broadly viewed as an attenuator of immune activation, it is known to preferentially downregulate IL-6 that has recently been shown to promote susceptibility to <italic>H. polygyrus</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, while upregulating IL-10, which acts as a broadly immunosuppressive cytokine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Hence, parasite survival is likely to be favoured by reduced DUSP1 levels. Further, DUSP1/MKP-1 dampens the acute inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide, promoting macrophage arginase expression over nitric oxide synthase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Hence, parasite repression of DUSP1 could block the induction of arginase, a known mediator of killing of <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> in the mouse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. These possibilities are now being investigated in our laboratories. Our reporter assays suggest that Dusp1 could be directly targeted by the parasite miRNAs; however, we do not observe repression of Il33r when transfecting the parasite miRNA, miR-71, that is predicted to target its 3&#x02032;UTR. It may be that additional parasite-derived RNAs or proteins could regulate <italic>Il33r</italic> expression, or that the effect operates indirectly through a separate target gene. For example, reduced expression of <italic>Dusp1</italic> or other regulators of MAPK signalling could result in GATA-2 phosphorylation, which might inhibit its ability to promote <italic>Il33r</italic> transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.</p><p>Finally, our work has revealed not only secreted miRNAs that are packaged in exosomes but also full-length Y RNAs that are transferred to host cells at an abundance level detectable by northern blot analysis. Y RNAs are not known to function in gene silencing but were recently shown to be packaged into exosomes secreted from dendritic cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and play roles in RNA quality control and DNA replication in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>.
