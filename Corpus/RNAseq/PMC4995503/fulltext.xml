Here, we investigated the evolutionary pattern of <italic>GLRs</italic> in plants. We observed that tandem duplications occupied the largest proportion of the plant <italic>GLR</italic> gene family expansion. Based on a phylogenetic tree, we suggested a new subfamily, <italic>GLR4</italic>, which is widespread in angiosperm but absence on Brassicales. Meanwhile, because <italic>GLR1</italic> and <italic>GLR2</italic> subfamilies were potential sister clades, we combined them into the <italic>GLR1&#x00026;2</italic> subfamily. A comparative analysis of plant <italic>GLR</italic> subfamilies revealed that selective forces shaped the <italic>GLR1&#x00026;2</italic> repertoires in the stems of eudicotyledons with distinct functional preferences. Moreover, <italic>GLR1&#x00026;2</italic> formed a species-specific highwoody-expanded subfamily, with preferential expression in the cambial-enriched and shoot apical meristem fractions of the highwood species. Together, these findings lay the foundation for evolutionary analysis of plant <italic>GLRs</italic> over the entire plant timescale and identified unique targets for manipulating the woody-growth behaviours of plant GLRs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Amino acids are formed from incorporation of inorganic nitrogen, and they serve as nitrogen signaling molecules in animals and plants. Plant glutamate-like receptors (GLRs), counterparts of mammalian ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), are assumed to be the prime amino acid sensors in plants. A parsimony phylogenetic analysis showed that plant GLRs preceded the divergence of animal and protokaryotic iGluR classes, and in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> can be divided into three clades, GLR1, GLR2 and GLR3<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Moreover, the GLR1 and GLR2 subfamilies are thought to have a sister relationship in the parsimony tree of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> GLRs, which was supported by their overlapping expression patterns<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.</p><p>Despite the classification, plant GLRs as predicted ligand-gated ion channels share the basic structures of the channel-forming domains and ligand-binding sites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. The channel-forming domain consists of three complete trans-membrane domains (M1, M3 and M4) plus a partial trans-membrane domain that forms a pore-loop structure (M2-Pore)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The predicted pore structure has functional cation channels and transplantation of AtGLR1.1 and AtGLR1.4 pore domains into rat GluR1 and GluR6 chimeras, respectively, led to conductance of cations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. A ligand-binding domain consists of two lobes, GlnH1 and GlnH2, which are related to channel-gating through agonist-induced conformational changes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Moreover, plant GLRs have an additional modulatory region, the amino-terminal domain (ATD), which in iGluRs can regulate channel activities by binding a wide range of ions and molecules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Furthermore, the resolved crystal structure of animal iGluRs revealed that ATDs regulate channel activities through interactions between the subunits to determine the channel composition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p><p>Analogous to mammalian iGluRs, plant GLRs conduct many cations into the cell in the presence of extracellular amino acids, such as AtGLR3.4, which are highly selective to calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. As Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a main signal messenger in plants, GLRs could play fundamental roles in mediation of diverse cellular responses in plant cells. Indeed, <italic>AtGLR3.1</italic> is preferentially expressed in stomatal guard cells, and <italic>AtGLR3.1</italic> over-expression elicited in impaired external Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced stomatal closure, suggests that <italic>AtGLR3.1</italic> is correlated with the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration that regulates stomatal movements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. <italic>AtGLR3.5</italic>-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling promotes seed germination by counteracting the inhibitory effects of abscisic acid through the repression of ABI4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Applying exogenous glutathione to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves triggered a transient rise in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, which is highly sensitive to GLR antagonists, and was also impaired in loss-of-function <italic>atglr3.3</italic> mutants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. These mutants showed enhanced susceptibility to bacterial pathogens, lower expression of pathogen-induced defence marker genes and similar phenotype to the glutathione biosynthesis defective mutant <italic>pad2</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Under D-Ser activation, <italic>AtGLR1.2</italic> mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into pollen tube cells as they extended in the pistil. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> signature is largely altered in <italic>glr1.2</italic> pollen tubes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p><p>Highwood species&#x02019; properties differ from those of other plant species and are mainly determined by the relative abundance of wood. Wood forms during secondary growth through activity of the vascular cambium, a layer of meristematic cells on the outer periphery of the stem. Cambial initials produce xylem mother cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, differentiate into mature xylem cells, including vessels and fibres. Xylem differentiation and cambial activity are spatially and temporally regulated at the transcriptional level and involve a complex hierarchical signal transduction network<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Ca<sup>2+</sup> has positive effects on wood formation in coniferous trees<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Moreover, increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> in cambium, xylem and phloem occur with increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> supply in nutrient solution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Likewise, stable isotope labelling showed 60&#x02013;70% of Ca<sup>2+</sup> content in vascular tissue, suggesting that long-distance transport Ca<sup>2+</sup> into woody tissue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Furthermore, under high titre Ca<sup>2+</sup> stress, poplar wood formation can be strongly inhibited shown in decreased vessel sizes and wood increments, decreased specific performances in reduced layers of cambial and xylem differentiation zones in the radial direction, and decreased lengths of young libriform fibres<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Secondary ion mass spectrometry showed a strikingly temporary increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the cambium during the reactivation period<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup> acts as signaling messenger, triggering cambium activation. Indeed, phenotypic investigation of poplar stem tissues under increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in cambium showed a much wider cambial zone with larger vacuoles, which is typical of active vascular cambium contrasting to cells filled with dense cytoplasm and decreasing cambial width with a reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> supply<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Additionally, Ca<sup>2+</sup> reportedly increased in the apical meristem during bud flush and the beginning of cell division<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. These results further show that cambium activation relies on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Thus, we suggest that potential Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transporters could participate in Ca<sup>2+</sup> long-distance transport and responses to wood formation.</p><p>At least two AtGLR (GLR3.4 and GLR3.2) proteins are enriched primarily in the phloem and play fundamental roles in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal transduction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. In parallel, using non-invasive electrodes, Mousavi <italic>et al</italic>. mapped surface potential changes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> after wounding leaves and found membrane depolarization domains in leaves distal to the wounds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Furthermore, mutations in several <italic>GLR3</italic> genes (<italic>3.2</italic>, <italic>3.3</italic> and <italic>3.6</italic>) alleviated wound-induced surface potential changes and correlated with jasmonate-response gene expression, which was more attenuated in a <italic>glr3.3 glr3.6</italic> double mutant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. This suggests that electrical impulses act as intracellular signals and that plant <italic>GLRs</italic> are potent regulators in this long-distance communication in wound-induced defence responses. These results support that long-distance signaling exists in plants and indicates that plant GLRs analogous to those important for synaptic activity in animals have roles in organ-organ Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal transmission.</p><p>Plant GLRs, as extracellular amino acid sensors, play fundamental roles in regulating various biological processes. However, knowledge of this gene family is confined to <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Thus, further investigations of <italic>GLRs</italic> in other plant species are necessary to determine more gene family profiles. Rosaceae, as a core plant lineage, and composing many highwood species, have had their genomes extensively sequenced<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. This provides an opportunity to further analyse the <italic>GLR</italic> family in highwood species. We collected genome data and used Rosaceae as a model for insight into plant GLR evolution. We combined comparative genomics, molecular evolutionary studies and expression analyses to examine the evolution of plant GLRs and investigate characteristics of highwood GLRs.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification, classification and characterization of plant <italic>GLRs</italic></title><p>There were 167 candidate <italic>GLRs</italic> identified in four Rosaceae species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>), and 23 were classified as pseudogenes because they contained only short gene fragments or contained frameshift mutations and/or premature stop codons. Consequently, 144 complete <italic>GLRs</italic> were used for analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis suggested that analogous to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, most Rosaceae <italic>GLRs</italic> were divided into three traditional phylogenetic clades (<italic>GLR1</italic>, <italic>GLR2</italic> and <italic>GLR3</italic>). Moreover, we observed a well-supported new clade (bootstrap values of 82&#x02013;100%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>), independent of traditional clades, and named this clade as <italic>GLR4</italic> subfamily.</p><p>GLR4 members shared a similar modular organization to other Rosaceae and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> GLRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>), consisting of a receptor family ligand binding region (PFAM ID: PF01094) and ligand-gated ion channel domain (PFAM ID: PF00060). In detail, it contained an extracellular ATD, four trans-membrane domains (M1-M4), a putative ligand-binding domain with two lobes (GlnH1 and GlnH2) that were separated by an ion channel domain, and a short cytoplasmic C terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Then, we aligned GLR4 proteins together with other subfamilies GLRs to examine the mean conservation index (number of conserved physico-chemical properties) using a sliding window (20 amino acid window, 10 amino acid slide) in four Rosaceae species and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. The results showed that the all annotated domains performed high conservation indexes, instead, the ATD (PF101904) was considerably more variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>). The most conserved domain was the M2-Pore region (highest mean conservation index of 6.05), which determined the selective transduction of cations by their residues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. We generated a protein alignment for this region. The residues that determine the selective transduction of cations were highly uniform among Rosaceae and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> GLRs included GLR4 subfamily (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2</xref>). Hence, GLR4 subfamily members are consistent with other Rosaceae GLRs that possess potential conserved plant GLR channel specificities. However, the principal issue of the GLR4 subfamily distribution in plant evolution needs to be addressed.</p><p>For this purpose, we comparatively analysed <italic>GLRs</italic> in 45 plant species. We separated these plant species into 16 parts based on plant taxonomy (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/CommonTree/wwwcmt.cgi">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/CommonTree/wwwcmt.cgi</ext-link>) and selected moss (lower plant), rice (monocotyledonous plant), <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (dicotyledonous herbs), and pear (dicotyledonous woody) <italic>GLRs</italic> as anchors for construction of a phylogenetic tree to cluster the remaining plant <italic>GLRs</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). Then, a collection of 881 sequences from 45 plant species was classified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S2</xref>). The <italic>GLR4</italic> genes were widespread in all analysed angiosperms. They first appeared in <italic>Amborella</italic>, which is the earliest known angiosperm species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. However, this subfamily has not been found in Brassicales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S2</xref>). This could explain the missing <italic>GLR4</italic> subfamily in the genome of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Evolutionary history of plant <italic>GLRs</italic></title><p>To investigate the evolutionary processes of plant GLR repertoires, we used Rosaceae <italic>GLRs</italic> as examples to determine the potential original, expansion and divergence of this gene family. First, we detected the duplication modes for <italic>GLRs</italic> in four Rosaceae genomes using the <italic>MCScanX</italic> package. Tandem duplications occupied the largest proportion of the <italic>GLR</italic> family&#x02019;s expansion in Rosaceae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S3</xref>). Dispersed duplication was secondary contributor to expansion of this gene family in Rosaceae. Interestingly, the recent whole genome duplication (WGD) events (30&#x02013;45 MYA) occurred in pear<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> likely resulted in the observed higher proportion of WGD/segmental-type <italic>GLR</italic> gene duplications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Together, these observations support that <italic>GLRs</italic> evolved mainly from tandem duplications in Rosaceae. Then, we assembled the duplicated gene pairs to form a linear expansion in each Rosaceae species based on hypothesis tests on the nearest duplicated gene pair&#x02019;s performance characteristics, which included the highest identity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S4</xref>), maximum number of flanking genes in segments and the lowest synonymous mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S5</xref>). Finally, we identified the ancestral genes of the Rosaceae <italic>GLR</italic> families by collinearity and synteny analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S6</xref>). We constructed a schematic diagram of the development history of the Rosaceae <italic>GLR</italic> family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p><p>This schematic diagram illustrated that five series of Rosaceae ancestral genes, two bulk orthologous genes in <italic>GLR3</italic> and <italic>GLR4</italic> subgroups, that were ordinal linked in four species. In contrast, the <italic>GLR2</italic> subfamily did not complete an orthology series, but was substituted by a more abundant and shorter series among two or three Rosaceae species. Meanwhile, there were three fragmented <italic>GLRs</italic> (mrna13028 and mrna23938 in strawberry, and Pm026785 in plum) that participated in evolution of the Rosaceae <italic>GLR3</italic> subfamily, indicating that these genes contained frameshift mutations and/or premature stop codons after the duplication events. In general, Rosaceae <italic>GLRs</italic> were taken several series of ancestral genes as the anchors during expansion; however <italic>GLR2</italic> subfamily had undergone a gene elimination during evolution. Once &#x02018;born&#x02019;, new <italic>GLRs</italic> presumably further expanded by tandem duplications, revealing this as a tremendous driving force for Rosaceae <italic>GLR</italic> gene expansion.</p><p>Analysis of <italic>GLR</italic> evolutionary patterns over the entire plant timescale showed 581 <italic>GLRs</italic>, accounting for 65.95% of all analysed plant <italic>GLRs</italic>, were tandem-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S7</xref>). It indicated that in all plant species, not just Rosaceae, tandem duplication is a major expansion force for <italic>GLR</italic> families. Exploring the evolutionary origin of plant <italic>GLR</italic>s by phylogeny analysis showed that the plant <italic>GLR</italic> family had an original group. We named this group <italic>GLR0</italic>, and it was closest to the <italic>GLR3</italic> group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). <italic>GLR0</italic> appeared first in algae, then began to differentiate and expand with evolution of Pinales, and finally differentiated into three stable and distinguishable subgroup structure, <italic>GLR3</italic>, <italic>GLR4</italic> and a larger and highly spread-out cluster (<italic>GLR1</italic> and <italic>GLR2</italic> subfamilies), from the Amborellales, the earliest angiosperm species known (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Plant <italic>GLR1</italic> and <italic>GLR2</italic> subfamilies formed sister clades</title><p>Marker-based phylogenetic analysis shows that <italic>GLR1</italic> and <italic>GLR2</italic> combined into a distinguish cluster occurred in all of tested plant orders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>), suggesting <italic>GLR1</italic> and <italic>GLR2</italic> subfamilies could be homologous and from a common gene. Consistent with the conservation analysis, <italic>GLR2</italic> had the most similar primary sequence to GLR1 in four Rosaceae species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S4</xref>). Taken pear <italic>GLRs</italic> as example, we tested the genes structure among subfamilies, the result showed the numbers of introns in <italic>GLRs</italic> were random (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref>). Indeed, using the server GSDraw (Gene Structure Draw server) to detect the gene structure based on a genomic sequence alignment using the main domain, showing that these highly dynamic introns were concentrated at the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>). However, the intron positions after motif 4 were conserved among pear <italic>GLR1</italic> and <italic>GLR2</italic> members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>). In addition, the highest identity value (43.12%) for the intron sequence after motif 4 between <italic>GLR1</italic> and <italic>GLR2</italic> subfamilies in pear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>). In comparison, there was only 25.37% identity between <italic>GLR2</italic> and <italic>GLR3</italic> subfamilies, and 20.23% identity between <italic>GLR2</italic> and <italic>GLR4</italic> subfamilies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Moreover, a phylogram of these intron sequences also revealed a greater similarity of <italic>GLR2</italic> to <italic>GLR1</italic> receptors than to other subfamily receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Likewise, similar results were obtained in other Rosaceae species (data not shown). Together, these observations demonstrated <italic>GLR1</italic> and <italic>GLR2</italic> formed sister clades and integrated into a single clade, which we named <italic>GLR1&#x00026;2</italic>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>GLR1&#x00026;2</italic> subfamily has more tandem gene arrays accompanied by domain loss events</title><p>Comparative analysis of the evolutionary patterns for expansion of <italic>GLR</italic> subfamilies showed distinct characteristics for <italic>GLR1&#x00026;2</italic>. The degree of tandem duplication events contributed to the expansion for <italic>GLR1&#x00026;2</italic> and <italic>GLR4</italic> subfamily were similar, 75.67 and 76.02%, respectively, which significantly higher than the overall average value (65.95%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S7</xref>). In contrast, tandem duplication genes only accounted for 44.44% of the <italic>GLR3</italic> subfamily and none of the <italic>GLR0</italic> subfamily. The results indicated that tandem expansion force was mainly in the <italic>GLR1&#x00026;2</italic> and <italic>GLR4</italic> subfamilies. The average of 2.6 tandem gene arrays was significantly higher for the <italic>GLR1&#x00026;2</italic> than the averages of 1.43 and 1.88 for <italic>GLR3</italic> and <italic>GLR4</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4</xref>).

In addition, we found that most of <italic>GLRs</italic>&#x02019; expression levels significantly increased during <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> maturation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S7B</xref>).

We hypothesized that <italic>GLRs</italic> originated from the <italic>GLR0</italic> plant subfamily, closely related to the <italic>GLR3</italic> subfamily, and that they subsequently diverged into the <italic>GLR1&#x00026;2</italic>, <italic>GLR3</italic> and <italic>GLR4</italic> subfamilies, with the earliest occurring in Amborellales, which is the first angiosperm species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>), estimated 160 million years ago. However, the <italic>GLR4</italic> subfamily was absent in Brassicales.

Tandem duplications as the main driving force with a concomitant more tandem gene arrays were observed in expansion of this subfamily, indicating functional differentiation in the gene expansion process. Furthermore, low sequence identities, high selective forces and highly spread instead orthologous phylogenetic relationships of <italic>GLR1&#x00026;2</italic>, suggested that this subfamily diverged in a species-specific pattern. The reason for this divergence is unknown, but it implies a reduced evolutionary constraint on co-expression, partially redundant ion channel genes undergo the selection for higher diversity in ion transport sequences to recognise more variable ligands in the environment. Indeed, the higher selective forces acting of <italic>GLR1&#x00026;2</italic> subfamily start at stem eudicotyledonous plants and this subfamily members occurred remarkable extended in highwood plant species, inferring that the <italic>GLR1&#x00026;2</italic> subfamily is potentially involved in regulating aspects of highwood woody growth.</p><p>Meanwhile, many plant GLRs had loss events in the ATD and 74% occurred in the GLR1&#x00026;2 subfamily. The ATD is a discernible and divergent domain preceding the GlnH1 domain in the N-terminus and is involved in the assembly of GLR subunits into heteromeric complexes in animal iGluRs and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> GLRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S10</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>.

Additionally, 80.22% of this type of <italic>GLR</italic> was involved in tandem duplication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S2</xref>). Thus, these results led to the hypothesis that retroposition events eliminated the gene redundancy to meet the frequent tandem events. However, 3.23% of highwood <italic>GLR</italic> repertoires performed retropositioning, significantly lower than the overall 11.03% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S10</xref>).

In this scenario, this is a feedback loop invoked to expand the <italic>GLR1&#x00026;2</italic> subfamily in highwood species. In fact, over their long lifespans, highwood plants require more sophisticated mechanisms and more genetic redundant-copy control to adapt to seasonal variations and expansive length of cambial activity, and to separate the juvenile and mature wood during secondary tree growth. This does not occur in vascular transmission regions, such as phloem and xylem, nor in short-lived annuals like <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Thus, it also aids understanding why highwood plants contain a high percentage of retained tandem repeats during evolution for the purpose of responding to variety of environmental stimuli<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Indeed, a possibility is that cambial activation through GLR channels affects wood development via Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the cambium.

The expression levels of the <italic>GLRs</italic> in all samples were determined by their quantification cycle values (<italic>C</italic>qs). Then, these expression values transformed into log<sub>2</sub> values and were standardized using EXPANDER 6. The K-means clustering in EXPANDER 6 grouped the genes into different main clusters with unique expression patterns. An MIQE checklist contains the essential information about qPCR analysis in this study provided (MIQE checklist). All indexes met the MIQE guidelines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Plant growth conditions</title><p>All materials were collected from <italic>P. bretschneideri</italic> Rehd. cultivar &#x02018;Dangshansu&#x02019; growing in a natural environment in Nanjing, China. The harvested seeds were germinated for 3 d and transferred to pots containing soil and vermiculite. Roots, stems and leaves were harvested 90 d after transfer. The mature seeds were obtained 13 weeks after flowering. Flowers were harvested a few days before anthesis, and the styles were then detached, weighed and stored in liquid nitrogen. Anthers were also dehisced, dried in bottles containing desiccant, and stored at &#x02212;20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in coated silica gel until needed. Mature pear pollen was cultivated in liquid for germination and growth. The incubation medium contained the following components (mM): 5 2-(<italic>N</italic>-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid hydrate, 440 sucrose, 0.55 Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, 1.60 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.60 H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>, and 1.00 KNO<sub>3</sub> at pH 6.0&#x02013;6.2 (adjusted with Tris). The pollen was incubated in small Petri dishes at 25&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 3&#x02009;h. Then, the samples were centrifuged, the supernatants removed and the pollen tube precipitates frozen in liquid nitrogen. The three typical stages of phloem, cambium and xylem samples were described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S6</xref>. Stage I: stem above cotyledons from 90-d-old pear trees; Stage II: stem from the current growth branches of 8-year-old pear trees. Stage III: stem from last year&#x02019;s branches of 8-year-old pear trees. All shoot tip tissues were harvested from 8-year-old pear trees and divided into two phases; dormant (February) and sprouted (April).
