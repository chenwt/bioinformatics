However, the emergence of next-generation-sequencing (NGS) with its direct transcript identification, lower cost, larger dynamic range and superior detection of low abundance genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], is making microarrays obsolete. Despite these advantages, some studies have raised concerns regarding RNA-Seq and microarray comparability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Probe design and differences in platform sensitivity have been offered as potential explanations, although normalization and analysis methods also contribute to low concordance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Analysis approaches have been developed specifically for RNA-Seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], yet repurposed microarray normalization, statistical analysis, and DEG identification methods outperform several RNA-Seq specific analysis tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Consequently, we investigated the use of our semi-parametric normalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and empirical Bayes analysis approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], traditionally used for microarrays. Semi-parametric normalization accounts for multiple sources of variation including random effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] while empirical Bayes analysis has the advantage of considering continuous variables such as the correlation between doses that can improve DEG detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], an important consideration in regulatory decision-making.</p><p>While microarray data submissions are encouraged by regulatory agencies and widely accepted in toxicogenomic research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], the third phase of the microarray quality control project (MAQC-III also known as SEQC) recommended further validation using different study designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. To date, study designs involving chemical treatment have been limited to single dose studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the impact of different normalization approaches, or dose&#x02013;response RNA-Seq studies with a sequencing depth of only 5&#x000a0;M reads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Collectively, these studies reported comparable responses between platforms, but were mixed in the ability of RNA-Seq to reveal the biological relevance of responses.</p><p>2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-<italic>p</italic>-dioxin (TCDD) is a persistent environmental contaminant that binds to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) which then translocates to the nucleus and dimerizes with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor translocator (ARNT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The TCDD-AhR-ARNT complex then binds to regulatory regions and elicits changes in global gene expression using dioxin response element (DRE)-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and -independent mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Dose-and time-dependent TCDD elicited differential gene expression has been evaluated using microarrays after a single dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In this study, we extend these results by examining the effects of continuous TCDD exposure. Dose-dependent hepatic differential gene expression in mice following oral gavage with TCDD every 4&#x000a0;days for 28&#x000a0;days was compared using RNA-Seq and Agilent oligonucleotide microarrays analyzed using same the same normalization and empirical Bayes analysis.</p><p>Overall, RNA-Seq and Agilent generated comparable results. Quantitatively, RNA-Seq detected more genes expressed in the liver, and identified more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared to Agilent. Qualitatively, direct sequencing by RNA-Seq provided more accurate transcript identification. Verification by WaferGen SmartChip QRTPCR indicates RNA-Seq had fewer false-positives and false-negatives compared to Agilent. Dose response modeling was also consistent between both platforms, but the ability of RNA-Seq to detect low abundance transcripts and its larger dynamic range provided superior qualitative and quantitative data for DEG identification, and estimates of point of departure (POD) and ED<sub>50</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Quantitative RNA-Seq advantages</title><p>Genome-wide hepatic gene expression was examined using NGS Sequencing and Agilent 4&#x000d7;44 K oligonucleotide microarrays using the same RNA samples.

Therefore, in addition to artifactual platform specific differential gene expression due to hard cut-off criteria, discrepancies between RNA-Seq and Agilent can also be attributed to differences in sensitivity and probe designs that query different regions, have no known target (mis-annotated) and/or are susceptible to cross-hybridization.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>RNA-Seq versus Agilent dose response analysis</title><p>Dose&#x02013;response modeling is critical in regulatory decision-making. Consequently, point of departure (POD) estimates for the benchmark dose (BMD; dose at which response begins to be different from control) and the benchmark dose limit (BMD(L); lower limit of a one-sided 95% confidence interval on the BMD) were determined using BMDExpress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. BMDExpress fit 842 of 1,249 RNA-Seq DEGs with dose response curves compared to 660 of 1,434 Agilent DEGs (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). Within the 449 DEGs common to both technologies, 142 (32%) were fitted with dose&#x02013;response curves. Platform difference in dynamic range and ability to detect low abundant transcripts influenced POD estimates. For example, at low BMD(L) estimates, Agilent values were higher compared to RNA-Seq due to poorer resolution at low expression levels. At higher BMD(L) estimates RNA-Seq values were higher, likely due to microarray signal compression (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). Nevertheless, POD estimates and rank were strongly correlated between both technologies (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>). Moreover, POD estimates were not influenced by sample size (data now shown).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Comparison of RNA-Seq and Agilent dose&#x02013;response modeling. <bold>(A)</bold> The ToxResponse modeler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] was used to identify genes fitting a sigmoidal response for the estimation of ED<sub>50</sub>s while <bold>(B)</bold> BMDExpress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] was used to find the best fit curves for point of departure (BMD and BMDL) estimates.

As regulatory agencies and researchers struggle to incorporate omic data into decision-making and research applications, the technology continues to evolve requiring the verification of reproducibility, reliability, and continuity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Hybridization-based platforms such as Affymetrix GeneChips and Agilent oligonucleotide microarrays are being replaced by NGS technologies such as RNA-Seq. Although several studies have reported comparable technical reproducibility, variance structure, absolute expression, and DEG identification capabilities using different study designs and model systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], only one has investigated dose response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], the corner stone of risk/safety assessment. Our study complements and extends previous comparisons by evaluating the dose-dependent hepatic changes in gene expression using RNA-Seq and Agilent 4&#x000d7;44 K oligonucleotide microarrays. We used the same normalization and analysis methods to minimize bias while further investigating the cause of qualitative and quantitative differences between RNA-Seq and Agilent oligonucleotide microarrays. In comparison to WaferGen SmartChip QRTPCR, we demonstrate that some differences between RNA-Seq and Agilent DEG identification may not be as significant as previously reported.</p><p>DEGs were identified using an adapted semi-parametric normalization approach followed by an empirical Bayes method that used model-based t values to calculate posterior probability P1(<italic>t</italic>) values on a per gene and dose basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Bayes models take into account adjacent points to consider trends within time course and dose response data sets. Therefore, P1(<italic>t</italic>) values do not test hypotheses, and can be used to rank and prioritize DEGs based on their probability of differential expression. This allows cut-off criteria to be varied in order to include well characterized responsive genes and mechanistic significance in the context of observed phenotypes, without violating any assumptions. In our study, varying the cut-off criteria demonstrated that RNA-Seq was particularly sensitive to P1(<italic>t</italic>) changes likely due to its much larger dynamic range compared to microarrays (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A, E</xref>).</p><p>The influence of sample size on DEG identification has not been adequately investigated. Power analyses suggest sample sizes of 3&#x02013;25 depending on sequencing depth and budget [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] while others have examined 2, 4, and 5 replicates using synthetic datasets and various analysis approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We identified comparable numbers of DEGs when using 3, 4, or 5 independent replicates at a sequencing depth of 30&#x000a0;M (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). Moreover, there was a strong correlation across all sample sizes indicating RNA-Seq responses were not significantly influenced by the sample size (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B-D</xref>), facilitating cross-technology comparisons using a sample size of 3 in this study.</p><p>Overall, RNA-Seq detected more genes expressed in the liver (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). Many of the genes only detected on Agilent microarrays could also be identified within the RNA-Seq dataset by lowering the number of reads threshold (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Similarly, most DEGs identified only on Agilent microarrays could also be detected in the RNA-Seq dataset by lowering the selection criteria, particularly the P1(<italic>t</italic>) cut-off. Comparing RNA-Seq and Agilent datasets for DEGs identified a 35% &#x02013; 50% overlap (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>), similar to previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. WaferGen QRTPCR, RNA-Seq and Agilent dose response curves were remarkably similar for many genes classified as either RNA-Seq- or Agilent-specific (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C, D</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Figure S4, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Figure S5, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Figure S6, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: Figures S7) suggesting that differences between platforms were due more to selection criteria as opposed to differences in expression. Consequently, RNA-Seq quantitatively outperformed Agilent microarrays when identifying the total number of genes expressed in the liver, and differentially expressed by TCDD (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). In addition, RNA-Seq provided more definitive qualitative data regarding the identity of the gene that the transcript represented and identified more genes involved in pathways known to be affected by TCDD. Previous studies suggest RNA-Seq performance was mixed for detecting the differential expression of low expressed genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, detection of low abundance genes improves dramatically at ~30&#x000a0;M reads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], the sequencing depth used in this study.</p><p>Further analysis of genes exhibiting divergent expression (e.g. upregulated in RNA-Seq and downregulated in microarray) identified two principal contributing factors. First, some Agilent probes were misannotated and did not target the expected gene possibly due to outdated annotation provided by manufacturer, but nevertheless, requiring re-evaluation and re-annotation. Second, multiple probes for the same gene also showed divergent responses indicating either non-specific binding (cross-hybridization) or the presence of variant transcripts that targeted individual probes. RNA-Seq analysis mitigates these disadvantages by using the most recent genome build available and its associated annotation, while providing the opportunity to identify treatment-specific transcript variants.</p><p>Risk assessments typically involve four components: hazard identification, dose response characterization, exposure assessment and risk characterization. Omic technologies are expected to improve risk assessment by providing more qualitative and quantitative data. This includes the use of gene expression profile or fingerprint classifiers that not only identify comparable modes/mechanisms of action in hazard identification, but could also justify the use of refined uncertainty factors for extrapolation between species. In addition, RNA-Seq provides a greater number of responsive genes that can be functionally annotated, associated with a key event, and modeled for ED<sub>50</sub> values and point of departure (POD) estimates such as BMD and BMD(L). Despite the challenges of incorporating omic data into risk assessment, the goal is to provide data that complements existing testing guidelines and requirements to support a more quantitative, mechanistically-based risk assessment.</p><p>RNA-Seq and Agilent datasets were analyzed for TCDD-elicited dose-dependent gene expression using ToxResponse modeler and BMDExpress. Although only a small subset of genes exhibited dose-dependent responses in both technologies (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A, B</xref>), the correspondence between both was strong. Overall, RNA-Seq POD and ED<sub>50</sub> values were considered to be more accurate due to its ability to detect lower abundance genes and greater dynamic range (Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D, E</xref> and 5C, D). Data compression and lower sensitivity also affects the slope of the dose response curve which may confound interpretation of receptor interaction mechanisms and cross-ligand comparisons used to determine toxic equivalency factor (TEF) estimates for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>RNA-Seq exhibited superior qualitative and quantitative performance compared to Agilent microarrays.
