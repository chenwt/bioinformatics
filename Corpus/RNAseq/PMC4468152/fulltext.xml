Here we focus on the human brain, utilizing transcriptomics and public available Human Protein Atlas (HPA) data to analyze brain-enriched (frontal cortex) polyadenylated messenger RNA and long non-coding RNA and generate a genome-wide draft of global and cellular expression patterns of the brain. Based on transcriptomics analysis of altogether 27 tissues, we have estimated that approximately 3% (n=571) of all protein coding genes and 13% (n=87) of the long non-coding genes expressed in the human brain are enriched, having at least five times higher expression levels in brain as compared to any of the other analyzed peripheral tissues. Based on gene ontology analysis and detailed annotation using antibody-based tissue micro array analysis of the corresponding proteins, we found the majority of brain-enriched protein coding genes to be expressed in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes or in neurons with molecular properties linked to synaptic transmission and brain development. Detailed analysis of the transcripts and the genetic landscape of brain-enriched coding and non-coding genes revealed brain-enriched splice variants. Several clusters of neighboring brain-enriched genes were also identified, suggesting regulation of gene expression on the chromatin level. This multi-angle approach uncovered the brain-enriched transcriptome and linked genes to cell types and functions, providing novel insights into the molecular foundation of this highly specialized organ.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding was provided by: Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (MU, FP, ES, LF, BMH, PN) -<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.wallenberg.com/kaw/">https://www.wallenberg.com/kaw/</ext-link>; PROSPECTS, a 7th Framework grant by the European Directorate (grant agreement HEALTH-F4-2008-201648/PROSPECTS, MU, PN)-<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.prospects-fp7.eu/index.html">http://www.prospects-fp7.eu/index.html</ext-link>; Swedish research council (VR 4x-2887, TH)- <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vr.se">http://www.vr.se</ext-link>; Alzheimerfonden (grant 03-216, JM)-<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.alzheimerfonden.se">http://www.alzheimerfonden.se</ext-link>.

These functions are executed by circuitries composed of specialized neurons supported by glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia) that each express sets of genes that determine their phenotype and physiological properties.</p><p>The human genome projects [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] revealed the genetic code, enabling extensive analysis of gene expression in tissue and organ samples in the context of evolution, physiology and disease. The majority of these data, including &#x0003e;35,000 data sets linked to human brain, are published in online repositories such as the Gene Expression Omnibus [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and ArrayExpress [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This huge amount of expression data and the development of next generation sequencing technologies have opened venues to explore gene expression, regulation of gene expression, splice variation and gene function on organ, tissue and cellular level. In fact, a meta analysis of public available data of &#x0003e;200 different studies using the Affymetrix U133A microarray platform generated the first global map of human gene expression [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The introduction of RNAseq platforms has enabled more thorough and faster genome wide expression analyses of various tissues available in the ensembl database [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) portal [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] as well as peer-reviewed, whole genome deep sequencing studies comparing 11 [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and 27 [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] tissue and organ types, including brain. These resources provide a detailed documentation of global gene expression and have identified ubiquitous versus more organ specific genes, showing the highest numbers of tissue-enriched genes to be expressed in testis and brain.</p><p>It has recently become evident that subsets of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate transcription and translation as precursor of microRNAs, by binding to microRNAs or interacting with microRNA binding sites [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], by chromatin modifications [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and by interacting with genetic elements that enhance gene expression [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Like mRNA, lncRNA are RNA polymerase II products, containing a 5&#x02019; cap and poly A tail and are frequently spliced [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Ensembl version 73 annotates and reports 6,969 lncRNA-coding genes, and the GENECODE consortium annotated 9,277 lncRNA coding genes producing 14,800 transcripts [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The brain expresses the highest levels of non-coding RNA when comparing 12 tissues (testis not included) [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and Kim and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] found a correlation between levels of enhancer RNA and levels of mRNA synthesized by neighboring genes in mouse cortical neurons. These data suggest an organ-specific regional organization of chromatin structures or presence of other epigenetic mechanisms that regulate transcription of clustered coding and non-coding genes.</p><p>Here we analyzed genes expressed in a functionally important area of the human brain, the frontal cortex (FC). By comparing 27 tissue types representing all major organs and tissues in the human body, brain-enriched protein coding [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and non-coding genes could be filtered, enabling a detailed survey of expression patterns and specialized biological processes specific for brain. Transcriptomics, gene ontology analysis and detailed evaluation of immunohistochemistry (IHC) results were combined to create a unique view on brain-enriched genes important for cortical physiology and provide insights in the genetic molecular mechanisms of gene expression in the brain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>The Human transcriptome</title><p>The transcriptomes of 26 peripheral human organs (testis, bone marrow, kidney, liver, esophagus, skin, heart, adrenal gland, adipose tissue, endometrium, ovary, pancreas, thyroid gland, prostate, salivary gland, stomach, colon, small intestine, duodenum, placenta, spleen, lymph node, appendix, lung, gall bladder, urinary bladder) and three frontal cortex samples (<xref rid="pone.0130028.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>) were analyzed using next generation sequencing based on specimens from altogether 95 individuals [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

In these analyses we used a cut-off value of 1 FPKM, that roughly represents one mRNA molecule per average cell in the sample [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. High correlation between biological replicates (<xref rid="pone.0130028.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) indicates low inter-individual variability in gene expression between the three frontal cortex samples. Correlation analysis also revealed relationships between tissue types. For example, both brain and adrenal medulla originate from the neuro-ectoderm, and in agreement the correlation coefficients between brain and adrenal gland is higher (<xref rid="pone.0130028.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>) as compared to brain versus testis (<xref rid="pone.0130028.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>).

Several genes generally expressed by endothelial cells such as the membrane protein caveolin 1 (CAV1) are expressed in blood vessels [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] in all organs including brain and colon (<xref rid="pone.0130028.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>).

The two main components of this brain specific feature are the ATP-binding cassette sub-family transporters P-glycoprotein 1 (P-gp, ABCB1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2). Unlike their organ function these efflux pumps are not brain-enriched, but expressed in many tissues including colon (Fig <xref rid="pone.0130028.g005" ref-type="fig">5B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0130028.g005" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>).

Based on IHC and RNAseq data, only one brain-enriched gene expressed by endothelial cells was identified: the solute carrier family protein SLC6A12 (GAT-2 or BGT-1), which is a betaine and GABA transporter that is brain-enriched and expressed in brain capillaries (<xref rid="pone.0130028.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].

These data illustrate and confirm that the majority of brain-enriched genes are cell-type specific most commonly expressed in neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Microglia and endothelial cells share the majority of expressed genes with related cells in other organs.

Hawrylycz, Lein and colleagues were the first to carry out a comprehensive study on gene expression in 900 anatomically defined regions and sub-regions of the human brain [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Here we use a different approach and aim to identify brain-enriched transcripts and their cellular distribution. The presented results are based on the analysis of 95 samples from 27 tissue types and the detection and quantification of 18,363 (91%) protein-coding genes [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and 2,959 (42%) non-coding genes expressed in the main organs of the human body. We identified coding and non-coding genes expressed in the brain with no or much lower expression in other organs (enriched/enhanced), and genes expressed in the brain with shared expression with other organs and tissue types (group-enriched). It seems relevant to continue this approach by zooming in on brain regions with cellular resolution combining cell selection and isolation techniques [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] with high throughput transcriptomics as has been executed in the mouse brain [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This will allow full characterization of cell types that populate the nervous system and identification of molecular networks based on cellular expression profiles. The integration of expression and distribution data will then advance the understanding of protein functions on a cellular and organ level.</p><p>First focus of this study was to generate a comprehensive list of genes with elevated expression in the human brain compared to analyzed peripheral tissues and to further characterize these brain-enriched protein-coding genes, by determining enriched biological functions and cellular expression. GO analysis of brain-enriched genes (including group-enriched), using all genes expressed in the brain as background, revealed many enriched GO-terms directly associated with development of the nervous system or synaptic signaling (<xref rid="pone.0130028.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). The strong representation of developmental genes among brain-enriched genes is somewhat surprising, since no prenatal samples were included in our analysis. Detection of developmental genes can be explained by the sensitivity of the method, being able to detect traces of genes (e.g. transcription factors) highly expressed during development, then becoming low abundant after completion of cortocogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, many developmental genes (e.g. adhesion molecules) have alternative functions in the adult brain. The enrichment of processes involved in chemical transmission is in line with the current understanding of brain physiology and is confirmed by IHC data. Of the 190 brain-enriched proteins examined, 65% was located in neuropil, containing synapses and glial endfeet (<xref rid="pone.0130028.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). We then searched for currently uncharacterized brain-enriched genes expressed in various cortical cell types. We found that the majority of brain-enriched genes examined by immunohistochemistry is expressed in neurons, astrocytes or oligodendrocytes/Schwann cells. In contrast, genes expressed by microglia and endothelial cells, are expressed in multiple organ and tissue types. These finding are supported by cellular expression studies on the mouse cerebral cortex [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Do all proteins have a single molecular function and is adaptation of tissue and organs regulated by expression of genes and transcripts with specialized properties? The fact that we identified hundreds brain-enriched genes supports the hypothesis that organ function and properties are determined by the expression of proteins with specific molecular characteristics and cellular functions. However, the fact that we did not find many brain-specific genes, suggests a more context-dependent functional adaptation of proteins resulting in specific tissue and organ functions. This is supported by the many group-enriched genes expressed in brain and non-related tissue types (e.g testis and liver) or the expression of BBB proteins ABCB1 (P-gp) and ABCG2 (BCRP) in glandular cells in colon. We also explored NECAB1 splice variants expressed in brain and heart muscle. The fact that NECAB1 expressed in heart lacks the N-terminal calcium binding EF-hand motif suggests a different cellular function of this protein in heart muscle and brain.</p><p>An additional benefit of our approach is the possibility to identify and quantify the expression of lncRNAs. Here we analyzed the genomic organization and expression patterns of brain-enriched non-coding genes in relation to protein-coding neighboring genes. The results presented here suggest a consistent pattern of neighboring genes with similar enriched expression characteristics, and the existence of chromosomal &#x02018;hot spots&#x02019; containing several brain-enriched coding and non-coding genes. For example a 3,185 kb region at position q16.1 of chromosome 6 (<xref rid="pone.0130028.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref>) contains several brain-enriched genes on the forward strand. Genome-wide association studies revealed a risk loci for bipolar disorder downstream of POU3F2 [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and a region around KLHL32, GPR63 and NDUFA4 associated with Tourette syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], indicating the importance of these enriched regions for establishing cortical functions. Our data also revealed a strong association of enriched lncRNA coding genes and transcription factor genes (<xref rid="pone.0130028.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). These data support the hypothesis of locus control around transcription factor and homeobox genes by local chromatic modifications, which has been suggested to be a key process in switching from a transcription inactive to active state [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The current hypothesis is that a class of mainly intergenic lncRNAs are involved in the recruitment of chromatin modifiers to specific loci [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], which could explain lncRNA (HOTTIP) mediated regulate expression of neighboring HOXA genes [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and could be a key process during organogenesis. It has recently become evident that transcription and epigenetic control involves chromatin modifications. Our results revealed an expression pattern that indicates regional regulation of clustered genes and a possible role of lncRNAs.

A hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stained frozen section (4&#x003bc;m) was prepared from each sample using a cryostat and the CryoJane Tape-Transfer System (Instrumedics, St. Louis, MO, USA). Each slide was examined by a pathologist to ensure proper tissue morphology and sample composition (white versus grey matter) and absence of evident pathological processes. Three sections (10&#x003bc;m thick) were cut from each frozen tissue block and collected into a tube for subsequent RNA extraction. The tissue was homogenized mechanically using a 3 mm steel grinding ball (VWR, Stockholm, Sweden). Total RNA was extracted from tissue samples using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The extracted RNA samples were analyzed using either an Experion automated electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) with the standard-sensitivity RNA chip or an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system (Agilent Biotechnologies, Palo Alto,CA) with the RNA 6000 Nano Labchip Kit. Only samples of high-quality RNA (RNA Integrity Number &#x02265;7.5) were used in the following mRNA sample preparation for sequencing. mRNA sequencing was performed on Illumina HiSeq2000 and 2500 machines (Illumina, San Diego, CA) using the standard Illumina RNA-seq protocol with a read length of 2x100 bases. For sequencing, samples were multiplexed with at most 15 samples per lane, producing an minimum of 12 million and an average of 35.8 million mappable read pairs per sample (n = 95, <xref rid="pone.0130028.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Analysis of data</title><p>The raw reads obtained from the sequencing system were trimmed for low quality ends with the software sickle (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/najoshi/sickle">https://github.com/najoshi/sickle</ext-link>), using a phred quality threshold of 20.

If a tissue-specific gene is only expressed in one type of tissue at any given time during life, it is necessary to define expression and to analyze all tissues at any developmental stage. Therefore, we believe the term &#x02018;specific&#x02019; is misleading and prefer to use &#x02018;enriched&#x02019;, when comparing tissue types, and &#x02018;enhanced&#x02019; when comparing mean global expression levels. The average FPKM value of all individual samples for each tissue was used to estimate the gene expression level. A cutoff value of 1 FPKM was used as the detection limit.

TMA sections were immunostained as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Briefly, slides were deparaffinized in xylene, hydrated in graded alcohols and blocked for endogenous peroxidase in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide diluted in 95% ethanol. For antigen retrieval, a Decloaking chamber (Biocare Medical, Walnut Creek, CA) was used. Slides were immersed and boiled in Citrate buffer, pH6 (Lab Vision, Freemont, CA) for 4 minutes at 125&#x000b0;C and then allowed to cool to 90&#x000b0;C. Automated IHC was performed essentially as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0130028.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], in brief, using an Autostainer 480 instrument (Lab Vision). Primary antibodies and a dextran polymer visualization system (UltraVision LP HRP polymer, Lab Vision) were incubated for 30 minutes each at room temperature and slides were developed for 10 minutes using Diaminobenzidine (Lab Vision) as chromogen. All incubations were followed by rinse in wash buffer (Lab Vision). Slides were counterstained in Mayers hematoxylin (Histolab, G&#x000f6;teborg, Sweden) and cover slipped using Pertex (Histolab) as mounting medium. Incubation with PBS instead of primary antibody served as negative control. The Aperio ScanScope XT Slide Scanner (Aperio Technologies, Vista, CA) system was used to capture digital whole slide images with a 20X objective. Whole slide images were de-arrayed to obtain individual images of each core. The outcome of immunohistochemical stainings in the screening phase, that included various normal tissues, was manually evaluated and scored by certified pathologists. In brief, the manual score of IHC-based protein expression was determined as the percentage of positive cells defined in different tissues: 0 = 0&#x02013;1%, 1 = 2&#x02013;25%, 2 = 26&#x02013;75%, 3&#x0003e;75% and intensity of immunoreactivity: 0 = negative, 1 = weak, 2 = moderate and 3 = strong staining.</p><p>The immunohistochemical staining pattern was visually evaluated for antibodies targeting the genes of interest, and staining profiles were compared with RNA values in 27 analyzed tissues. Each antibody was scored for reliability, taking into account the effect of antibody titration on intensity of immunoreactivity. We considered an antibody to be reliable, if the staining pattern was (i) consistent with the expression profile, (ii) partly consistent with the RNA profile together with supporting western blot or (iii) was consistent when obtained with multiple antibodies recognizing different epitopes of the target protein. Only such antibodies were included in this study (<xref rid="pone.0130028.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). In total 190 brain-enriched genes (127 brain-enriched and 63 group-enriched) as well as 130 genes expressed in all tissues with consistent immunohistochemistry data provided by at least two antibodies were selected. Neuronal-like and glia-like staining patterns and neuropil (including axons, dendrites, synapses and glial endfeet) were annotated manually.
