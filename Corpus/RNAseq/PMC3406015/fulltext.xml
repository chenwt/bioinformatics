However, the roles in mammalian biology of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) are not well understood. Few lncRNAs have experimentally determined roles, with some of these being lineage-specific. Determining the extent by which transcription of lncRNA loci is retained or lost across multiple evolutionary lineages is essential if we are to understand their contribution to mammalian biology and to lineage-specific traits. Here, we experimentally investigated the conservation of lncRNA expression among closely related rodent species, allowing the evolution of DNA sequence to be uncoupled from evolution of transcript expression. We generated total RNA (RNAseq) and H3K4me3-bound (ChIPseq) DNA data, and combined both to construct catalogues of transcripts expressed in the adult liver of <italic>Mus musculus domesticus</italic> (C57BL/6J), <italic>Mus musculus castaneus</italic>, and <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>. We estimated the rate of transcriptional turnover of lncRNAs and investigated the effects of their lineage-specific birth or death. LncRNA transcription showed considerably greater gain and loss during rodent evolution, compared with protein-coding genes. Nucleotide substitution rates were found to mirror the <italic>in vivo</italic> transcriptional conservation of intergenic lncRNAs between rodents: only the sequences of noncoding loci with conserved transcription were constrained. Finally, we found that lineage-specific intergenic lncRNAs appear to be associated with modestly elevated expression of genomically neighbouring protein-coding genes. Our findings show that nearly half of intergenic lncRNA loci have been gained or lost since the last common ancestor of mouse and rat, and they predict that such rapid transcriptional turnover contributes to the evolution of tissue- and lineage-specific gene expression.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The best-understood portion of mammalian genomes contains genes transcribed into RNAs, which are subsequently translated into proteins. These genes are generally under high selective pressure and deeply conserved between species. Recent publications have revealed novel classes of genes, which are also transcribed into RNA but are not subsequently translated into proteins. One such novel class are long noncoding RNA (lncRNA). LncRNA loci are controlled in a similar manner to protein-coding genes, yet are more often expressed tissue-specifically, and their conservation and function(s) are mostly unknown. Previous reports suggest that lncRNAs can affect the expression of nearby protein-coding genes or act at a distance to control broader biological processes. Also, lncRNA sequence is poorly conserved between mammals compared with protein-coding genes, but how rapidly their transcription evolves, particularly between closely related species, remains unknown. By comparing lncRNA expression between homologous tissues in two species of mouse and in rat, we discovered that lncRNA genes are &#x0201c;born&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;die&#x0201d; more rapidly than protein-coding genes and that this rapid evolution impacts the expression levels of nearby coding genes. This local regulation of gene expression reveals a functional role for the rapid evolution of lncRNAs, which may contribute to biological differences between species.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammalian transcriptome has recently been shown to be surprisingly diverse in its extent and encoded functions <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Bertone1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1002841-Cloonan1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, much of which are noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) as they are not translated into proteins. The ability to sequence the entire transcriptome in an unbiased manner has not only allowed more complete characterization of well described and highly abundant noncoding RNAs with known function, such as transfer RNAs, small nuclear RNAs, small nucleolar RNAs and ribosomal RNAs, but have also revealed additional ncRNA species. For example, a number of long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) larger than 200 nucleotides (nt) have been discovered <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Carninci1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Okazaki1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Guttman1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Many lncRNA loci are intergenic, when transcription occurs wholly within the genomic intervals between two adjacent protein-coding genes <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Mercer1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Some lncRNAs can be transcribed divergently from a neighbouring protein-coding transcript using identical or almost identical transcriptional initiation complexes <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Mercer1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In addition, lncRNAs overlapping with protein-coding genes can be transcribed from either strand <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Mercer1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1002841-Engstrom1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Although the precise roles of many lncRNAs remain unknown, in general they are thought to act in transcriptional regulation <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Mercer1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Ponting1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. LncRNAs can regulate gene expression programs through a variety of mechanisms, including interactions with chromatin remodelling complexes or transcription factors <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Huarte1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Consistent with a <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory role, co-expression of intergenic lncRNA loci with their neighbouring protein-coding genes has been observed <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Ponjavic1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Orom1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and a number of intergenic lncRNAs have demonstrated roles in regulating the expression of genes in their genomic vicinity <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Ponting1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.

Nevertheless, the exact proportion and the distinguishing features of <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-acting intergenic lncRNAs remain unknown.</p><p>If lncRNAs' functional roles are conserved it is expected that their loci should be evolutionarily preserved. Indeed, the transcripts and promoters of mammalian intergenic lncRNAs exhibit signatures of selective constraint: their promoters are highly conserved across vertebrates <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Carninci1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and they have accumulated fewer substitutions than neighbouring putative neutral sequence <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Ponjavic2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Marques1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However little is yet known of the evolutionary persistence of lncRNA transcription. Generally the loss and gain of functional noncoding sequence can occur rapidly, with approximately half of all functional ancestral nucleotides predicted to have been gained or lost in mouse or rat since their common ancestor <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Meader1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Other noncoding RNAs, in particular tRNAs, have been shown to exhibit rapid turnover of their transcribed loci, despite conservation of their function <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Kutter1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Turnover of regulatory elements underlies species-specific transcriptional evolution and may be associated with phenotypic changes <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Barrett1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>Only a small minority of intergenic lncRNAs in mouse or human were found to have transcribed orthologous sequences in the other species <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Church1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Cabili1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.

Indeed, analysis of the transcription of three intergenic lncRNA loci across homologous regions of the mammalian and avian brain revealed that some intergenic lncRNAs can have conserved expression patterns <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Chodroff1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>To resolve the extent of lncRNA transcriptional turnover it is important to undertake a careful comparison of lncRNA transcription in homogeneous and homologous tissues.

These differences in species separation across evolutionary time allowed us to take two snapshots of transcriptional turnover during rodent evolution, using the closest wild-derived mouse species (Mcas) to Mmus that is commercially available and Rnor as the evolutionary nearest rodent species with a well-annotated genome. Similar to the characterization of transcripts in Mmus liver, we performed RNAseq and H3K4me3 ChIPseq experiments in Mcas and Rnor, and identified 158 and 605 intergenic lncRNAs respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002841.s015">Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002841.s019">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002841.s020">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002841.s021">S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002841.s022">S8</xref>). The observed difference between the numbers of annotated intergenic lncRNA loci across the three rodents (293, 158 and 605 for Mmus, Mcas and Rnor, respectively) can be either due to experimental bias or underlying biology. To test the contribution of the difference in read number of each species RNAseq library (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002841.s015">Table S1</xref>), we reassembled transcripts in Mmus and Rnor after randomly selecting from Mmus and Rnor libraries the same number of reads as Mcas, our smallest library (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002841.s015">Table S1</xref>). For each species we repeated this procedure 10 times. By comparing the numbers of intergenic lncRNAs in Mmus or Rnor that overlapped a transcript from these recreated libraries, we found that the differences in numbers of lncRNAs between mice (Mmus and Mcas) species are mostly due to the depth of sequencing. After adjusting the read number of the Mmus RNAseq library to the Mcas RNAseq library, we identified a mean of 154 intergenic lncRNA loci (standard deviation&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3.4) for Mmus, a similar number to the one assembled in Mcas (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;158), suggesting that the difference in the number of lncRNA loci is due to an experimental bias. In contrast, in Rnor, using the same number of sequencing reads the reduction approach afforded a mean of 284 intergenic lncRNA loci (standard deviation&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5.9). This number corresponds to a 80&#x00025; rise over the 158 Mcas intergenic lncRNA loci and indicates that there is an increase of liver lncRNA loci in the rat lineage.</p><fig id="pgen-1002841-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1002841.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Transcriptional turnover of liver expressed transcripts in rodents.</title><p>(A) Primary liver tissue was isolated from Mmus and two other rodents whose lineage split from Mmus one million years (Mcas) or 13 to 19 million years (Rnor).

We next investigated if some relative orientations of lineage-specific lncRNA transcription were more frequently associated with increased expression of the most proximal protein-coding gene. We divided lineage-specific intergenic lncRNA and protein-coding gene pairs into three classes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002841.s012">Figure S12A</xref>): tandem (48 gene pairs) if transcription occurred in the same orientation, divergent (71 gene pairs), or convergent (17 gene pairs) if transcription occurred in opposite directions either diverging or converging, respectively. All three relative genomic arrangements are associated with increased expression of the closest protein-coding genes. Both tandem and convergent orientations are associated with significantly increased expression at the 5&#x00025; level while divergent orientation is significant at the 10&#x00025; level (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.08, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002841.s012">Figure S12B</xref>).</p><p>We considered a number of possible interpretations for this apparent association of lineage-specific intergenic lncRNAs with increased transcription of nearby protein-coding genes.

We excluded paralogous protein-coding gene pairs and considered only protein-coding genes A&#x02032; with a one-to-one ortholog in rat (89 genes). Transcription levels of nearby genes appear unaffected by the presence of lineage-specific protein-coding gene transcription in the genomic vicinity (median fold-difference&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.052, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003e;0.4) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002841.s013">Figure S13</xref>). As an additional control, we compared the densities of chromatin boundary elements (CCCTC-binding factor [CTCF]-bound sites) and DNase I hypersensitivity sites in the intergenic regions between (i) the lineage-specifically expressed intergenic lncRNA locus and its neighboring protein-coding gene A and (ii) protein-coding genes B, using data from previous studies <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Ling1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. We found no significant differences between these densities (permutation test <italic>p</italic>&#x0003e;0.2). The association between lineage-specific lncRNA transcription and increased expression levels of neighbouring protein-coding genes might depend on the distance between their transcriptional start sites (TSSs). The median distance of the TSS of a lineage-specifically expressed intergenic lncRNA with its closest protein-coding gene is 22 kb. However, no significant correlation was observed between this distance and the median fold difference in expression for protein-coding genes measured between mouse and rat (Pearson correlation, R&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.03, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.76, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002841.s014">Figure S14</xref>).</p><p>Our comparison of matched tissues in two species thus revealed that birth or death of intergenic lncRNAs is associated with changes in transcription of proximal protein-coding genes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>To investigate the evolution of lncRNAs, we identified the highest confidence set of lncRNAs in matched, nutritionally unstressed, adult livers of three closely related rodent species: Mmus, Mcas and Rnor, by combining genome-wide interrogation of chromatin signatures and total RNA expression. This highly conservative set of lncRNAs confirmed a number of prior observations. First, many intergenic and antisense lncRNA loci are expressed in a cell/tissue- or time-specific manner: we found that the intergenic lncRNAs present in adult liver are not only absent from other adult tissues, but are perhaps surprisingly even absent in developing mouse liver. These temporally- and spatially- restricted expression patterns, together with their relatively low expression levels, likely explain why our intergenic lncRNA set shows limited overlap with previously reported sets <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Marques1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. From our analysis, two major results emerged: first, that intergenic and antisense lncRNA transcription can evolve extremely rapidly between closely related mammals; second, that this rapid evolution seems to occur simultaneously with increased expression of neighbouring protein-coding genes.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Evolution of intergenic and antisense lncRNA transcription between closely related mammals</title><p>Previous studies have indicated that 12 to 15&#x00025; of lncRNAs are conserved between human and mouse, based on comparison of EST and cDNA datasets from disparate experimental designs <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Church1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Cabili1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Our matched interspecies data are perhaps better suited to establish experimentally the rate of lncRNA turnover. The use of mouse and rat, being closely related species, minimises the effects of genomic sequence divergence, thus better uncoupling sequence and transcriptional changes. Transcription of noncoding loci is more frequently gained or lost than transcription of protein-coding genes; between 28&#x00025; and 61&#x00025; of intergenic and antisense lncRNAs, respectively are specific to the <italic>Mus</italic> genus. We expect similar turnover will be found in most cell types of various developmental stages given that liver is a typical somatic tissue <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Blouin1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. The transience of intergenic lncRNA transcription is mirrored by changes to selective pressures acting on their sequences. Our results are consistent with purifying selection acting on transcribed intergenic lncRNA loci, and with no selection acting on untranscribed orthologous sequence in other species. This coupling of transcriptional conservation with sequence constraint suggests that conserved intergenic lncRNA loci are biologically significant in rodents.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Lineage-specific intergenic lncRNAs and transcription of neighbouring protein-coding genes</title><p>The expression levels of intergenic lncRNAs and their genomically neighbouring protein-coding genes have previously been shown to be positively correlated <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Ponjavic1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Orom1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. We find that species-specific transcription of intergenic lncRNAs correlates with elevated expression of neighbouring protein-coding genes. The increased transcription observed among neighbouring genes is unique to intergenic lncRNAs, and seems unlikely to be due to local changes in chromatin environment. If the intergenic lncRNAs in other tissues and species behave similarly, intergenic lncRNAs could contribute substantially to lineage-specific and tissue-specific evolution of gene expression.</p><p>The rapid turnover we observed in lncRNA transcription strongly resembles what was recently reported for transcription factor binding events <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Bourque1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1002841-Schmidt2" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, tRNA transcription <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Kutter1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and functional regulatory sequences in general <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Meader1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

To account for differences in size of constitutively expressed portions of Mmus and Rnor genes, the total number of overlapping reads per nucleotide in Rnor was adjusted to what would be expected if the sequence in Rnor had the same length as that observed in Mmus. The expression of a gene in Rnor or Mmus is proportional to the sum of reads mapped to their exons divided by their combined length. To allow comparison of gene expression between species, read counts were normalized using TMM (edgeR package) <xref rid="pgen.1002841-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>.
