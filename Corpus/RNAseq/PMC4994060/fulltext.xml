for how heightened aerobic glycolytic
metabolism fuels cancer pathogenicity, but there are still many unexplored
pathways. Here, we have performed metabolomic profiling to map glucose
incorporation into metabolic pathways upon transformation of mammary
epithelial cells by 11 commonly mutated human oncogenes. We show that
transformation of mammary epithelial cells by oncogenic stimuli commonly
shunts glucose-derived carbons into synthesis of sialic acid, a hexosamine
pathway metabolite that is converted to CMP-sialic acid by cytidine
monophosphate <italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminic acid synthase (CMAS)
as a precursor to glycoprotein and glycolipid sialylation. We show
that CMAS knockdown leads to elevations in intracellular sialic acid
levels, a depletion of cellular sialylation, and alterations in the
expression of many cancer-relevant genes to impair breast cancer pathogenicity.
Our study reveals the heretofore unrecognized role of sialic acid
metabolism and protein sialylation in regulating the expression of
genes that maintain breast cancer pathogenicity.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>cb6b00433</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>cb-2016-004336</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="sec1">Cancer cells

metabolomic profiling showed that glycolytic
carbon incorporation was particularly and commonly heightened for
specific metabolites, including citrate, fumarate, malate, and oxaloacetate
from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle as well as sialic acid from
the hexosamine pathway (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>A&#x02013;C; <xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">Figure S1, Table S1</xref>). Heightened glycolytic metabolism into the TCA cycle has been well-studied
in the context of generating carbon sources for macromolecular building
blocks to enable cell proliferation and generation of metabolites
that influence transcriptional and signaling pathways to drive cancer
pathogenicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> However, the role of sialic
acid and the hexosamine pathway in cancer are not as well understood.
We thus focused our efforts toward elucidating the role of sialic
acid metabolism in breast cancer cell pathogenicity.</p><p>Sialic
acids are primarily synthesized <italic>de novo</italic> and, upon
metabolic activation, are incorporated at the terminal
positions of both N- and O-linked glycan chains. Sialic acid must
be activated to cytidine monophosphate (CMP)-sialic acid by cytidine
monophosphate <italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminic acid synthase (CMAS)
before sialylation of glycoproteins or glycolipids can occur. We note
that the levels of [<sup>13</sup>C]CMP-sialic acid are not as universally
heightened upon oncogenic transformation as seen with [<sup>13</sup>C]sialic acid (<xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">Figure S1</xref>). This may be
due to increased flux of this metabolite into proteins or gangliosides
or possibly reduced formation of this metabolite. Nonetheless, our
results showing heightened [<sup>13</sup>C]sialic acid levels suggested
that these cells may be amplifying glycolytic flux into the hexosamine
pathway potentially leading to heightened sialylation of proteins,
prompting us to investigate the role of sialylation in breast cancer
pathogenicity. Sialylation is an important post-translational modification
on glycosylated cell-surface proteins, and these sialoglycoproteins
are known to be enriched on the cell surface of cancer cells to drive
cancer malignancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup></p><p>To investigate
the role of sialylation and the enzyme CMAS in breast
cancer cells, we knocked down the expression of CMAS in the estrogen
receptor/progesterone receptor/HER2 receptor-negative (triple-negative)
human breast cancer 231MFP cell line using RNA interference using
a short-hairpin oligonucleotide (shCMAS) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>A). While there are many sialyltransferases
responsible for adding sialic acids onto glycan chains, only CMAS
can bioactivate the cellular pool of sialic acid and thus provide
sialyltransferases with substrates for sialylation. Modulation of
CMAS expression could therefore be used as a tool for investigating
the effect of reduced protein sialylation on breast cancer pathogenicity.
We show that CMAS knockdown in 231MFP cells impaired prolonged serum-free
cell survival and tumor xenograft growth in immune-deficient mice,
indicating that CMAS expression and sialylation capacity was important
in maintaining breast cancer pathogenicity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>B&#x02013;C).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Knockdown of CMAS in 231MFP breast cancer

targeted
LC-MS/MS metabolomic profiling to investigate the metabolic and biochemical
alterations conferred by CMAS knockdown in 231MFP cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>D,E; <xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">Table S2</xref>). We filtered for changes in metabolite
levels that were highly significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01)
and robustly changing (&#x0003e;5-fold) in shCMAS cells compared to shControl
cells. CMAS knockdown led to impressive greater than 20-fold elevations
in the intracellular free sialic acid pool. Additionally, we observed
other hexosamine pathway metabolites increasing, with &#x0003e;5-fold changes
in <italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminic acid-9-phosphate and <italic>N</italic>-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc). The only significantly altered
metabolite not found in the hexosamine pathway was an increase in
pantothenate (vitamin B<sub>5</sub>), a necessary metabolite for coenzyme
A synthesis. While the exact role for pantothenate metabolism in the
context of sialic acid synthesis is unclear, we predict that increased
sialic acid production would similarly need an increased substrate
pool of acetyl-CoA. Conversely, we observed a reduction in the product
of the reaction catalyzed by CMAS, CMP-sialic acid, with a 5-fold
decrease in shCMAS cells as compared to control cells. Taken together,
our data indicate that CMAS knockdown specifically causes a large
accumulation of intracellular sialic acid which then causes a backlog
of hexosamine pathway intermediates and depletes the cells of CMP-sialic
acid (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>F). Importantly,
CMAS knockdown creates a unique and distinct metabolic profile that
does not appear to affect other pathways such as glycolysis, TCA cycle,
or the synthesis of amino acids or nucleotides.</p><p>We next assessed
whether CMAS knockdown caused changes in the amount
of sialic acids capping terminal glycan chains. We removed freely
soluble intracellular metabolites including sialic acid via solvent
extraction, followed by enzymatic digestion with neuraminidase to
cleave off sialic acid from glycan chains. Following SRM-based LC-MS/MS
analysis of enzymatically released sialic acid, we found that CMAS
knockdown caused a drastic reduction in the total amount of sialic
acid-capped glycans (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>G).</p><p>To determine whether this CMAS knockdown impaired
the ability of
the cell to sialylate newly synthesized or post-translationally modified
proteins due to the lack of CMP-sialic acid, we labeled cells with
a bioorthogonal azide-modified mannosamine (ManNAz). ManNAz is utilized
by cells in a manner similar to ManNAc, converted biochemically into
an azide-modified sialic acid, and then metabolically incorporated
into nascent glycans to create an azido-sialoglycan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> Upon using copper-catalyzed click-chemistry to append a
rhodamine handle for gel-based fluorescent detection of sialylated
proteins, we showed that CMAS knockdown reduced the incorporation
of azide-modified sialic acid into glycoproteins. This labeling strategy
showed that <italic>de novo</italic> sialylation of glycoproteins
is reduced with CMAS knockdown (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>H).</p><p>We next wanted to further characterize the
identification of sialylated
glycoproteins in 231MFP cells that were affected by CMAS knockdown.
We thus labeled shControl and shCMAS 231MFP cells with ManNAz, appended
a biotin handle via click-chemistry for subsequent avidin enrichment,
tryptic digestion, and proteomic analysis. We identified 7 proteins
that were both significantly enriched with ManNAz labeling compared
to DMSO-treated cells (&#x0003e;4-fold), as well as significantly reduced
in shCMAS cells compared to shControl cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>I, <xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">Table S3</xref>).
Interestingly, these sialylated proteins included important oncogenic
signaling proteins such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
as well as the breast cancer stem cell marker CD44. We further validated
EGFR as a sialylated protein through biotin-mediated enrichment of
azide-tagged sialylated EGFR followed by immunoblotting with a total
EGFR antibody (<xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>To further
elucidate whether loss of sialylation mediated by CMAS
knockdown affected EGFR signaling, we measured EGFR expression and
activity. We observed an approximate 50% reduction of phosphotyrosine<sup>1068</sup> EGFR level in shCMAS cells compared to shControl cells
(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>J). However,
we were surprised to also observe an equivalent reduction in total
EGFR protein expression. The ratio of phosphorylated EGFR to total
EGFR total protein level was unchanged with CMAS knockdown, indicating
that reduced levels of phosphorylated EGFR were likely due to downregulation
of EGFR protein expression. Similarly, we also observed reductions
in the protein levels of all glycosylated forms of CD44 with CMAS
knockdown (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>J). Although not found through our ManNAz screen, we report here
that the Siglec sialic-acid-binding family member CD22 is also downregulated
with CMAS knockdown (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>J). CD22 is known to bind sialic-acid-containing glycan ligands
not just <italic>in trans</italic> but also on the same cell surface,
suggesting that there may be a potential feedback loop between autonomous
cellular display of sialoglycans and protein expression of CD22.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup></p><p>We initially considered the possibility that reduced sialylation
of glycoproteins led to their post-translational downregulation in
protein expression via increased lysosomal or proteasomal degradation
(<xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">Figure S3</xref>). This was not the case, since
lysosomal inhibition by chloroquine or proteosomal inhibition by MG132
did not rescue the EGFR downregulation conferred by CMAS knockdown
(<xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">Figure S3</xref>). We instead found that EGFR,
CD44, and CD22 are transcriptionally downregulated in shCMAS cells
to an extent that is comparable to their respective protein levels
(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>K). Collectively,
our data indicate that CMAS knockdown and impaired protein sialylation
leads to impaired cancer pathogenicity, potentially through the transcriptional
downregulation of cell-surface sialylated or sialic-acid responsive
proteins including EGFR, CD44, and CD22.</p><p>Intrigued by these
results, we next performed transcriptomic analysis
using RNASeq to investigate additional transcriptional changes that
occur upon loss of CMAS expression and globally reduced cellular sialylation.
Interestingly, over the 40&#x0202f;000 mRNA transcripts profiled, we
observed 221 transcripts changing significantly greater than 2-fold
(<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 with multiple-testing correction for
statistical analysis) with expression level (as read by transcripts
per kilobase million) of &#x0003e;30 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>A; <xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">Table S4</xref>).
Incredibly,
of these 221 transcripts that change with CMAS knockdown, we observe
a substantial overlap with our ManNAz metabolic labeling proteomics
data. HLA-A, HLA-B, EGFR, NRP1, and SLC1A5 are all sialylated according
to our proteomic identification and are transcriptionally downregulated
with decreased cellular sialylation capacity. We were particularly
interested in additional genes that may be downregulated by CMAS knockdown
to better understand the scope of transcriptional regulation controlled
by cellular sialylation pathways. Among the strongest downregulated
(&#x0003e;4-fold) transcriptional alterations in shCMAS cells included
palmitoyl
protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1), nucleolin (NCL), chemokine C-X-C motif
ligand 1 (CXCL1), ETS-domain protein (ELK3), dysadherin (FXDY5) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>B), which were subsequently
validated by RT-qPCR. Notably, all of these genes separately have
been previously demonstrated to be important mediators of cancer pathogenicity.
For example, PPT1 inhibition has been shown to increase cell death
in neuroblastoma cell lines, whereas PPT1 overexpression protects
these cells against apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> Nucleolin (NCL) is

processes that were significantly altered upon CMAS knockdown were
those involved in immunological responses (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>C; <xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">Figure S4</xref>).
It has become clear with recent studies in cancer immunology that
chemokines and their receptors play complex biological roles in host&#x02013;tumor
interactions, including cell survival and metastatic potential. Differential
sialylation can alter activity of receptors and change cellular response
to ligand secretion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> Here we observe transcriptional downregulation of
cytokines interleukin 1 and 6 (IL-1, IL-6), both of which are commonly
upregulated in breast cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> We see downregulation of many
chemokine ligands such as CXCL2 and 10, CCL2 and 20, and the promiscuous
chemokine receptor CCR1. Chemokines and their receptors have numerous
implications in cancer, particularly in immune cell infiltration of
tumors and influence of metastatic or site-specific spread of tumor
cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> Taken together, our results indicate
that cellular sialylation broadly regulates transcription of inflammatory
and secretory pathways that are necessary for aggressive cellular
phenotypes, and reduction in cellular sialylation capacity disrupts
breast cancer pathogenic features.</p><p>Here we show that CMAS knockdown
in 231MFP breast cancer cells
causes broad transcriptional changes resulting in the downregulation
of many genes that are important in maintaining cancer cell pathogenicity.
We report that oncogenic transformation of mammary epithelial cells
by multiple different commonly mutated or amplified human oncogenes
resulted in heightened glucose incorporation into sialic acid, an
important metabolite used for glycan sialylation. Our results are
consistent with previous studies that have shown that transformation
of cancer cells by KRAS or other oncogenic programs, such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition, leads to stimulation of glycolytic metabolism into hexosamine
biosynthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> Our data indicates that, unknown
until now, many other oncogenic programs also contribute to diversion
of glycolytic intermediates toward the hexosamine pathway. Sialic
acid has been previously shown to be involved in resistance to apoptotic
signaling, immune cell evasion, chemotherapeutic resistance, cancer
progression, and metastasis. Sialyltransferases and sialidases are
also known to be dysregulated in cancers; inhibition of protein sialylation
through knockdown of individual sialyltransferases has been shown
to impair cancer pathogenicity, but the mechanism underlying these
changes have remained unclear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup></p><p>Here, we show
that globally impairing protein sialylation by knockdown
of CMAS leads to impaired phenotypic hallmarks of breast cancer pathogenicity
and moreover results in broad negative alterations in gene expression
of several key transformation and malignancy-promoting genes, including
the glycoproteins EGFR and CD44, as well as downregulation of a host
of other genes with known involvement in cancer progression. Whether
the loss of cellular sialylation can additionally alter the glycosylation
pattern of individual proteins, impacting their function or regulation,
is yet to be determined. While we show that CMAS knockdown leads to
striking biochemical changes in the hexosamine pathway metabolites,
we believe that the phenotypes and transcriptional changes observed
are likely due to reduced sialylation.</p><p>We do not yet understand
by which mechanism(s) CMAS knockdown leads
to the noted transcriptional changes or the extent of the contribution
of these transcriptional changes to the observed phenotypes. There
is a precedent for transcriptional changes conferred by modulation
of other hexosamine metabolites. Wellen et al. showed that glucose
deprivation led to marked reduction in glutamine uptake and progressive
cellular atrophy in mammalian cells through the <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)-dependent downregulation of IL-3 receptor
&#x003b1;, which in-turn led to transcriptional regulation of amino
acid transporters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> In addition, O-GlcNAc
modifications have also been shown to control transcriptional programs
through modification of transcriptional complexes or epigenetic regulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> Our data thus far point to indirect transcriptional
regulation of many genes through impairing protein sialylation, including
sialylated proteins EGFR and CD44, which are well-studied in the context
of cancer. We postulate that reduced protein sialylation, perhaps
of a particular yet unidentified protein, may lead to lysosomal or
proteasome-mediated degradation and in turn cause the observed transcriptional
signature we report here. Future studies would be necessary to identify
such a protein, if any, by comparing protein abundance to gene expression
to identify proteins that are downregulated only at the protein level.</p><p>Here we reveal a potential novel pathway through which heightened
utilization of glucose through glycolysis effect fuels cancer pathogenicity
via shunting metabolic intermediates into hexosamine biosynthesis
of sialic acids. We show that heightened glycolytic metabolism generates
increased sialic acid levels as a substrate for glycan sialylation,
in turn maintaining a transcriptional signature rich in expression
of genes involved in breast cancer cell pathogenicity. We further
show that reducing cellular sialylation through knockdown of CMAS
leads to transcriptional reprogramming and reduced breast cancer pathogenicity.</p><sec id="sec2"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Cell Lines
