We hypothesized that informative marker sets can be obtained by combining genes with a relatively low degree of individual differential expression. We developed a method for construction of highly informative gene combinations aimed at the maximization of the cumulative informative power and identified sets of 2&#x02013;5 genes efficiently predicting recurrence for ER-positive breast cancer patients. The gene combinations constructed on the basis of microarray data were successfully applied to data acquired by RNA-seq. The developed method provides the basis for the generation of highly efficient prognostic and predictive gene signatures for cancer and other diseases. The identified gene sets can potentially reveal novel essential segments of gene interaction networks and pathways implied in cancer progression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Transcriptomic analysis is an important tool for both theoretical research and clinical applications, including diagnosis, prognosis of disease and the optimal therapy choice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. However, it should be noted that for both theoretical research and clinical applications transcripts with the highest individual informative power are commonly used, more specifically the ones having the best differential expression characteristics including the lowest p-values and the highest fold-changes. This approach is used not only for the analysis related to individual transcriptomic markers, but also for the analysis dealing with combinations of transcripts, in particular, with gene signatures. Gene signatures are traditionally constructed by combining top N genes with respect to a certain measure of gene individual informative power, without any attempts to maximize the cumulative informative power of a gene combination. The top-N approach was used for the construction of such gene signatures, as Oncotype DX<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, MammaPrint<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, PAM50<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. The N value (number of used genes) is typically less than a few hundreds and often comprises several dozens: 16 prognostic (and 5 control/reference) genes for OncotypeDX, 70 for MammaPrint, 50 for PAM50. Thus the use of top-N approach for gene signature construction automatically excludes all genes with a relatively low individual informative power from the scope of the analysis.</p><p>At the same time, as the synthetic example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> shows, genes with low individual informative power can make a significant contribution into the cumulative informative power of transcripts combination. In this synthetic example gene 1 has a high degree of differential expression, but does not provide the separation of groups. Gene 2 has a low degree of differential expression. However, the pair consisting of these genes provides ideal separation of groups confirming a significant contribution of gene 2 into the cumulative informative power of the pair.</p><p>We hypothesized that genes with low degree of differential expression could also work efficiently for experimental datasets. One of the well-known approaches to the utilization of expression data for genes with low individual informative power is to analyze gene expression correlations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. However, the fact that certain genes have highly correlated expression for one group of samples and low correlated expression for another group, reveals general differences of transcriptomes between groups of samples, but does not lead to the reliable conclusion about the attribution of a given individual sample to one of these groups.</p><p>In this work we constructed the classifiers that attributed samples to one of the given classes and identified informative combinations of transcripts. The high informative power of a combination of transcripts was defined as high reliability of the classifier based on this combination. Classifiers were constructed using Support Vector Machine (SVM), more specifically soft-margin SVM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> with linear kernel.</p><p>A microarray dataset consisting of ER-positive breast cancer samples was taken for the examination of the proposed hypothesis that genes with low level of differential expression can in combinations nevertheless reliably reveal phenotypical differences. Validation procedure used a similar dataset as well as an RNAseq-based dataset.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Outline of the experiment</title><p>A key step in the present study is the analysis of the informative power of all pairs of genes. The samples were divided into three non-overlapping groups including training group, filtration group (consisting of two sub-groups) and validation (testing) group. The training group comprised microarray data from GSE17705 dataset<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, the filtration sub-groups contained microarray datasets GSE12093<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> and GSE6532<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, and the dataset GSE3494<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> was used for validation. The numbers of patients in each group are indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>.</p><p>Genes with low or constant expression level in the training dataset were excluded from the analysis (see Methods). The analyzed set consisted of 14,712 probesets corresponded to 10,060 genes.</p><p>For each pair of probesets a binary classifier was constructed separating the groups of patients with recurrence within five years after surgery and no recurrence. We used the training dataset and the support vector machine approach (soft-margin SVM with linear kernel) in this step. The reliability of the classifier was evaluated on the training group as well as on the two filtration subgroups. If the quality of the classification met the accepted criteria, the pair was considered informative and was further used on the validation dataset. Filtration based on additional groups along with the training dataset provided the removal of gene pairs that worked well for the training dataset solely because of the specific properties of the training dataset or as a result of a coincidence due to the large number of analyzed classifiers (more than 100 million).</p><p>The general outline of the analysis of gene pairs is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>.</p><p>This analysis was followed by the construction of larger gene combinations performed by a specially developed greedy-type extension algorithm.</p><p>The total amount of computation required for the construction of gene pairs and larger gene combinations exceeded 50,000 CPU-hours.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>AUC-based study of gene pairs</title><p>The area under the ROC-curve (AUC) is a commonly accepted characteristic of the quality of the classifier. For a random sample attribution AUC equals 0.5, and error-free classifiers have AUC equal to 1. We set the AUC threshold to 0.75 for the training dataset and to 0.7 for each filtration dataset. This resulted in 570 informative probeset pairs out of more than 100 million initial pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary File</xref>) which corresponded to 547 unique pairs of genes.</p><p>The resulted mean value of AUC for the validation group was 0.662 (95-percent confidence interval for the mean (0.659, 0.665), median 0.663). We tested a null hypothesis that the mean value of AUCs of the informative classifiers for the validation group was 0.5, i.e. corresponded to the reliability of a random classification. The p-value of this hypothesis was less than 2.2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;15</sup> confirming the reliability of constructed classifiers.</p><p>Notably, the classifiers comprised 343 genes in total with some genes belonging to more than 20 classifiers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Most of these genes are known to be biomarkers of breast cancer or involved in cancer progression, including SQLE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, CTTN<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, TTK<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, RACGAP1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, KIF4A<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, and CCNA2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. However for the gene TOMM70A there was no evidence for any role in cancer so far.</p><p>We performed category enrichment analysis for all 343 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The top of revealed categories includes phosphoproteins, acetylation, regulation of cell cycle and cell division all known to be highly relevant to malignant progression.</p><p>Interestingly, the majority of probesets forming informative pairs had low degree of differential expression with respect to 5-years recurrence and recurrence-free patients from the training dataset. More specifically, for the fold change threshold of 1.5&#x000d7; the number of probesets did not exceed 7% (23 probesets corresponding to 22 genes), whereas the total number of probesets having such fold change was 67 (60 genes). Thus the traditional approach focused on the genes having significant differential expression would exclude the majority of genes forming the informative pairs out of the researcher&#x02019;s focus.</p><p>Remarkably, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> contains only one gene with fold change higher than 1.5&#x000d7;, namely, SQLE. Moreover, nearly 90% of informative pairs consisted of probesets having the fold change lower than 1.5&#x000d7;, and there were no pairs having both probesets of higher fold change. Finally, the reliability of classification by the pairs with one probeset of fold change &#x02265;1.5&#x000d7; was equal to the reliability provided by pairs without such probesets (t-test two-tailed p-value 0.276).</p><p>The AUC mean values for the training and filtration datasets and AUC values for the validation dataset correlated significantly with the Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation p-value 4.4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;12</sup> which means that higher AUC mean value for training and filtration datasets consistently corresponded to a higher AUC for the validation dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Thus the AUC mean value for the training and filtration datasets is itself an important parameter predicting the classification quality for another dataset and can be used as a criterion to rank the identified pairs of genes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Additional sensitivity- and specificity-based filtering of gene pairs</title><p>Even in cases of high AUC values using the same classifier threshold for different datasets can be impossible or may result in a bias towards high sensitivity in combination with low specificity or the opposite bias (high specificity with low sensitivity) depending on datasets. In order to achieve balanced classification results using the same threshold we additionally performed filtration of identified gene pairs with the thresholds for the sensitivity and specificity. More specifically, for each parameter the threshold was set to 0.65 for all datasets. This filtration resulted in 14 pairs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>) having the AUC mean value 0.697 (median 0.698) and mean values of sensitivity 71.0% (median 72.7%) and specificity 60.7% (median 62.1%) for the validation dataset. Remarkably, there was only one pair containing a probeset with fold change &#x02265;1.5&#x000d7;, namely PRC1 in the pair of DLG3 and PRC1.</p><p>The pair IGFBP6-ELOVL5 showed the highest AUC mean value (0.765) for the training and filtration datasets. When the same coefficients and threshold were used, this pair exhibited outstanding classification quality for the validation dataset as well (AUC 0.749, sensitivity 81.8% and specificity 62.5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). This remarkable reliability of the classification is similar<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> to the one provided by well-known gene signatures such as OncotypeDX and MammaPrint<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, which however include more genes (21 and 70, respectively).</p><p>We tested the IGFBP6-ELOVL5 classifier on the breast cancer dataset from TCGA Research Network (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/">http://cancergenome.nih.gov/</ext-link>) obtained using RNA-seq. Surprisingly, in spite of completely different technologies of microarrays and sequencing, both sensitivity and specificity of the classifier exceeded 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). This observation points out to the fact that classifiers generated by the presented approach may be universal and can be applied to any group of ER-positive breast cancer samples even if they have been obtained using other technologies for gene expression analysis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The construction of larger combinations of genes</title><p>We investigated whether the classification quality can be improved by increasing the number of genes in the analyzed gene combinations. Since the exhaustive analysis for gene triples would already need more than 2,5 million CPU-hours and is computationally infeasible, we developed an alternative two-step approach. First we analyzed all possible extensions of 570 previously identified informative pairs by one out of the 14,712 probesets and filtered out the triples which did not pass AUC, sensitivity and specificity thresholds for training and filtration datasets. The second step consisted in a greedy element-wise optimization. The optimization started by the analysis of all possible changes of the first element in a triple and selection of the change resulting in the maximal AUC mean value for the training and filtration datasets and passing the additional thresholds on sensitivity and specificity. Then the same procedure was performed for the second and the third element of the triple and then again for the first one and so on until there was no further increase of the AUC mean value. A similar approach was used to construct quadruples starting from the triples and quintuples starting from the quadruples.</p><p>We obtained 426 triples, 291 quadruples and 414 quintuples. As expected, the increase of the number of genes in a classifier resulted in a more reliable classification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). More specifically, the transition from pairs to triples was accompanied by the increase of the AUC median value for the validation dataset from 0.663 to 0.669 (two-tailed U-test p-value 1.7&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>) and the AUC mean value from 0.662 to 0.679. The transition from triples to quadruples consistently resulted in further increase of the AUC median value up to 0.694 (two-tailed U-test p-value when comparing with triples 3.9&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) and the AUC mean value up to 0.690. During the transition from quadruples to quintuples we observed saturation or even overtraining, namely the increase of AUC on the training dataset did not lead to the similar change of this value on the validation dataset. We even found a decrease of AUC value for the validation dataset comparing to the quadruples and triples (AUC median value down to 0.669 and AUC mean value down to 0.670). At the same time, the transition to quintuples led to a significant decrease of AUC deviation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, we directly compared this greedy approach with the exhaustive analysis described above and found that the exhaustive analysis had significantly higher efficiency for gene pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Text</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Genome-wide expression analysis is a common tool, which is routinely used nowadays to identify genes which are associated with disease. It is accepted by definition to consider only the most differentially expressed so-called &#x000ab;top-genes&#x000bb; when comparing expression profiles of sample groups<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. However this traditional approach omits the majority of yet moderately differentially expressed genes completely. The approach presented here proves that these genes can contribute significantly to the construction of highly informative gene signatures.</p><p>We have compared SVM-based exhaustive search and a greedy-type extension algorithm and found that the gene signatures with the highest informative power are identified by the exhaustive search. The limitation of this method is the necessity of the use of a supercomputing facility. However, the significance of this limitation will probably be reduced due to the technical progress within the next years. The greedy-type extension algorithm is also resource-consuming, but it still allows construction of larger gene signatures in comparison with the exhaustive search construction.</p><p>We investigated the number of genes comprising the signatures and found that the informative power increases during the transition from 2 to 3 and then to 4 genes in a single signature. Further increase was diminished which can be explained by over-training of the classifier. This observation suggests that the optimal number of genes in an informative signature is limited to 3 or 4 providing a solid basis for the identification of pathways or gene cascades potentially involved in the biological processes of interest.</p><p>The reported approach identified highly informative gene signatures (pairs) using microarray expression datasets, and these signatures turned out to work efficiently on RNA sequencing-based dataset of ER-positive breast cancer patients. This points out to the fact that the classifiers constructed using our method may be universal and applicable to any other datasets of ER-positive breast cancer patients irrespectively of the gene expression analysis platform used.</p><p>The reported method allows to go beyond the limitation of the &#x0201c;top-genes&#x0201d; and covers the majority of analyzed genes. This broad approach could explain the robustness of gene signatures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> identified by our method and the observed inconsistencies of many marker genes claimed to be of prognostic or predictive value for cancer patients in other reports.</p><p>We suppose that the presented approach can potentially be applied not only for RNA expression datasets but for any other kind of biological high-throughput data including metabolome and proteome and can be adapted to SNP and methylome datasets.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Microarray datasets</title><p>All analyzed microarray datasets used Affymetrix U133A platform.

Variables with non-normal distribution were compared using Mann-Whitney U-test. The normality check was performed using the Shapiro-Wilks test. The calculation of confidence intervals for means of normally distributed variables was based on quantiles of Student&#x02019;s t-distribution. The statistical analysis of Kaplan-Meier curves used the log-rank test.
