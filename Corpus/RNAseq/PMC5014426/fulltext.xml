biosustainable hydrocarbon-based chemicals. In spite of a similar number of protein-coding genes to that in other Hemiascomycetes, the <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>lipolytica</italic> genome is almost double that of model yeasts. Despite its economic importance and several distinct strains in common use, an independent genome assembly exists for only one strain. We report here a <italic>de novo</italic> annotated assembly of the chromosomal genome of an industrially-relevant strain, W29/CLIB89, determined by hybrid next-generation sequencing. For the first time, each <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>lipolytica</italic> chromosome is represented by a single contig. The telomeric rDNA repeats were localized by Irys long-range genome mapping and one complete copy of the rDNA sequence is reported. Two large structural variants and retroelement differences with reference strain CLIB122 including a full-length, novel Ty3/Gypsy long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon and multiple LTR-like sequences are described. Strikingly, several of these are adjacent to RNA polymerase III-transcribed genes, which are almost double in number in <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>lipolytica</italic> compared to other Hemiascomycetes. In addition to previously-reported dimeric RNA polymerase III-transcribed genes, tRNA pseudogenes were identified. Multiple full-length and truncated LINE elements are also present. Therefore, although identified transposons do not constitute a significant fraction of the <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>lipolytica</italic> genome, they could have played an active role in its evolution. Differences between the sequence of this strain and of the existing reference strain underscore the utility of an additional independent genome assembly for this economically important organism.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EEC-0813570</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LM010235</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baldi</surname><given-names>Pierre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000092</institution-id><institution>U.S. National Library of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NLM 07443</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baldi</surname><given-names>Pierre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IIS-1321053</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baldi</surname><given-names>Pierre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1S10RR025496</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sandmeyer</surname><given-names>Suzanne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1S10OD010794-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sandmeyer</surname><given-names>Suzanne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award007"><funding-source><institution>National Institutes of Health (US)</institution></funding-source><award-id>S10OD021718</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sandmeyer</surname><given-names>Suzanne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award008"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA-62203</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant no.

Despite a genome almost twice the size of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>lipolytica</italic> is not thought to have undergone whole genome duplication [<xref rid="pone.0162363.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>lipolytica</italic> has more traits in common with metazoan cells than other characterized yeasts. These include dispersed 5S genes, signal-recognition-particle type 7SL RNA sequence, and a greater fraction of the genome composed of introns and intergenic sequences [<xref rid="pone.0162363.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162363.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>lipolytica</italic> genome also contains representatives of diverse classes of transposable elements, including remnants of a DNA transposon [<xref rid="pone.0162363.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], long-terminal repeat (LTR) [<xref rid="pone.0162363.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and non-LTR <italic>L</italic>ong <italic>IN</italic>terspersed <italic>E</italic>lement (LINE) [<xref rid="pone.0162363.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] retrotransposons [<xref rid="pone.0162363.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Finally, unlike the more widely-studied respiro-fermentative <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>lipolytica</italic> is an obligate aerobe. It metabolizes a wide range of carbon substrates including lipids, paraffins, oils, glycerol, and acetate and is capable of accumulating a high percentage of cell weight in lipid [<xref rid="pone.0162363.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162363.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162363.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This metabolism has recently been tuned for production of hydrocarbon chemicals.</p><p>Availability of an annotated, complete genome assembly is a significant advantage for the study of any organism. The current <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>lipolytica</italic> genomic reference sequence, YALI0, is that of <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>lipolytica</italic> strain E150/CLIB122 (hereafter CLIB122) [<xref rid="pone.0162363.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162363.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162363.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/genomes/194">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/genomes/194</ext-link>). The YALI0 assembly features the six chromosomes that have been reduced to thirteen contigs and genes that have been extensively annotated [reviewed [<xref rid="pone.0162363.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]]. CLIB122 was derived from a cross between isolates from a Paris sewer (W29/CLIB89, hereafter CLIB89) and an American corn processing plant (CBS6124-2) [<xref rid="pone.0162363.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Some current strains of industrial interest, including PO1f [<xref rid="pone.0162363.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], were derived directly from CLIB89 [<xref rid="pone.0162363.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162363.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162363.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Draft reference genomes of <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>lipolytica</italic> PO1f of 348 contigs [<xref rid="pone.0162363.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and CLIB89 of 369 contigs [<xref rid="pone.0162363.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] have recently been assembled by alignment with the CLIB122 assembly. However, a complete and independent assembly of strain CLIB89 has been lacking.</p><p>We report here the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly and annotation of the <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>lipolytica</italic> strain CLIB89 genome. Illumina and PacBio sequencing enabled a hybrid assembly of single contigs for chromosomes A-F and mitochondrial chromosome M. Irys long-range genome mapping was utilized to identify extensions of rDNA repeats on the left ends of chromosomes A, C, and F and the right end of chromosome B. Complete sequences of key genetic markers, <italic>URA3</italic> and <italic>LEU2</italic>, and one copy of rDNA sequence not represented in the CLIB122 annotation, were determined. A potentially active copy of Tyl3, a Ty3/Gypsy-like long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon was discovered. Comparison of the sequence of the CLIB89 genome to related strain CLIB122 revealed unexpected differences in numbers and types of transposable elements.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Assembly and annotation</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Genome assembly</title><p>The <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>lipolytica</italic> genome sequence was determined by HiSeq 2500 (Illumina Inc.) and PacBio RS II (Pacific Biosciences) high-throughput sequencing coupled to a hybrid assembly pipeline (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec021">Materials and Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0162363.t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162363.s011">S1 Text</xref>).

Self-alignment highlighted, as expected, repeated sequences throughout the two genomes. Many of these were 5&#x02013;6 kb or 300&#x02013;500 bp in length, consistent with the sizes of full-length or truncated LINE elements and LTR retrotransposons or solo LTRs. However, consistent with the Irys map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162363.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) comparison of the CLIB89 and CLIB122 assemblies revealed a 71-kb sequence in CLIB89 YALI1 chromosome B that was inverted relative to the same sequence in the CLIB122 YALI0 assembly and the draft CLIB89-related assemblies, PO1f and W29 [<xref rid="pone.0162363.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162363.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162363.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. PCR was performed across the upstream and downstream junctions of the inversion using primer pairs JY5118/JY5119 and JY5120/JY5121 respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162363.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). These reactions generated products consistent with the predicted sizes from the CLIB89 YALI1 assembly of 752 bp and 763 bp, respectively. Products with an identical migration pattern were generated when PO1f genomic DNA was used as a template. Furthermore, although a negative result, primer pairs JY5118/JY5121 and JY5119/5420, failed to generate a product, contrary to what was predicted in the CLIB122 YALI0 assembly. This result is consistent with the close relationship of CLIB89 and PO1f.</p><p>MUMmer analysis also revealed a striking ~115-kb region in CLIB89 YALI1, but not CLIB122 YALI0. Examination of the DNA sequence in this region showed that, consistent with the Irys map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162363.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), a 54-kb sequence was repeated with three 6.5-kb Ylli LINE copies: flanking upstream and downstream and separating the 54-kb repeats. In order to validate this structural variant, PCR was performed using primers JY5124/JY5125 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162363.s003">S1 Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162363.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), complementary to sequences at the downstream and upstream junctions of the 54-kb sequence with the central Ylli sequence. PCR generated a product consistent with the size predicted for an amplicon containing Ylli sequence bounded by head and tail ends of flanking copies of the 54-kb sequence. In the CLIB122 YALI0 assembly, the 54-kb block occurs as a single copy flanked by Ylli sequence direct repeats. These differences between the two assemblies could have been generated by unequal crossing over between the first and second Ylli elements. Local amplification of gene copy number such as this might have advantages for the host. In this case, it is difficult to speculate. There were a total of 29 features including 27 CDS among them genes implicated in stress resistance.</p><p>IrysView software was used to align the physical CLIB89 Irys Nt.BspQI molecules and virtual sequence based CLIB89 YALI1 Nt.BspQI patterns. This comparison showed consistency between the physical molecular and sequence maps, thereby confirming the orientation of a 71 kb sequence and the existence of the 54-kb direct repeat flanked by Ylli element fragments in the CLIB89 YALI1 sequence (panels C and D <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162363.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p><p>The CLIB89 YALI1 sequence was examined for the region of chromosome A encompassing four protein-coding genes found in CLIB122, but reported to be absent in the latest PO1f draft assembly (CLIB122: 196442&#x02013;215157)[<xref rid="pone.0162363.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This sequence in CLIB122 YALI0 included YALI0A01562 and YALI0A01602, genes encoding proteins with weak similarity to SMC5/6 proteins involved in DNA repair and recombination, leading to speculation that this deficiency contributes to the relatively low ratio of homologous recombination (HR) to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) observed in <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>lipolytica</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0162363.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

Therefore, rather than switching expression of a mating-type locus, strains themselves are of alternative Mating Types, A and B. CLIB89 possesses the Mating-Type A protein and CLIB122 possesses the Mating-Type B protein, consistent with the previously reported mating types [<xref rid="pone.0162363.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Twelve additional genes were identified in terminal regions of the chromosomes in the CLIB89 assembly that were not present in the CLIB122 assembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162363.s007">S5 Table</xref>). The simplest explanation is that rather than constituting an actual difference between the strains, this region was incomplete in the CLIB122 YALI0 assembly. These regions contained: one heat-shock gene on chromosome A; a block of seven genes at the end of chromosome D, and four genes within the first 32 kb of chromosome E. This interpretation is supported by sequence reads related to argininosuccinate synthase that we report to be encoded in the terminal end of chromosome D in CLIB89 YALI1, that were previously reported collected in the CLIB122 sequencing project, but not mapped to any chromosomal scaffold [<xref rid="pone.0162363.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Comparison of genes identified in CLIB89 YALI1 with those reported in CLIB122 YALI0 also identified several that were present in CLIB122 YALI0, but not identified in CLIB89 YALI1. Differences in the mating-type proteins were among these, as expected. In addition, there were multiple differences in transposon sequences of class I (RNA) and class II (DNA) elements further detailed below. In addition, we report 1428 CDS and 88 pseudogenes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0162363.t004">Table 4</xref>) in CLIB89 YALI1 sequence. The majority of the 1428 CDS were discovered in the SnowyOwl pipeline and lacked transcript or identifiable protein domain support. In addition, compared to the CDS with those properties, a significant fraction of these CDS were relatively short, although longer than 100 codons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Transposable elements in CLIB89</title><p><italic>Y</italic>. <italic>lipolytica</italic> displays striking diversity in transposon composition with relics of a Class II (DNA) element and both LTR and non-LTR class I (RNA) elements (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0162363.t005">Table 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162363.s009">S7 Table</xref>). Full-length copies of LTR retroelements can undergo recombination between the LTRs resulting in deletion of the internal domain and one LTR copy, generating a so-called solo LTR. Despite fundamental differences in transposition mechanisms, transposable elements (TE) have common distinguishing features. For example, they are typically present in multiple copies per genome. Ultimately both classes are mobilized by transposases/integrases and terminate in a conserved inverted repeat recognized by those enzymes. TG&#x02026;CA represents the minimal virtually universally conserved terminal inverted repeat, although individual elements exhibit a range of inverted repeat lengths. Insertions are initiated by strand transfer. Because these reactions occur across a DNA helix, reacting positions on the two strands are offset; repair of the single-stranded extensions caused by the offset generates short target-site duplications that flank outside transposon ends [<xref rid="pone.0162363.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We first searched for Ty1-Copialike and Ty3-Gypsylike conserved reverse transcriptase-coding sequences, and other TE sequences identified in CLIB122 YALI0. However, during identification of allelic tDNAs, we also identified a number of insertion polymorphisms which were characterized by the properties described above that are conserved among solo LTRs. Because we failed to identify a retroelement full-length copy, we designated these as LTRyl7, 8, 9. However, this did not represent an exhaustive search of the CLIB89 genome for novel LTRs.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0162363.t005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id

In that study, blotting with a MudrB probe failed to identify a complementary sequence in the CLIB89 genome. Given the relatedness of the CLIB122 and CLIB89 strains, this was interpreted to mean that the element might have been acquired by more recent horizontal transmission to the CLIB89 descendant, CLIB122. Consistent with the previous report, MudrB-coding sequence was not found in the CLIB89 YALI1. However, BLAST searches of CLIB89 sequence identified an ORF allelic to CLIB122 YALI0A14971g (YALI1A15017t) the MudrA transposase sequence in the full-length Mutyl element (YALI0A16207) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0162363.t005">Table 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162363.s009">S7 Table</xref>). Thus, partial Mutyl sequence is present in the predecessor strain at the same site as in CLIB122 and were likely shared by vertical transmission.

These elements are similar to retroviruses in that the upstream LTR contains the promoter for transcription of genomic RNA and the downstream LTR specifies transcription termination and polyadenylation [<xref rid="pone.0162363.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162363.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Retrotransposons typically contain two ORFs. The upstream ORF encodes capsid structural and nucleic acid binding domains and the downstream ORF encodes proteinase, reverse transcriptase and integrase. Elements have devised various mechanisms to ensure an excess of structural proteins over catalytic proteins. These include programmed frameshifting or even splicing to join the respective protein sequences. Two superfamilies of LTR retrotransposons are abundantly represented in eukaryotes: Ty1/Copia and Ty3/Gypsy.

Tyl6 is represented by one full-length copy and no solo LTRs. Tyl3 is represented by no full-length elements but four solo LTR copies. LTRyl1 is represented by 30 copies of solo LTR sequence [<xref rid="pone.0162363.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. As noted above, CLIB122 was derived from a cross between French strain CLIB89 and American strain CBS6124-2. Amazingly, CLIB89 YALI1 and CLIB89-derived PO1f completely lack both full-length and solo LTR copies of Ylt1 and Tyl6 based on hybridization, draft assembly and complete sequence analysis [<xref rid="pone.0162363.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162363.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162363.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] (this study). However, it has four copies of Tyl3 LTRs three of which are allelic with copies in CLIB122 and 54 copies of LTRyl1 thirty of which are allelic with copies in CLIB122 YALI0.

BLAST analysis of CLIB89 YALI1 sequence used the Ty1/Copia and Ty3/Gypsy conserved reverse transcriptase domains as queries. A truncated <italic>POL</italic> encoding a Ty1-homologous RNaseH was identified adjacent to a copy of LTRyl1. This LTR was not flanked by direct repeats of a target sequence, consistent with it representing the downstream LTR of a truncated element rather than a solo LTR derived from recombination of terminal LTRs. Ty1/Copia and Ty3/Gypsy elements differ in the order of integrase and reverse transcriptase/RNaseH domains. The position of the RNAseH-coding sequence proximal to LTRyl1, the similarity of the sequence to Ty1 RNAseH, and the lack of short direct repeats bordering the LTR argue that the LTRyl1 family is derived from an extinct Ty1/Copia element.

Comparison of the candidate LTR of this element and Tyl3 LTR sequences showed 100% identity. Sequences with similarity to nucleocapsid, and the protease active site confirmed the presence of Gag and Pol-like domains.

The outside ends of the LTRs were flanked by 5-bp target site duplications offset by one &#x0201c;T&#x0201d; in the upstream repeat (ATTTTT/ATTTT). Other features of LTR retrotransposons are also present: two nts downstream of the upstream LTR is a sequence complementary to the 3&#x02019; terminal 14 nts of initiator tRNA<sup>Met</sup>(CAU), the presumed minus-strand primer. Some patches of initiator tRNA<sup>Met</sup> complementarity were found in the downstream LTR as well, possibly indicating a bi-partite primer [<xref rid="pone.0162363.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].

Because tDNA are transcribed into pre-tRNAs which have an approximately 10-nt pre-sequence, the insertion of a 5-bp target site duplication positions retrotransposon sequence 15 to 17 bp upstream of mature tRNA-coding sequence. Sequences flanking Tyl3 and Tyl3 LTRs were analyzed using tRNAscanSE. Analysis showed that Tyl3 is inserted at the likely transcription start site of tDNA<sup>Val</sup>, previously identified in CLIB122 YALI0 sequence. In addition, two of the four Tyl3 solo LTRs are positioned at likely transcription start sites of tDNAs. Two others are less closely related and are inserted 5 bp inside the upstream end of a tDNA and at the 5&#x02019; end of a 5S rRNA gene.

Ten full-length LINEs were reported in CLIB122 YALI0. In the current study, seventeen full-length elements were identified in CLIB89 YALI1. Much of our understanding of LINES is extrapolated from studies of the active human L1 element [<xref rid="pone.0162363.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. L1 encodes first and second ORFs that are translated into structural and catalytic proteins, respectively. These associate with cytoplasmic RNAs including genomic Ylli RNA and mediate nuclear re-entry, reverse transcription, and subsequent integration. Ylli similar to L1, is a member of the class of LINES in which ORF2 encodes an apurinic-like endonuclease that nicks chromosomal AT-rich sequences.

Ylli encodes proteins of 714 and 1,300 aa, the second of which contains homology to reverse transcriptase and apurinic-type endonucleases.

However, Ylli is distinct from other LINEs in that target-site duplications have not been identified. We speculate that target-site duplications exist, but are too short to be identified, or as sometimes is the case, the ends of the element have non-templated reverse transcribed nucleotides which confound identification of the ends of insertions. Underscoring differences between the CLIB89 and CLIB122 genomes, as mentioned above, there are seventeen apparently full-length, 6.5-kb Ylli insertions in CLIB89 YALI1 and ten in CLIB122 YALI0.

Although CLIB89 was one of the parental strains used to derive CLIB122, we observed striking differences in TE composition. It was of interest to estimate the extent to which segregation versus active transposition contributed to these differences. The abundant Ylt1 in one strain but none in the other strain was particularly striking. We considered three possible hypotheses for the differences between these two closely-related strains in Ylt1 and other elements: 1) there are similar positions and numbers of the element of itnerest in both strains, but ancient versions in the CLIB89 lineage have degenerated and are no longer readily detectable by BLAST analysis; 2) copies were possibly more abundant in CBS6124-2 or CLIB89 and simply segregated differentially; and 3) a wave of retrotransposition sometime after the cross of the <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>lipolytica</italic> strains resulted in differential proliferation of elements between the two strains.</p><p>These hypotheses make distinct predictions regarding the degree of variation in sequence flanking allelic and non-allelic TE. Hypothesis one predicts that elements present in CLIB122 and as relics not identified by BLAST analysis in CLIB89 could be identified by reconstructing the sequence in CLIB122 without the insertion and aligning it to that region in CLIB89. Hypothesis two predicts that elements existing in CLIB122, but not CLIB89, such as Ylt1, would be embedded in sequence inherited from CBS6124-2 and so would be relatively enriched in variants when compared to the same region from CLIB89. Hypothesis three predicts that although some CLIB122 elements might be flanked by variants, if overall an element transposed after the CLIB89 X CBS6124-2 cross, then insertions sites would be randomly distributed across DNA from each parent and <italic>overall</italic> mismatch density would be similar to average genomewide mismatch densities.</p><p>To distinguish among these possibilities we took Ylt1 as an example of an element over-represented in CLIB122 and Tyl1 as an example of an element over-represented in CLIB89. We first manually reconstructed 27 full-length element and LTR insertion sites in CLIB122 to derive &#x0201c;na&#x000ef;ve&#x0201d; sequences for comparison to CLIB89.

Results of this analysis showed that as expected overall intergenic iLoci averaged higher variant density (M = 2.42, I = 1.05, D = 1.95) than gene feature iLoci (M = 1.17, I = 0.40, D = 0.39)(Panels A and B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162363.g005">Fig 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162363.s010">S8 Table</xref>). In contrast, the nonallelic family Ylt1with 10 full length and 17 solo LTR members exhibits flanking regions of even greater variant density (M = 9.29, I = 2.25 nd D = 3.09) whereas the 30 LTRyl1 allelic elements of the 54 LTRyl1 total elements in CLIB89 YALI1 are embedded in regions of lower variant density (M = 3.21, I = 1.54, and D = 2.52) in contrast to LTRyl1 non-allelic members (M = 4.65, I = 2.68, and D = 1.93) and Ylt1 non-allelic elements. The LINE Ylli showed a similar pattern (non-allelic, M = 7.66 versus allelic M = 0.80). Furthermore, overall, non-allelic members of TE families occurred in regions of greater variant density (M = 6.67, I = 2.72, and D = 2.98) compared to allelic members (M = 2.74, I = 1.38, D = 1.77)(Panel A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162363.g005">Fig 5</xref> Circos; Panel B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162363.g005">Fig 5</xref> box plots; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162363.s010">S8 Table</xref>). The observed differences in the mismatch/kb and insertion densities in comparing all allelic TE to non-allelic TE are significant (p = 0.0027 and p = 0.01, respectively), but the deletion density difference is less (p = 0.082). Overall, therefore while we cannot formally exclude the contribution of TE mobilization subsequent to the CBS6124-2 X CLIB89 cross as an explanation for gross differences between progeny strain CLIB122 and parent CLIB89, data are consistent with hypothesis 2, namely that non-allelic families such as Ylt1 CLIB122 elements were plausibly inherited together with flanking sequence from the CBS6124 parent, rather than supporting hypothesis 3, that subsequent to generation of CLIB122, new insertions occurred and were randomly distributed into intergenic sequence.

This information was used to determine the placement of contigs spanning repetitive regions in the genome. The PacBio scaffolding was accomplished through the following four steps: i) matching PacBio long reads with the first-stage contigs via BLAST [<xref rid="pone.0162363.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] and extending each BLAST hit via a combination of in-house software and ClustalW [<xref rid="pone.0162363.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] to generate mapped sequences with computed percent identity; ii) filtering to remove unreliable mapped sequences, sequences that will not provide scaffolding information, and sequences leading to ambiguous or conflicting cases; iii) selecting the closest, non-repetitive right-mate contig and incorporating that into the growing assembly; and iv) identifying the correct mate for a repeated contig via long-distance contig information.</p></sec><sec id="sec030"><title>Assembling junctions between extended contigs</title><p>Successful scaffolding of contigs from the previous stage enabled the identification of junction sequences.

Positions in the MSA were selected for the consensus sequence only when: i) enough reads confirmed its existence, and ii) the reads had high agreement, where the two parameters values (i, ii) were optimized for each junction for which the target consensus sequence was known. These junction sequences were further corrected for consensus by utilizing previously unused reads from datasets YL97B and YL110, where unaligned single reads in YL97B with respect to the contigs were reused by Velvet to generate additional comparison contigs, and paired reads in YL110 with part of a read in the junction regions were extracted with Eland v2e. The new contigs and selected paired reads were used iteratively to complete the error-correction.

The same approach was used to extend the chromosome ends until no more bases could be added. The chromosome C contig joint was confirmed to overlap by PCR utilizing primers annealed to unique sequences at the ends of the two contigs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162363.s003">S1 Table</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec032"><title>Mapping of chromosomal ends</title><p>Of the twelve chromosomal ends, two were similar between the CLIB89 and CLIB122 assemblies; five were longer in CLIB122.

CLIB122 sequence was appended to the ends of the CLIB89 assembly as follows: YALI0B 3' end position 3,044,622 (387 bp); YALI0C 5' end 1 8,912 bp; YALI0C 3' end position 3,353,699 (12,578 bp); YALI0D 5' end 1 3,177 bp; YALI0E 3' end position 4,188,128 bp (10,433 bp); YALI0F 3' end position 3,999,287 bp (3,679 bp). PCR amplification utilizing primers 4956/4957, 4958/4959, and 4960/4961 were used to confirm these additions to the 5&#x02019; end of YALI1C, the 3&#x02019; end of YALI1B, and the 5&#x02019; end of YALI 1D respectively. A flanking primer in the CLIB122 sequence together with a rDNA primer was used to confirm the position of one rDNA repeat.

These contig tag patterns were aligned to a virtual restriction tag pattern generated from the hybrid Illumina-PacBio YALI1 sequence. This alignment showed overall agreement between the two assemblies. However, the length of the Irys assembly was 25.246 Mb, significantly longer than either CLIB89 or CLIB122 sequence assemblies. This difference could be explained by heterogeneity of the lengths of chromosomal ends in which Irys mapping was biased for the longest extensions or redundancy in mapping terminal repeated regions. Consistent with these possibilities, inspection of the Irys assembly in telomeric regions showed that Irys contigs at the left end of chromosomes A, C, and F and the right end of chromosome B were each nearly 1 Mb longer than the corresponding YALI1 chromosomes and contained a distinctive ~10 kb unit repeat. Analysis of these regions is discussed further below.</p><p>DNA extraction and labeling was according to BioNano Genomics protocols. Briefly, CLIB89 cells were spheroplasted by treatment with Zymolyase (Seikagaku Corporation), immobilized in low-melting point agarose matrix, and treated with proteinase K (Qiagen), washed with TE, digested with RNAse and washed again with TE. Agarose was melted and digested with GELase (Epicentre Biotechnologies) to recover genomic DNA. Buffers were exchanged by drop dialysis and DNA was stained according to QuBit dsDNA HS kit instructions, sonicated and quantified on a Qubit Fluorometer. DNA molecules of average length 285 kb were subjected to digestion to completion with single-strand nickase Nt.BspQI. Finally 300 ng of DNA was labeled by limited-drive nick translation in the presence of a fluorophore-labeled nucleotide. Labeled nicks were repaired using a thermostable polymerase and ligase.</p><p>Eight microliters of DNA at a concentration of 4.6 ng/microliter DNA was loaded into a flowcell of the IrysChip for imaging in the Irys instrument in a low voltage electric field controlling sample flow of individual molecules through nanochannels for 30 cycles.
