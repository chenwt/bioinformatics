Using a genome-wide association study approach with three cases and 170 breed matched controls, a suggestive locus for sensory neuropathy was identified that was followed up using a genome sequencing approach. An inversion disrupting the candidate gene <italic>FAM134B</italic> was identified. Genotyping of additional cases and controls and RNAseq analysis provided strong evidence that the inversion is causal. Evidence of cryptic splicing resulting in novel exon transcription for <italic>FAM134B</italic> was identified by RNAseq experiments. This investigation demonstrates the identification of a novel sensory neuropathy associated mutation, by mapping using a minimal set of cases and subsequent genome sequencing.

Genome sequencing would then be used to interrogate suggestive loci from the GWAS for potential causal variants. In summary, our aims were to map the locus for SN using a minimal case set, with the use of genome sequencing techniques to identify the causal variant.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Diagnosis of SN cases and sample set selection</title><p>Three 4-month-old clinically affected [two full-sibling (one male and one female) and one unrelated (one female)] Border Collie dogs were evaluated.

Due to the small number of cases, allelic association analysis using the entire genotyping dataset did not produce a clear genome-wide significant signal, but use of a homozygosity mapping approach enabled a probable disease associated locus to be identified. This study is a further example of how autosomal recessive diseases can be mapped in the dog, even with a very small number of cases, because of the high levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) within individual breeds (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Sutter <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Safra <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). Despite there being a number of good candidate genes for sensory neuropathy, a GWAS approach was chosen for this study in preference to a candidate gene approach, due to the incidental availability of GWAS data from a large number of suitable controls, with the aim of identifying a novel locus for sensory neuropathy. Given the nonexonic nature of the mutation, the inversion would not have been identified using a candidate gene exon resequencing approach. However, a pattern of linkage disequilibrium for neutral variants in and around the exons of <italic>FAM134B</italic> may have prompted further investigation of this gene. Use of genome sequencing is demonstrated as an effective way of interrogating disease associated intervals, as it provides excellent coverage across all regions including repetitive elements, which are often not captured efficiently using targeted resequencing methods.</p><p>Analysis of RNAseq data revealed <italic>FAM134B</italic> was majorly disrupted by the inversion, with novel exons occurring 3&#x02032; of the final normally transcribed exon before the inversion, due to cryptic splicing. Although an exact tissue matched control was not available, amplification of two of the three novel exons would not have been possible without the inversion due to primer orientation. The unavailability of suitable antibodies targeting the two genes prevented western blot analysis to determine whether proteins are still produced from the altered transcript sequence. Visual analysis of RNAseq data aligned to the genes flanking and within the inversion region suggests gene expression for these genes was not affected. Genotyping analysis of 192 Border Collies for the SN associated inversion was consistent with the inversion being causal. Based on the location of two identical SINEs (SINEC_c2) at the two inversion breakpoints, we speculate that these repeat elements are likely to have been involved in the inversion mechanism.</p><p>The <italic>FAM134B</italic> gene is highly conserved across species and encodes a <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi protein found in sensory and autonomic ganglion neurons (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Kurth <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Little is known about the function of <italic>FAM134B</italic> but it is thought to be critical in the survival of sensory nerve cells (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Kurth <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>FAM134B</italic> has shown to result in structural rearrangements of the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi compartment, inducing apoptosis in dorsal root ganglia (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Kurth <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>), highlighting the importance of this gene in the survival of sensory and autonomic neurons. Mutations in <italic>FAM134B</italic> have been associated with SN in humans and, in common with the inversion identified in the dog, all mutations have been high consequence mutations (<italic>i.e.</italic>, nonsense, splice site, and frameshift mutations) (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Ilgaz Aydinlar <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Murphy <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Kurth <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). This may suggest that major disruption of the gene is required to see the severe early onset phenotype of SN in these cases. Nerve conduction studies in a human patient with <italic>FAM134B</italic> associated SN showed axonal SN with some motor involvement, which is in agreement with the presentation of SN seen in the Border Collie (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Murphy <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Kurth <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). The human <italic>FAM134B</italic> gene codes for a 497 amino acid protein, compared with a 485 amino acid protein in the dog, with the size difference being due to a shorter exon 1 in dog. Exon 1 of canine <italic>FAM134B</italic> is positioned in an unsequenced region of the canine genome, and as a consequence the Ensembl gene prediction for this gene was incorrect. Canine exon 1, which was assembled using RNAseq data, is 82.4% GC rich, which is likely to be reason for its absence from the canine genome build.</p><p>In summary, we have used a GWAS approach using a minimal number of cases and genome sequencing to identify an inversion associated with SN in the Border Collie. This approach is particularly attractive when suitable control genotyping datasets from unrelated GWAS are readily available, and has the advantage over candidate gene studies of potential novel locus identification.</p></sec>
