It is unfavourably genetically correlated to milk production, and, thus, knowledge of the mechanisms that underlie these traits would be valuable to improve both of them simultaneously through breeding. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) that affects both clinical mastitis and milk production has recently been fine-mapped to around 89&#x000a0;Mb on bovine chromosome 6 (BTA6), but identification of the gene that underlies this QTL was not possible due to the strong linkage disequilibrium between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within this region. Our aim was to identify the gene and, if possible, the causal polymorphism(s) responsible for this QTL through association analysis of high-density SNPs and imputed full sequence data in combination with analyses of transcript and protein levels of the identified candidate gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Associations between SNPs and the studied traits were strongest for SNPs that were located within and immediately upstream of the <italic>group</italic>-<italic>specific component</italic> (<italic>GC</italic>) gene. This gene encodes the vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) and has multiple roles in immune defense and milk production. A 12-kb duplication that was identified downstream of this gene covered its last exon and segregated with the QTL allele that is associated with increased mastitis susceptibility and milk production. However, analyses of <italic>GC</italic> mRNA levels on the available samples revealed no differences in expression between animals having or lacking this duplication.

The consequences of CM include reduced animal welfare, economic losses due to reduced milk yield and altered milk composition, increased costs due to veterinary treatment of diseased animals, increased use of antibiotics, and early culling of animals. Thus, there is a high demand for solutions that help reduce the incidence of mastitis. Genetic improvement of resistance to CM by traditional breeding is possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], in spite of its low heritability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and an unfavorable genetic correlation with milk production (ranging from 0.21 to 0.55 in Norwegian Red; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]). Knowledge of the genetic mechanisms that are involved both in susceptibility to mastitis and in milk production would be valuable information for selection programs to break the genetic correlation between these traits and improve both traits simultaneously. One approach to gain such knowledge is to identify associations between high-density or sequence level single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the traits in question.</p><p>A quantitative trait locus (QTL) that affects susceptibility to CM or somatic cell score, which is an indicator trait of CM, was reported at ~90&#x000a0;Mb on bovine chromosome 6 (BTA6) in Norwegian Red cattle (NR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and in several Holstein populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Several genes that are known to be involved in immune defense, such as those that encode the CXC chemokines and are located at around 90.6&#x000a0;Mb, and the <italic>IGJ</italic> gene at 87.8&#x000a0;Mb that encodes the immunoglobulin J polypeptide, have been suggested as candidates for susceptibility to mastitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, two recent publications suggested that the gene <italic>group</italic>-<italic>specific component</italic> (<italic>GC</italic>) at 88.7&#x000a0;Mb was responsible for both a QTL that affects CM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and a QTL for milk production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In both studies, the high level of linkage disequilibrium (LD) within this QTL region limited the ability to identify the causal polymorphisms.</p><p>
<italic>Group</italic>-<italic>specific component</italic> is a logical functional and positional candidate gene. It is mainly transcribed in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and encodes the vitamin D-binding protein (DBP), which circulates in blood and has multiple important roles in the immune system and host defense, e.g. as the main carrier of vitamin D. DBP has also been suggested to have a direct role on milk production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we performed association analyses on high-density SNP chips and imputed full sequence data in order to identify the gene, and if possible the polymorphism (or polymorphisms) on BTA6 behind the variation in susceptibility to CM and in milk production. We also studied splice variants and determined the transcript levels of the identified gene in liver samples, and analyzed the concentrations of DBP and its ligand in serum samples from individuals with different <italic>GC</italic> genotypes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Biological samples</title><p>Three different sets of samples were used:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(A)</label><p>Semen samples from Norwegian Red artificial insemination (AI) bulls for which phenotypic information was available for SNP genotyping (the number of bulls varied among analyses as described in the relevant sections), and semen samples from NR bulls and blood samples from NR cows for genome resequencing.</p></list-item><list-item><label>(B)</label><p>Liver samples from 112 healthy NR animals, mostly bulls, from which DNA was extracted for SNP genotyping; 10 of these 112 individuals were selected for analysis of mRNA expression.</p></list-item><list-item><label>(C)</label><p>Blood serum samples from 50 healthy NR cows, of which 21 were pregnant at the time of sampling, for analysis of protein expression and vitamin D levels.</p></list-item></list>

Slaughter started in the morning and all sampled animals were culled within 2.5&#x000a0;h. Data from the Norwegian Health Card system showed that all animals were healthy. All animals were between 512 and 628&#x000a0;days old at the time of the sampling.

These time intervals include three periods during the first lactation: CM1 [&#x02212;15 to 30&#x000a0;d postpartum (dpp)], CM2 (31&#x000a0;to&#x000a0;120 dpp) and CM3 (121&#x000a0;to&#x000a0;305 dpp), two periods during the second lactation: CM4 (&#x02212;15 to 30 dpp) and CM5 (31&#x000a0;to&#x000a0;120 dpp); and two periods during the third lactation: CM6 (&#x02212;15 to 30 dpp) and CM7 (31&#x000a0;to&#x000a0;120 dpp).</p><p>Five milk production traits, i.e., 305 d lactation yields for kg milk, kg protein, kg fat, protein percentage and fat percentage, were based on monthly test-day records of milk yield and bimonthly records of kg fat and kg protein. Animal repeatability models that were based on data from the first to third lactation were used for the genetic evaluation of milk production traits.</p><p>The number of bulls with trait data varied for each trait, especially in the case of CM traits because many cows were culled before they reached the last period of the last lactation. In addition, selection of animals for genotyping was performed to fit the needs of several studies, and hence the number of bulls with both trait and genotype data varied among analyses as described below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Construction of a high-density SNP dataset for BTA6</title><p>Genotypes from the Affymetrix 25K SNP array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara), the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip (54K) and the Illumina BovineHD Genotyping BeadChip (777K) (Illumina, San Diego) were combined to produce a dataset for BTA6 that consisted of 26,737 SNPs. First, 2552 NR AI bulls were genotyped on the 25K chip. Then, 1575 NR bulls were genotyped on the 54K chip with 536 of these 1575 animals already genotyped on the 25K chip. Finally, 384 of the 1575 bulls were genotyped on the 777K chip. The three datasets were filtered to remove SNPs with a minor allele frequency lower than 0.05. Map positions were based on the bovine reference genome assembly (UMD 3.1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]). SNPs on unplaced scaffolds and on sex chromosomes were discarded. The 25K dataset was imputed to 54K and then the combined 54K dataset was imputed to 777K. All imputations and phasing of data were completed using BEAGLE v3.3.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Phasing information was used to identify double recombinants, i.e. a heterozygous genotype with a phase that differed from the phase on both sides. Such genotypes were either corrected (for instance from AG to GA) or removed. All five milk traits and seven CM traits were analyzed for these 26,737 SNPs on BTA6. There were 3090 bulls with genotype data and DYD information for the five milk traits, CM1 and CM2, and this number decreased with later CM periods to 2874 bulls for CM7.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Genome sequencing, alignment of sequence reads and variant calling</title><p>Whole-genome sequencing data were obtained for 147 animals at three different time points in batches of 5, 16 and 126 animals. A first batch of five bulls were sequenced by FASTERIS (Switzerland) on an Illumina Genome Analyzer GAIIx instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with 2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;108&#x000a0;bp paired end reads. The TruSeq SBS V2-GA kit was used to prepare libraries and the FASTX-toolkit v0.0.13 (Hannon Lab, FASTX-Toolkit, 0.0.13 ed2010) for adaptor- and quality-trimming of raw reads in FASTQ-format. An average sequence coverage of ~4&#x000d7; and 10&#x000d7; was obtained for three and two bulls, respectively. A second batch of 16 elite bulls were sequenced by AROS (Denmark) on a HiSeq 2000 platform according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocols. Samples were prepared for paired-end sequencing (2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;100&#x000a0;bp) using the TruSeq kit and sequenced with the Illumina V3 kit (Illumina, San Diego) to generate an average coverage of 10&#x000d7;. Finally, the third batch that included 96 NR elite bulls and 31 NR cows were sequenced by the Norwegian Sequencing Centre (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sequencing.uio.no">http://www.sequencing.uio.no</ext-link>) on a HiSeq 2500 platform according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocols. Samples were prepared for paired-end sequencing (2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;125&#x000a0;bp) by using the TruSeq DNA PCR-free library preparation kits and sequenced with the Illumina V4 kit (Illumina, San Diego) to generate an average coverage of 9&#x000d7;. Average sequencing coverage in a 1-Mb region that included the most significant markers and the duplication agreed with the genome-wide average coverage.</p><p>The quality of the Illumina reads was checked with fastQC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Adaptors were trimmed as described above but no quality trimming of the Illumina reads was done before alignment, as recommended when the read quality is sufficiently high (all samples had mean PHRED quality scores above 30 throughout the whole length of the reads). All reads were aligned against the UMD 3.1 bovine genome assembly using BWA-mem version 0.7.10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and then PCR duplicates were sorted and marked and the resulting SAM files were indexed using SAMtools version 1.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Between 98.7 and 99.6&#x000a0;% of the reads were mapped to the reference genome, including all chromosomes and unplaced scaffolds. Variant calling was done with FreeBayes version 1.0.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], with a minimum total read coverage of 10, a minimum PHRED-based mapping score of 20 and a minimum PHRED-based base quality of 20. All called variants were filtered prior to phasing by using bcftools version 1.2, which is a part of the SAMtools program suite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The applied filters were run with the following bcftools command: bcftools filter --exclude &#x0201c;QUAL&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;30&#x000a0;| NUMALT&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2 | SAF&#x000a0;==&#x000a0;0 | SAR&#x000a0;==&#x000a0;0 | DP&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;10 | DP&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;2500 | MAF&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01&#x0201d; --SnpGap 4 --IndelGap 10, which will exclude all variants that do not fulfill one of the following criteria: (1) an overall quality (QUAL) score less than 30, (2) a total depth with less than 10 or more than 2500 reads, (3) if no read was observed on either the forward or reverse strand, (4) if there was more than one alternate allele, (5) if the minor allele frequency was lower than 1&#x000a0;%, (6) if a SNP was closer than 4&#x000a0;bp to an INDEL and (7) for any two INDEL that were within 10&#x000a0;bp of each other, the lower quality INDEL was removed. These filtering criteria are similar to those used in the 1000 bull genome project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.1000bullgenomes.com/">http://www.1000bullgenomes.com/</ext-link>), and were chosen to minimize the number of false positive variants, while sacrificing some degree of variant calling sensitivity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Imputation to full sequence</title><p>Genotypes of the called variants were refined and phased using Beagle version 4.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The initial data input to Beagle was the genotype likelihood of each genotype reported by Freebayes. The resulting phased dataset was then used as a reference panel for imputing all previously mentioned 3090 animals to full sequence, ending up with a total of 3096 animals with full sequence data and phenotypes for CM1. Beagle 4.1 was run with the window parameter set to 100,000 SNPs and a window overlap set to 10,000 SNPs. Effective population size was set to 200 and remaining parameters were set to default values.

Ten libraries representing liver samples from the five AA and five GG bulls were prepared for sequencing using an Illumina TruSeq stranded mRNA LT Set-A kit (Illumina, California, USA) with the following slight modifications to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol: (i) using 2&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g input RNA, (ii) incubation for 25&#x000a0;s (vs. 8&#x000a0;min) at the &#x0201c;elute, fragment and prime&#x0201d; step, and (iii) using a cDNA:read ratio of 1:0.7 ratio (vs. 1:1) (Agencourt AMPure XP Beads; Beckman Coulter, California) after adapter ligation and PCR step.

Absorbance was detected at 450&#x000a0;nm. Albumin (ALB) concentrations were determined by The Central Clinical Laboratory (Sentralaboratoriet, NMBU School of Veterinary Medicine, Oslo) with the bromocresol green (BCG) dye-binding method (Advia 1800 Chemistry System, Siemens Healthcare, Germany). Serum albumin quantitatively binds to BCG to form an albumin-BCG complex that was measured as an endpoint reaction at 596&#x000a0;nm. 25-Hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3] concentrations were determined by applying a liquid chromatography&#x02013;tandem mass spectrometry (LC&#x02013;MS/MS) method developed at the Hormone laboratory (Oslo University Hospital). More details on these procedures are in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>. Free, bioavailable, ALB- and DBP-bound 25(OH)D2, 25(OH)D3 and total 25(OH)D [a sum of 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3] were calculated using modified equations previously described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], based on the serum concentrations of 25(OH)D, DBP and ALB.

</p><p>The more telomeric positions of the most significant markers for kg protein, CM4 and CM6 could suggest that additional polymorphisms affected these traits. However, when the effect of rs110483492 at 88,741,762&#x000a0;bp was corrected for, no markers remained significant for any of the six traits. Hence, all significant markers are most likely in strong LD with the same causal polymorphism.</p><p>The use of full sequence data did not refine the QTL region much more compared to the first step. However, since the sequence data include all the variants that are present in a larger region, other genes than <italic>GC</italic> could be excluded as causal. Moreover, the analysis suggests that the underlying causal variation has a regulatory role since no variants within the coding sequences were among the most significant ones.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>LD structure</title><p>LD analyses revealed a relative complex LD structure, which reflects the history of the NR breed. Highly significant SNPs were located in a larger region that spanned the entire <italic>GC</italic> gene and several kb from its 5&#x02032; end, and were dispersed in-between other SNPs that had much lower significance levels. All the SNPs with a p value lower than 1*e&#x02212;11 for CM1 were in high LD with each other, most often with an r<sup>2</sup> higher than 0.95. One unexpected exception was the most significant SNP for CM1 at 88,741,762&#x000a0;bp, which showed an r<sup>2</sup> with the other top SNPs of ~0.84. The top-ranking SNPs were distributed across a large number of haplotype blocks, and most blocks contained SNPs with highly variable significance levels. For CM1, most of the SNPs with a p value lower than 1*e&#x02212;12 were in three blocks that covered the region between 88,739,045 and 88,744,985&#x000a0;bp, i.e., a region that spanned from the beginning of intron 1 to ~5&#x000a0;kb from the transcription start site. For each of these SNPs, the allele that was associated with the highest mastitis incidence and milk yield was unique to a haplotype with a frequency of 37&#x000a0;%, which is in agreement with the frequency of the individual alleles.</p><p>Such an LD pattern that consists of a high LD between rather distant SNPs, which are interspersed in-between many other SNPs with a much lower LD is typical for most commercial cattle breeds that have undergone a rapid recent decrease in effective population size from a large ancestral population due to selection and breed formation. The long-ranging LD is most likely due to the presence of some long haplotypes that are the result of the recent extensive use of AI bulls and that have not been broken apart by recombination, in a background of much shorter haplotypes that reflect the large ancestral population. The size and the combinational effects of such haplotypes limit our ability to fine map and precisely identify the causal polymorphism(s) that underlie the QTL based only on association mapping results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Structural variation</title><p>A search for larger structural variants in resequencing data from 21 NR sires revealed a marked increase in read depth for a 11,781-bp region between 88,693,550 and 88,681,769&#x000a0;bp (i.e., 2.4&#x000a0;kb 3&#x02032; of the last ordinary exon of <italic>GC</italic>, see below) for animals that are homozygous AA at rs110675140 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This increase was not present in the homozygous GG animals, while for the heterozygous GA animals an intermediate increase in read depth was observed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This indicates that the sequence is duplicated in the haplotypes that carry the A allele, but not in those that carry the G allele. The orientation of the paired end reads that span the breakpoint of the duplication suggested that the two copies of the sequence were orientated as a tandem duplication.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Visualization of the duplication. The first animal, 10177, is homozygous AA at rs110675140 and shows an increased read depth in a region 3&#x02032; of <italic>GC</italic>. This indicates that the region is duplicated. Moreover, the duplication is found in both haplotypes since the read depth is doubled compared to the surrounding regions. The second animal, 3718, is heterozygous GA, and has an intermediate read depth. This indicates that the duplication is present in one haplotype only (i.e., the one that also carries allele A). The last animal, 10540, is homozygous GG at rs110675140, and has a normal read depth, which indicates that there is no duplication</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12711_2016_257_Fig3_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig>
</p><p>The presence and the orientation of the duplication were verified by PCR on DNA from 45 AI bulls and 112 randomly selected abattoir samples, and compared against rs110675140 genotypes. Bands that confirmed the duplication were observed for all 37 animals with genotype AA at rs110675140, and for 57 of the 58 animals with genotype GA (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> for examples). The duplication was absent in 60 of the 62 animals with genotype GG and very weak bands were observed for the two remaining GG animals.

The duplicated region overlapped the position of the alternative last exon 13 found in the predicted <italic>GC</italic> transcript variant X1 (XM_005208092.1), thus one possibility is that the presence of two copies of this exon may affect the level, stability or function of this transcript. A study that mapped regions enriched for acetylated lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27ac) via chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) showed that binding sites for enhancers were situated within the duplicated region (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nagrp.ansci.iastate.edu/eric/epidb/rsem_expression.php%23type1chipseq">http://nagrp.ansci.iastate.edu/eric/epidb/rsem_expression.php#type1chipseq</ext-link>).

First, we searched publicly available databases for putative HNF1 and C/EBP binding sites in the bovine sequence. The most likely HNF1 site was found between 88,739,350 and 88,739,364&#x000a0;bp on BTA6.

This site is located near three of the most significant SNPs for CM1, i.e. rs109360654 at 88,739,045&#x000a0;bp (intron 1), rs108964685 at 88,739,413&#x000a0;bp (5&#x02032; region) and rs109541079 at 88,739,458&#x000a0;bp (5&#x02032; region). The most likely binding sites for C/EBP were found in the region between 88,727,907 and 88,727,918&#x000a0;bp, which is between rs109056048 at 88,727,480&#x000a0;bp and rs110675140 at 88,728,121&#x000a0;bp in intron 1.

Concentrations of free 25(OH)D2 and bioavailable 25(OH)D2 were highest during the first month after calving and decreased thereafter. This is consistent with previous studies in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In cattle, 25(OH)D3 concentrations are reported to be associated with the pregnancy cycle and the lactation stage, with the highest 25(OH)D3 serum concentration observed during mid lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Our study reports for the first time an association between the serum DBP concentrations and the lactation stage in dairy cattle. See (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Table S5) for more details.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Evidence that supports <italic>GC</italic> as the positional and functional candidate gene for the QTL</title><p>Although high LD and long-range haplotypes in the QTL region complicate fine mapping and make it impossible to identify a causal polymorphism for the QTL, the results strongly support <italic>GC</italic> as the best positional candidate gene and agrees with results from other studies e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Sahana et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] used whole-genome resequencing data to position the QTL for CM within a region that contains only two genes, <italic>GC</italic> and <italic>NPFFR2</italic>. They reported slightly different positions for this QTL in the two analyzed breeds, with the most significant SNPs located at 88.72&#x000a0;Mb (intron 1 of <italic>GC</italic>) in Nordic Red cattle, and at 88.97&#x000a0;Mb in Nordic Holstein. High LD in this region limited their ability to identify the causal polymorphism. The authors also tested for co-segregation with milk production traits in their Danish Holstein population and detected significant associations for kg milk, kg protein and kg fat between ~88.5 and 89.5&#x000a0;Mb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], which is in agreement with our study.</p><p>In a follow-up study on Danish Holstein cattle, associations with CM were observed at three different locations in the region between 88.06 and 89.07&#x000a0;Mb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. One QTL overlapped with the <italic>deoxycytidine kinase</italic> (<italic>DCK</italic>) gene, the second overlapped with the <italic>solute carrier family 4, sodium bicarbonate co</italic>-<italic>transporter, and member 4</italic> (<italic>SLC4A4</italic>) gene, and the last QTL overlapped with the <italic>neuropeptide FF receptor 2</italic> (<italic>NPFFR2</italic>) gene. No significant QTL within or near the <italic>GC</italic> gene were detected in Danish Holstein, which may indicate that different polymorphisms affect susceptibility to CM in Holstein as compared to Nordic and Norwegian Red breeds. However, the LD between the SNPs in the third QTL (i.e. at <italic>NPFFR2</italic>) and the most significant SNPs in our study was high (not shown), and indicates that this third QTL in Danish Holstein is the same as the QTL detected in Nordic Red and Norwegian Red.</p><p>In addition, Goddard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] reported <italic>GC</italic> as the gene that underlies a QTL for milk production in an Australian Holstein population. Again, in this study, the high LD in the QTL region made it difficult to pinpoint a causal polymorphism. However, they identified the most significant SNPs at 88,741,762 and 88,743,767&#x000a0;bp depending on the methods. These SNPs are the most significant and third most significant SNPs for CM1 in our study, and among the most significant for the remaining traits.</p><p>
<italic>Group-specific component</italic> encodes DBP, which has multiple important biological roles in the immune system and host defense. DBP is the major plasma protein carrier of vitamin D3 and its metabolites. Vitamin D3 has a function as a cytokine that is generated to protect the host against microbial invaders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. During an infection, both human and bovine monocytes and macrophages express an enzyme that converts vitamin D into its biologically active form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], which then regulates the expression of the vitamin D responsive genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Recent studies indicate that vitamin D signaling has important roles in the immune function and infectious disease resistance in cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], and DBP was found to be a serum biomarker during subclinical mycobacterial infections in cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p>Vitamin D-binding protein was also suggested to be a precursor of the macrophage activating factor Gc-MAF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Activated macrophages develop the capacity for specialized tasks such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis and the lysis of intracellular parasites, as well as the destruction of tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Furthermore, DBP was shown to increase monocyte and neutrophil chemotaxis to complement component C5a (C5a)-derived peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p><p>DBP may have a direct effect on milk production. Goddard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] suggested that this effect could be mediated through the number and activity of mammary epithelial cells, since vitamin D restricts growth and differentiation of these cells in tissue culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Vitamin D also has a key function in maintaining serum levels of calcium by stimulating intestinal calcium absorption, mobilization of calcium from bone and stimulating the renal reabsorption at the onset of lactation, when large amounts of calcium are secreted into the milk and colostrum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The association that we detected between serum DBP and vitamin D concentrations with lactation stage also suggests a role of DBP and vitamin D in regulating milk production in dairy cattle.</p><p>Hence, the QTL could either affect host immune response to pathogens and indirectly decrease milk production in diseased animals, or the main effect could be on increased milk production with a secondary effect on mastitis, for instance due to lack of energy for immune defense or strain on the teat canal and sphincter muscle from increased volume at each milking. Alternatively, the mechanisms behind milk production and immune response could be affected more or less independently by the same underlying polymorphism, or by multiple polymorphisms in high LD with each other.</p><p>In this study, we did not succeed in identifying the functional variant that is responsible for the QTL. A limitation of our study was the choice of the animals used for RNA expression and protein analyses. Ideally, such analyses should use samples from cows with different genotypes during a mastitis infection. However, sampling such material with uniform quality and in sufficiently large amounts for proper statistical analysis poses a rather complicated logistics challenge, at least in Norway where the farms are small and situated far apart, and would need a long period of time. This was beyond the duration and resources of this project, and analyses were therefore restricted to material that was readily available. RNA expression was analyzed in liver samples, since the <italic>GC</italic> gene is most highly expressed in this tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, most of the available samples were from healthy bulls, and the QTL seems to show functional significance only in females or during an infection. Protein analyses were performed in serum samples from cows, but these were also healthy animals. A more successful strategy to identify the nature of the QTL might be to investigate RNA expression and protein levels in cows with mastitis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Association analysis of full sequence data mapped a highly significant QTL that affects both clinical mastitis in early lactation and milk production to a region within or immediately upstream of the <italic>GC</italic> gene. We also detected a duplication downstream of the <italic>GC</italic> gene that segregated with the alleles of this QTL. The duplication covered the alternative last exon of the <italic>GC</italic> gene and might contain binding sites for enhancers. No differences neither in <italic>GC</italic> transcript levels nor in protein levels and binding were detected under the examined conditions, but our data did not permit any final conclusions to be drawn on differences in transcription or protein binding during an infection. Further functional studies including both healthy and infected animals are needed to reveal the causative variants that underlie this QTL.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec29"><title>Additional files</title><p>
