This bacterium causes significant loss to goat and sheep farmers because it is the causal agent of the infectious disease caseous lymphadenitis, which may lead to outcomes ranging from skin injury to animal death. In the current study, we simulated the conditions experienced by the bacteria during host infection. By sequencing transcripts using the SOLiD<sup>TM</sup> 3 Plus platform, we identified new targets expected to potentiate the survival and replication of the pathogen in adverse environments. These results may also identify possible candidates useful for the development of vaccines, diagnostic kits or therapies aimed at the reduction of losses in agribusiness.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Under the 3 simulated conditions (acid, osmotic and thermal shock stresses), 474 differentially expressed genes exhibiting at least a 2-fold change in expression levels were identified.

The CMNR group shares several common characteristics, including (i) the organisation of the cell wall, which is mainly composed of peptidoglycan, arabinogalactan and mycolic acids and (ii) the high G + C content of the genome (47-74%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The bacterium causes caseous lymphadenitis disease, which affects small ruminants and large animals (such as horses and cattle) worldwide and can infect humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to control the disease through the development of effective vaccines, therapies and diagnostic kits.</p><p>Because <italic>C. pseudotuberculosis</italic> is a facultative intracellular microorganism found preferentially in macrophages in the host, during the infection process, the bacterium is exposed to a number of environmental changes that are far from ideal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>After phagocytosis, the phagosome quickly becomes acidic (pH ~ 4.6-5.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] negatively affecting the metabolism and damaging macromolecules in the invading cell. In addition, other intracellular stresses negatively affect the microorganism, including oxidative thermal shock and nitrosative, surface, osmotic and starvation stresses; however, the bacterium manages to escape and persist in the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>To survive in this environment, the pathogen must mount an immediate and adequate, protective response that is reflected initially by transcriptional changes in specific sets of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In this context, sigma factors, which coordinate the expression of these genes under different types of stresses are important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]; these factors include s<italic>igS</italic> in <italic>E.coli,</italic> which is involved in trehalose synthesis during osmotic stress, with trehalose serving as an important osmoprotectant in this type of stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, RT-PCR (real-time polymerase chain reaction) was used to demonstrate the transcriptional profile of 10 sigma factors during the exponential growth phase. The role of these sigma factors was analysed under different conditions of stress, and a number of the factors demonstrated increased expression in response to one kind of stimulus, whereas others responded to more than one stimulus. The resistance to different environmental stresses is associated with the ability of the pathogenic bacteria to survive in the host, and different sigma factors play fundamental roles in the survival of the pathogen. For example, in <italic>M. smegmatis, sigB</italic> is involved in the response to oxidative stress<italic>,</italic> and <italic>sigE</italic> was shown to play a role in the regulation of genes involved in the response to acid stress, thermal shock and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The functions of sigma factors include involvement in the adaptation to stress, the interaction of the bacterium with the extracellular medium and in a number of cases, with bacterial virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>For <italic>C. pseudotuberculosis</italic> 1002, there is still no information regarding the role of sigma factors in the regulation of genes involved in bacterial survival throughout the infection process. In addition, few virulence determinants contributing to bacterial survival have been identified. Therefore, investigations related to the control of caseous lymphadenitis have been difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. To date, the virulence determinants most studied in <italic>C. pseudotuberculosis</italic> infection include the following: the PLD (phospholipase D) protein, an exoprotein that is also considered leukotoxic, contributing to the formation of lesions and the destruction of caprine macrophages during infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>];the <italic>fagABC</italic> operon and the <italic>fagD</italic> gene, which play a role in the virulence of the bacterium and have been identified as genes involved in iron acquisition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]; the high concentration of cell wall lipids, which renders the microorganism resistance to digestion by cellular enzymes and allows it to persist as a facultative intracellular parasite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and CP40, identified as an immunogenic protein that exhibits proteolytic activity as a serine protease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The availability of the <italic>C. pseudotuberculosis</italic> strain 1002 genome (access number CP001809) has allowed the further investigation and characterisation of the microorganism, which is poorly characterised despite its importance to agribusiness. Therefore, to generate additional information, the transcriptional profile of <italic>C. pseudotuberculosis</italic> was analysed using cDNA sequencing with SOLiD&#x02122; 3 plus next-generation technology (Life TechnologiesTM, CA). Using this technology, we investigated the molecular characteristics of the microorganism that allow it to persist in the host and the mechanisms the bacteria use to escape the host immune response. Additionally, in an attempt to contribute to the elimination of caseous lymphadenitis in caprine and ovine populations, we investigated a large number of targets related to <italic>C. pseudotuberculosis</italic> virulence by simulating the specific conditions tolerated by the bacterium when invading the host (i.e., acidic, osmotic and high temperature stresses).</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>The sequencing of cDNA is an attractive technology for the investigation of gene expression in prokaryotic organisms because it provides a high level of coverage and high sensitivity for the detection of transcripts at considerably lower costs compared to traditional methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Currently, sequencing technology is considered the gold standard for the analysis of gene expression levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Therefore, because the microorganism can survive environmental changes in the host during infection, we analysed the transcriptional profile of <italic>C. pseudotuberculosis</italic> strain 1002 using RNAseq technology. Acid, osmotic and thermal shock stresses were used to identify genes involved in bacterial tolerance of these unfavourable environments.</p><p>Stress-generating agents were applied to the cells at an optical density (OD) of 0.2 (A<sub>600nm</sub> = 0.2), and the cell viability analysis demonstrated a reduction in replication of approximately 27% under thermal stress, 34% under acid stress and 23% under osmotic stress (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

From the cDNA sequencing performed using SOLiD<sup>TM</sup> at the beginning of the exponential phase, 2,055 transcripts active in control were identified (equivalent to 98.32% of the transcribed genome) and 35 genes (1.67%) were considered non-transcripts, exhibiting a RPKM value of 0.

In this study, a comparative analysis between 2 rRNA depletion methodologies was performed, and the transcripts were submitted to <italic>ab initio</italic> assembly. Both transcriptomes were then submitted to gene ontology analysis according to biological processes and molecular functions. Data were obtained only under physiological conditions using brain heart infusion (BHI) media. The authors observed that few transcripts represented genes involved in pathogenicity or the cell adhesion process and concluded that contact with the host may influence the induction of these transcripts.</p><p>The present study simulated some of the environmental conditions that the pathogen faces in the host. The cell adhesion process was among those most represented in the conditions described below, and these levels showed greater than a 2-fold change. This result indicated that there were a greater number of transcripts representing genes that participate in the cell adhesion process when compared to the physiological condition. Together, these findings demonstrate that contact with the host most likely influences the transcription of genes essential for bacterial survival.</p><sec><title>Genes induced in the biological processes of the osmotic stress stimulon</title><p>The Blast2GO programme was used to identify the biological processes most abundant in the cells under osmotic stress. However, for a more detailed analysis of the processes (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), the CoreStImulon (CSI) programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] was used, which identified the genes present in each of the processes determined in the Blast2GO programme (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Biological processes most evident among the genes induced in the osmotic stimulon.</bold> Figure obtained with the CSI program.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-15-14-3"/></fig><p>The majority of the genes induced under osmotic stress were part of the oxidoreduction process, represented by 4 genes (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1). Normal aerobic metabolism induces the production of active oxygen molecules, which are increased following exposure to certain environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The results demonstrated that the growth of the bacterium was reduced but was not interrupted under these conditions; therefore, the bacterium survived in the environment. This observation was confirmed by the biosynthetic process, which was comprised of 3 genes (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1), indicating that the bacterium was able to invest energy into the replication process and survived in the unfavourable environment.</p><p>The adhesion process, comprising 3 genes, was prominent under osmotic stress. Adhesion is essential for the initiation of the infectious process because the bacterium-host interaction establishes a pathogenic relationship. The Cp1002_0988 gene, encoding a hypothetical protein, is located within 1 of the pathogenicity islands of <italic>C. pseudotuberculosis</italic> 1002, indicating its importance in the development of the disease. Additionally, this gene exhibited a 6.8-fold change in expression levels compared with the control (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S1).

The adhesion processes were composed of hypothetical proteins, 1 of which was characterised as a secreted protein containing an LPxTG domain, which may be an important vaccine candidate. Through analysing the genes that made up the cellular oxidoreduction process, we observed the presence of genes with functions that appeared essential for the persistence of the bacterium in this environment.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Biological processes most evident among the genes induced in the acid stimulon.</bold> Figure obtained using the CSI program.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-15-14-4"/></fig><p>The Cp1002_2043 gene exhibited a 7.8-fold change in expression (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Table S2). This gene, which may encode the Dps protein, was linked to the processes of stress response and cellular oxidoreduction (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Figure S2). This protein protects the organism against oxidative stress because it stores iron in a bioavailable form, reducing the possibility of the production of reactive oxygen molecules. Under acidic conditions, the production of molecules that produce reactive oxygen species is increased. Reports have demonstrated that in cells in which the pH is decreased, the ratio of HOO<sup>&#x02013;</sup> to O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup> increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], increasing the chance of producing hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Therefore, the increased number of genes constituting the cellular oxidoreduction process is justified. Another important gene in the oxidoreduction process was Cp1002_0173, which exhibited a 4-fold change in expression and is presumed to encode a catalase that plays a role in reducing the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the cell.</p><p>The mechanisms used by the bacterium to resist the damage caused by reactive oxygen species are essential for survival within the macrophage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].

Because the MsrA protein may be required to maintain the role of adhesins, the high increase in <italic>msrB</italic> expression suggested that the protein contributes to the survival of the pathogen in the host, the resistance to oxidative stress in vitro and the adhesion capability of eukaryotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The methionine (Met) residues in proteins exposed at the cell surface are thought to be involved in capturing reactive oxygen species, and a complex comprised of MsrA and MsrB reduces the oxidised Met residues, removing the reactive oxygen species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Met is the amino acid most sensitive to reactive oxygen species, and the oxidation of the Met residue in a protein alters the protein structure (or prevents translation), drastically affecting the function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. There is evidence that only the MsrB domain is present in <italic>C. pseudotuberculosis</italic> 1002. However, the loss of the <italic>msrA-msrB</italic> domain or <italic>msrB</italic> alone in <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> resulted in a reduction in virulence in mouse models, likely because of the oxidation of important proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Therefore, the process of cellular oxidoreduction may involve genes that contribute predominantly to the maintenance and persistence of the bacterium in media harmful to the cell.</p></sec><sec><title>Genes induced in the biological processes of the thermal shock stimulon</title><p>We analysed the genes involved in the oxidoreduction process under thermal stress. The Cp1002_1785 (<italic>betA</italic>) gene is among the genes that exhibited the highest fold-change in expression values (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>: Figure S3), and the gene may encode choline dehydrogenase. The induced gene exhibited a 5-fold change in expression (See Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>: Table S3) compared to the control. The protein belongs to the oxidoreductase family, which catalyses the oxidation of choline to glycine betaine via the intermediate betaine aldehyde. The protein promotes increased tolerance to hypersalinity and freezing and contributes to the osmotic balance of the cell under stress. The osmoprotectors not only play a role in osmotic balance but also act as effective stabilisers of enzymatic function, providing protection against salinity, high temperatures, freezing, thawing and even dryness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Under conditions of high salinity, the osmoprotectors, together with the transport system, function as virulence factors in certain pathogenic bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

This protein acts as a negative regulator of the expression of genes encoding chaperones and proteases in different bacteria under physiological conditions. The heat shock proteins play a key role in cellular metabolism under all growth conditions, monitoring the folding, assembly and translocation of cellular proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, HspR represses the operon formed by the <italic>dnaK-grpE-dnaJ-hspR</italic> genes through interaction at the HAIR (HspR-associated inverted repeats) region located in the 5&#x02032;UTR region of the genes. In <italic>C. pseudotuberculosis</italic>, the <italic>hspR</italic> gene is located in the reverse strand, below the <italic>dnaJ, GrpE</italic> and <italic>dnaK</italic> genes, indicative of their regulation by HspR.</p><p>It has been suggested that the HspR protein acts as a repressor of other genes linked to virulence/pathogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. A study in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> demonstrated that the partial disruption of heat-shock regulation influences virulence because the bacterium loses the ability to establish a chronic infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Mutation of <italic>hspR</italic> in the organism produced increased expression of the DnaK chaperone, which is highly antigenic, resulting in an enhanced immune response in the host. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that DnaK acts as co-repressor for HspR; the activity of HspR is dependent on DnaK. A proposed mechanism for the regulation of <italic>hspR</italic> expression is that under conditions of heat shock, the operon is induced, leading to the increased synthesis of DnaK and HspR. When the concentration of these proteins reaches a critical level, they bind to the promoter of the operon, resulting in repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. To investigate whether this scenario occurred in <italic>C. pseudotuberculosis</italic>, we analysed the gene encoding DnaK and demonstrated that the expression of the gene was induced 2.5-fold relative to the control, which is consistent with the proposed mechanism (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>: Table S3).</p></sec><sec><title>Distribution of genes among the simulated conditions</title><p>From the Venn diagram (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) it was possible to observe the distribution of genes per condition, demonstrating 29 genes active in all 3 simulated environments. The analysis of the genes demonstrated that a variation in the fold-change in expression, ranging from 2- to 43-times the control, was observed among the stresses. Of these genes, 48% encoded hypothetical proteins and demonstrated a higher fold-change in expression (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>: Table S4) under all conditions.

In the host, the bacterium suffers various stresses simultaneously; therefore, identifying the proteins and their role in the cell is essential for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the bacterium.

The amount of total RNA was assessed using a Qubit&#x000ae; 2.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec><title>mRNA enrichment through rRNA depletion</title><p>To enrich the mRNA, rRNA from each total RNA sample was removed using the Ribominus&#x02122; Transcriptome Isolation kit for yeast and bacteria (Invitrogen, USA), in accordance with the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations. The rRNA-depleted RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using the SOLiD&#x02122; Total RNA-Seq kit in accordance with the standard protocol recommended by the manufacturer, and the material was quantified in a Qubit&#x000ae; 2.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec><title>Sequencing in SOLiD&#x02122;</title><p>The depleted RNA was fragmented using RNase III in preparation for amplification of the cDNA library, which was produced by reverse transcription from adapters attached to the ends of the RNA molecules, in accordance with the SOLiD&#x02122; Total RNA-Seq kit protocol (Life Technologies&#x02122;, CA). Next, 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed and fragments of appropriate sizes (150 to 250 bases) were cut from the gel for cDNA amplification using PCR. Following recommended protocols, the cDNA was purified and the sizes were confirmed using 2% agarose electrophoresis. The PCR amplification in emulsion was performed using primers complementary to the adapters, in accordance with the Applied Biosystems SOLiD&#x02122; 3 Plus System Templated Bead Preparation Guide. After amplification, the microspheres were deposited onto slides for sequencing in accordance with the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations. The SOLiD&#x02122; 3 Plus system was used to sequence the 50-nucleotide RNA reads.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis <italic>in silico</italic></title><p>After obtaining the reading files using the SOLiD&#x02122; technique, the data were loaded into Bioscope version 1.2.1-5 programme (Life Technologies&#x02122;, CA), and the gene expression data were obtained and quantified as reads per kilobase of coding sequence per million reads (RPKM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The DEGseq programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] was used to identify differentially expressed genes.
