Mammary stem cells are believed to play an important role in breast tumorigenesis, but how their function changes with age is unknown. We compared mammary epithelial cells isolated from young and old mammary glands of different cohorts of C57BL6/J and BALB/c mice, and our findings revealed that old mammary glands were characterized by increased basal cell pool comprised of mostly CD49<sup>fhi</sup> cells, altered luminal-to-basal cell ratio, and irregular ductal morphology. More interestingly, basal stem cells in old mice were increased in frequency, but showed a functional decline of differentiation and increased neoplastic transformation potential. Gene signature enrichment analysis revealed a significant enrichment of a luminal cell gene expression signature in the basal stem cell-enriched population from old mice, suggesting some luminal cells were expressing basal markers. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the presence of luminal cells with high CD49f expression in hyperplastic lesions implicating these cells as undergoing luminal to basal phenotypic changes during aging. Whole transcriptome analysis showed elevated immune and inflammatory responses in old basal stem cells and stromal cells, which may be the underlying cause for increased CD49<sup>fhi</sup> basal-like cells in aged glands.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mammary stem cell</kwd><kwd>neoplasia</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Many human diseases, including cancer, increase in frequency during aging [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Most breast cancers (80%) are diagnosed in women aged &#x0003e; 50 years and the incidence of invasive breast cancer increases exponentially with aging [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Even for women carrying BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations with family history of familial breast cancer, aging is an important risk factor [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Despite this evidence pointing to aging being the number one risk factor for breast cancer, few studies have attempted to explore the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms linking aging with clinical manifestation of breast cancer [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. During aging, stem cells responsible for lifelong tissue maintenance and repair are susceptible to changes in their niche and genomic integrity. A recent study examining cancer risk in different tissue types suggested that stem cells are potential targets for neoplastic transformation [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, little direct experimental evidence links aging stem cells to spontaneous pre-neoplastic transformation and tumorigenesis.</p><p>Murine mammary stem cells are usually identified by the mammary fat pad reconstitution assay. Earlier studies based on this transplantation assay suggest that a rare population of multipotent stem cells maintains the mammary epithelium [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. More recently, using the <italic>in vivo</italic> genetic labeling techniques of lineage tracing, the mammary epithelium was found to be orchestrated by both bipotent and unipotent stem/progenitor cells [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In particular, the adult basal/myoepithelial and luminal lineages are maintained largely by their own lineage-restricted basal and luminal stem/progenitor cells under <italic>in vivo</italic> physiological conditions [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Mammary stem/progenitor cells have the potential to drive mammary gland development and to initiate neoplastic transformation when genetically altered [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Gene expression profiles of different subtypes of breast cancer have been shown to correspond to the profiles of stem/progenitor-enriched epithelial cells [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which suggests that these stem/progenitor cells might be the origin of certain types of breast cancer. However, it is unknown how aging might alter these stem/progenitor cell compositions, function and transformation potential. In this study, we characterized age-related changes in the murine mammary epithelium using multiple mouse strains and provide the first direct evidence that aged mammary stem cells (MaSCs) may serve as cells of origin for aberrant mammary gland regeneration with early neoplastic lesions.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Aging was associated with an altered luminal-to-basal cell ratio, an increase in MaSC frequency and a decrease in LP frequency</title><p>Mammary epithelial cells include basal cells that contain MaSCs and luminal cells that contain luminal progenitor (LP) cells. To be consistent with existing literature as well as to facilitate comparison among different studies, here we used the same terminology of MaSC and LP for basal and luminal restricted stem and progenitor cells. Different marker combinations [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] have been used to identify basal and luminal cells, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting separate MaSC- and LP-enriched populations.

Young mice at diestrus were excluded from data analysis because of the known hormonal (progesterone) effects of diestrus stage on MaSCs [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Similarly, old mice bearing pituitary tumors were excluded from data analysis because of the significant effect of hyperprolactinemia on mammary glands, which are usually characterized with extremely dilated primary ducts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S1a</xref>). All old mice used in the present study were nulliparous, free of lymphoma or other tumors or wounds, and were generally in good health. We observed significantly more basal cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">b</xref>), less luminal cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">c</xref>), and subsequently a lower mean luminal-to-basal (L/B) cell ratio (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>) in mammary glands of old mice than in those of young mice in both mouse strains. In general, old mammary glands were characterized with an L/B &#x0003c; 1, and young glands were characterized with an L/B &#x0003e; 1. We found similar changes with another set of surface markers of CD24 and CD29 using a different cohort of young (5 months) and aged C57BL6/J (27 months) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S1b</xref>).</p><p>A sphere formation and differentiation assay [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] was used to determine whether an increase in the number of MaSC-enriched basal cells in aged mammary glands correlates with an increase in MaSC frequency. This assay consists of a suspension culture of sorted basal or luminal cells in which they form mammospheres, followed by a 3-dimensional Matrigel culture to induce sphere differentiation into solid organoids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S1c</xref>) originated from MaSCs, and spheres that differentiated into hollow organoids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S1d</xref>) originated from LPs. For the C57BL/6 strain, the MaSC frequency, as measured by the number of sphere formation/differentiation-initiating cells (SFD-IC), increased 3.2-fold from young (0.06% or 1 SFD-IC per 1667 epithelial cells) to old mice (0.19% or 1 SFD-IC per 526 epithelial cells), and the LP frequency decreased 2.5-fold from young (3.0% or 1 SFD-IC per 33 epithelial cells) to old mice (1.2% or 1 SFD-IC per 83 epithelial cells) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1e-f</xref>). A similar observation was made in BALB/c mice with a 2.3-fold increase of MaSC frequency and a 2.6-fold decrease of LP frequency (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1e-f</xref>).</p><p>The LP cells can also be quantified by the number of luminal cells capable of forming discrete colonies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S1e</xref>) when plated on an irradiated NIH3T3 cell feeder layer [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Using this assay, we observed an approximately 3.1-fold decrease of LP frequency from young (13%) to old C57BL/6 mice (4.2%) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1g</xref>), which exhibited the same trend of change as the LP frequency measured using the SFD assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1f</xref>). However, this assay is not suitable for BALB/c mice because luminal cells from BALB/c mice gave rise to not only fewer colonies (at least 10-fold less than that of C57BL/6) but also much smaller colonies [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Findings from these in vitro colony formation assays demonstrated that MaSC frequency increased and LP frequency decreased with age.</p><p>It is known that the progesterone surge during the diestrus stage of the estrus cycle can dramatically increase basal cell numbers [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. To assess whether the increased basal cells in aged glands was possibly due to effects from the estrus cycle, we first checked the estrus cycle in old mice. Following a two-week vaginal smear on a daily basis, we found that old mice (&#x0003e; 25 months) were not cycling and most of them rested at proestrus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S1f</xref>). This was confirmed by a low serum progesterone level in old mice (ranging from &#x0003c; 0.21 ng/mL to 1.46 ng/mL, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S1g</xref>). We further examined the gland morphological appearance with whole-mount carmine staining. In comparison with young glands (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1h</xref>), we found increased tertiary branching and disorganization in glands from aged mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1i-k</xref>). In particular the increased tertiary branching, which resembles glands of pregnant females, may explain the reversed L/B ratio in aged glands.</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title>Old MaSC-regenerated mammary glands showed declining function</title><p>We evaluated self-renewal and tissue functionality of MaSCs with an in vivo serial transplantation assay. To ensure that the regenerated outgrowth was truly derived from transplanted donor cells, we used a cohort of young (7-9 months) and old (26-29 months) DsRed-C57BL/6 mice as donors. These DsRed mice exhibited similar basal and luminal epithelial cell composition as those of wild type C57BL/6 described above. Three-week old athymic female nude mice were used as recipients for in vivo transplantation because our earlier findings showed incompatibility of donor cells from DsRed mice into cleared fat pads of wild type C57BL/6 recipients. Young and old MaSCs&#x02013;formed solid organoids were transplanted into the cleared fat pads of the right and left inguinal mammary glands, respectively, of the same recipient mice. Out of 15 injected cleared fat pads, we obtained similar numbers of positive outgrowths (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S2</xref>) for young (11 out of 15; 73%) and old donors (12 out of 15; 80%) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). We further isolated MaSC-enriched basal cells from the regenerated glands and used them for secondary transplants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S2</xref>), and the engraftment was 100% for both young and old donors (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). While these findings suggest no significant difference in their ability of regeneration between young and old MaSCs, further studies with limiting dilution transplantation are necessary to score their renewal capacity with more rounds of serial transplants.</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title><italic>In vivo</italic> transplant of young and old MaSCs</title></caption><table frame="box" rules="all"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2" align="left" valign="bottom" colspan="1">Transplants</th><th rowspan="2" align="left" valign="bottom" colspan="1">Donor cells</th><th colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1">Positive / total CFP (%)</th></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Young</th><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Old</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1<sup>st</sup> transplants</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Basal 3D organoid (1 per CFP)</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11/15 (73%)</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12/15 (80%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2<sup>nd</sup> transplants</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Basal cells (650-1800 cells per CFP)</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5/5 (100%)</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5/5 (100%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>CFP: cleared fat pad; Donor cells come from DsRed C57BL6/J mice and 3-week old nude mice were used as recipients for the in vivo transplant.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The functional capacity of luminal alveolar progenitors was next examined by their ability to differentiate and produce milk in response to ovarian hormones. We mated a subset of MaSC-transplanted recipient mice to measure the ability of the regenerated gland to produce milk (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S2</xref>). Out of 5 recipients, one did not get pregnant due to poor health although it gave rise to regenerated outgrowths in both inguinal sites, one only gave rise to regenerated outgrowth from the site injected with old MaSCs, but three recipients gave rise to outgrowths from both sites. These regenerated outgrowths along with endogenous thoracic glands from the same recipient mice were excised at postnatal day 1 (PND1), and immunohistochemistry showed that the majority of ducts had dark staining for the milk protein &#x003b2;-casein. The percent of lightly stained alveoli in the outgrowths regenerated from old MaSCs was significantly higher than that in the outgrowths regenerated from young MaSCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). Importantly, regenerated outgrowths from young MaSCs exhibited the same staining intensity as that of young endogenous thoracic glands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S3a</xref>). These comparisons were made within the same recipient mice with the donor MaSCs being the only difference, thus these findings showed a decreased milk production in regenerated glands originating from old MaSCs.

We also observed a similar trend of increasing hyperplastic lesions in old MaSC-regenerated glands in comparison with their young counterparts, but this was not statistically significant and likely due, in part, to the limited number of outgrowths obtained from young MaSCs in virgin recipients (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). The use of young recipients in the transplant assay may also help alleviate the severity of hyperplastic lesions in the regenerated glands. However, when we evaluated the same endpoint in the BALB/c cohort, we observed a significant increase in hyperplastic lesions in primary and regenerated glands from old MaSCs when compared with their young counterparts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). We also observed higher frequency of ADH/DCIS in old primary glands than young primary glands in BALB/c mice, but this difference was diminished in the regenerated glands from young and old MaSCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>). Since most mammospheres are formed by s single MaSC according to our earlier studies [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], these findings indicate that mammary neoplasia can originate from MaSCs and aging can increase the transformation potential of MaSCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2_4"><title>Basal cells in aged glands were enriched with luminal gene signature and contain K8 positive luminal cells</title><p>To gain insight into the age-associated molecular alterations engendering the different characteristics between old and young MaSCs, we used RNAseq to derive gene expression signatures representative of the basal, luminal, and stromal populations using freshly sorted cells and basal and luminal cell-derived spheres.

The upregulated gene signature for basal cells would be the overlapping (intersection) of genes that are higher in basal cells when compared to each of the other two types of cells (as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S4</xref>). The downregulated gene signature for basal cells was derived similarly through the pairwise comparisons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S4</xref>). We generated luminal cell gene signatures using the same method by comparing the gene expression levels of the luminal cells to those of basal and stromal of cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S4</xref>). These signature gene sets are included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. We then used these signature gene sets to interrogate the expression profiles of basal and luminal cells derived from young and old mammary glands. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed significant enrichment of the luminal cell up-regulated signature genes in old basal cells, yet these luminal signature genes were distributed evenly across young and old luminal cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). When we used a luminal cell up-regulated signature gene set from an earlier study published by Lim and co-workers [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] to interrogate our dataset, we obtained very similar findings (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). In contrast, the luminal cell down-regulated signature genes from our study as well as from that of Lim and co-workers were significantly enriched in the young basal cells in comparison with the old basal cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). These findings indicated that genes normally expressed only in luminal cells were getting expressed in old basal cells. In comparison, the basal cell up-regulated signature genes were more enriched in the young basal cells and the basal cell down-regulated signature genes were more enriched in the old basal cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S5a</xref>). Yet, we did not observe any enrichment of the basal signature genes in young or old luminal cells as GSEA showed them to be evenly distributed across young and old basal cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S5a</xref>). Further, we used the luminal signature gene sets to interrogate the expression profiles of MaSC- or LP-enriched spheres. Similarly, the basal cell-derived MaSC spheres from old glands were significantly enriched with luminal up-regulated signature genes resembling the old luminal cell-derived LP spheres (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S5b</xref>), suggesting that both the primary basal cells and MaSC enriched basal spheres express luminal gene signature during aging.</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Aged basal cells were enriched with cells expressing luminal gene signature and contains K8<sup>+</sup> luminal cells</title><p>(<bold>a</bold> and <bold>b</bold>) Gene set enrichment analysis.

To explore these possibilities, we co-stained basal and luminal lineage markers, smooth muscle actin (SMA) and cytokeratin 8 (K8) with CD49f. We did not observe any basal cell expressing the typical luminal marker K8, or any luminal cell expressing typical basal marker SMA either in normal or hyperplastic ducts, and CD49f<sup>hi</sup> cells were mainly confined to the basal layer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c-f</xref>). Similar findings were obtained with another typical basal marker K5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S6</xref>). Further query with our RNAseq data showed that basal and luminal cells in aged glands retain typical basal (K5/K14/p63/ID4) and luminal (K8/Gata3/Elf5/Muc1) markers, respectively (data not shown). However, in some hyperplastic lesions, we observed high CD49f expression in luminal cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3g-i</xref>), and especially those luminal cells that form alveolar hyperplasia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3g</xref>) or those dislodged from the ductal wall (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3i</xref>). None of these CD49f<sup>hi</sup> luminal cells express the basal marker SMA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3j</xref>), indicating that the luminal signature in old basal cells originated from luminal cells expressing high CD49f.</p></sec><sec id="s2_5"><title>Aged MaSCs and stromal cells show an elevated inflammatory response</title><p>Whole transcriptome sequencing was performed with RNA samples from basal cell derived spheres (highly enriched in MaSCs) and stromal cells (MaSC niche), from young and old mice, to gain insights into the observed differences described above between young and old MaSCs. We identified 176 differentially expressed genes between young and old basal cell derived spheres and 66 differentially expressed genes between young and old stromal cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). Functional annotation of these differentially expressed genes with Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID)[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] platform showed that the primary biological processes in MaSC-enriched spheres were associated with immune, defense, and wound responses, and those in stromal cells were associated with oxidation-reduction, inflammation, and wound responses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). With respect to the individual genes that are differentially expressed between young and old cells, the Cdkn2a locus, containing p19<sup>ARF</sup> and p16<sup>INK4a</sup>, was most highly upregulated (20-fold) in the old stromal cells (adjusted <italic>P</italic> &#x02264;.05), which was confirmed with real time RT-PCR assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>).

This age-related change in basal and luminal epithelial cell composition was accompanied by an increased MaSC frequency and decreased LP frequency. Morphologically, aged mammary glands displayed increased tertiary branching, irregular ductal organization, and prevalence of hyperplastic lesions. Most importantly, in vivo transplantation of MaSCs revealed significant reduction of milk production and increased hyperplastic lesions in regenerated glands derived from old, but not young BALB/c MaSCs. These findings for the first time demonstrated that spontaneous neoplastic lesions can originate from MaSCs and old MaSCs could be the susceptible targets for neoplastic transformation.</p><p>Our observations of age-associated increase in MaSC frequency and decrease in stem cell function in mammary glands from C57BL6/J and BALB/c mice are similar to findings on hematopoietic, gastrointestinal, muscle, and skin stem cells [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, these results differed from findings in FVB/N mice, where no age-specific difference of mammary stem cell activity was found between old (16 to 22 months) and young mice (age, 14 weeks) [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We did not observe the typical aging phenotype of the altered luminal-to-basal cell ratio in mice younger than 25 months in C57BL/6. It is possible that different mouse strains may have age-related phenotypic changes at different age, as observed in C57BL6/J at age old than 25 months and BALB/c mice at age old than 17 months in the present study. In other words, different mouse strain may age at different paces, and similar age-related changes in FVB mice may occur at older ages than those that have been investigated, which was younger than 23-month-old [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Future studies should look into this possibility. Strain-specific differences also exist in mammary gland development [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], hormonal regulation [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and tumorigenesis susceptibility [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In the present study, higher %hyperplasia was detected in aged mammary glands from BALB/c mice when compared with C57BL/6 counterparts. BALB/c mice are known to be more susceptible to radiation induced tumor formation than C57BL/6 due to their deficiency in DNA double-stranded break repair [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It is possible that the same mechanism is responsible for higher %hyperplasia found in BALB/c mice. Our findings of early onset of aging related MaSC changes and the prevalence of hyperplasic lesions in aged glands plus their well-known susceptibility to carcinogenesis render BALB/c mice a preferable mouse model for studying human aging and breast cancer.</p><p>Another interesting finding in the present study is the enrichment of luminal gene signature in the expanded basal cell population in old mammary glands. This phenomenon could have resulted from impure flow cytometry cell sorting from accidental inclusion of luminal cells in the basal gate. However, two measures were implemented to minimize the likelihood of this possibility. First, we always checked the cell purity post-sorting to ensure all sorted basal and luminal cells were &#x0003e; 99% within their designated gates. Second, with these sorted cells we performed in vitro SFD cultures and if CD24<sup>+</sup>CD49f<sup>lo</sup> luminal cells were accidently sorted into the basal cell gate, we would see hollow organoids formed in the SFD assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S1d</xref>). However, all sorted basal cells gave rise to solid organoids and all sorted luminal cells gave rise to hollow organoids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S1c-d</xref>). Therefore, the luminal signature in old basal cells is not likely due to accidental inclusion of CD24<sup>+</sup>CD49f<sup>lo</sup> luminal cells. Rather, our immunofluorescent staining indicated possible inclusion of K8<sup>+</sup>CD49f<sup>hi</sup> luminal cells in the basal cell fraction due to elevated CD49f in these K8 positive luminal cells, which are mainly confined to hyperplastic lesions. In normal human mammary epithelial cells, aging is associated with a reduction of myoepithelial cells and an increase in luminal cells that express K14 and CD49f, markers previously believed to be expressed exclusively in myoepithelial cells in women younger than 30 years [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although it is unknown how these luminal cells obtain basal-like features during aging, they were postulated to contribute to aging-associated mammary tumorigenesis [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Whether these basal-like K8<sup>+</sup>CD49f<sup>hi</sup> luminal cells in the aged murine mammary glands are the cell of origin in mammary tumorigenesis awaits further validation.</p><p>Although we observed a few luminal cells expressing high CD49f, the majority of luminal cells, either in normal or hyperplastic ducts, did not have high CD49f expression. Yet the basal cell pool in old glands was almost double the size of that in young animals. Considering the increased tertiary branching observed in old glands, we deduced that the majority of expanded CD49f<sup>hi</sup> basal cells might have derived from alveolar basal cells. More recently, studies examining Timp 1-4 mutant mammary glands revealed similar observation of MaSC-enriched basal cell pool expansion during aging [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, this study indicated that basal cell expansion in Timp mutants was accommodated by far greater cell density and cell compaction of mammary ducts [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Collectively, an expanded basal cell pool in aged mammary glands could result from increased ductal basal cells, alveolar basal cells, and K8<sup>+</sup>CD49f<sup>hi</sup> luminal cells in hyperplastic lesions. Given the heterogeneous nature of cells in the basal population, it is difficult to discern which cell type was the main contributor to the early neoplastic lesions observed in the regenerated outgrowths derived from these old MaSCs. Although we and others have proposed possible existence of ductal and alveolar basal progenitors in the basal cell lineage [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], currently there are no markers enabling the separation of these two types of basal cells. Future studies need to identify specific markers that can tag each of these distinct cell populations in the basal cell gate to allow full characterization of their roles in spontaneous tumorigenesis.</p><p>In human breast, the majority of cancer cases are estrogen receptor (ER) positive luminal subtypes [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Earlier studies using oncogenic transduction of isolated epithelial cells showed that basal cell derived tumors were mainly metaplastic/claudin-low ER negative [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Gene expression profiling also revealed that MaSC-enriched (basal) signature was concordant with claudin-low and &#x02018;normal-like&#x02019; breast subtypes [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, Blanpain's group recently reported that oncogenic <italic>Pik3ca</italic><sup>H1047R</sup> mutant expression at physiological levels in basal cells using keratin (K)5-CreER<sup>T2</sup> mice induced the formation of luminal ER<sup>+</sup> tumors, while its expression in unipotent luminal cells using K8-CReER<sup>T2</sup> mice induced either liminal ER<sup>+</sup> or basal-like ER<sup>&#x02212;</sup> tumors [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It is known that <italic>PIK3CA</italic> is the most frequently mutated gene in luminal/ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancers [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Their findings suggested that the MaSC-enriched basal cells could serve as the cell of origins for luminal ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancers under physiologically relevant conditions. Additionally, oncogenic <italic>KRAS<sup>G12D</sup></italic> transduction in basal cells isolated from normal human breast tissue in a recent study produced tumors most closely resembling those of spontaneous human breast cancers classified as &#x02018;normal-like&#x02019; or luminal A subtype, and the majority of these tumors (~88%) contained &#x0003e; 5% ER<sup>+</sup> cells [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Although basal cells were found to be mostly ER negative, they were cycling during diestrus cycle when progesterone levels are high [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], revealing that basal cells can be sensitive to hormonal stimulation. Collectively, these very recent findings support our speculation that expanded basal stem cells in aged glands could serve as the cellular origins for the predominant luminal ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancers observed in aged women.</p><p>Our previous study have shown that pubertal xenoestrogen bisphenol A exposure altered MaSC function, causing early neoplastic lesions in regenerated glands, which indicates that MaSCs are susceptible to xenoestrogen-induced transformation [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. More recently, studies examining variation in cancer risk among different tissues showed strong correlations between the lifetime risk of cancers and the number of stem cell divisions [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These findings, together with current study, indicate that stem cells are vulnerable targets for cell transformation, and may serve as cellular origins for tumorigenesis. This may explain why the breast tissues of adolescent females are more sensitive than those of older women to the effects of ionizing radiation (IR) as this developmental stage involves extensive stem/progenitor cell proliferation and thus has a large pool of targets for IR-induced transformation [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Similarly, the relative susceptibility of BALB/c mice to IR or chemical induced mammary tumors comparing to C57BL/6 mice may as well attribute to the higher (3-4 fold) MaSC frequency found in BALB/c than that of C57BL/6. Correlative studies between MaSC frequency and tumor susceptibility in different developmental windows or in different mouse strains will help us further clarify the role of MaSCs in breast cancer initiation.</p><p>The expansion of basal cell population, increased MaSCs and increased tertiary branching in aged glands phenocopy mammary glands at diestrus of the estrus cycle and those at pregnancy [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, vaginal cytology and serum progesterone confirmed that old mice (&#x0003e; 25 months) had unchanging vaginal smears and low circulating progesterone levels, indicating cessation of their reproductive cycle and thus exclude possible effect from progesterone signaling. Instead, our findings revealed an elevated inflammatory response in old mammary glands, which was evidenced by activated immune/inflammatory-related gene expression and increased Cox2 and CLS. One significant source for aging associated chronic inflammation is cellular senescence [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Senescent cells increase with age [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and are found at sites of age-related pathologies including benign prostatic hyperplasia [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Senescent cells also secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, extracellular matrix components, and growth factors, which can disrupt local tissue homeostasis and promote tumorigenesis [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Inoculation with premalignant or malignant epithelial cells together with senescent fibroblasts led to more and larger tumors in host mice than inoculation with the epithelial cells alone or with pre-senescent fibroblasts [<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. More recently, senescence-associated inflammatory response has been shown to contribute to colon tumorigenesis [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The upregulation of the <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> locus in old stromal cells in this study is consistent with increased p16 expression observed in many old mammalian cells including hematopoietic and neural stem cells [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], suggesting a senescence phenotype in old mammary glands [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. It is worth noting that although we did not observe any difference in MaSC self-renewal between young and old, it is possible this may be due to the limited number of <italic>in vivo</italic> serial transplantation we did in the present study as normally 5 to 6 serial transplants are required to observe the senescence phenotype of stem cells [<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Another significant source for aging associated chronic inflammation is an altered immune response [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Whole transcriptome sequencing in our study revealed an activated immune-like response in old MaSCs. Thus, aging-induced chronic inflammation might be the underlying cause for the altered epithelial cell composition, stem cell frequency and function observed in old mice. Earlier studies with epidermal and central nervous systems also support this hypothesis [<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p><p>Our findings of decreased hyperplasia incidence in regenerated glands derived from old MaSCs transplanted into cleared fat pads of young recipients when compared with primary old glands indicate the importance of stroma, where young environment may rejuvenate old stem cells [<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Thus, elevated inflammatory environment we observed in aged stromal could play a significant role in functional changes of aged MaSCs. However, regenerated glands from aged MaSCs of BALB/c mice still exhibited &#x0003e; 2.3-fold increase of %hyperplasia than their young counterparts despite the use of young recipients (niche), suggesting cell intrinsic (genetic/epigenetic) impacts of aging on MaSCs. For example, recent studies in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have suggested that epigenomic alterations of the DNA methylation landscape contribute to the functional decline of HSCs during aging [<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Future studies are necessary to fully characterize both the extrinsic and intrinsic factors in MaSC aging.</p><p>In summary, our present study showed that murine MaSCs increased in frequency, decreased in function, and had increased transformation potential during normal aging. These MaSCs are susceptible to age-associated changes, and may be primed for neoplastic transformation and may subsequently serve as the cell of origin for certain subtypes of age-associated breast cancer. Future validation of this hypothesis will improve our understanding of breast cancer etiology and permit the development of novel preventive and therapeutic interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Animals</title><p>Animal care and use were conducted according to established guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio.
