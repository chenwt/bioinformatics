In this study, we identify the genetic determinants that enable the mirid, <italic>Tupiocoris notatus,</italic> to feed on its well-defended host plant, <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic>, an outstanding model for plant-insect interaction studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We used an RNAseq approach to evaluate the global gene expression of <italic>T. notatus</italic> after feeding on a transgenic <italic>N. attenuata</italic> line which does not accumulate jasmonic acid (JA) after herbivory, and consequently accumulates very low levels of defense metabolites. Using Illumina sequencing, we generated a <italic>de novo</italic> assembled transcriptome which resulted in 63,062 contigs (putative transcript isoforms) contained in 42,610 isotigs (putative identified genes). Differential expression analysis based on RSEM-estimated transcript abundances identified 82 differentially expressed (DE) transcripts between <italic>T. notatus</italic> fed on wild-type and the defenseless plants. The same analysis conducted with Corset-estimated transcript abundances identified 59 DE clusters containing 85 transcripts. In both analyses, a larger number of DE transcripts were found down-regulated in mirids feeding on JA-silenced plants (around 70%). Among these down-regulated transcripts we identified seven transcripts possibly involved in the detoxification of <italic>N. attenuata</italic> defense metabolite, specifically, one glutathione-S-transferase (GST), one UDP-glucosyltransferase (UGT), five cytochrome P450 (P450s), and six serine proteases. Real-time quantitative PCR confirmed the down-regulation for six transcripts (encoding GST, UGT and four P450s) and revealed that their expression was only slightly decreased in mirids feeding on another <italic>N. attenuata</italic> transgenic line specifically silenced in the accumulation of diterpene glycosides, one of the many classes of JA-mediated defenses in <italic>N. attenuata</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results provide a transcriptional overview of the changes in a specialist hemimetabolous insect associated with feeding on host plants depleted in chemical defenses. Overall, the analysis reveals that <italic>T. notatus</italic> responses to host plant defenses are narrow and engages P450 detoxification pathways.

Consistent exposure to toxic or anti-digestive compounds has selected for adaptions in herbivorous insects to the defenses of host plants with the result that well-defended plants have become targets of herbivory. This co-evolutionary process has to a large extent shaped the host plant specialization in insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and the majority of phytophagous insects feed only on a small number of host plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The most common evolutionary innovations that enable insects to reliably cope with noxious metabolites produced by their host plants can be classified in three main categories of biochemical strategies: mechanisms that result in enzymatic detoxification, rapid excretion and metabolic changes that allow for the sequestration of plant toxins for the insects own defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Enzymatic detoxification of ingested plant defenses is commonly used by both generalist and specialist insect herbivores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Enzymes that are involved in xenobiotic detoxification frequently belong to the large cytochrome P450 monooxigenase (P450) family which catalyze a wide range of reactions in animal and plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The best-studied examples of the role of P450s in plant metabolite detoxification come from different lepidopteran families. Several <italic>Papilio</italic> species as well as the parsnip webworm, <italic>Depressaria pastinacella</italic>, use a CYP6B enzyme to detoxify toxic fouranocoumarins produced by their host plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In the navel orangeworn, <italic>Amyelois transitella</italic>, a closely related CYP6AB11 metabolizes imperatorin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and in the generalist <italic>Helicoverpa zea</italic>, CYP6B8 metabolizes a variety of plant compounds, including several phenolics and flavonoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> requires the activity of CYP6AE14 to develop on cotton containing gossypol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and another cotton pest belonging to a different order, the aphid <italic>Aphis gossypii</italic>, relies on a similar enzyme (CYP6DA2) to deal with the same toxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Examples of detoxification carried out by P450 enzymes are also present among Coleoptera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], Diptera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and Hymenoptera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In addition to the direct evidence of detoxification provided by the above examples, P450s have also been associated with resistance to plant secondary metabolites in a number of other species, including <italic>Manduca sexta</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic> species from the Sonora desert and mosquito larvae, all of which have been shown to increase the accumulation of transcripts coding for specific P450s in response to the ingestion of defense compounds (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]).</p><p>Another common detoxification strategy, which is often a subsequent step to P450-mediated functionalization reactions, involves the addition of sugars or glutathione which frequently reduces the reactivity of functional groups and increases their water solubility making the toxins easier to excrete. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and UDP-glucosyltransferases (UGTs) are examples of such enzymes. In <italic>Spodoptera</italic> spp., larvae feeding on maize, which produces the toxic aglucone DIMBOA when attacked, detoxify the toxin in their guts by the addition of glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. <italic>Helicoverpa</italic> larvae uses an UGT to glycosylate the alkaloid capsaicin produced by pepper fruits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and <italic>M. sexta</italic> larvae glycosylate several toxic plant phenolics produced by its host plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. <italic>M. sexta</italic> larvae are also one of the likely numerous examples in which host plant specialization has enabled them to exploit plant metabolites for their own defense against predators. While feeding on nicotine-containing <italic>Nicotiana</italic> species, <italic>M. sexta</italic> larvae pass the majority of the nicotine they ingest through with their frass but can exhale a small amount through their spiracles in response to attack from spiders. A largely mid-gut expressed P450, CYP6B46 is required for this unusual defensive co-option of an otherwise excreted defense metabolite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. To date, the ability to sequester plant secondary metabolites has been found in more than 250 insect families and in many cases, the sequestration has been shown to increase insect defenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Attacked plants not only produce toxic secondary metabolites but also proteinaceous effectors such as proteinase inhibitors (PIs). PIs interfere with insect digestion processes and reduce the availability of essential amino acids required for growth, development and reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Insects overcome the deleterious effects of ingesting PIs by either the direct hydrolysis of PIs with specific proteinases and/or transcriptionally upregulating the production of PI-insensitive isoforms or over-producing sensitive proteinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>The majority of examples of insect adaptation to harmful plant metabolites comes from three orders: Lepidoptera, Coleoptera or Diptera. Very few examples come from hemimetabolous insects, such for Hemiptera, the so-called plant bugs. <italic>Tupiocoris notatus</italic> Distant (Hemiptera: Miridae) is a cell-content feeder bug with a wide distribution in the southern United States. It specializes on solanaceous species, attacking both wild plants and cultivated crops. Its main hosts are species from <italic>Nicotiana</italic> and <italic>Datura</italic> families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In the Great Basin Desert of the southwestern USA, <italic>T. notatus</italic> attacks the native tobacco plant <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic> (Torr. Ex Watson), a model species for plant-insect interactions. <italic>N. attenuata</italic>&#x02019;s response to insect attack involves a well-characterized signaling system which leads to the accumulation of toxic secondary metabolites such as nicotine, phenolic compounds or diterpeneglycosides (DTGs), defensive proteins like trypsin PIs (TPIs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. When the attacker is the lepidopteran <italic>M. sexta</italic>, <italic>N. attenuata&#x02019;s</italic> responses are elicited by fatty acid-amino acid conjugates from caterpillar saliva that are introduced into plant wounds during feeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Recognition of these elicitors is followed by a jasmonic acid (JA) burst that mediates the accumulation of defense metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. How <italic>N. attenuata</italic> recognizes herbivory from the important piercing-sucking herbivore <italic>T. notatus</italic> remains unknown; however the extensive tissue damage produced by mirid feeding elicits a very similar suite of responses as those elicited by <italic>M. sexta</italic>, which includes increased concentrations of phenolics, DTGs and TPIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Similarly, the mechanisms that allow <italic>T. notatus</italic> to cope with the array of toxic metabolites produced by <italic>N. attenuata</italic> remain unexplored. Previous field experiments on <italic>T. notatus</italic> preferences among different <italic>N. attenuata</italic> transgenic lines silenced in several layers of defenses revealed that <italic>T. notatus</italic> feeds with apparent impunity on its host plant since it even prefers better defended wild-type plants than those impaired in JA biosynthesis; the opposite occurs for most other herbivores that attack <italic>N. attenuata</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This has led to the hypothesis that <italic>T. notatus</italic> might be even more adapted to <italic>N. attenuata</italic> defense metabolites than other generalist herbivores, such as <italic>Empoasca</italic> spp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, when single defense compounds were silenced, both DTGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and TPIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] emerged as clear determinants of <italic>T. notatus</italic> host choice.</p><p>To understand <italic>T. notatus&#x02019;s</italic> responses to <italic>N. attenuata</italic> defenses, we used next-generation sequencing and a <italic>N. attenuata</italic> transgenic line deficient in JA biosynthesis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Allene oxide cyclase (AOC) is a key enzyme in JA production, mediating the last step of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) biosynthesis. Plants silenced in this gene do not accumulate most of the known defense metabolites produced by the plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], and hence are ideal for identifying candidate resistance genes that help <italic>T. notatus</italic> exploit <italic>N. attenuata</italic> as a host. We hypothesized that <italic>T. notatus</italic> feeding on JA-deficient plant would have a decreased expression of genes used in the detoxification of toxic metabolites. We then used transgenic lines specifically silenced in DTGs and TPIs accumulation to evaluate if the expression of particular candidate genes were involved in the detoxification of these two groups of defenses which are important in determining the host choice of mirids.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the transformed plants used to dissect the mechanisms used by <italic>Tupiocoris notatus</italic> to tolerate toxic metabolites produced by its host plant, <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic>.

An empty-vector (EV) transformed plant line (A-04-266-3) was used as controls. Seed germination and glasshouse growth conditions are described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Briefly, seeds were germinated on sterile Gamborg B5 medium (Duchefa) after 1&#x000a0;h of treatment with diluted smoke (House of Herbs) and 1&#x000a0;mM GA3 (Roth). Ten days after germination, seedlings were transferred into Teku pots containing a peat-based substrate, and after 10&#x02013;12 d plantlets were transplanted into individual 2-L pots with the same substrate.

After collection, nymphs were separated from adults and 80 adults were used for each replicate, and three replicates per treatment were harvested. Total RNA extraction was performed with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Poly-A RNA purification, library preparation and Illumina sequencing were carried out at the BGI sequencing facilities (Hong-Kong). The six libraries were sequenced in a single lane in a HiSeq 2000 machine (Illumina), to obtain 100&#x000a0;bp paired-end reads. Adapter sequences and low quality sequences were removed using Trimmomatic to obtain high quality (HQ) reads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].

<italic>De novo</italic> assembly of a <italic>T. notatus</italic> reference transcriptome was performed using short read assembler Trinity with default parameters, using <italic>in silico</italic> normalization and min_kmer_cov 2 options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Trinity output delivers two output types: contigs, which represent putative transcript isoforms, and isotigs, which represent putatively identified genes. HQ reads were then mapped back to the assembled transcriptome using Bowtie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], and mapping statistics were estimated by RSEM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Finally, contigs with less than one IsoPct (percentage of expression for a given contig compared with all expression from a particular isotig) or less than 0.3 fragments per kilobase transcript length per million fragments mapped (FPKM) were discarded.</p><p>We employed two different assembly strategies to cope with the high heterozygosity of the samples. In the first strategy&#x000a0;(ALL), we assembled all HQ reads obtained from sequencing (derived from 480 insects), and in the second one&#x000a0;(TWO) we only used HQ reads from two replicates per treatment (320 insects in total). These two transcriptomes were then compared in terms of lowest total number of contigs, highest number of mapped HQ reads, highest number of uniquely HQ mapped reads, highest number of unique Blastx hits against <italic>Acyrthosiphon pisum</italic> proteome and ortholog hit ratio (OHR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. According to these parameters, the best assembled transcriptome was then used as a reference transcriptome, and has been deposited at GenBank under the accession GFBA00000000. The version described in this paper is the first version, GFBA01000000.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Annotation</title><p>Annotation of the reference transcriptome was conducted on a local server against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant database (nr), Swissprot database and Uniref90 database using Blastx with an e-value of 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>. Additional Blastx search comparison was performed in order to obtain a set of putative orthologs from <italic>A. pisum</italic>, <italic>Diaphorina citri</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> proteomes. Gene ontology (GO) terms were retrieved by using Blast2GO software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] with default parameters, using Blastx results against a local nr database. GO annotation resulting from Blast2GO was implemented by running InterProScan and merging the results. Finally, the GO-slim function was used to summarize annotation results. Enzyme classification codes (EC) and metabolic pathway annotation (KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) were generated by Blast2GO from direct mapping of GO terms to their enzyme code equivalents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Differential gene expression analysis</title><p>To obtain the count matrix that contains the number of reads mapped to each contig in each sample, we used two different methods to estimate counts in case of multi-mapping reads. First, a SAM file was generated per each sample using Bowtie allowing multi-mapping. Then, in the first approach the SAM files were fed to RSEM implemented in the Trinity pipeline. In case of multi-mapping reads, RSEM employs a &#x0201c;rescue&#x0201d; method based on estimated maximum likelihood expression levels, which allows partitioning and distributing portions of a multiread&#x02019;s expression value among all of the contigs to which it maps. When RSEM is run with Trinity-assembled transcriptomes, it delivers two outputs: estimated counts at isoform (contig) level and at the gene (isotig) level. In parallel, SAM files were also processed by Corset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], which hierarchically clusters the contigs based on the proportion of shared reads and expression patterns. All the reads are uniquely assigned to a cluster; hence, each read is only counted once, even though the reads were originally multi-mapped to different contigs. Matrix counts estimated by the two methods were then used to identify differentially-expressed (DE) contigs through EdgeR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] in R using RStudio. Heatmaps showing the expression level of specific contigs were generated in R using heatmap.2 implemented in the package gPlots.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Phylogenetic analyses of CYP450, GST and UGT families</title><p>Contigs annotated as P450s, GSTs or UGTs after Blastx were selected for phylogenetic analysis. First, contigs belonging to the same isotig were aligned with the software BioEdit 7.2.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], alignments were manually inspected and the longest contig was selected. Secondly, coding sequences (CDS) (either complete or partial) were identified. For each gene family, an alignment of all <italic>T. notatus</italic> CDS was generated by TranslatorX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] using the Muscle algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], and a maximum likelihood (ML) tree was constructed in MEGA v6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Redundant sequences were then merged to obtain a non-redundant list of putatively unique transcripts (PUTs), although it should be noted that we cannot exclude that some PUTs might be allelic variants of the same gene. PUTs were then translated into proteins and for each gene family, an amino acid alignment was constructed in MEGA v6 using genomically annotated sequences from other insect species: <italic>A. pisum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] and <italic>Rhodnius prolixus</italic> P450s and GSTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> UGTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].

On average, the same numbers of reads (around 33&#x000a0;M) were obtained from each treatment: whole <italic>T. notatus</italic> feeding on EV and ir<italic>AOC</italic> defense-less plants (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). After trimming, <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly was carried out in parallel using two different strategies. Since our samples consisted of eighty individuals per replicate, they might display a high heterozygosity that would affect <italic>de novo</italic> assembly and subsequent differential expression analysis. We assembled in parallel a transcriptome from a smaller subset of HQ reads (transcriptome TWO), and we then compared its statistics with those of a transcriptome assembled using all HQ reads (transcriptome ALL). In trascriptome TWO, the number of contigs obtained decreased from 71,182 to 63,062 whereas the N50 decreased from 1,891 to 1,746 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Interestingly, transcriptome TWO was mapped by the same quantity of HQ reads as did transcriptome ALL despite its fewer contigs, and the number of uniquely HQ mapping reads increased from 58 to 62% (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Thus, the decreased number of contigs in transcriptome TWO was likely due to a better assembly and a consequent reduction of redundant isoforms. Blastx results against the pea aphid proteome (which consisted of 23,090 predicted proteins) were consistent with the results: 37 and 35% of the contigs from transcriptomes TWO and ALL found matches, respectively (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), and a higher number of <italic>A. pisum</italic> sequences were matched once by contigs from transcriptome TWO (3,615) compared to those from transcriptome ALL (3,423) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), consistent with a decrease in redundancy for transcriptome TWO. Blastx results were also used to calculate the ortholog hit ratio (OHR) for both transcriptomes, which estimates the completeness of a transcript contained in each assembled contig [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Transcriptome ALL showed an OHR of 0.57, slighter higher than transcriptome TWO (0.55). In short, the assembly derived from transcriptome TWO had fewer isoforms and lower redundancy without a drastic decrease in contig size or completeness, and hence was used as the reference transcriptome.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Sequencing statistics</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2"/><th colspan="3">

Such plant defense compounds usually elicit a counter-response in the insects, and for many insect species, it is thought that this counter-response consists of the activation of detoxification enzymes or processes that allow for the sequestration of the metabolites, in ways that are frequently particular to the natural history of the herbivore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Transcriptional surveys of the responses of phytophagous insects consuming their host plants can provide insights into the processes by which insects specialize on and detoxify otherwise well-defended plants. Such genome-wide approaches remain relatively scarce as most studies examine the effects of single toxic compounds, frequently with artificial diets, simply because the genomic tools are lacking to manipulate the pathways responsible for defense metabolite production for most host plants.</p><p>
<italic>N. attenuata</italic> produces a wide array of noxious compounds during <italic>T. notatus</italic> attacks, from phenolamides like caffeoyl-putrescine, phenolic compounds like chlorogenic and crypto-chlorogenic acid to diterpene-glycosydes (DTGs) and the proteinaceous effectors like trypsin-proteinase inhibitors (TPIs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. All of these defense metabolites or proteins are inducible and their production is mediated by a rapid phytohormone signaling, such as JA that accumulates within a few minutes of insect attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. By using ir<italic>AOC</italic> plants which are deficient in JA biosynthesis due to the silencing of Na<italic>AOC</italic>, we were able to analyze in detail the global response of <italic>T. notatus</italic> to the entire suite of JA-elicited defense compounds produced by its host plant, and identify specific candidate genes which allow <italic>T. notatus</italic> to feed on <italic>N. attenuata</italic>. The results were consistent with the general expectation for specialist herbivores, whose adaptation to the host plant is thought to involve a small number of fine-tuned and highly efficient detoxification mechanisms. In contrast, generalist herbivores rely on a broader array of detoxification genes, with different degrees of substrate specificity and efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Transcriptional rearrangements shown by <italic>T. notatus</italic> feeding on <italic>ir</italic>AOC plants are limited, with a greater number of down-regulated transcripts.

Classification provided by a further phylogenetic analysis were consistent with a role for these genes in detoxification; the <italic>T. notatus</italic> GST belongs to the delta class, which is thought to function together with members of the epsilon class in xenobiotic metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], and the four down-regulated <italic>T. notatus</italic> P450s belong to the CYP3 clan which has been linked to xenobiotic metabolism and insecticide resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. P450s, GSTs and UGTs usually function cooperatively and participate in two different phases of xenobiotic detoxification. P450 enzymes are thought to carry out a first detoxification step (phase I reactions), which increase the molecule&#x02019;s hydrophilicity. Transferase enzymes, like GSTs of UGTs, participate in phase II reactions which usually act on the products of the phase I reactions, and add side groups, such as glucuronides, which further increase the compound&#x02019;s water solubility for later excretion or sequestration. Genes encodings P450s, GSTs and UGTs implicated in the metabolism of plant toxins are thought to provide the foundation of the detoxification mechanisms characteristic of generalist insects that cope with a more diverse and unpredictable array of plant defenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In contrast, it is thought that highly adapted insects possess more specialized enzymes that enable them to convert specific toxic products from their host plants to less toxic ones, as in the case of glucosinolate tolerance in certain species of Lepidoptera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. The results suggest that <italic>T. notatus</italic> employs a cooperative detoxification system based on P450s, GSTs and UGTs to metabolize tobacco defense metabolites, in a process more similar to the expectations for a generalist insect, than for a specialist like <italic>T. notatus</italic>. However, the <italic>T. notatus</italic> host, <italic>N. attenuata</italic>, produces a wide array of toxic compounds and <italic>T. notatus</italic> also feeds on a restricted number of other Solanaceous plants, like <italic>D. wrightii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and may move among hosts during its life. Hence, during its lifetime, <italic>T. notatus</italic> likely needs a highly adaptable detoxification system able to cope with the diversity of metabolites that it&#x02019;s commonly exposed to. A previous comparison of two related CYP6Bs, which were both induced by and metabolize furanocoumarins, revealed that the enzyme from the generalist <italic>H. zea</italic> had a much wider substrate spectrum than the enzymes from the specialist <italic>P. polyxenes</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We infer that functional specialization of <italic>T. notatus</italic> P450s may account for its oligophagy, but at the same time retain the functional versatility required for coping with the diversity of secondary metabolites produced by <italic>N. attenuata</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>After <italic>T. notatus</italic> attack, <italic>N. attenuata</italic> also produces TPIs, which decrease insect growth by inhibiting gut proteases and potentially reducing the availability of essential amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. <italic>T. notatus</italic> feeding on ir<italic>AOC</italic> down-regulated the expression of six different serine proteases, results consistent with the well-documented strategies for coping with diets high in PIs: overproduction of inhibitor-sensitive digestive proteases, expression of inhibitor-insensitive isoforms or activation of proteases that hydrolyze plant PI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, the results could not be confirmed by RT-qPCR, which showed no differences in serine protease expression between <italic>T. notatus</italic> feeding on EV or ir<italic>AOC</italic> plants (and also not in ir<italic>PI</italic> plants, which were specifically silenced in TPI expression). Although these discrepancies were not observed for the other down-regulated transcripts, the differences in serine protease expression might be explained by the use of different biological replicates for each technique. Also, discrepancies between the two methods used for estimating counts from read mapping may be the responsible for false positives. Down-regulated serine proteases were identified using count matrix estimated by RSEM but not by Corset (except for the contig TR15565_c1_g1 which was a chimera between transcripts encoding a serine-protease and a protein from endoplasmic reticulum). Overall, the results obtained with Corset tended to be more accurate than those obtained with RSEM. Corset identified contigs belonging to seven clusters that could be merged into six PUTs (one GST, one UGT, three P450s and a serine-protease), and RT-qPCR confirmed a down regulation for four of these PUTs (GST, UGT and two P450s). In contrast, results obtained using RSEM-estimated count matrix were confirmed by RT-qPCR only for three (three P450s) of ten PUTs (four P450s and six serine-proteases). In general, our whole-body RNAseq analysis yielded only a handful of candidate detoxification genes which were DE in <italic>T. notatus</italic> when feeding on <italic>ir</italic>AOC plants. This may be due to several reasons. The use of entire insects may have masked expression differences among specific tissues, such as the midgut which is commonly involved in detoxification.</p><p>Expression of PUTs encoding defensive enzymes, which were down-regulated in <italic>T. notatus</italic> feeding on JA-silenced ir<italic>AOC</italic> plants, was further tested in mirids feeding on a different <italic>N. attenuata</italic> transgenic line, which specifically does not produce DTGs. When mirids were allowed to feed on ir<italic>GGPPS</italic> plants, results revealed that down-regulation was always not as strong compared to mirids feeding on ir<italic>AOC</italic> plants, suggesting that the putative detoxification mechanisms mediated by CYP450s, UGT and GST was not specifically involved in DTG detoxification but probably tuned to other JA-mediated defense compounds. Another possibility is that the activation of these enzymes was elicited by oxilipin products, such as JA or its conjugates, which accumulate in EV and <italic>ir</italic>GGPPS but not in ir<italic>AOC</italic> plants during <italic>T. notatus</italic> attack. Indeed, it has been shown that insects can perceive phytohormones. <italic>Helicoverpa zea</italic> responds to the ingestion of large quantities of JA and salicylate by activating four P450 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Consistent with this possibility is the observation that another hemipteran (<italic>Empoasca</italic> sp.) which occasionally feeds on <italic>N. attenuata</italic> plants in nature, prefers to feed on plants deficient in JA accumulation, independently of the major defensive compounds elicited by JA signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="discussion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>&#x000a0;Here we identify and further validate the accumulation of transcripts involved in the adaptation of <italic>T. notatus</italic> to its host plant, <italic>N. attenuata</italic>. The RNAseq approach identified six transcripts which were down-regulated in <italic>T. notatus</italic> feeding on JA-silenced <italic>ir</italic>AOC plants and which encode detoxification enzymes which are thought to function cooperatively to metabolize <italic>N. attenuata&#x02019;s</italic> major defensive compounds. The actual function of these transcripts in <italic>T. notatus</italic> can be now rigorously tested with plant-mediated RNA silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], which can be conducted in field experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Thus, our results provide a first step in understanding the mechanisms by which <italic>T. notatus</italic> exploits <italic>N. attenuata</italic> as host.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec20"><title>Additional files</title><p>
