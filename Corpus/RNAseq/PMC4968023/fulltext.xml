In order to make meaningful comparisons that can provide significant insights into the evolution of regulatory networks, homologous networks from multiple taxa must be deeply characterized. One of the most thoroughly characterized GRNs is the dorsoventral (DV) patterning system of the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> embryo. We have developed the wasp <italic>Nasonia</italic> as a comparative DV patterning model because it has shown the convergent evolution of a mode of early embryonic patterning very similar to that of the fly, and it is of interest to know whether the similarity at the gross level also extends to the molecular level.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We used RNAi to dorsalize and ventralize <italic>Nasonia</italic> embryos, RNAseq to quantify transcriptome-wide expression levels, and differential expression analysis to identify genes whose expression levels change in either RNAi case. This led to the identification of &#x0003e;100 genes differentially expressed and regulated along the DV axis. Only a handful of these genes are shared DV components in both fly and wasp. Many of those unique to <italic>Nasonia</italic> are cytoskeletal and adhesion molecules, which may be related to the divergent cell and tissue behavior observed at gastrulation. In addition, many transcription factors and signaling components are only DV regulated in <italic>Nasonia</italic>, likely reflecting the divergent upstream patterning mechanisms involved in producing the conserved pattern of cell fates observed at gastrulation. Finally, several genes that lack <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologs show robust and distinct expression patterns. These include genes with vertebrate homologs that have been lost in the fly lineage, genes that are found only among Hymenoptera, and several genes that entered the <italic>Nasonia</italic> genome through lateral transfer from endosymbiotic bacteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Altogether, our results provide insights into how GRNs respond to new functional demands and how they can incorporate novel components.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12915-016-0285-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>sfb 680</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roth</surname><given-names>Siegfried</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R03HD078578</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lynch</surname><given-names>Jeremy A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Patterning and morphogenetic processes in developmental systems rely on the underlying activity of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Changes in these networks can lead to new developmental outputs (morphologies, cell types) and thus understanding how these networks vary across phylogenies is critical to understanding the evolution of development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>To understand evolutionary variation in GRNs, a comparative approach must be taken. In addition, the networks to be compared must be understood at a high level of detail and completeness if the comparisons are to be robust and valuable sources of evolutionary insight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The embryonic dorsoventral (DV) patterning network of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is one of the few GRNs that are understood well enough to serve as a basis for comparative analysis.</p><p>DV patterning in <italic>Drosophila</italic> leads to the establishment of three broad cell fates, the mesoderm, ectoderm, and the amnioserosa, with distinct sub-fates established within each (particularly the ectoderm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The NF-kB transcription factor Dorsal is a master regulator of this network, and acts as a morphogen, activating and repressing genes in a concentration-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Dorsal itself has direct regulatory input into most of the components of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> DV GRN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and its patterning ability is augmented by additional regulatory interactions among its targets that lead to refinement of patterning (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]). Feedback on Toll signaling by one of its zygotic targets has recently been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The function of this feedback appears to be to stabilize the breadth and shape of the Dorsal gradient in the face of fluctuating and imprecise upstream positional information, allowing Dorsal to most efficiently perform its function at the top of the DV patterning hierarchy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to <italic>Drosophila,</italic> patterning processes that are dynamic in both space and time, and are generated by regulatory networks with apparent self-regulatory properties, have been found in other insect species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In order to understand how early embryonic patterning networks can be altered in the course of evolution, we have endeavored to characterize the embryonic DV GRN of the wasp <italic>Nasonia</italic> at a level of detail that makes meaningful comparisons to <italic>Drosophila</italic> possible. <italic>Nasonia</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> have been evolving independently for over 300 million years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], yet they undergo very similar modes of long germ embryogenesis, which have likely arisen through convergent evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The expression of marker genes for the major tissue types along the DV axis (mesoderm, ectoderm, and extraembryonic membranes) are nearly identical at the onset of gastrulation in the two species (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]). However, the ways these patterns are generated are quite divergent, as the <italic>Nasonia</italic> DV patterning system exhibits dynamic behavior, with initially narrow domains of ventral genes expanding over developmental time, indicating the possibility that a positive feedback loop is used to generate the full DV pattern in <italic>Nasonia</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]). In addition, it has been shown that generation of the DV pattern in <italic>Nasonia</italic> depends heavily on BMP signaling, with Toll signaling relegated to a limited role on the ventral side (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]). This is in direct contrast to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> system, where Toll signaling is responsible for all DV polarity, and BMP plays a subordinate, dorsally restricted role (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Summary of similarities and differences between <italic>Nasonia</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryogenesis. Representation of wasp (<italic>left</italic>) and fly (<italic>right</italic>) embryos from the mid-blastoderm stage (<italic>1</italic>) through the completion of gastrulation (<italic>6</italic>). Patterning and tissue establishment is represented by the following colors: extraembryonic (<italic>purple</italic>), dorsal ectoderm (<italic>gray</italic>), neuroectoderm (<italic>green</italic>), mesoderm (<italic>red</italic>). As the blastoderm cellularizes (<italic>1&#x02013;3</italic>), retraction of the expression domain of extraembryonic marker genes is observed in both insects. While the domains of the other tissue-specific markers fluctuate very little in the fly, the mesoderm marker gene expression domain expands dynamically at the expense of lateral ectoderm marker expression in the wasp. These wasp-specific changes precede a&#x000a0;stable pattern nearly identical to that of the fly just prior to the start of gastrulation (<italic>3</italic>). However, once gastrulation begins (<italic>4&#x02013;6</italic>), the behavior of the different tissue domains diverges again. In the fly a ventral furrow internalizes the mesoderm. In the wasp, the epithelium breaks at the border of the mesoderm and neuroectoderm, and the free edges of the ectoderm migrate towards each other until they meet and re-form a continuous epithelium at the ventral midline. At the end of gastrulation, the fly amnioserosa remains in place and slowly shrinks; however, the wasp extraembryonic tissue expands at this time. The dorsal ectoderm flanking the serosa and amnion folds and eventually breaks, again creating free edges. The free edges of the serosa then migrate over the ectodermal epithelium, forming a squamous epithelium that eventually covers the entire embryo.

There is no ventral furrow in <italic>Nasonia</italic> gastrulation, but rather the blastodermal epithelium ruptures at the border between mesoderm and mesectoderm, and the ectoderm then appears to crawl over the mesoderm until the two ectodermal plates meet at the ventral midline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, <italic>Nasonia</italic> has a true serosa, which migrates dramatically, unlike the fly amnioserosa, which remains on the dorsal side until it disappears at dorsal closure (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]). Both of these <italic>Nasonia</italic> morphogenetic processes are similar to those in <italic>Apis</italic>, indicating that they were an innovation of the hyper-diverse higher Hymenoptera (Apocrita) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>These differences indicate that the composition of, and regulatory connections within, the <italic>Nasonia</italic> DV patterning network are significantly different from their counterparts in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, despite the near identity of the pattern of tissue fate marker expression at the end of the blastoderm stage. The availability of both RNAi to manipulate gene function and well-characterized genomic and transcriptomic data make <italic>Nasonia</italic> an ideal model for comparative GRN analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. We have previously shown that RNAi knockdown of BMP signaling components leads to a robust loss of dorsally and laterally expressed genes along with a simultaneous expansion of some ventrally expressed mesoderm markers (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]). On the other hand, reduction of Toll signaling leads to the loss of the mesoderm and ventral ectoderm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). We reasoned that comparing the global transcriptomes of these two RNAi cases to each other and to wild type (wt) should allow us to discover most genes that are differentially expressed along the DV axis of the wasp.</p><p>Using this approach, we have identified 110 genes with distinct expression patterns in the <italic>Nasonia</italic> embryo. While there is core of conserved DV factors found in both <italic>Nasonia</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, a significant majority of <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologs of <italic>Nasonia</italic> DV patterned genes do not show DV expression patterns in the fly embryo. Other highlights include a set of factors that are differentially expressed along the DV axis in both species, but mark different cell fates in <italic>Nasonia</italic>; <italic>Nasonia</italic> genes that do not have clear homologs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (or in any other animal in many cases); and new expression patterns that do not have clear equivalents in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. This study represents the first major leap towards a comprehensive characterization of an additional DV patterning GRN for comparative analysis of regulatory network evolution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experimental design</title><p> As the focus of our transcriptome analysis, we used embryos of the parasitoid wasp&#x000a0;<italic>Nasonia&#x000a0;vitripennis</italic> at&#x000a0;the time period starting from the penultimate syncytial division until the onset of gastrulation (4&#x02013;7 hours after egg lay at 28 &#x000b0;C). This covers the dynamic patterning stage until the final establishment of cell fates on the blastoderm and onset of gastrulation, and represents the critical patterning time window in <italic>Nasonia</italic>.

For <italic>Nv-TollA</italic>, two independent double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) made from non-overlapping sections of the Toll gene were used in separate experiments, serving as biological replicates. <italic>Nv-dpp</italic> and <italic>Nv-gbb</italic> served as biological replicates for BMP signaling knockdown, as these two genes produce indistinguishably ventralized progeny. Each dsRNA was at a concentration of 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL in water. Finally, two independent water-injected embryo pools were collected.

Library preparation started with 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of total RNA. After poly-A selection (using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads), mRNA was purified and fragmented using divalent cations under elevated temperature. The RNA fragments underwent reverse transcription using random primers. This was followed by second strand cDNA synthesis with DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. After end repair and A-tailing, indexing adapters were ligated. The products were then purified and amplified (14 PCR cycles) to create the final cDNA libraries. After library validation and quantification, equimolar amounts of library were pooled. The pool was quantified using the Peqlab KAPA Library Quantification Kit and the Applied Biosystems 7900HT Sequence Detection System.

The resulting queries of CG numbers with hyperlinks to individual BDGP pages were then extracted and compiled into a database. Stage 4&#x02013;6 in situ hybridization images for each CG were examined and annotated with an appropriate primary localization. The following localization terms were used: Extraembryonic (dorsal expression), Dorsal Ectoderm (dorsolateral localization), Ectoderm (lateral localization), Ventral Ectoderm (ventrolateral localization), Mesoderm (ventral midline localization), and Endoderm (anterior/posterior localization corresponding to mouth/anus precursors). An additional localization term, Complex, was used for genes with multiple localizations of equal expression. Genes not localized along the DV axis (Gap, Pair-rule, Segmental, ubiquitous, unlocalized, etc.) were removed from the database. Additionally, DV regulated genes detected by Stathopoulos et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] were compiled into this database, resulting in a total of 278 genes. Each gene was then examined in greater detail by searching its CG number on flybase.org. Gene names, symbols, and molecular function were collected. Specific molecular functions referenced by flybase were then organized into the following broader molecular function categories: Membrane Proteins, Transcription Factors, Signaling, Catalytic Enzymes, Proteases, Kinases, Structural, Protein Binding, RNA Binding, DNA Binding, Ion Binding. Genes with no &#x0201c;Experimental Evidence&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;Predictions/Assertions&#x0201d; were categorized under the term Unknown.

These Nasvi numbers were then used to search within the RNA-RNAseq data to determine if each ortholog was differentially expressed.

Genes whose expression was significantly altered in at least one RNAi case fell into seven classes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Genes expressed all along the DV axis were detected, as well as some unexpected patterns at the anteroposterior (AP) poles and in the primordial germ cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Many distinct molecular functions were present among the detected genes. Transcription factors were predominant, followed by membrane proteins, protein-binding proteins, and proteins of unknown function (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).

Some of these are Hymenoptera specific, whereas others are conserved within the vertebrates but have been lost in the fly lineage. These findings will be further described and discussed below. The initial description of the results is organized around the region of embryonic expression of the genes, because the nature of many of the patterns gives insights into how the <italic>Nasonia</italic> patterning system operates.

It remained strongly expressed in the serosa cells as they encapsulated the embryo (not shown).

Particularly interesting were ankyrin domain-containing genes that also posses the so-called PRANC (Pox proteins Repeats of ANkyrin, C-terminal) domain. PRANC-containing genes appear to have originated in poxviruses, where one of the functions of the PRANC domain is to manipulate the NF-kB function of eukaryotic hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].

A similar pattern of apparent loss of the PRANC domains is also observed in poxviruses themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. It is not clear how many horizontal transfers are responsible for the current array of more than 250 ankyrin domain-containing genes, but clearly gene duplication played a major role in amplifying this gene family.</p><p>We found a single ankyrin domain-containing gene, <italic>Nasvi2EG004500</italic>, expressed ventrally in a broad, dynamic domain that was similar to genes such as <italic>Nv-twi</italic> or <italic>Nv-sna</italic>. However, expression of this gene remained pole to pole, instead of taking on the typical slug-shape of the presumptive mesoderm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>). Two genes (<italic>Nasvi2EG006715</italic> and <italic>Nasvi2EG001594</italic> and) were broadly expressed laterally, with a more intensely staining &#x0201c;gap-like&#x0201d; domain near the head primordium (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b, c</xref>). One ankyrin domain protein was expressed in two broad stripes that were repressed on the dorsal side (<italic>Nasvi2EG001954</italic>, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8d</xref>), while another was broadly expressed but repressed in a wide ventral domain (<italic>Nasvi2EG005791</italic>, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8e</xref>). Three genes were expressed on the dorsal side of the embryo. One (<italic>Nasvi2EG001522</italic>, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8f</xref>) was expressed broadly at the poles, and in a narrow stripe in the main trunk of the embryo. Another (<italic>Nasvi2EG002650</italic>, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8g</xref>) was highly expressed at the extreme poles (anterior domain out of focus) of the embryo, and in an incomplete stripe along the dorsal midline.

Given the similarity of these 10 genes, we propose that in the process of gene family amplification, some of the paralogs may have lost the PRANC domain, while maintaining a core characteristic ankyrin repeat domain.

However, there were a few genes whose normal expression patterns were not predicted by their behavior in the RNAi analyses. Two of these genes, the <italic>Nasonia</italic> homologs of a modulator of BMP protein signaling, <italic>twisted gastrulation</italic> (<italic>Nv</italic>-<italic>tsg2</italic>), and a G2 checkpoint kinase, <italic>wee1</italic> (<italic>Nv-wee1</italic>), exhibited dorsal expression patterns (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9a, d</xref>). A reduction in transcript levels after BMP knockdown (by ~50 % and 20 % respectively, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>) is consistent with the observed dorsal expression pattern; however, increases in transcript levels after Toll knockdown were also observed (by ~50 % and 60 %, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). This result was unexpected, as up until this point, all dorsally expressed genes had been observed to act independently of Toll regulation. To better elucidate the regulation of these two genes, in situ hybridization experiments of these transcripts were performed on BMP- and Toll knockdown embryos. In wt embryos, <italic>Nv-tsg2</italic> was expressed in a broad dorsal domain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9a</xref>).

Expression decreased markedly after Toll knockdown (by ~80 %, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>) and only slightly decreased after BMP knockdown (by ~10 %, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>), leading to the prediction that this novel gene should have an expression pattern localized to the ventral half of the embryo. However, only half of the wild-type embryos examined showed a ventral pattern, while the other half showed a dorsally localized pattern (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9g, j&#x02013;o</xref>). This ratio was maintained in every stage from the first few nuclear divisions up through germband elongation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9j-o</xref>). No correlation to sex was observed, since eggs from virgin females (all males) and from fertilized females (normally a 9:1 female to male ratio) showed the same 50/50 ratios of dorsal and ventrally expressed <italic>Nasvi2EG010608</italic> (data not shown).</p><p>Again, in situ hybridization experiments of these transcripts were performed in the two knockdown conditions. In BMP knockdown embryos, expression was reduced to a slightly smaller ventral (not shown) or dorsal (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9h</xref>) domain. In Toll knockdown embryos, expression expanded dramatically to near ubiquity, with weak or no expression along the ventral midline (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9i</xref>). While in situ data from the pRNAi embryos confirmed the slight reduction seen in the quantification of BMP knockdown expression levels compared to control, it seemed to contradict the reduced expression observed from the Toll RNAi-RNAseq analyses. Additionally, the in situ data failed to shed light on the variation of expression observed in wild-type embryos. Further experiments will be done to determine the cause of this dynamic expression pattern.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Limitations of the analysis</title><p>Nearly all of the genes that were known to be expressed in patterns along the DV axis of the <italic>Nasonia</italic> embryo were found with high confidence in our analysis. However, a few were overlooked in one or both of the DE analyses based on the two transcriptome annotations we used. The lateral portions of the embryo were always the clear weak point of our approach, as genes expressed in these regions were predicted to require low amounts of either Toll or BMP input, so would be least sensitive to reduction of these pathways. Thus, we were pleasantly surprised to be able to identify a large number of genes with specific lateral expression patterns. However, most of these were initially classified as marginal, and were largely at the edge of our statistical significance and fold change cutoffs. We would not be surprised to find that there may be additional laterally expressed genes, especially given that several genes known to have lateral patterns were not identified in our analyses.</p><p>Particularly striking was that <italic>Nv-brk</italic> was not found in either analysis. This gene is highly expressed laterally, and is clearly regulated by both Toll and BMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, the RNAseq approach can only detect changes in global levels of RNA expression, and not redistribution. Another known gene that did not appear in our analysis is <italic>Nv-ind</italic>, which is the most &#x0201c;lateral&#x0201d; member of the columnar gene group&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]&#x000a0;, and is expressed in a region furthest away from the peaks of activity of the two signaling pathways patterning the <italic>Nasonia</italic> DV axis, and thus may be insensitive to changes to one gradient or the other.</p><p>Another set of genes that might have been missed by our analysis is composed of genes that have multiple domains of expression, which reduces the overall magnitude of DE after single knockdowns. For example, the ventral domain of <italic>Nv-snail</italic> is strongly affected by <italic>Nv-Toll</italic> knockdown, but the magnitude of the expression difference between water and <italic>Nv-Toll</italic> expression were much less than for comparable genes like <italic>Nv-twi</italic>. This is likely due to high expression of <italic>Nv-sna</italic> in the yolk nuclei&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], which is not affected by <italic>Nv-Toll</italic> pRNAi. Similarly, genes expressed both ventrally and dorsally show reduced magnitudes of DE in the RNAi cases, and we propose that this explains why genes like <italic>Nv-tgf&#x003b1;</italic> were missed. These genes have late ventrolateral expression similar to (but temporally delayed relative to) <italic>Nv-vnd</italic>, and dorsal stripes flanking the serosal domain&#x000a0;(JAL, personal observation). Toll pRNAi has a relatively weak input into genes expressed like <italic>Nv-vnd</italic> (compared to those in the mesoderm), so the magnitude of change is likely to less than 100 % on the ventral side. This in combination with a significant amount of remaining expression on the dorsal side could lead to an overall reduction below our ~1.5&#x000d7; cutoff. In BMP knockdown, the same factors are in play with the additional caveat that the ventral domain of this type of gene could increase, offsetting the reduction of mRNA produced on the dorsal side.</p><p>Finally, errors and omissions in the genome sequence, assembly, or annotation can lead to some genes being missed. Despite all of this, given the large number of genes that were detected, we believe the vast majority of the participants in the <italic>Nasonia</italic> DV GRN have been identified.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Comparison to <italic>Drosophila</italic></title><p>A similar experiment was conducted in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, using microarray technology to detect DE of transcripts along the entire DV axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Many novel insights were gained in that study (and subsequent ones taking different technological or methodological approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]), including the discovery of new FGF pathway ligands. In addition, comprehensive analyses of embryonic gene expression identified further genes expressed in different patterns along the axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. The evolutionary significance of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> work was until recently not entirely clear, as it represented a single comprehensive data point. With our data, and the basal position of <italic>Nasonia</italic> within the Holometabola, we can now begin to propose a conserved core set of tissue specification genes for mesoderm, ectoderm, and extraembryonic tissues, as well as generate hypotheses about novel gains and losses of genes from the DV patterning GRN within the Holometabola.</p><p>The transcription factors Twist, Snail, Six4, and Zinc Finger Homeodomain; the FGF signaling components Stumps and Breathless; the axon guidance molecule Netrin; and the integrin Inflated are conserved mesoderm factors between <italic>Nasonia</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Eight transcription factors (Vnd, Sim, Sox-N, Bowl, TFIIF1, Msh, Brk, Ind) and another integrin (Multiple Edematous Wings, <italic>mew</italic>) have conserved ectodermal expression patterns. In the extraembryonic and dorsal embryonic region, 11 genes have conserved expression. This includes six transcription factors (Tail-up, Grain, Pannier, Dorsocross, Zen, and Araucan), two BMP modulators (Crossveinless-2 and Twisted Gastrulation), the immunoglobulin domain protein CG43462<italic>,</italic> the membrane-bound signaling molecule Semaphorin5c, and the enzyme RACE. In total, 18 of the 28 conserved genes are transcription factors. This is consistent with a model in which specific transcription factors have conserved roles in specifying tissue fates that are broadly conserved in evolution. On the other hand, molecules involved in cell structure and behavior are less evolutionary stable, as the behaviors of, and interactions among, embryonic tissues change much more frequently than the presence of the tissue itself.</p><p>To better understand how our <italic>Nasonia</italic> results compare to what is known in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we compiled a list of 278 genes with distinct expression along the DV axis of the fly embryo at the late blastoderm stage, combining the microarray, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, and high-throughput in situ data available in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref> and Methods for how this list was generated). This list is likely to be more comprehensive than the set of confirmed DV expressed genes we have found in <italic>Nasonia</italic> and likely includes expression patterns and levels that we excluded from our analysis. For example, some genes with significant DE after RNAi were excluded from our analysis due to very low FPKM values in wild type. A handful of <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologs of such genes have DV expression, indicating that this class of lowly expressed genes may be a fruitful source of DV patterning genes in future analyses in <italic>Nasonia</italic>. Overall, this analysis showed again that there is a large divergence in DV expressed genes between wasp and fly, as only 35/278 genes with patterned DV expression in fly have homologs that show DE in at least one comparison in our <italic>Nasonia</italic> data.</p><p>Sixty-six (23&#x000a0;%) of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> DV genes have no clear <italic>Nasonia</italic> homologs, which is similar to the 18 % of <italic>Nasonia</italic> genes without clear fly orthologs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>).Twenty-four of the 66 (36&#x000a0;%) are only found in diptera, and 17 of these 24 are found only within the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lineage and its close fly relatives. This is in strong contrast to what we found in <italic>Nasonia,</italic> where 17 of the 23 genes without fly orthologs are unique to the Hymenoptera, and 14 of these 17 are so far only found in <italic>Nasonia</italic>. It remains to be seen if these differences in lineage-specific novelty reflect a true difference in evolutionary pattern, or if it is an artifact of different levels of sampling between the two lineages.</p><p>Five of the genes without <italic>Nasonia</italic> orthologs are found in Coleoptera and/or Lepidoptera, indicating that these genes originated after the split between Hymenoptera and the rest of the holometabolan lineage. The remaining 37 of the 66 <italic>Drosophila</italic> DV genes without <italic>Nasonia</italic> homologs (13&#x000a0;% overall) provisionally represent wasp lineage gene losses. This is more than two-fold higher than the ~5&#x000a0;% of <italic>Nasonia</italic> DV genes whose lack of fly homologs is due to loss along the fly lineage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Comparison to the beetle <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic></title><p>A conceptually similar experiment was recently published for the beetle <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Given the quite different blastoderm fate map in <italic>Tribolium</italic>, and the fact that much DV patterning takes place well after gastrulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], direct comparisons with <italic>Nasonia</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> are not straightforward. Despite this difficulty, the <italic>Tribolium</italic> experiments identified several new conserved insect DV components: the transcription factor ZFHD, the integrin Inflated, the FGF signaling component Dof, and the Notch pathway component Uif. Further in-depth comparisons among wasp, beetle, and fly will begin to give a clearer understanding of how embryonic patterning networks have evolved among the holometabolous insects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have shown here that, apart from a conserved core of mostly transcription factors, the GRNs for DV patterning and early morphogenesis have diverged significantly between the wasp <italic>Nasonia</italic> and the fly <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This fits well with the observations that both the upstream patterning networks, and the downstream morphogenetic events of gastrulation are quite divergent. At present we cannot tell which network is more representative of the ancestral state of the Holometabola, or indeed whether they are both highly divergent. With the advent of increasingly cost-effective large-scale sequencing technologies, and broadly applicable functional approaches, many more taxa can be sampled and characterized at a deep level. This should allow hypothesis of the pattern and direction of phylogenetic change to be tested robustly. Our observation that many lineage restricted genes have been incorporated into the <italic>Nasonia</italic> DV GRN raises the question of whether such novelty is a common feature of developmental patterning systems, and what role, if any, natural selection plays in setting up the early body plan. Again, broad and deep sampling of taxa at varying phylogenetic distances can shed light on this question and should be a high priority research area where insects can make a uniquely powerful contribution.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec27"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12915_2016_285_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Methods: Compilation of scripts used in TopHat and Cufflinks analyses.
