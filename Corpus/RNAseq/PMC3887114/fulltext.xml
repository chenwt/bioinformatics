KSHV reactivation from latency and virion production is dependent on efficient transcription of over eighty lytic cycle genes and viral DNA replication. CTCF and cohesin, cellular proteins that cooperatively regulate gene expression and mediate long-range DNA interactions, have been shown to bind at specific sites in herpesvirus genomes. CTCF and cohesin regulate KSHV gene expression during latency and may also control lytic reactivation, although their role in lytic gene expression remains incompletely characterized. Here, we analyze the dynamic changes in CTCF and cohesin binding that occur during the process of KSHV viral reactivation and virion production by high resolution chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and show that both proteins dissociate from viral genomes in kinetically and spatially distinct patterns. By utilizing siRNAs to specifically deplete CTCF and Rad21, a cohesin component, we demonstrate that both proteins are potent restriction factors for KSHV replication, with cohesin knockdown leading to hundred-fold increases in viral yield. High-throughput RNA sequencing was used to characterize the transcriptional effects of CTCF and cohesin depletion, and demonstrated that both proteins have complex and global effects on KSHV lytic transcription. Specifically, both proteins act as positive factors for viral transcription initially but subsequently inhibit KSHV lytic transcription, such that their net effect is to limit KSHV RNA accumulation. Cohesin is a more potent inhibitor of KSHV transcription than CTCF but both proteins are also required for efficient transcription of a subset of KSHV genes. These data reveal novel effects of CTCF and cohesin on transcription from a relatively small genome that resemble their effects on the cellular genome by acting as gene-specific activators of some promoters, but differ in acting as global negative regulators of transcription.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a human virus that causes Kaposi's sarcoma and lymphoma. KSHV establishes a lifelong infection in B lymphocytes, and persists in a latent form as circular DNA molecules. Reactivation and replication yield infectious virions, allowing transmission and maintenance of latent infection. The cellular mechanisms controlling reactivation remain incompletely characterized. Host proteins that regulate RNA transcription play an important role in controlling viral reactivation. In this study, we used high-throughput techniques to analyze the binding of two cellular proteins, CTCF and Rad21, to the KSHV genome as the virus reactivated to produce infectious virions. We found that these proteins dissociate from the latent genome when reactivation occurs. We also found that depleting cells of these proteins increases virus production as much as a hundredfold. Depleting the cell of CTCF or Rad21 caused complex changes in the synthesis of RNAs by KSHV, with the amounts of most KSHV RNAs increasing greatly. We also showed that Rad21 and CTCF are needed for the virus to synthesize RNAs efficiently. Our study provides new insights into how the cell uses CTCF and Rad21 to limit KSHV's ability to synthesize RNA and reactivate from latency to produce infectious virus.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Public Health Service grant CA-81133 and CA-119905 from the National Cancer Institute.

KSHV maintains a persistent latent infection as an episome in B lymphocytes, from which it occasionally reactivates, enters a lytic cycle of replication, and produces infectious virions. Released virions infect other lymphocytes to maintain the latent reservoir or are transmitted from person-to-person in saliva. Cell-mediated immunity is essential for limiting KSHV reactivation and pathogenesis, but cellular epigenetic regulatory mechanisms may also play an important role in limiting viral replication. The balance between lytic and latent infection is an important determinant of pathogenicity.</p><p>Lytic herpesvirus reactivation, while often more common in states of immunosuppression, is nevertheless apparently stochastic, and may occur quite variably among fully immunocompetent individuals <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Hadinoto1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Lytic replication and viral gene expression are important in pathogenesis for several reasons. First, expansion of the reservoir of infected cells is at least partly dependent on recurrent reactivation of human gammaherpesviruses. Thus long-term acyclovir suppression of lytic replication led to a significant decrease over time in the latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) load in B lymphocytes of immunocompetent patients <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Hoshino1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Second, lytic replication and gene expression appears to contribute to oncogenesis in several settings where even a minority of infected cells is permissive for lytic replication <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1003880-Staskus1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Several lytic KSHV gene products have anti-apoptotic, proliferative or immunosuppressive properties, increasing the likelihood of malignant transformation by paracrine and autocrine mechanisms <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Moore1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Cesarman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The role of lytic replication in oncogenesis is supported by the decreased incidence of KS in KSHV infected individuals who received long-term antiviral therapy for other infections <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Understanding the basic mechanisms by which the host cell maintains control of lytic viral replication and viral strategies to overcome such control is therefore central to devising novel therapies aimed at these control points.</p><p>Host proteins that play multiple roles in chromatin organization, transcriptional regulation and chromosome segregation have recently been shown to also bind herpesvirus genomes at specific sites and regulate gene expression <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Amelio1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1003880-Tempera1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. CTCF is an 11 zinc finger sequence-specific DNA binding protein with roles in transcription activation and repression, gene insulation, enhancer blocking and long range chromatin interactions <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Gause1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. CTCF binds to between 14,000 to 20,000 sites in the human genome and is functionally important in regulation of several hundred genes based on knockdown studies <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1003880-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Initial studies suggested that CTCF exerted activating or repressing effects on promoters by direct binding in the manner of classic transcription factors <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Filippova1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, its role in global gene regulatory functions was demonstrated by its ability to block enhancer function when interposed between enhancer elements and target promoters <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Subsequent studies have shown that CTCF binding mediates insulation throughout the human genome <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Cuddapah1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In addition, CTCF may act as a barrier element, demarcating regions of heterochromatin and open chromatin, thereby isolating areas of low and high transcriptional activity. Based on binding studies delineating intra-chromosomal interactions, CTCF mediates three dimensional chromatin structure via long-range interactions.</p><p>Cohesin, a complex of four proteins, SMC1, SMC3, SCC1/Rad21 and SA1/2, essential for chromatid segregation, has also been recognized as a global regulator of transcription (for a review, see reference <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Dorsett1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>). The four proteins form a ring-shaped structure that encloses chromatids. Several other proteins are associated with cohesin, and regulate the dynamic association of cohesin with chromatin as it is sequentially loaded and dissociated from chromosomes during mitosis and segregation. Specificity of cohesin localization is complex and likely mediated by multiple proteins including NIPBL, mediator, transcription factors and CTCF. Thus while cohesin binds to many CTCF sites, it also binds to sites on the genome independently of CTCF. Although cohesin may have both positive and negative effects on transcription, many of its effects are thought to be mediated by facilitating and stabilizing long-range interactions between promoters and enhancers to which it binds. The most likely mechanism is that cohesin causes topological linking of DNA sequences <italic>in cis</italic> similar to its role in chromatid linkage <italic>in trans</italic>. Cohesin also is involved in regulation of polII pausing at promoters and relieves pausing, promoting RNA elongation <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Schaaf1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>CTCF and cohesin bind at distinct sites on herpesvirus genomes, including herpes simplex virus, EBV and KSHV. CTCF has been implicated in regulating gene expression during latent EBV infection by mechanisms that likely involve both insulator function and modification of genome conformation by causing formation of intragenomic loops <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Tempera1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. During KSHV infection in primary effusion lymphoma cells, both cohesin and CTCF play a regulatory role in latent and possibly lytic gene expression <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1003880-Stedman1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Chromosome conformation capture assays have demonstrated that a cohesin/CTCF site in the 5&#x02032; region of the major latency KSHV transcript forms contacts with a site close to the primary gene necessary for lytic reactivation (ORF50/RTA) and with the 3&#x02032; region of the latency region. <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Mutation of the CTCF site led to increased latency gene expression, suggesting that CTCF and cohesin play a repressive role in latent gene expression. Interestingly however, deletion of this site also led to a loss of stable viral episome maintenance.</p><p>Although knockdown of cohesin components led to increased transcription of lytic genes in PEL cells, depletion of CTCF had virtually no such effect <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Conversely, mutation of the CTCF site, which would be predicted to disrupt both cohesin and CTCF binding, led to decreased lytic gene expression. In this study, we have performed a detailed analysis of the role of cohesin and CTCF in regulating KSHV lytic replication. By employing siRNAs specific for CTCF and cohesin, we have explored their role in regulating KSHV lytic replication. Using ChIP-Seq, we have defined at high resolution the dynamic changes in cohesin and CTCF binding that occur during lytic KSHV replication and reactivation from latency. The distinct regulatory roles of cohesin and CTCF have also been further defined by transcriptional profiling of infected cells undergoing lytic replication under conditions of cohesin and CTCF depletion. These studies reveal novel mechanisms of gene regulation by CTCF and cohesin during KSHV replication and establish their role as host restriction factors for KSHV replication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cells and plasmids</title><p>293 and 293T cells were grown at 37&#x000b0;C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and glutamine. iSLK cells <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Myoung1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> were maintained in DMEM containing 10% charcoal stripped FBS (Sigma) and glutamine with 250 &#x000b5;g/ml neomycin and 1 &#x000b5;g/ml puromycin. iSLK cells were infected with WT KSHV derived from bacmid BAC16, expressing eGFP and hygromycin resistance <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Brulois1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.

Highly efficient CTCF depletion was achieved by lipid-mediated transfection of iSLK cells with siRNA specific for CTCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003880-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In order to assess the effect of CTCF depletion on KSHV reactivation and virion production, cells were transfected with either CTCF-specific siRNA or control siRNA and treated with doxycycline 48 hours later. KSHV reactivation was allowed to proceed and virion-containing supernatant was harvested 120 hours after induction of lytic replication with doxycycline. Infectious virus production was measured by infection of 293 cells with serial dilutions of virus supernatant followed by flow cytometry of infected cells. Virus titer in the supernatant can thus be accurately quantitated as GFP-transducing units.

Our experiments suggested that CTCF might also repress KSHV lytic genes, leading to increased virus production when CTCF was completely depleted. In order to determine if the increased KSHV replication observed when CTCF was knocked down in SLK cells might be due to transcriptional mechanisms, we assessed changes in mRNA levels of representative KSHV lytic genes by qPCR after CTCF knockdown. Cells were transfected with CTCF or control siRNA and cellular RNA was isolated 48 h after lytic replication was induced as previously described. While ORF57 (early) and ORF6 (early) lytic mRNA expression were enhanced approximately four-fold by CTCF depletion, there was a less significant increase in other early (ORF59) or late (ORF25) lytic mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003880-g002">Figure 2</xref> A&#x02013;D).

Since CTCF appeared to play a role in restricting productive KSHV replication, it seemed likely that CTCF dissociation from one or more sites might occur upon lytic reactivation. A comprehensive analysis of dynamic changes in CTCF binding during reactivation from latency has not been previously performed. We therefore performed ChIP-Seq studies on iSLK cells at serial times after induction of lytic replication to characterize CTCF binding to the KSHV genome during the process of reactivation from latency. It should be noted that the system employed in these studies does not require sodium butyrate or other chemical inducers, which have broad effects on gene expression and epigenetic state. Rather, induction of lytic KSHV replication in iSLK cells relies solely on transcriptional activation by KSHV RTA. After treatment with doxycycline to induce RTA expression and lytic replication, we harvested cells at 0, 3 and 5 days after induction. Cells were treated with formaldehyde to cross-link DNA and protein, followed by DNA fragmentation and immunoprecipitation with anti-CTCF antibody. Immunoprecipitated DNA and input DNA were then analyzed by high-throughput DNA sequencing. The results, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003880-g003">Figure 3</xref>, reveal several important aspects of dynamic CTCF changes during KSHV reactivation. First, the high resolution map provided by the deep sequencing identifies at least thirty distinct areas of CTCF localization during latency. All contain high-probability sequence motifs and are consistent with previously published literature <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Stedman1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Ziebarth1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Second, there are clearly broad regions in which CTCF binding decreases as lytic replication progresses. Importantly, however, wholesale eviction of CTCF from the genome does not occur. Rather, binding at most sites in the latency gene locus, from approximately nt 117,000 to the 3&#x02032; end of the genome remains preserved (blue bar). Similarly, binding at the major CTCF site at approximately nt 52,000 (red arrow) is also maintained. Further evidence of the site-specific nature of these dynamic changes in CTCF binding is evident at another site (blue arrow) where CTCF occupancy is maintained despite its loss at neighboring sites.</p><fig id="ppat-1003880-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1003880.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Changes in CTCF binding to the KSHV genome during KSHV reactivation and lytic replication.</title><p>ChIP-SEQ assays were performed on cell samples obtained at 0, 3, and 5 d after induction of lytic KSHV replication in iSLK cells.

Since CTCF depletion alone led to greatly increased KSHV virion production, and cohesin is known to bind to many CTCF sites, it was of interest to determine the effect of cohesin disruption on KSHV replication in our system. Cohesin is a complex of four core proteins, SMC1, SMC3, SCC1/Rad21 and SA1/2 that encloses chromatids and may act to facilitate intrachromosomal looping.

We therefore performed a ChIP-seq analysis of Rad21 localization analogous to that conducted for CTCF. KSHV-infected iSLK cells were treated with doxycycline, and DNA was harvested for ChIP at 0, 3 and 5 days post-induction. Several significant differences between Rad21 and CTCF binding were immediately revealed by the ChIP-Seq analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003880-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Comparison with the previously described CTCF experiment demonstrates that there are twelve major peaks of Rad21 binding, significantly fewer than for CTCF. These are consistent with previously identified cohesin-binding sites but include at least one additional novel Rad21 binding locus at nt 28819&#x02013;29553 (24,26). In addition, the profile of Rad21 differs from that of CTCF, with most peaks being much narrower, and the relative ratios of the major peaks differing from those of CTCF. Finally, and most interestingly, the eviction of Rad21 was much more rapid and generalized. Thus residual Rad21 binding at 72 h was only detectable at the two loci centered at approximately nucleotides 124,000 and 136,000, whereas the loss of CTCF binding was more gradual, and fully evident only by 5 days, in addition to being more site-specific. At 72 h, the input KSHV DNA copy number was only increased by 2.5 fold when measured by qPCR or estimated by viral read number in the ChIP-seq input samples, whereas Rad21 binding was absent at most sites.

Rad21 depletion led to significantly greater increases in KSHV yield, suggesting that Rad21 and CTCF might have unique effects on the transcription of KSHV lytic genes. In order to perform a comprehensive analysis and comparison of the effects of CTCF and Rad21 on the KSHV transcriptional profile, we performed high-throughput deep sequencing of mRNA from KSHV-infected cells in which either CTCF or Rad21 was depleted prior to induction of lytic replication. KSHV-infected iSLK cells were transfected with either control siRNA, CTCF siRNA or Rad21 siRNA as was done in the experiments to examine the effect on virion production. 48 hours after siRNA transfection, cells were treated with doxycycline to induce KSHV lytic replication, and cells were harvested at 24 and 48 hours after induction of replication. RNA was isolated, oligo-dT selected, and processed for deep sequencing. The effects of both CTCF and Rad21 knockdown on lytic cycle transcription were compared to each other and to the transcriptional profile of induced cells transfected with control siRNA.

The first somewhat surprising finding is that transcription of most KSHV genes actually decreases at 24 hours in the CTCF and Rad21 depleted cells compared to control. This is particularly evident in the CTCF-KD case, but is reduced overall by either CTCF-KD or Rad21-KD, suggesting that CTCF and Rad21 initially act as positive factors in lytic gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003880-g006">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003880.s003">Figure S3</xref>). However, by 48 hours, lytic transcription of most genes is increased compared to control when CTCF is depleted. This biphasic effect on KSHV transcription was also evident upon Rad21 KD, with levels of the majority of lytic transcripts being increased by 48 hours. The ultimate enhancing effect of Rad21 on lytic gene transcription was even more pronounced than that of CTCF depletion, demonstrating that the two proteins have similar but distinct effects on lytic gene transcription.</p><fig id="ppat-1003880-g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1003880.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Effect of CTCF and Rad21 depletion on the KSHV lytic gene transcriptional profile defined by RNA-Seq.</title><p>A.

The mean fold-change in early gene transcript levels was 3.3+/&#x02212;2.1 S.D versus 4.5+/&#x02212;1.2 S.D. for late genes.</p><p>Comparison of CTCF KD and Rad21 KD also demonstrates that these differences in the magnitude of the Rad21 versus CTCF effects were not uniform across the genome, i.e. there were specific individual differences in mRNA abundance due to CTCF KD versus Rad21 KD. This is most clearly evident in two such regions highlighted by black bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003880-g006">Figure 6A</xref>. These regions, which include the vIRF genes and ORF65, ORF66, ORF67 and ORF67A, demonstrate decreased expression with CTCF KD and increased expression with Rad21 KD.</p><p>A third group of genes was also readily evident in the comparison of transcriptomes generated from CTCF-depleted and Rad21-depleted cells. This group consisted of genes whose abundance decreased with CTCF and Rad21 KD at 24 h and remained depressed compared to control at 48 h, suggesting that unlike the majority of genes, they are particularly dependent on CTCF and Rad21 for efficient expression. This group of genes in two clusters (denoted by blue bars, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003880-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) includes K2,K4, K5, K6, K7, ORF68 and ORF69 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003880-g006">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003880-g006">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>The magnitude of the overall changes in transcription of individual lytic genes due to CTCF or Rad21 knockdown were reproducible but relatively modest (2&#x02013;8 fold over control) compared with the increases observed in virion production under the same conditions. At least 18 million reads were measured for each sample in the RNA-Seq analyses, which should allow accurate quantification of mRNA levels for all KSHV transcripts, which are abundantly expressed during lytic replication <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Blencowe1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. We therefore performed qPCR for selected mRNA targets to validate and confirm the RNASeq data. ORF57 is representative of the vast majority of genes whose expression was similarly upregulated by both CTCF and Rad21 KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003880-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). The increase in ORF57 expression measured by qPCR upon CTCF or Rad21 KD was approximately 3.6 fold over control, which correlates well with the increases measured by RNASeq (4 fold). A second group of genes that were differentially regulated by CTCF and Rad21 is represented by vIRF1 and ORF47. Expression of both genes was not significantly changed by CTCF KD but was upregulated 5-fold by Rad21 KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003880-g007">Figure 7B and 7C</xref>). The third group of genes, those whose expression was reduced by both CTCF KD and Rad21 KD, and are thus dependent on CTCF and Rad21 for expression, is represented by K2 and K5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003880-g007">Figure 7D and 7E</xref>). Expression of both genes was confirmed to be reduced to 20% of control by both CTCF and Rad21 KD.</p><fig id="ppat-1003880-g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1003880.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Effects of Rad21 or CTCF knockdown on expression of specific KSHV genes.</title><p>CTCF or Rad21 knockdown was performed in iSLK cells with siRNAs specific for CTCF (CTCF Si) or Rad21 (Rad21 Si).

In order to determine whether ORF50 levels were altered by CTCF or Rad21 KD, and thereby responsible for some of the observed transcriptional changes, we directly measured ORF50 protein levels at the same time points at which RNA-Seq was performed. Immunoblotting of protein lysates from cells at 24 hrs and 48 hrs after induction of lytic replication revealed no significant increases in ORF50 protein levels when either CTCF or Rad21 depletion was carried out prior to induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003880-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). In fact, a slight decrease in ORF50 protein was observed at 48 h in all cases. In order to address the possibility that CTCF or Rad21 might inhibit ORF50 function per se, we conducted the following experiment in which we asked whether CTCF or Rad21 KD affects the ability of ORF50 to activate RTA-responsive promoters in KSHV-negative cells. We performed luciferase assays with cells transfected with an RTA-responsive reporter plasmid and an RTA expression plasmid after either CTCF, Rad21 or control KD. The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003880-g008">Figure 8C</xref>, demonstrate that CTCF and Rad21 do not inhibit RTA function in the reporter assay. Rather CTCF or Rad21 depletion actually resulted in slightly decreased RTA activation function. These results together demonstrate that the global effects of CTCF and Rad21 on KSHV lytic gene expression are not likely to be mediated via effects on RTA expression or function.</p><fig id="ppat-1003880-g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1003880.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Lack of CTCF or Rad21 effect on ORF50/RTA levels or ORF50/RTA activation function.</title><p>A.

First, both CTCF and Rad21 act as host restriction factors for lytic KSHV replication as depletion of either protein resulted in markedly increased production of infectious virions. Rad21 appears to exert a greater effect, as Rad21 knockdown resulted in nearly 100-fold increases in virus yield, approximately five times more than the increase caused by CTCF knockdown. We also demonstrate that both CTCF and Rad21 dissociate from viral genomes during the process of lytic KSHV replication. Rad21 binding is lost earlier and more completely than CTCF after lytic KSHV replication begins. The almost complete loss of Rad21 from the majority of KSHV genome sites indicates eviction from latent episomes early during lytic replication as well as a lack of binding to newly replicated genomes. Conversely, the persistence of Rad21 at the major latency region and the terminal repeats indicates that Rad21 not only remains bound to template genomes but that it binds to nascently replicated genomes at these two sites. CTCF also exhibited site-specific changes in KSHV genome occupancy during lytic replication. CTCF occupancy was decreased by 3 days, and by 5 days, the relative occupancy at most sites was reduced by over 50%, indicating that CTCF binding also does not occur to newly replicated genomes at these locations. The finding that CTCF depletion results in increased virus production is in contrast to those of Chen et. al. who did not observe any effects of CTCF knockdown on KSHV lytic transcription in PEL cells <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. These differences may be due to the different cell lines employed, and to the fact that knockdown in the our experiments was essentially complete, with no detectable CTCF remaining at the time of lytic induction.</p><p>Our findings that cohesin and CTCF may play distinct roles in regulating KSHV reactivation and virion production are mirrored by the differing effects of their knockdown on KSHV lytic gene transcription. Consistent with the more profound effects of Rad21 KD on virion production, Rad 21 depletion consistently led to greater increases in KSHV lytic gene expression than did CTCF KD. Further, depletion of the two proteins had distinguishable effects on the lytic transcriptional profile. Whereas Rad21 KD led to increases in several vIRF gene transcript levels, compared to control, CTCF KD led to decreases or no change in this subset of mRNAs. A similar pattern was observed in several other specific genes, highlighting the complexity of overlapping gene regulation by CTCF and cohesin.</p><p>Another novel finding in our study is the kinetic profile of the effects of CTCF and Rad21 on lytic gene transcription. Upon induction of KSHV replication, lytic gene transcription increased several orders of magnitude at 24 hours, as expected, and increased further at 48 hours. When CTCF or Rad21 were depleted, the increases in lytic gene transcription were significantly depressed at 24 hours compared to control. This relative decrease in lytic transcription was reversed by 48 hours, when CTCF KD, and particularly Rad21 KD, resulted in greater accumulation of lytic transcripts than in the presence of either protein. These data suggest that at baseline, CTCF and cohesin act as stimulators of transcription of many KSHV lytic genes but that their net effect, exerted subsequently, is negative, resulting in overall restriction of transcription and virus production. What is the likely mechanism of cohesin and CTCF gene activation, followed by inhibition? It has been suggested that cohesin binding to the promoter region of ORF50/RTA and secondary interactions with cohesin bound at the latency promoter have a repressive effect on ORF50 expression, which is required for lytic reactivation, thus acting as a proximal inhibitor of lytic transcription <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Our data suggest that the effects of cohesin on KSHV lytic gene transcription are more complex and global. First, lytic replication was initiated by expression of RTA <italic>in trans</italic>, essentially removing RTA as a limiting factor for lytic transcription. In addition, total levels of RTA protein were not affected by CTCF or Rad21 depletion. Finally, depletion of cohesin and CTCF actually resulted in less accumulation of KSHV transcripts at early times. These data are consistent with cohesin and CTCF initially acting as general stimulators of KSHV lytic transcription, similar to cohesin's effect on host cell genes <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Schaaf1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Dorsett2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Cohesin appears to stimulate transcription from promoters of genes to which it is bound by facilitating the transition from paused RNA polII to elongating polII <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Schaaf1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Fay1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. In addition, cohesin increases polII occupancy at genes to which it binds, most likely by increasing enhancer-promoter contact via looping. Importantly, however, depletion of cohesin also decreases transcription at most genes which do not bind cohesin and do not contain paused promoters, likely due to cohesin effects on basal and specific transcription factors <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Schaaf1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Rhodes1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. It is this latter mechanism which is most likely responsible for the globally decreased KSHV transcription seen at earlier times after cohesin depletion in our studies. The mechanisms by which CTCF and cohesin regulate herpesvirus transcription are likely to be significantly different from those operative on the human genome as herpesvirus lytic genes are virtually all unspliced and in close proximity to each other. Thus facilitation of enhancer-promoter interaction may be less important in regulation of herpesvirus transcription by cohesin. Combined with the relatively limited number of high density cohesin sites on the KSHV genome, the positive effects of cohesin on early lytic gene transcription are likely due to the indirect effects of cohesin on cellular transcription factors referred to above.</p><p>What is the likely basis of the subsequent enhancing effects of cohesin depletion on lytic gene expression and RNA accumulation? A possible mechanism is suggested by the requirement for DNA replication <italic>in cis</italic> for efficient transcription of late lytic herpesvirus promoters. The positive effects of DNA replication <italic>in cis</italic> on transcription may derive from topological changes facilitating access to transcription factors as well as relocalization of genomes to intranuclear replication compartments <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Amon1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1003880-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. It is possible that the physical linkages between cohesin molecules at various sites on circular latent genomes constrain the molecule, limiting maximal transcription. The more robust effect of Rad21 depletion on transcription, and especially virus production, suggest that the linking effects of cohesin may be more important in this regard than CTCF. It also implies that cohesin binding, although coincident with CTCF, may not be completely abrogated by removal of CTCF. The distinct and separable nature of cohesin and CTCF functions is underscored by the subtle but clear differences in the KSHV transcriptional profile exerted by their individual depletion.</p><p>An additional insight into the potential role of cohesin in regulating KSHV transcription is provided by an examination of the few genes whose transcript levels are depressed by cohesin depletion and remain suppressed at later times. These include several of the K transcripts, suggesting that they are particularly dependent on cohesin for their efficient expression. It is likely relevant that several of these same genes were previously identified as unique among KSHV genes in containing paused RNA polII at their promoters <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Toth1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. It has recently been demonstrated that cohesin is particularly important for transcription of eukaryotic promoters that contain paused RNA polII. Thus cohesin may play the same role at these particular KSHV promoters as it does at a subset of cellular promoters that contain paused RNA polII, facilitating transition to elongation <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Schaaf1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Whether such pausing also occurs at the other KSHV genes whose expression is adversely affected by cohesin depletion (e.g. ORF 68, ORF69) or if there are other promoter properties that determine cohesin dependence is an interesting avenue for further study.</p><p>In summary, CTCF and cohesin play distinct roles in regulating KSHV reactivation from latency at the level of mRNA transcription. Cohesin and CTCF appear to initially act as positive factors, facilitating transcription for the majority of KSHV lytic genes, but subsequently their presence limits transcription and virus production, potentially by topological effects on transcription. In contrast to its role in host cell gene regulation, cohesin may primarily play an inhibitory role in transcriptional control of the KSHV lytic cycle. With regards to its baseline stimulatory effects on transcription in KSHV, cohesin effects may primarily derive from global effects on transcription factors such as myc, as has been previously demonstrated with cellular promoters <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Schaaf1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Rhodes1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. It is less likely that cohesin stimulates transcription by facilitating long-range enhancer recruitment to specific promoters as observed in cellular eukaryotic systems <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Dorsett1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003880-Schaaf1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In addition, cohesin and CTCF appear to be required for activity of certain KSHV promoters that are particularly cohesin and CTCF-dependent, and these effects are possibly due to effects on paused RNA polII. During the process of KSHV virion production, cohesin, and to a lesser degree, CTCF, dissociate from latent KSHV genomes, implying a dynamic role for both in replication control. The importance of both proteins as host restriction factors regulating KSHV reactivation is demonstrated by the dramatic increases in virus yield that result from their depletion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1003880.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>KSHV virus production in cells depleted of Rad21 or CTCF with additional siRNA pools and negative control siRNAs.</bold> A.
