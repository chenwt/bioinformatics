Accumulating evidence has revealed a critical contribution by the Polycomb axis of epigenetic repression. However, a coherent understanding of the regulatory networks affected by Polycomb during gliomagenesis is still lacking. Here we integrate transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses to define Polycomb-dependent networks that promote gliomagenesis, validating them both in two independent mouse models and in a large cohort of human samples. We find that Polycomb dysregulation in gliomagenesis affects transcriptional networks associated with invasiveness and de-differentiation. The dissection of these networks uncovers <italic>Zfp423</italic> as a critical Polycomb-dependent transcription factor whose silencing negatively impacts survival. The anti-gliomagenic activity of <italic>Zfp423</italic> requires interaction with the SMAD proteins within the BMP signalling pathway, pointing to a novel synergic circuit through which Polycomb inhibits BMP signalling.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="i1" xlink:href="ncomms10753-i1.jpg"/>Polycomb-mediated gene regulation has been implicated in gliomas.

Trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3), catalysed by EZH2 or EZH1 within Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is both a major mechanism for the reversible maintenance of gene silencing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> and one of the few histone posttranslational modifications for which <italic>bona fide</italic> evidence supports a mechanism of propagation through cell division, thus providing the molecular basis for the maintenance of aberrant repressive chromatin during cancer growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. In particular, convergent lines of evidence implicate Polycomb developmental functions as critical nodes of dysregulation during tumorigenesis. First, the majority of genes that are hypermethylated in cancers on CpG promoters are pre-marked by H3K27me3 during development, corroborating the model in which PcG-dependent programmes that orchestrate normal development can be hijacked in cancer as templates for aberrant DNA methylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Second, inappropriate expression of PcG proteins was directly shown to fuel dedifferentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, and more recently the dynamic acquisition of the bivalent chromatin configuration featuring both H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, which has been associated to both embryonic and tissue-specific stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, was found to mediate the plastic interconversion, within the same tumour, of non-cancer stem cells into cancer stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p><p>Furthermore, and beyond the developmental aspects of its function, the PcG system has been also implicated in other cardinal features of tumorigenesis, including silencing of the INK4A-ARF-INK4B locus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, promotion of angiogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> and direct control of DNA replication<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p><p>However, we still lack a coherent understanding of the genome-wide circuits affected by Polycomb during tumorigenesis, a deficit that has grown more relevant with accumulating evidence that PcG members can play opposing roles in tumorigenesis. Besides the &#x02018;classical' oncogenic properties of EZH2 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), recent evidence has pointed also to a tumour suppressor role manifested through either inactivating mutations of PRC2 members<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> or histone mutations that were shown to inhibit PRC2 activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Indeed, in the case of glioblastoma (GBM), although EZH2 is very frequently overexpressed, only its short-term inhibition ameliorates survival, while a longer depletion exacerbates tumour-related dedifferentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Yet, although these results underscore the extreme context dependence of Polycomb involvement in tumorigenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, its molecular basis remains elusive. Even in settings in which EZH2 inhibition proved remarkably effective, as in lymphomas with gain-of-function mutations, it was not possible to define consistent transcriptional outputs, indicating that Polycomb can regulate different pathways even within the same apparently homogeneous tumour type<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. This diversity of molecular impact is being linked to what is increasingly recognized, starting from Polycomb, as the core function of many chromatin modifiers, namely the definition of cell context-dependent ranges or thresholds of gene expression rather than the univocal determination of transcriptional output<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. In turn, this grounds the rationale to pursue the elucidation of Polycomb-dependent programmes in highly defined and physiopathologically meaningful tumour models.</p><p>Here we address this challenge focusing on malignant gliomas, which constitute one of the most significant unmet medical needs and present two particularly relevant features: (i) pronounced heterogeneity among and within tumour types and (ii) convergent evidence of context-dependent Polycomb involvement, which is largely limited to its impact on single genes and has not mechanistically uncovered the diversity of its target pathways in relation to specific glioma subtypes and developmental contexts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Specifically, we integrate transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses to define functionally relevant PRC2-dependent networks that promote gliomagenesis, validating them both in mouse models and human samples. We find that PRC2 affects specific developmental pathways associated to defining features of the disease. Moreover, the dissection of PRC2-dependent circuits at distinct stages of gliomagenic transformation uncovers <italic>Zfp423</italic> as a critical downstream target of PRC2, whose downregulation negatively impacts survival and whose overexpression impairs gliomagenesis in a SMAD (small mother against decapentaplegic)-dependent manner.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Polycomb targets developmental pathways during gliomagenesis</title><p>To define the gene circuits that are deregulated during gliomagenesis in a PRC2-dependent manner, we used a well-established mouse model of gliomagenesis that relies on the loss of <italic>Ink4a/Arf</italic> combined with the overexpression of the constitutively active mutant form of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) known as EGFR variant III (hereafter indicated as EGFR&#x0002a;), the two most common lesions in human high-grade gliomas (HGGs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). The model relies on orthotopic transplantation of early postnatal astrocytes harbouring both lesions (hereafter <italic>Ink4a/Arf</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup>; EGFR&#x0002a;) and its unique advantage, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, is the definition of largely homogeneous cell populations endowed with different tumorigenic potential (non-tumorigenic primary <italic>Ink4a/Arf</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> astrocytes, hereafter Astro; tumorigenic <italic>Ink4a/Arf</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> astrocytes expressing EGFR&#x0002a;, hereafter AstroEGFR&#x0002a;; glioma propagating cells (GPCs) derived from primary tumours, hereafter PT; and GPCs derived from secondary tumours, hereafter ST), which constitute a privileged entry point to dissect the transcriptional and epigenomic alterations that accrue during gliomagenesis. Importantly, the <italic>Ink4a/Arf</italic>-null background allows to study the developmental features of PRC2-dependent oncogenesis independent of its control of the INK4A-ARF-INK4B locus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. We first validated the model through a thorough histopathological assessment, which extended previous observations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, confirming that in mouse the <italic>Ink4a/Arf</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup>; EGFR&#x0002a; combination recapitulates a broad range of HGG, ranging from anaplastic astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas to GBM and gliosarcoma (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b,c</xref>). Next, we focused on the key transition between AstroEGFR&#x0002a; and PT, and performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIPseq) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) for H3K27me3, to investigate the hypothesized redistribution of the PRC2 mark and its transcriptional impact during gliomagenesis. For this, we developed an <italic>ad hoc</italic> computational pipeline that integrates RNAseq and ChIPseq profiles with transcription factor (TF) motif enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), to generate mechanistically testable hypotheses on the relevant Polycomb-dependent circuits.</p><p>A transcriptomic analysis of three independent <italic>Ink4a/ARF</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup>;EGFR&#x0002a; astrocyte batches along with their resulting PT led to the identification of a set of 545 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which 272 are downregulated and 273 upregulated in PT versus AstroEGFR&#x0002a;. A cluster analysis based on DEGs revealed a clear clustering by cell type (that is, with tumorigenic astrocytes segregating away from all primary tumours; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). This pointed to a major and largely convergent shift in gene expression underlying the AstroEGFR&#x0002a;-PT transition. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> (right), an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) for canonical pathways uncovered the strongest enrichments among the downregulated DEGs, with a convergent involvement of genes controlling cell morphogenesis and migration, and belonging to the top scoring axonal guidance signalling, regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and integrin signalling pathways, whose key regulators have a well-established involvement in gliomas. Along with the related Reelin signalling pathway, axonal guidance signalling came out among the best-ranking pathways also within the upregulated DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>), consistent with its dual role in regulating cell migration by fine-tuning both attractive and repulsive cues. Thus, molecules that are generally associated to repulsive clues, such as <italic>Slit2&#x02013;3</italic> and <italic>Shh</italic>, appeared to be downregulated, whereas attractors such as <italic>Wnt7b</italic> and <italic>Vegfa</italic> were upregulated, consistently with the acquisition of the infiltrating capacity that characterizes malignant gliomas. Finally, the second top-scoring enriched pathway in downregulated DEGs was human embryonic stem cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>), whose enrichment was due to the exclusive involvement of differentiation-promoting genes. This points to dedifferentiation as a particularly significant feature of gliomagenesis and further extends the insight that gliomas originate through the reversion of either astrocytes (as in our experimental system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) or neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> to an undifferentiated state. Consistently, we found that <italic>Tgfb3</italic>, known to promote neuronal differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, <italic>Bmp4</italic>, involved in astrocyte differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, and <italic>Smad7</italic>, important in neural fate acquisition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, were all downregulated in our PT samples.</p><p>When we analysed the same cell populations for H3K27me3 distribution, comparing the number of PRC2 targets in each class of samples revealed a major overall increase of PRC2 marking in PT, with 2,306 gene hits compared with 668 in AstroEGFR&#x0002a;. We then compared these gene sets with two previous data sets that captured distinct aspects of PRC2 developmental control: (i) the H3K27me3 signature that characterizes cortical neural progenitors (NPs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, finding that although PT samples shared a statistically significant overlap of H3K27me3 target genes with NPs (92 genes), AstroEGFR&#x0002a; did not show any specific overlap (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>, left); and (ii) the core set of PRC2 targets whose silencing we found to be required for cell fate reversion to pluripotency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, finding that PT samples shared a striking overlap of H3K27me3 target genes with this core set (732 genes), whereas AstroEGFR&#x0002a; showed only a minimal overlap (12 genes) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>, right). Together, these results highlight the extent of developmental dysregulation and dedifferentiation that characterize this tumour model. Next, to analyse the dynamics of PRC2 targets, we focused on the 456 genes that acquire the mark during the transition from AstroEGFR&#x0002a; to PT consistently across all PT samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>, left). Also in this case, axonal guidance signalling and human embryonic stem cell pathways scored among the top ten in the IPA analysis of canonical pathway associated to this subset of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>, right). Importantly, <italic>de novo</italic> targets featured three clearly distinct enrichment patterns for H3K27me3: (i) that centred on the transcription start site (TSS), with the typical pattern of great enrichment right upstream and downstream of the sharp dip coinciding with the TSS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>; (ii) that with a prevalent enrichment upstream of the TSS (&#x02212;3&#x02009;kb); or (iii) that with a prevalent enrichment downstream of the TSS (&#x0002b;3&#x02009;kb). Comparison of expression values for genes belonging to each of the three classes showed a significant downregulation for those in which the accumulation of the mark included both the TSS and its downstream region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1f</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we integrated the RNAseq and ChIPseq data sets to pinpoint the genes that, in the AstroEGFR&#x0002a;&#x02013;PT transition, became both downregulated and <italic>de novo</italic> targets of H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, left). Remarkably, axonal guidance signalling was strongly associated with this subset of genes as well, indicating that this pathway is under direct Polycomb control during the gliomagenic transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, right). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2b,c</xref> shows the independent validation of these findings for representative members of the axonal guidance signalling pathway, namely <italic>Slit2</italic>, <italic>Slit3</italic> and <italic>Bmp4</italic>, which were tested for H3K27me3 enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>) and expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). <italic>Slit2</italic> and <italic>Slit3</italic> are two key molecules originally involved in axon guidance (in which they provide repulsive cues by binding to their Roundabout receptors)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, whose functional association with glioma emerged with the observation that <italic>Slit2</italic> is epigenetically silenced in gliomas through DNA methylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, and that rescue of its expression reduces cell migration both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. <italic>Bmp4</italic> is known to reduce proliferation and promote astrogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>; hence, its silencing further highlights dedifferentiation as a core feature of gliomagenesis. Interestingly, the core subset of genes that are both downregulated and acquire <italic>de novo</italic> H3K27me3 in the AstroEGFR&#x0002a; to PT transition showed a highly significant overlap with the subset of Polycomb targets that are significantly downregulated during cell reprogramming (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). Among these genes, we found <italic>Bmp4</italic> along with other genes involved in cellular differentiation, further emphasizing the key role played by Polycomb during the transcriptional shift from astrocytes to primary tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>Zfp423</italic> is a master Polycomb target during gliomagenesis</title><p>PRC2 had thus far been implicated in gliomagenesis on the basis of either clinical correlations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> or of its effect on exemplary genes involved in astroglial differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. By defining a consistent genome-wide pattern of PRC2 redistribution across independent glioma samples and characterizing its transcriptional output, our results enabled a first dissection of the specific contribution of this epigenetic axis, uncovering two prominent domains of developmental dysregulation (that is, the control of migration and differentiation outlined above). However, beyond these specific pathways and consistent with recent evidence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, this approach also confirmed that only a minor portion of the extensive transcriptional changes that accrue during gliomagnesis could be directly imputable to aberrant PRC2 occupancy. Thus, to gain further mechanistic insight into the functional relevance of H3K27me3 redistribution, we focused on the identification of putative PRC2-dependent master regulator TFs that could mainly and indirectly account for the transcriptional changes we observed. For this, we first performed a TF motif enrichment analysis of the DEGs between AstroEGFR&#x0002a; and PT. This analysis pinpointed 22 candidate master regulator TFs, defined as TFs whose binding sites were significantly enriched among the DEGs characterizing the AstroEGFR&#x0002a; to PT transition. These genes were then ranked according to the significance of their expression change and correlated to their H3K27me3 status. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, among the 22 predicted candidate master regulator TFs, <italic>Zfp423</italic> was the only one whose repression correlated with the <italic>de novo</italic> acquisition of H3K27me3 in PT. Furthermore, meta-analysis of an RNAseq data set obtained from a different murine glioma model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> revealed an inverse expression correlation between the PRC2 enzymatic subunit <italic>Ezh2</italic> and <italic>Zfp423</italic>, with <italic>Ezh2</italic> knockdown resulting in increased <italic>Zfp423</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). We next confirmed both the downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>) and the <italic>de novo</italic> H3K27me3 acquisition of <italic>Zfp423</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>) in a larger cohort of samples, highlighting the consistency of this silencing circuit.</p><p>As recounted above, gliomas display remarkable heterogeneity both at the histopathological and molecular level. In addition, we thus analysed a different mouse model that is based on the overexpression of platelet-derived growth factor beta (PDGF-B) in cortical NP (see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>), to determine whether the glioma-associated repression of <italic>Zfp423</italic> was consistent across different tumour-driving mutations. In this case as well, we characterized homogeneous populations of cells that captured different disease stages, namely primary, non-tumorigenic NP sourced from E13.5 telencephali (hereafter NP), tumorigenic NP overexpressing PDGF-B (hereafter NP PDGFB) and GPCs derived from primary tumours (hereafter PT) that were able to regrow tumours upon orthotopic transplantation. Consistent with our observations from the <italic>Ink4a/Arf</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup>; EGFR&#x0002a; model, we confirmed a progressive downregulation of <italic>Zfp423</italic> along with the increase in tumorigenic potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>Zfp423</italic> is downregulated in human gliomagenesis</title><p>Although <italic>Zfp423</italic> had not yet been associated to gliomas, a previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> found the human orthologue of <italic>Zfp423</italic>, <italic>ZNF423</italic>, to be downregulated in human neuroblastoma.

Thus, to generalize our findings and test whether <italic>ZNF423</italic> behaved similarly in gliomas, we performed a meta-analysis of a large cohort of expression data from 343 samples of human gliomas deposited at the NCI REpository for Molecular BRAin Neoplasia DaTa<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>, we observed that also in gliomas, <italic>ZNF423</italic> downregulation correlated with higher grade (right panel). Comparable results were obtained by performing a second meta-analysis on a further independent cohort of expression profiles, comprising 157 expression data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO ID: GSE4290; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). Moreover, when we classified patients from the REpository for Molecular BRAin Neoplasia DaTa database into three groups according to <italic>ZNF423</italic> expression on the basis of their fold change with respect to median expression, a Kaplan&#x02013;Meyer analysis for progression-free survival confirmed that higher levels of <italic>ZNF423</italic> correlate with a far better prognosis compared with mid or low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>, left panel), with high statistical significance between high- (f.c.&#x0003e;2) and low-expressing (f.c.&#x0003c;2) tumours (Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test, <italic>P</italic>=1.65218e&#x02212;5). Finally, to ground the mechanistic dissection of the role of <italic>Zfp423</italic> dosage in gliomagenesis, we resorted back to our initial <italic>Ink4a/Arf</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup>; EGFR&#x0002a; murine model and interrogated three independent batches of tumorigenic astrocytes (AstroEGFR&#x0002a;1, AstroEGFR&#x0002a;2 and AstroEGFR&#x0002a;3) with comparable <italic>Zfp423</italic> expression. When challenged in <italic>in-vivo</italic> experiments upon orthotopic transplantation, we found that AstroEGFR&#x0002a;1 and AstroEGFR&#x0002a;3 yielded gliomas with a shorter survival compared with AstroEGFR&#x0002a;2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Strikingly, although primary tumours originated from every astrocyte batch invariably displayed <italic>Zfp423</italic> downregulation, they did so to different extents, with AstroEGFR&#x0002a;1 and AstroEGFR&#x0002a;3 showing a greater reduction than AstroEGFR&#x0002a;2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>), thus confirming results from human data and validating this model as a sensitive system to test the physiopathologically relevant role of <italic>Zfp423</italic>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Context-specific antigliomagenic effect of <italic>Zfp423</italic></title><p>As higher levels of <italic>Zfp423</italic> were associated to better prognosis in both humans and mice, we set out to validate its role by forcing its overexpression in tumorigenic <italic>Ink4a/Arf</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup>; EGFR&#x0002a; astrocytes and thereby test whether preventing its PRC2-mediated downregulation would impair or delay gliomagenesis. The three representative independent batches of tumorigenic astrocytes, AstroEGFR&#x0002a;1, AstroEGFR&#x0002a;2 and AstroEGFR&#x0002a;3, were thus infected with a retroviral vector encoding <italic>Zfp423</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>; hereafter AstroEGFR&#x0002a; <italic>Zfp423</italic>). Following confirmation of overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>), cells were then assessed for tumorigenicity by sterotactic inoculation. Interestingly, the three AstroEGFR&#x0002a; lines responded differently to the challenge of <italic>Zfp423</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>, the overexpression of <italic>Zfp423</italic> had a major impact on the tumorigenicity of AstroEGFR&#x0002a;2 astrocytes, with a highly statistically significant increase in survival (<italic>P</italic>=0.0089). On the contrary, mice transplanted with either AstroEGFR&#x0002a;1 or AstroEGFR&#x0002a;3 astrocytes showed different survivals. Specifically, although AstroEGFR&#x0002a;1, which reached overexpression levels comparable to those in AstroEGFR&#x0002a;2, showed a trend of extended survival that did not reach statistical significance, AstroEGFR&#x0002a;3, despite much stronger <italic>Zfp423</italic> overexpression, displayed a shorter survival. To gain insight into the molecular underpinnings of the differential response to <italic>Zfp423</italic> overexpression, we followed two complementary approaches.</p><p>First, we performed a principal component analysis of the AstroEGFR&#x0002a; transcriptomes, which revealed that AstroEGFR&#x0002a; cluster according to their responsiveness to <italic>Zfp423</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Differential expression analysis uncovered gene clusters that were distinctly associated to each batch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>), which we then used to query PT transcriptomes finding that PT originated from AstroEGFR&#x0002a;1 and AstroEGFR&#x0002a;3, when compared with the AstroEGFR&#x0002a;2-derived PT, retained expression of a larger portion of the gene cluster belonging to the respective astrocyte batch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). On the contrary, a shuffling analysis that randomly queried astrocyte batch-specific clusters against PT did not reveal the same degree of retention (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). This establishes that a significant fraction of the gene expression that distinguishes similar yet distinct batches of tumorigenic astrocytes is retained in the respective tumours. Furthermore, it highlights how such tumour-retained gene expression is already primed to a greater extent in the <italic>Zfp423-</italic>resistant astrocyte batches that display, accordingly, a more aggressive tumorigenicity. This finding was strengthened by an unsupervised cluster analysis of the transcriptomes of the three AstroEGFR&#x0002a; and the respective PT. Indeed, each AstroEGFR&#x0002a; clusters with the corresponding tumour (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>), indicating that each AsroEGFR&#x0002a; batch is already seeded with partially specific transcriptional programmes that will unfold during tumour development.</p><p>Second, we compared by RNAseq the transcriptomes of the three batches of AstroEGFR&#x0002a; to their respective transcriptomes upon forced <italic>Zfp423</italic> expression (AstroEGFR&#x0002a;1 versus AstroEGFR&#x0002a;1 <italic>Zfp423</italic>, AstroEGFR&#x0002a;2 versus AstroEGFR&#x0002a;2 <italic>Zfp423</italic> and AstroEGFR&#x0002a;3 versus AstroEGFR&#x0002a;3 <italic>Zfp423</italic>) and went on to define the <italic>Zfp423-</italic>centred transcriptional interactions specific to each pair. To this end, we integrated the results of differential expression obtained from each comparison with a co-expression-based analysis extracted from a large data set of 106 gene expression profiles collected in the GeneMania database<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. The aim was first to infer the high confidence co-expression networks centred on <italic>Zfp423</italic> and then define which portion of these predicted circuits were empirically validated in <italic>Zfp423</italic>-responsive versus <italic>Zfp423</italic>-non-responsive tumorigenic astrocytes. Consistent with the <italic>in-vivo</italic> outcome, interrogation of these gene networks showed that <italic>Zfp423</italic> overexpression had affected different sets of genes in the three batches of tumorigenic astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>). We thus reasoned that these distinct gene subsets should display marked differences with respect to the transcriptional programme that underlies primary gliomagenesis in the same murine model. To test this hypothesis, we thus compared, by gene set enrichment analysis, the <italic>Zfp423</italic>-dependent genes specifically affected in each batch of tumorigenic astrocyte with the DEGs that marked the AstroEGFR&#x0002a;-to-PT transition. This approach confirmed that the genes downregulated in the AstroEGFR&#x0002a;-to-PT transition were significantly enriched for the <italic>Zfp423</italic>-dependent genes that were upregulated specifically in AstroEGFR&#x0002a;2, providing a clear molecular basis for the antigliomagenic effect of <italic>Zfp423</italic> in this context. On the contrary, although we did not find any significant enrichment for <italic>Zfp423</italic>-dependent genes affected in AstroEGFR&#x0002a;1, we found a significant enrichment for the <italic>Zfp423</italic>-dependent genes affected in AstroEGFR&#x0002a;3, but among the genes that changed in the same direction as the DEGs characterizing the AstroEGFR&#x0002a;-to-PT transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>), again providing the molecular correlate for the lack of antigliomagenic effect by <italic>Zfp423</italic> in this context. Together, these results provide a molecular basis for the antigliomagenic impact of <italic>Zfp423</italic> in the specific cellular context of AstroEGFR&#x0002a;2, grounding it in the ability to specifically antagonize a significant portion of the gliomagenesis-specific transcriptional programme that characterizes this murine model.</p><p>Interestingly, among the genes specific to the <italic>Zfp423</italic> response there are several members of the axon guidance pathways and tumour suppressor genes whose modulation was already associated to reduced tumorigenicity: namely <italic>Slit2</italic> (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>), <italic>Pappa</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, <italic>Nfatc4</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>) and <italic>Lox</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Furthermore, the group of genes specifically downregulated upon <italic>Zfp423</italic> overexpression only in AstroEGFR&#x0002a;2 and not in AstroEGFR&#x0002a;1 or AstroEGFR&#x0002a;3 included also <italic>Sox2</italic> and several other Sox family genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>), which have recently emerged as important driving or enabling factors in gliomagenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. As TF motif analysis predicted that the <italic>Sox2</italic> promoter contains a putative binding site for <italic>Zfp423</italic>, we asked whether <italic>Zfp423</italic> overexpression could antagonize gliomagenesis by repressing <italic>Sox2</italic> in <italic>Zfp423</italic>-responsive astrocytes. To test this hypothesis, we overexpressed <italic>Sox2</italic> in <italic>Zfp423</italic>-responsive astrocytes to revert the phenotype of extended survival, using a construct that lacked endogenous control regions and thus could not be subjected to <italic>Zfp423</italic> transcriptional repression. Indeed, the overexpression of <italic>Sox2</italic> in the context of <italic>Zfp423</italic> overexpression showed a survival rate that was much shorter compared with that achieved with <italic>Zfp423</italic> overexpression alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>), thus establishing <italic>Sox2</italic> downregulation as a fundamental antigliomagenic event downstream of <italic>Zfp423</italic> overexpression. Interestingly, however, against the expected accelerated tumorigenesis induced by overexpression of <italic>Sox2</italic> alone, mice receiving astrocytes overexpressing both TFs showed longer survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>), uncovering also a mutually antagonistic indirect circuit between <italic>Zfp423</italic> and <italic>Sox2</italic> in gliomagenesis.</p><p>Finally, in light of these analyses indicating that the <italic>Ink4a/Arf</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup>; EGFR&#x0002a; paradigm is more diverse than previously anticipated, we investigated this diversity considering the pronounced heterogeneity characterizing human HGG, as captured in recent molecular classifications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>.

In our PT samples, both <italic>Bmp4</italic> and <italic>Zfp423</italic> are <italic>de novo</italic> H3K27 trimethylated and downregulated, pointing to a double and synergic blockade of the BMP signalling pathway that is critical for astroglial differentiation.

Beyond the obvious difficulty linked to the anatomical site and the remarkable invasiveness of these tumours, two key problems have hampered progress so far: (i) the marked heterogeneity of these tumours, which implies the development of several subgroup-targeted approaches, and (ii) the virtual inaccessibility of early-stage lesions, with the attending inability to trace tumour history and define the critical gene circuits that drive initial establishment of the tumour. Notably, although many mouse models have proven invaluable in dissecting central aspects of this human disease, the experimental features of most of them precluded a thorough characterization of disease dynamics. This applies especially to the chromatin level of regulation, despite its emergence as a fundamental domain of perturbation that is raising major therapeutic hopes. Indeed, although cancer-specific chromatin maps, including for PRC2-dependent H3K27 trimethylation, are rapidly accumulating for both human and murine tumours, they most often describe endpoints of disease progression and are seldom related to transcriptional output in terms of mechanistically tested and functionally validated circuits.</p><p>Here we advance significantly our understanding of PRC2 contribution to gliomagenesis with an unbiased characterization of the PRC2-dependent circuits. Specifically, we combined the informative power of a mouse model featuring homogeneous cell populations of differential tumorigenic potential with a computational pipeline for the systematic integration of RNAseq and ChIPseq profiles with discovery tools for TF motif enrichment. This yielded two key insights. First, it enabled us to functionally partition the effect of PRC2 silencing, by showing that two critical developmental domains, one centred on the morphogenetic cues that enable migration and the other centred on dedifferentiation, were under direct PRC2 control. Importantly, both have been linked to core features of HGG, such as the marked propensity for invasiveness and the aberrant re-expression of elements of the pluripotency network<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Second, it led to the identification of a single TF, <italic>Zfp423</italic>, that was also under direct PRC2 control and accounted for a significant portion of the transcriptional dysregulation that underlies the transition from tumorigenic astrocytes to GPCs. Importantly, we found that <italic>Zfp423</italic> downregulation correlated with a worse prognosis, both in two independent mouse models and in two very large cohorts of human patients. The human homologue of <italic>Zfp423</italic>, <italic>ZNF423</italic>, had been previously identified as a positive prognostic factor for neuroblastoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>; hence, our results now extend the functional relevance of this gene to a wholly different class of tumours.</p><p>The modular architecture of <italic>Zfp423</italic> and ZNF423, whose Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like C2H2 zinc finger clusters mediate interaction with distinct transcriptional partners<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>, allowed us to mechanistically define the requirement of the BMP signalling axis for the anti-gliomagenic activity of <italic>Zfp423</italic>, as only the full-length protein but not its SMAD mutant form was able to prolong survival. This finding is particularly interesting in light of our results demonstrating PRC2-silencing of <italic>Bmp4</italic> in our primary tumour samples and of previous data on the aberrant recruitment of PRC2 to the <italic>BMPR1B</italic> receptor gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, pointing to a synergic impact of Polycomb both on core members of the BMP signalling pathway and on one of their critical downstream effectors.</p><p>Finally, our findings also uncovered a significant degree of heterogeneity within <italic>Ink4/Arf&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic>; EGFR&#x0002a; gliomagenesis, which we harnessed at the molecular level to define the mechanisms and context specificity of <italic>Zfp423</italic> antigliomagenic activity. As to the former, we found that <italic>Ink4/Arf&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic>; EGFR&#x0002a; tumorigenic astrocytes, despite their overall similarity, display transcriptional specificities that are differentially retained in the gliomas they originate, suggesting that they represent differentially primed entry points of tumorigenesis. Consistently, this heterogeneity is carried through the primary gliomas, which encompass a relatively wide range of high-grade histopathological subtypes and also recapitulate, to different extents and for different parts, the signatures used to classify human HGG.</p><p>This transcriptomic dissection of glioma heterogeneity was functionally validated with the observation that <italic>Zfp423</italic> exerts the strongest antigliomagenic activity only in the context of the least tumour-primed astrocytes, in which it antagonizes, in an exquisitely SMAD signalling-dependent manner, a very significant portion of the gliomagenic programme that includes <italic>Sox2</italic>, a well-established glioma oncogene, and several other differentiation-promoting factors that are specifically downregulated in gliomas. However, the context specificity displayed in this experimental model did not prevent the definition of a general prognostic impact for <italic>ZNF423</italic> downregulation, which was confirmed in two large independent human cohorts. The context effect of <italic>Zfp423</italic> is consistent with accumulating evidence on the extreme heterogeneity that characterizes gliomas, with a growing number of TFs being shown to play critical roles but in highly selected cases, as in the instance of the six TFs that underlie transcriptomic changes uniquely in the mesenchymal subtype HGG<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> or, even more strikingly, the <italic>FGFR-TACC</italic> oncogenic fusion that was identified in three patients from a large cohort of HGG patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>. Indeed, especially in light of the significant challenge posed by this remarkable heterogeneity, we believe that our approach of identifying candidate master regulators, along with their relevant networks, by comparing initiating cells with their corresponding tumours further advances the functional reclassification of gliomas on the basis of physiopathologically meaningful TF-centred pathways.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Human cells</title><p>Human GBM cell lines were obtained from Rossella Galli's lab (San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy) and were grown as described in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>.

Cells were passaged at 80&#x02013;90&#x00025; confluency at a ratio ranging from 1:3 to 1:6. They were detached with Accutase and dispersed into single cells by gentle pipetting; after centrifugation at 300&#x02009;<italic>g</italic> for 5&#x02009;min, cells were resuspended in glioma-initiating cell medium and plated as described above. GPCs were kept in culture for less than ten passages before being used for <italic>in-vivo</italic> experiments and next generation sequencing profiling. Differentiation was performed according to the protocol published in the same paper. In particular, astrocytic differentiation was performed by adding FBS or BMP4 to the culturing medium, whereas neuronal differentiation was achieved through growth factor withdrawal. The same protocol was used for the differentiation of embryonic neural precursors.</p><p>EGFR&#x0002a;, Pdgf-&#x003b2;, Zfp423 or Zfp423DSBD retroviral particles were generated using the retrovirus producer cell line Phoenix-Eco.
