Studies on molecular mechanisms of SSc-related progressive lung fibrosis have been conducted in animal models as well as in human populations. A recent publication reported a set of genes that are differentially expressed between SSc-related progressive lung fibrosis and a control healthy population in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This set included genes associated with macrophage activation and chemokine, IFN, and profibrotic/TGF&#x003b2;-regulated gene expression. These genes are potentially important for the diagnosis and for understanding of the molecular mechanisms related to progressive SSc lung fibrosis. Whole genome gene expression profiles from mouse recombinant inbred (RI) strains and human populations have been widely used for the construction of gene network to illustrate the potential molecular pathways of genes of interests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore, construction of gene network of these differentially expressed genes may enhance our understanding of their molecular pathways and regulatory connections.</p><p>This study aims to explore the potential pathways that connect these genes in human lung and to investigate whether similar pathways exist in mice. The identification of these differentially expressed genes for progressive SSc lung fibrosis is a very important step for eventual understanding of the molecular events in this manifestation of SSc. Moreover, understanding molecular mechanisms of changes of gene expression in SSc lung fibrosis will greatly enhance our ability to select targets for drug design. One important step in understanding the mechanism of these changes is to determine how these genes are regulated and related to each other under normal genomic conditions. Understanding the network of these genes in a normal genomic background will provide information on how these genes are regulated in pathways dysregulated in SSc lung fibrosis. This knowledge will enhance our understanding on how the gene pathways are altered and how the disease is trigged, and therefore, what and how the targets should be selected for drug design. In this study, we will focus on the construction of pathways of these genes under the normal genomic background using data from normal lungs of humans and mice. Other diseases may sometimes affect gene expression of similar sets by different mechanisms or genes at alternate, but similar, steps in the pathways. We will also compare networks between humans and mice so as to provide information on similarities and differences to guide studies of murine models of lung fibrosis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Human gene expression data sets</title><p>GeneNetwork expression data from lung were based on results of 1230 samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], which contain gene expression levels of the whole-genome from human lung tissues processed with Affymetrix HuRSTA array.

Probes are collected and selected based on the list of the genes. In case of multiple probes, we first used all the probes in the construction of the gene network. If they are all highly positively correlated. Then one probe (usually the one with the highest expression level) is used for the final construction of the gene network. Graphic connections and associations within the gene network are accomplished with the Metrix and Network Graphs at GeneNetwork. Initial edge lengths were computed by applying an r-to-Z transform to the correlation coefficients and then inverting the results. The graph drawing algorithm found a configuration that minimizes the total stretching of the edges. Curves show Pearson correlation coefficients &#x0003e;0.35 or &#x0003c;&#x02212;0.35.

These 82 probes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table&#x000a0;S1) represent the 23 genes and their closely relevant genes; however, they are also the results of multiple probes of single genes amongst these genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For the purpose of simplicity and clarity, we used the probe of the highest expression level in case there were multiple probes for a gene. We examined whether one probe represent the others of the same gene in the 23 genes, we initially conducted the gene network analysis of the genes with multiple probes. The result indicated that different probes of the same genes are highly significantly associated (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure&#x000a0;S1).

Like other lung fibrosis, SSc-related progressive lung fibrosis arises from a series of molecular and pathological events. Understanding of the molecular basis of SSc-related progressive lung fibrosis is a key in prevention and treatment of the disease. Our data are the first to show the potential molecular pathways of these genes for this disease. The publication of Christmann&#x02019;s group identified the differentially expressed genes and categorized them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Our study organized them into pathways and connected them together. There are studies on the pathways of these genes in animal models, however, not in humans, mainly due to the limited number of samples. Detailed studies in the future of the order of events, and sequence regulation of events related to expression of these genes will provide information for identification of potential molecular targets in drug design.</p><p>There is a difference between humans and mice in the regulation of genes identified in SSc-related progressive lung fibrosis. The macrophage activation genes are associated more strongly in humans than that in mice. Several genes (including CD163, AIF1, CD86, MS4A4A, CCL18, CCL13, and CCR1) are positively associated in humans, while in mice there is a relatively weak association among Cd86 and Aif1. While the association in gene expression between humans and mice are similar for IFN-regulated genes and profibrotic/Tgf&#x003b2;-regulated genes, the difference between humans and mice on the regulation of macrophage activation genes alerts a potential problematic issue in the translation of research results from the mouse model into the human population. A typical scenario is that treatment in humans targeting mainly macrophage activation genes may be a better antifibrotic strategy; while, in mice, targeting profibrotic/Tgf&#x003b2;-regulated genes may be a better strategy.</p><p>In both humans and mice, the associations among the investigated genes are stronger in the lung than that in the liver. Such a result indicates that, if one of these genes in these gene groups of strong association is dysregulated, it affects the lung more seriously than the liver, because the dysregulated gene may not (in turn) affect the expression levels of others in the liver. The difference of gene associations between lung and liver also supports the reliability of this study. It would be difficult to explain why fibrosis occurs in SSc lungs but not liver, if a stronger association of these genes was found in liver.</p><p>In a study using lung tissues from Systemic Sclerosis patients with Pulmonary Fibrosis and Pulmonary Hypertension, Hsu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] identified 242 and 335 genes that were differentially expressed in lungs and primary fibroblasts, respectively. Our study analyzed the genes from a study of systemic sclerosis-related progressive lung fibrosis and compare the molecular pathways in the lung of normal mouse and human populations. While key genes in both studies, such as COL1A1, TGFb1, are the same, there is a considerable difference in the gene lists between these two studies. Most of the genes in the report by Hsu et al. are not listed in the report by Christmann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Many of the genes in our study involve in the protein bolding, such as COL1A1, COL5A2, COL14A1, CD86, CD163, COMP. They are also the important components for extracellular region. Several genes participate cytokine activity, such as CXCL5, CCL13, CCL18, SPP1, IL18, and IFNA2. It may be necessary for the future to investigate their association with other pathways such as in the insulin-like growth factor signaling and caveolin mediated endocytosis pathways.</p><p>The selection of genes in this study is based on data from humans. Several studies suggest that mice have different macrophage markers and it is even organ/model dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. For example, Arginase-1 (Arg1) has been used in animal models as the molecular marker for SSc-Related Progressive Lung Fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, Arg1 is not selected as a differentially expressed gene in SSc-Related Progressive Lung Fibrosis in humans. Our data emphasize the importance of identification of similarities and differences between humans and animal models. When applying the results from mouse models to humans, these differences need to be carefully examined to ensure the clinically translational clinic study is oriented in the correct direction.</p><p>In studying molecular pathways from mice, we used data from mouse RI strains, which are homozygous in genomics within each of such strains. Evidently the data are accurate not only due to the homozygousity of the mouse strain but also the reproducibility of results from multiple mice within each strain. However, the human population included data from more than 1000 individuals. The gene network, constructed with data from RNAseq, also confirmed the conclusion of the microarray data. Although the results from this study may need further confirmation by additional studies, the data are considerably reliable. We realized that our data were from normal tissues. The observed correlations (or lack of correlation) might change upon TGF-beta or interferon activation in human SSc tissues or murine fibrotic models.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec14"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13104_2015_1510_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><caption><p>
