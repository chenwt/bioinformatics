High coverage, next-generation sequencing technologies have provided an unprecedented view of the mutational landscape of whole cancer genomes and demonstrated that cancer genomes have typically acquired thousands of somatic alterations by the time they are clinically detected [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Although a majority of these alterations do not have clear biological consequences, some alterations are recurrently found; implicating them as critical events in that tumor&#x02019;s evolution. Subsequently, external factors such as the tumor microenvironment and therapy can confer selective advantages that allow successful clones to eventually supersede one another [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Two of the major findings of next generation sequencing studies are that biopsies taken at the time of tumor presentation already contain a significant amount of genetic heterogeneity [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and importantly that often a rare subclone in the primary tumor subsequently becomes the founding clone of a metastatic or relapse tumor [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The remarkable accuracy and read coverage depth of whole genome sequencing technology now enables the inference of intra-tumor heterogeneity and cancer evolutionary history that is encrypted in its mutational profile [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The study of the evolutionary history of a cancer provides insight into which mutations are cancer-driving from the numerous passenger mutations and sheds light on the mechanism of tumorigenesis.</p><p>Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma of childhood. Despite a growing understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying RMS, the disease continues to have significant mortality and morbidity especially when the tumor is metastatic or recurrent [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. RMS tumors can be subdivided into two major subtypes: PAX fusion positive (PFP) and fusion negative (PFN), characterized by the presence or absence of a oncogenic fusion between the <italic>PAX3</italic> or <italic>PAX7</italic> and <italic>FOXO1</italic> genes [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Fusion positive tumors tend to occur in adolescence and are associated with an adverse outcome. Fusion negative tumors typically occur at a younger age and have been associated with significant aneuploidy, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at chromosome 11p15.5 [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and mutations of <italic>NRAS</italic>, <italic>KRAS</italic>, <italic>HRAS</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, <italic>CTNNB1</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and <italic>FGFR4</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We have recently reported that PFP- and PFN-RMS have distinct landscapes of somatic genomic alterations that activate a common molecular pathway [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Another effort, using high coverage targeted re-sequencing of two relapsed fusion negative tumors, showed that indeed RMS relapse tumors are derived from a minor subclone discovered in the primary tumor [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we decipher for the first time, the evolutionary history of RMS using high coverage whole-genome sequencing of 44 primary tumors with their matched normal samples. We applied a framework of algorithms that enabled the prediction of the sequential order of mutational events and subclonality using chronological molecular information encoded in somatic mutations and allelic copy number (including copy number changes and allelic imbalance). The major inputs to our method include the variant allele fraction (VAF) of somatic mutations, the variant allele fraction of germline single nucleotide variants in tumor samples and somatic copy number status. We verified the accuracy of mutation detection and VAF estimation by deep sequencing on independent platforms. Our framework first estimates the rate of normal cell contamination and corrects its effect on VAF and copy number. Tumor subclones with different genomic profiles are then identified using the distribution of VAF of somatic mutations as well as the allelic copy number status. Finally, we estimate the temporal progression of the observed somatic events in each tumor genome based on the fact that somatic mutations that occur before and after aneuploidy events will have different values of VAF.</p><p>Through our analysis, we discovered that the initiating common lesions of PFN-RMS are the combination of loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 11p15.5 and point mutations in members of the RAS pathway in majority of cases. In a small number of PFN-RMS tumors where no obvious RAS pathway mutations were present, we identified alternative genes that were mutated early in the tumors progression, indicating their potential roles in oncogenesis. In PFP-RMS, we discover that a whole genome duplication event which results in tetraploidy consistently occurs in the middle or late stage of the development of these tumors and that the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion event occurs prior to the whole genome duplication event, making it probable that the fusion is an early event in the evolutionary history of these fusion-positive RMS. Finally, we find that in general RMS tumors are universally composed of a dominant clone, although each tumor contains subclonal populations with a unique mutational profile, which may provide selective advantage to a relapse or metastatic tumor. Because we sequenced only one tumor sample for each patient, a limitation of our study, despite a moderately high coverage of the whole genome sequencing (average 105X), is that we may miss some subclonal mutations and clones especially for subclonal mutations with a VAF&#x0003c;0.1. Nevertheless our findings allow us to propose a developmental model of how this devastating pediatric cancer initiates and evolves prior to presentation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Large-scale deep WGS analysis of RMS</title><p>We used data from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 44 primary RMS tumors (19 PAX- fusion-positive, and 25 PFN tumors) with paired blood samples (providing germline status) with an average of 105x coverage per genome base. The accuracy of somatic mutation detection has been estimated as 93% by experiments in which 604 non-silent mutations were verified by whole-exome sequencing and targeted sequencing on independent platforms [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. To verify the observed VAF of somatic mutations, we re-sequenced the somatic mutations discovered in two RMS samples using multiplex PCR and deep sequencing (1997x coverage) with an orthologous platform. The verification rate of VAF was high by the targeted sequencing (90% accuracy respectively, <xref rid="pgen.1005075.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig.</xref>). In order to accurately estimate the timing of somatic alterations and dissect intra-tumor subclonality, we first estimated the portion of normal cells contaminating the tumor sample by surveying allelic copy number status and VAF of somatic mutations across the genome (<xref rid="pgen.1005075.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>). The normal cell contamination rate was generally low in the 44 tumor samples, with a range of 0&#x02013;33%, a median of 16% and a standard deviation of 9% (<xref rid="pgen.1005075.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). The effect of normal cell contamination was numerically corrected for in all subsequent analyses so that the VAF and copy number status are purely for tumor population. The efficacy of normal cell contamination correction is illustrated in <xref rid="pgen.1005075.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005075.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> Figs., where the observed non-integer allelic copy number was corrected to integers and the observed VAF distribution of somatic mutations was corrected to the expected distribution, <italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. VAF = 0.5 for heterozygous mutations on chromosomes without aneuploidy.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Subclonality analysis</title><p>Multiple studies have shown that subclones exist in individuals with cancer which may become a major clone at relapse or progression and this phenomenon has been reported in two fusion negative RMS tumors [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. To identify those events which may provide resistance to therapy and allow recurrence, we searched for genomic alterations that specifically were confined to the subclonal population. Subclonal copy number alteration events and mutational events were identified using an <italic>in-silico</italic> method (for which the workflow is shown in <xref rid="pgen.1005075.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig.</xref>). Fifty point mutations were identified where the variant&#x02019;s allele frequency was greater than 10% from the expected full clonal allele frequency (<xref rid="pgen.1005075.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). Included in this gene list were 7 COSMIC genes including <italic>ABL1</italic>, <italic>BUB1B</italic>, <italic>CDK12</italic>, <italic>ERBB2</italic>, <italic>IGF2</italic>, <italic>KDR</italic>, and <italic>SMARCA4</italic>. Gene ontology showed enrichment for genes involved in cell adhesion (GO:0007155 p = 0.002), negative regulation DNA repair (GO:0006281, p = 0.05) and cell migration (GO:0030335 p = 0.026). Across the population, several chromosomal events were recurrently found in the subclonal population, including gain of chromosomes, 5, 8, 11, 13, 14, 18 and 19 (<xref rid="pgen.1005075.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>).</p><p>We illustrate our method in more detail using one PAX-fusion negative RMS tumor (RMS2110). Genome wide, this tumor had 3,889 somatic mutations including oncogenic mutation <italic>KRAS</italic> G13D and <italic>FGFR4</italic> V550L [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Using the procedure described in the previous section, we estimated that this sample had 12% normal cell contamination (<xref rid="pgen.1005075.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Copy number analysis showed that RMS2110 had large-segment allelic imbalance (including copy neutral LOH) and copy number alteration on eleven chromosomes (<xref rid="pgen.1005075.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).We employed the combination of somatic mutations, allelic imbalance and copy number alterations to dissect tumor clones that have unique genomic profiles. First, VAF of somatic mutations was determined to find subclonal mutations, based on the fact that a subclonal mutation (present only in a part of the tumor cells) usually has lower VAF than full-clonal mutations (present in all tumor cells) [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A typical scenario is on chromosomes without aneuploidy or allelic imbalance, where heterozygous full-clonal mutations have VAF equal to 0.5 while subclonal mutations have VAF&#x0003c;0.5. Analysis of RMS2110 showed that more than half of the chromosomes are without aneuploidy or allelic imbalance (<xref rid="pgen.1005075.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A and 1B</xref>). On these chromosomes, a small portion of somatic mutations have observed VAF significantly lower than others indicating the presence of subclones (<xref rid="pgen.1005075.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, where there are two distinct VAF clusters, one is centered on VAF = 0.5 and the other is centered on VAF = 0.2; for individual chromosomes see <xref rid="pgen.1005075.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Using a clustering algorithm with cluster-number-selection procedure (<xref rid="pgen.1005075.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>) we can identify subclonal mutations as those with lower VAF. Given the depth of sequencing coverage, we estimated that we could detect subclonal mutations with VAF as low as 0.1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005075.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig.</xref>). Second, allelic copy number status is used to detect subclonal copy number alterations, based on the fact that subclones of different copy number will result in a non-integer allelic copy number for the whole tumor sample. The joint status of total copy number and lesser allele fraction (LAF&#x02014;the ratio between the less allelic copy number and total copy number, estimated by germline single nucleotide variants, see <xref rid="sec011" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>) reflects whether the allelic copy number is an integer&#x02014;whether the observed allelic copy number (red dots) is on the expected position (blue crosses) in <xref rid="pgen.1005075.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>. Therefore our approach predicts the subclonal copy number alterations and the fraction of tumor cells possessing these changes (<xref rid="pgen.1005075.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen.1005075.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1005075.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Inferring evolutionary history for a typical rhabdomyosarcoma sample RMS2110.</title><p>(a) A circos plot of tumor genome RMS2110 (before normal cell contamination correction).

Looking across all 44 genomes revealed that a dominant clonal lineage was present in each tumor sample (<xref rid="pgen.1005075.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The dominant clone carried a large proportion (from 81&#x02013;96%) of somatic mutations regardless of PAX-fusion status of the tumor.

For example, chromosome 9p and 11 have 2 copies with LAF of 0 (<xref rid="pgen.1005075.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), which is likely the loss of one allele followed by a duplication of the remaining allele although we cannot formally exclude the possibility of the duplication of both alleles with subsequent loss of the 2 copies of one allele. This observation was confirmed by the fact that most germline single nucleotide variants on chromosome 9p and 11 had VAF near 1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005075.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). In this case, the somatic mutations occurring before the &#x0201c;LOH+duplication&#x0201d; event must be present on both copies, with an expected VAF of 1, whereas those occurring after the &#x0201c;LOH+duplication&#x0201d; event would be present on only one copy, with an expected VAF of 0.5. The data confirmed this prediction with the VAF displaying a bi-modal distribution with two peaks at 0.5 and 1, respectively (<xref rid="pgen.1005075.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). The ratio between the numbers of mutations in the two clusters reflects the fraction of &#x0201c;molecular time&#x0201d; it undergoes to accumulate mutations before and after the &#x0201c;LOH+duplication&#x0201d; event, assuming a constant accumulation rate [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

Somatic mutations occurring before and after chromosome aneuploidy events had distinct VAF values, which allowed inference of the timing of two candidate driver mutations in this tumor, the nonsynonymous mutation of <italic>FGFR4</italic> V550L and the nonsynonymous mutation of <italic>KRAS</italic> codon G12. The mutation of <italic>FGFR4</italic> V550L has a VAF = 0.95, indicating that the mutation happened before the uniparental disomy event of chromosome 5, which is estimated to occur at 26% of molecular cancer lifetime (<xref rid="pgen.1005075.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Therefore <italic>FGFR4</italic> mutation should happen between 0 to 26% of molecular time. Similarly, the mutation of <italic>KRAS</italic> codon G12 has a VAF of 1, indicating that it occurred before the copy gain of chromosome 12p, timed at 21% of molecular cancer lifetime. Other early events included trisomy of chromosome 8 which happened at 8% of the molecular cancer lifetime and uniparental disomy of chromosomes 11 and 9p which occurred at 14% of the molecular cancer lifetime. Note that on both copies of chromosome 9p, there is a somatic focal deletion of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> (chr9:21981721-21952010), which is also verified by RNAseq (FPKM = 0).</p><p>Other aneuploidy events in this sample included: trisomy of chromosomes 12 and 19 which occurred at 21% of molecular cancer lifetime; uniparental disomy of chromosomes 5, 7 and 17 which happened at 26% of molecular cancer lifetime; tetrasomy of a segment of chromosome 3q which occurred around 50% of molecular cancer lifetime; trisomy of chromosome 13 which occurred at 77% of molecular cancer lifetime; hexasomy of 12p which happened at 85% of molecular cancer lifetime; and trisomy of chromosome 20 which occurred near the time of tumor presentation (<xref rid="pgen.1005075.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p><p>This method was applied to all the 44 tumor-normal sample pairs to build the evolutionary history of RMS (<xref rid="pgen.1005075.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005075.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig.</xref>, and <xref rid="pgen.1005075.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). In summary, our results showed three major findings. First, LOH of 11p15.5 was a consistent early founding event (in average occurred at 35% of molecular cancer lifetime) in PFN-RMS. In comparison, other highly recurrent aneuploidy events such as the copy gain of chromosome 8 and 2 were not consistent early occurring events (time ranges from 1%&#x0223c;95% and 16%&#x0223c;96%, respectively). Second, mutations in RAS pathway genes, including <italic>FGFR4</italic>, <italic>KRAS</italic>, <italic>NRAS</italic> and <italic>HRAS</italic>, were recurrent early events in PFN-RMS. In addition, mutations in other genes (<italic>PKN1</italic>, <italic>CCND1</italic>, <italic>CUL2</italic>, and <italic>TTK</italic>) occurred early suggesting their role in tumorigenesis. Third, PFP-RMS tumors in general had much fewer somatic alterations and few of them occurred early in the tumor&#x02019;s molecular lifetime. Of note, a whole-genome duplication event consistently occurred at the middle or late point in the molecular lifetime of these tumors. The high recurrence suggests that this event might be crucial for the presentation of this cancer subtype. We will discuss these findings in more details in the following sections.</p><fig id="pgen.1005075.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1005075.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Summary of recurrent somatic lesions found across the 44 tumors and the estimates of their occurrence time.</title><p>The heatmap denotes the occurrence of the lesions and their timing (the brightness of grids represents the percentage of cancer lifetime when the lesion occurred).

In contrast, only 2 out of 19 PFP-RMS samples had 11p15.5 LOH. The observed LOH usually was accompanied by a copy gain (23 out of 24 PFN samples with LOH on 11p15.5) of the remaining allele resulting in uniparental disomy (n = 8 in PFN and n = 1 in PFP), trisomy (n = 4 in PFN), tetrasomy (n = 8 in PFN and n = 1 in PFP), or pentasomy (n = 3 PFN) (<xref rid="pgen.1005075.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Fig.</xref>).</p><p>Applying our evolution-history-inference method across the RMS population revealed that the 11p15.5 LOH event universally occurred at an early time point in these tumors development (<xref rid="pgen.1005075.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Fig.</xref>). In these tumors, 11p15.5 had a LAF of 0 (<xref rid="pgen.1005075.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12 Fig.</xref> (A)-(C)), meaning that most germline single nucleotide variants present in the tumor, were homozygous. In contrast, the somatic mutations can be homozygous (before 11p15.5 copy gain) or not (after 11p15.5 copy gain). For instance, on chromosome 11 (uniparental disomy) of sample RMS2110, the majority of somatic mutations distributed around a VAF of 0.5 with a minority distributed around VAF of 1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005075.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). The cluster of somatic mutations discovered around a VAF of 0.5 indicated that these mutations occurred after chromosomal duplication.

On average, the &#x0201c;LOH+duplication&#x0201d; event of 11p15.5 occurred at 35% of molecular time of the 23 PFN-RMS tumors that had this event.

To test our hypothesis and assess the potential of our method in identifying driver mutations, we conducted a cell line study described in this section. <italic>PKN1</italic> is a member of the AGC-subfamily of serine/threonine kinases. The protein product of the <italic>PKN1</italic> gene is composed of a C-terminal kinase domain with significant homology to that of the protein kinase C isoforms, but a unique auto-inhibitory N-terminus made up of 3 homologous stretches of anti-parallel coiled-coil folds (ACC1&#x02013;3) known to bind to Rho-family GTPases in a nucleotide-dependent manner followed by a C2-like region, known to bind phospholipids and fatty acids. Rho-GTPase binding to the ACC regions causes a conformational change that allows <italic>PKN1</italic> to be phosphorylated and activated by PDK1. Active PKN1 plays a role in diverse cellular processes such as regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, vesicular transport and glucose metabolism [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. PKN1 represses WNT/CTNNB1 signaling [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and stimulates the ATF2 and MEF2A transcription factors via a signaling pathway that involves MAP2K3/MAP2K6 and MAPK12 [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The observed mutations in RMS202 (E216K) and RMS2035 (A298T) occurred prior to 30% and 42% of molecular lifetime of the tumors, respectively. Both mutations occur in the region of the third ACC domain and could potentially interfere with regulation of the kinase activity of PKN1. To test the functional consequences of the PKN1 E216K mutation, wild type and mutant <italic>PKN1</italic> viral constructs were made and transduced into the mouse skeletal muscle precursor cell line C2C12.

The implication from adult studies is that progression of a tumor cell follows a long course, with subsequent lineages of cells acquiring mutations until a particular alteration allows expansion of one clone; ultimately leading to clinical detection. Studies of multiple cancer types including melanoma [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and colon [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] have shown that even potent oncogenic mutations may be relatively quiescent and thus remain in an undetected premalignant state until released by an additional genetic hit. The patients in our study had a median age at diagnosis of 6.5 years, indicating that the tumors in these children were developed over a relatively short time course, perhaps hinting at the relative potency of the observed somatic changes. Despite a shorter window of development, our study shows that the basic pattern of sequential mutation accumulation is maintained.</p><p>Given that similar analyses of adult tumors find the presence of a dominant clone [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], we anticipated that RMS tumors might have a similar finding. Our results show that a dominant clone accounts for more than 80% of cancer cells in a typical tumor sample and genome wide carries many hundreds or even thousands of accumulated point mutations. Even with our genome-wide sequencing and deep coverage, the subclones are frequently observed only at the limits of detection. Admittedly, our study may miss part of the subclonal mutations due to the limit of coverage and the complex nature of genomic subclonality, especially for subclonal mutations with a VAF&#x0003c;0.1. Nevertheless GO analysis of subclonal mutations showed enrichment for potential resistance and progression pathways including cell adhesion, DNA repair and cell migration. While our DNA extraction included relatively large tumor sections, it is also possible that further sampling of the tumor may yield additional subclonal populations as have been appreciated in the study of distant metastases [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Even with these constraints, we can conclude that one clone typically dominates these samples, and the majority of tumor cells share most of the detectable genomic alterations. In addition, our findings indicate that a significant proportion of the clonal heterogeneity in RMS is found in gain or loss of copy number, mirroring similar findings in a study of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Future efforts will be needed to determine if these alterations might play a role in defining a "cancer stem cell" which resists the selective pressures of the microenvironment and therapy to survive as a recurrence or metastatic lesion.</p><p>From the analyses described here, we can begin to understand the dynamics of RMS development. LOH of 11p15.5 has long been described as recurrent feature of several pediatric conditions including the overgrowth phenotype of Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], Wilms tumor [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and embryonal RMS. The proposed mechanism for oncogenesis of this lesion is loss of imprinting control over the <italic>IGF2</italic> locus resulting in over-expression of this developmentally regulated growth factor. In this study, we find that not only is this lesion highly recurrent (&#x0003e;90%), it also appears to be the key early landmark in the evolution of fusion-negative tumors. The discovery of a somatic mutation of IGF2 within a fusion negative sample that does not harbor LOH of 11p15.5 (RMS2037) provides additional support to the role of dysregulation of IGF2 in PFN-RMS. In evolutionary terms, the presence of 11p15.5 LOH defines the &#x0201c;most recent common ancestor&#x0201d; when combined with a mutation in a gene in the RAS pathway (<italic>NRAS</italic>, <italic>KRAS</italic>, <italic>HRAS</italic>, <italic>FGFR4</italic>). While the progression we describe in this study indicates a possible common sequence of events (<xref rid="pgen.1005075.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>), in some tumors it is equally as likely that the oncogenic mutation of a RAS pathway gene is the founding lesion. This corroborates the finding that patient&#x02019;s with Costello Syndrome (<italic>HRAS</italic> germline mutation) [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], Noonan Syndrome (<italic>NRAS</italic>, <italic>KRAS</italic>, <italic>PTPN11</italic> germline mutations) [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and Neurofibromatosis (<italic>NF1</italic> germline mutation) [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] all have increased risk of developing fusion-negative RMS. Interestingly, while RMS is certainly described in patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (germline uniparental disomy of 11p15.5), these patients appear to have a higher relative risk of developing Wilms&#x02019; tumor and hepatoblastoma than RMS [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Regardless of which lesion comes first, the combination of LOH of 11p15.5 with a RAS pathway mutation appears to set a clone on the course towards developing a fusion negative RMS tumor (<xref rid="pgen.1005075.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen.1005075.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1005075.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Proposed evolutionary model of rhabdomyosarcoma.</title><p>(a) PFN samples. (b) PFP samples.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1005075.g006"/></fig><p>By examining other mutations that occur early in the molecular history of fusion negative tumors, especially those tumors that had no mutation in a candidate &#x0201c;RAS&#x0201d; pathway member, it is possible to nominate other potential founding lesions. In this analysis, mutation of <italic>PKN1</italic> stands out as both recurrent (occurring in tumor RMS202 and RMS2035) and occurring early in the evolutionary history of these tumors (&#x0003c;30% and &#x0003c;42% respectively). PKN1 is a member of the protein kinase C family and has been implicated as a repressor of WNT/CTNNB1 signaling [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], a mediator of insulin signaling to the actin cytoskeleton [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and an activator of MEF2A dependent transcription [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The observed mutations (E216K and A298T) occurred within the third ACC domain and may relieve N-terminal auto-inhibition of PKN1 kinase activity (<xref rid="pgen.1005075.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14 Fig.</xref>). Our functional assessments of the <italic>PKN1</italic> mutation demonstrated that the observed mutation can inhibit terminal differentiation of skeletal muscle in a dominant-negative fashion. Gene expression analysis of PKN1 E216K expressing C2C12 cells grown in low serum media reveals that this differentiation block occurs as a result of repression of skeletal muscle specific genes and genes with MEF2A binding sites in the promoter. Expression of MEF2 proteins is induced by myogenin during normal skeletal muscle differentiation, and MEF2 factors, in complex with other transcriptional activators, are known to play a role of in myogenic differentiation [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. One possible explanation for these results is that PKN1-dependent signaling leads to replacement of MEF2A at skeletal muscle specific genes with a transcriptional repressor. The identity of this transcriptional repressor is not yet known.</p><p>GSEA analysis of PKN1 E216K expressing C2C12 myoblasts reveals that the gene expression signature of these cells is enriched for a YAP gene signature. The YAP gene signature is composed of genes activated by YAP overexpression in human mammary cells, mouse liver tissues and immortalized mouse fibroblasts, and thus represents a list of evolutionary YAP target genes [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. YAP1 has recently been identified as a potent ERMS oncogenic driver, and YAP1-TEAD complexes repress expression of genes important for myogenic differentiation, in part by impinging upon the binding of myogenic transcription factors including MEF2 [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Intriguingly, YAP1 is able to functionally compensate for oncogenic KRAS in colorectal and pancreatic cancer mouse models [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], which is consistent with the fact that RAS mutation and <italic>PKN1</italic> mutation are mutually exclusive in the set of ERMS tumors presented here. The mechanism by which PKN1 leads to increased YAP1 activity is currently unknown.</p><p>With whole genome sequencing from a single biopsy, we were unable to reliably estimate the molecular timing of some of the recurrent genetic lesions observed in RMS. These events include mutations in <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, <italic>FBXW7</italic>, <italic>NF1</italic>, and <italic>BCOR</italic>, and the focal amplification of <italic>MDM2</italic>, <italic>CDK4</italic>, and <italic>MYCN</italic>. Moreover, somatic events such as the copy gain of chromosomes 2, 8 and 13 were estimated to occur in an inconsistent temporal pattern among RMS patients (occurring at multiple time points throughout the evolutionary history). Certainly, the recurrence of these lesions in multiple large sample sets speaks to their importance, however since they can occur either early or late in the cancers evolutionary history they do not represent the initiating lesion in the tumor but rather modifiers of the tumor as it grows towards presentation.</p><p>Early flow cytometry studies to evaluate DNA content [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and cytogenetic analysis [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] in ARMS noted the frequent presence of tetraploidy. We find evidence that fusion positive tumors demonstrate a very high recurrence of a whole genome duplication event that results in a tetraploid genome. In general, the duplication event occurs around the midpoint of the tumor&#x02019;s evolutionary history and prior to additional accumulation of aneuploidy (<xref rid="pgen.1005075.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). The mechanism of a cell moving from a diploid state to a tetraploid state can be due to a cytokinesis failure, a cell fusion event or mitotic slippage and it has long been speculated that tetraploidy is an intermediate in cancer progression [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. This is born out in at least one premalignant state (Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus), where tetraploidy represents an early intermediate as the cancer precursor develops towards esophageal adenocarcinoma [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Further experimental evidence of a tetraploidy intermediate state is demonstrated in <italic>TP53</italic> null mouse mammary cells where tetraploid but not diploid cells promote tumorigenesis in nude mice [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Of note, in the mouse model of PFP ARMS both the increase in allelic copy number of the <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> fusion and the loss of <italic>TP53</italic> or <italic>CDKN2A</italic> were found to be a critical component in increasing the penetrance of the phenotype [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Given the role of loss of <italic>TP53</italic> in allowing a permissive environment for the tetraploid cell to escape cell cycle arrest, this is consistent with our findings. It is interesting to speculate that in our tumor series the whole genome duplication event is an attempt by the tumor to increase the allelic dose of the PAX fusion. Another intriguing possibility is that the whole genome duplication event alters the telomere length and activates telomerase; a critical cooperating genetic event in the temporal sequence that produces alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma from human myoblasts [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, based on deep whole genome sequencing, we developed a systematic method to infer the evolutionary history and identify the causative lesions of this pediatric solid tumor. From our data, we provide a model for how these tumors develop. Our results demonstrate two distinct evolutionary paths resulting in a convergent phenotype of this soft tissue cancer: 1) genomic loss of heterozygosity on 11p15.5, nonsynonymous mutations on RAS pathway and cell cycle genes, including <italic>FGFR4</italic>, <italic>KRAS</italic>, <italic>NRAS</italic>, <italic>HRAS</italic> and <italic>CCDN1</italic>, as well as several other genes, including <italic>CUL2</italic>, <italic>TTK</italic> and <italic>PKN1</italic>, occur early in the evolution history of PFN-RMS; 2) recurrent whole genome duplication occurs in the middle or late stage of the tumors evolution in the PAX-fusion positive RMS tumors. PAX3-FOXO1 fusion occurs before the whole genome duplication event. Intriguingly, a recent report of the clonal evolution in two cases of relapsed fusion-negative RMS tumors after chemotherapy and radiation demonstrated that recurrent tumors are derived from the founding tumor&#x02019;s minor clone [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Nevertheless given that survival following relapse is 30% [<xref rid="pgen.1005075.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], our findings that LOH of 11p15.5 and mutation of RAS genes form the &#x0201c;trunk&#x0201d; of the fusion negative RMS tumors has important therapeutic implications; at least in theory it is preferable for treatment to target mutations that are present in all of the tumor cells. In addition, while further biologic validation is required, our analysis identifies candidate lesions that may underpin the ability of the minor clone to survive therapy and proliferate during relapse or metastasis. Thus given clonal evolution and heterogeneity, our data suggests that future efforts to understand the emergence of resistant clones should include deep sequencing analysis on all patients at presentation and relapse. These efforts will add to the growing understanding of the biology of RMS and identify actionable genetic aberrations for targeted therapies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Patient samples</title><p>All patient sample collection was approved by the institutional review board of the participating facility.

If a mutation occurred on allele &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; before the duplication (the pink circle), its mutant copy gets duplicated as well and thus the VAF is 2/3. On the contrary, if a mutation occurred after the duplication (the light green circle), there is only one mutant copy and the VAF is 1/3. The occurrence time of the duplication can be inferred by comparing the number of mutations with VAF = 1/3 to the number of mutations with VAF = 2/3.

Since our method estimates the mutation accumulation speed for individual chromosome groups (with unique copy number, LAF and somatic VAF distribution) independently, the consistent estimates of mutation accumulation speed from different chromosome groups can be an indicator of the robustness of our method. (a) shows that the mutations speed estimated independently from different chromosome groups of sample RMS2110 are consistent&#x02014;standard deviation is 0.063, &#x0003c;1/10 of the mean 0.6791 (per megabase across the cancer lifespan). Such consistency is further shown in (b), by comparing the number of mutations accumulated on each chromosomes and the length of the chromosomes. As expected, the number of accumulated mutations is largely associated with the length of chromosomes (coefficient of determination r<sup>2</sup> = 0.9985), indicating strong robustness of the estimation. (c) The robustness is observed on multiple other samples which also have multiple chromosome groups to infer the mutation speed independently. The well fitted regression lines and high coefficient of determination confirm the robustness of the method.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1005075.s009.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1005075.s010"><label>S9 Fig</label><caption><title>Summary of evolutionary history of 44 rhabdomyosarcoma.</title><p>The evolutionary history timelines were built by inserting the timing of recurrent lesions, in percentage, into the cancer lifespan.

Therefore, it is likely that the chromosomes are of tetrasomy&#x02014;a mutation with 0.25 VAF is expected to have mutant on 1 out of 4 copies. It is also possible that the mutations of 0.25 VAF come from a subclone that is present in 50% of tumor cell; however such phenomenon occurs in 17 PFP tumors and it is unlikely that all these 17 tumors have the same subclonal composition. Interestingly, by timing the tetrasomy chromosome by chromosome, we found that the tetrasomy duplication happens around the same time for all the chromosomes, as shown in (b), suggesting an endoreduplication event.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1005075.s014.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1005075.s015"><label>S14 Fig</label><caption><title>Protein and position of the <italic>PKN1</italic> mutations.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1005075.s015.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1005075.s016"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Cancer evolutionary history of 44 RMS samples.</title><p>Listed are fusion status, sample ID, age, normal cell contamination rate, occurrence time of whole genome duplication, number of clones, occurrence time of chromosomal aneuploidy, and occurrence time of nonsynonymous mutations.
