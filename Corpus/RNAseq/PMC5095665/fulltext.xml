Sometimes, one gene can have more than one PAS, which can produce the alternative polyadenylation (APA) phenomenon and affect the stability, localization and translation of the mRNA. In this study, we discovered 28,363 PASs using pig RNAseq data, with 13,033 located in 7,403 genes. Among the genes, 41% were identified to have more than one PAS. PAS distribution analysis indicated that the PAS position was highly variable in genes. Additionally, the analysis of RNAseq data from the liver and testis showed a difference in their PAS number and usage. RT-PCR and qRT-PCR were performed to confirm our findings by detecting the expression of 3&#x02032;UTR isoforms for five candidate genes. The analysis of RNAseq data under a different androstenone level and salmonella inoculation indicated that the functional usage of PAS might participate in the immune response and may be related to the androstenone level in pigs. This study provides new insights into pig PAS and facilitates further functional research of PAS.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>In eukaryotes, polyadenylation is an essential step for mRNA maturation and the subsequent execution of gene function. In the process, multiple enzymes first recognize poly(A) signals, such as cleavage/polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), cleavage stimulation factor (CstF) and cleavage factor I (CFI), and then cleavage occurs at the 3&#x02032; ends of mRNAs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Subsequently, poly(A) tail addition modifies mRNA at the cleavage site (also called the polyadenylation site, PAS), catalysed by CPSF, polyadenylated polymerase (PAP), polyadenylated binding protein II (PAB II) and RNA polymerase II (RNAP II)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. The poly(A) tail in eukaryotic mRNA plays a key role in its stability, translation and transport<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. A short or absent poly(A) tail might lead to the degradation of the transcript and changes in the abundance of gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. However, more than one PAS can exist in protein coding genes and long non-coding RNAs in eukaryotes and produce various transcript isoforms with different lengths<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> in a process, called alternative polyadenylation (APA), which depends on the PAS number and poly(A) signals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. APA can change the length and composition of 3&#x02032;UTR and alter its ability to bind with various regulatory elements, such as miRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs); it can also change the expression of genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Not surprisingly, APA has been widely reported to be functionally important. Additionally, when PASs are located in introns or ORF regions, APA can also alter the coding sequence (CDS) and produce different proteins for a gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Recently, many studies have observed the global shortening of 3&#x02032;UTRs associated with diseases, such as cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, myotonic dystrophy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p><p>APA has been found in pig genes and associated with some important traits. The porcine <italic>GBP1</italic> gene is a negative regulator of the T-cell response, the gene expression of which might be associated with viremia levels and lower weight gain following porcine reproduction and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Recently, Gol <italic>et al</italic>. found that a <italic>G</italic> to <italic>A</italic> mutation in the porcine <italic>GBP1</italic> gene was associated with its expression. Interestingly, different alleles of the mutation affected the usage of two PASs in 3&#x02032;UTR of <italic>GBP1</italic> gene. The distal PAS is more commonly used in all test samples, and the short transcript is generated by the proximal PAS when the <italic>A</italic> allele is present<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. The study suggested that the APA participates in the formation of different lengths of transcripts and results in various expressions for <italic>GBP1</italic>. To better understand the mechanism of oocyte maturation in pigs, two porcine genes <italic>cyclin B1</italic> and <italic>Cdc2</italic>, the components of maturation/M-phase promotion factor (MPF) and key players in the maturation of mammalian oocytes, were characterized during the <italic>in vitro</italic> maturation (IVM) of pig oocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. The results showed that two isoforms of the <italic>cyclin B1</italic> gene underwent polyadenylation beginning at approximately 24&#x02009;hr and continuing to 44&#x02009;hr of IVM, suggesting that <italic>cyclin B1</italic> was regulated post-transcriptionally by polyadenylation during IVM. Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. also found the <italic>cyclin B1</italic> short isoform, <italic>GDF9</italic> and <italic>C-mos</italic> genes underwent more intensive polyadenylation modification in cyclopiazonic acid treated oocytes than control oocytes, which indicated that polyadenylation might influence Ca(2+)-modulated changes in gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Polyadenylation signals and the expression of the <italic>CYP51</italic> (cytochrome P450, family 51) gene were identified in pigs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. The shorter size of the 1.8-kb transcript was generated through the usage of an unusual polyadenylation signal and was only found in the testis, not in the epididymis. The aforementioned observations indicated that APA is commonly present in the pig genome and associated with porcine traits. However, to our knowledge, a genome-wide analysis of the PAS in the pig genome has not yet been conducted.</p><p>Since the completion of pig genome sequencing project, a large number of transcriptome analyses have been conducted, making possible a genome-wide analysis of PAS in pigs. In this study, we used currently published transcriptome data containing more than 12 billion reads to identify 28,363 positive PASs in pigs. We annotated pig PASs and analysed the physical position and distribution of PAS in pig genome. Additionally, the differences in PAS number and usage between the liver and testis were also analysed. Finally, using the RNAseq data under a different androstenone levels and salmonella inoculation, we concluded that the functional usage of PAS might participate in the immune response and may be related to the androstenone level in pigs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to reveal pig PAS at the genome-wide level, the PAS distribution in the genome and the functional usage of PAS under these conditions. These results provide new insights into pig PAS and facilitate further functional research of PAS.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Polyadenylation sites and annotation</title><p>The pig polyadenylation site (PAS) was discovered using all RNAseq data collected, with a total of 12.2 billion RNAseq reads after filtering out low-quality and short reads using Trimmomatic software<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. The alignment of raw reads was performed using bowtie2 software, and 4.8 billion reads failed to be aligned to the pig genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). In the unmapped reads, 38.3 million RNAseq reads were identified as candidate polyadenylated reads starting or ending with at least 10 consecutive A or T with 10% mismatch allowed for either case as described in Materials and Methods. In total, we obtained 13.8 million polyadenylated reads that mapped to the genome when A and T residues were trimmed. After selecting the unique mapping reads and filtering out potential cases of internal priming in the genome, we obtained 1.9 million polyadenylated reads and identified a total of 69,496 putative PASs, which were classified into 28,363 clusters by considering the adjacent PASs (separated by less than 20&#x02009;bp) as one. The large majority of PASs (63.8%) showed no heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Two PASs and more than two PASs were grouped in 14.8% and less than 22% of cases, respectively. Positive PASs were estimated according to the covered reads for PASs in each cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p><p>Pig PASs were first annotated using the annotated files from the Ensembl database with a total of 30,585 gene transcripts and 21,630 protein coding genes (genes version is <italic>Sus_scrofa.Sscrofa10.2.81</italic>). Among the 28,363 positive PASs described above, 13,033 PASs (47%) were located in a total of 7,403 genes with different gene regions, with 34% pig genes annotated with PAS. Among the 13,033 PASs, 7,900 (61%) were located in 3&#x02032;UTRs, 3,441 (26%) in introns and 2,187 (17%) in ORFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The remaining 15,330 PASs were located in non-annotated gene regions. Additionally, a de novo transcriptome analysis was performed using all RNAseq data. After the intersection between 15,330 PASs and de novo transcripts, we obtained 6,806 PASs (24%) overlapping with the regions of de novo genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Therefore, a total of 19,839 (70%) PASs obtained were located in gene regions and 8,524 (30%) PASs in intergenic regions.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>PAS distribution in the pig genome</title><p>The distribution of PAS in genes was analysed using all PASs. PAS was observed in 3&#x02032;UTRs and 5,489 (74%) associated genes, 37.5% of which showed alternative polyadenylation, leading to different lengths of 3&#x02032;UTRs. A total of 40.9% of genes were also identified to have alternative PAS, and we plotted the average position of PAS following the stop codon according to the number of PASs (one to six PASs). The standard deviations displayed that the position of PAS in genes is highly variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). We also presented the distance between adjacent PASs per gene, and 45% PASs showed that the distance of two adjacent PASs was less than 1&#x02009;kb, indicating the high frequency of close PAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Additionally, the genomic distance between adjacent PASs per gene displayed two models in 3&#x02032;UTRs and genes, with one peak at ~300&#x02009;nt for 3&#x02032;UTRs and three peaks at ~200&#x02009;nt, ~2000&#x02009;nt and ~8000&#x02009;nt for genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). A similar distribution was observed in the left peak (200&#x02013;300&#x02009;nt) for 3&#x02032;UTRs and genes, and the last two peaks for genes were mainly attributed to introns. When using only the first PAS located in 3&#x02032;UTRs following the stop codon per gene, the distance between the stop codon and the first downstream PAS had a median value of 307&#x02009;nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The differences of PAS between tissues</title><p>Here, we discovered the differences of PAS in terms of PAS number and usage using the PASs identified from data sets of the liver and testis (SRP018524)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, resulting in 12,777 and 14,375 PASs in the liver and testis, respectively. Approximately 21% of total PASs were commonly present in the two tissues, whereas others uniquely existed in one tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>), which implied that the PAS number varied between the liver and testis. In addition, the usage of the common PASs was analysed using the edgeR program, and the results illustrated that most of the common PASs had various usages between the two tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Therefore, both PAS number and usage were different between the liver and testis.</p><p>With a further comparison among tissues, we discovered PAS in four data sets (liver of pigs with high androstenone, liver of pigs with low androstenone, testis of pigs with high androstenone and testis of pigs with high androstenone) and the PAS information was listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables S3&#x02013;S6</xref>, with the commonness and difference in the PAS number among the four groups shown by an upset R program<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. The results indicated that the number of common PAS is larger in the same tissue than in a different tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Additionally, we compared the absolute value of PAS usage in a PAS among the four groups. Two examples from our results were used to indicate the different usage of PAS under various tissues and conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). The <italic>HADHA</italic> gene has been identified to have a total of four PASs, and the first PAS produces a shorter 3&#x02032;UTR and only exists in the testis. The last three PASs produce relatively longer 3&#x02032;UTR and show various usages among the four groups. <italic>ACADM</italic> is a reverse transcription gene with five PASs found along it, the usages of which are diverse between the liver and testis as well as under different conditions. The aforementioned results illustrate that PAS number and usage have sharp differences between the liver and testis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Relationship between the functional usage of PAS and pig traits</title><p>Two data sets, ERP004640 and SRP018524, were selected to analyse PAS function under a different androstenone level and salmonella inoculation, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, including biological replications as well as control and treatment conditions. PAS was first discovered from the two data sets; then, PASs with different usages and their associated genes were identified for gene functional analysis in terms of corresponding conditions (see Materials and Methods).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>PAS usage related to the androstenone level of pigs</title><p>The RNAseq data of the testis and liver were collected from ten pigs with two different androstenone levels (five pigs with high androstenone and five with low androstenone), enabling us to discover the different-usage PASs in the testis and liver under the two conditions. According to PASs obtained from the four data sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables S3&#x02013;S6</xref>), the different-usage PASs under the two conditions were investigated. In the liver, 84 PASs showed usages that were statistically significant, with at least a 2-fold difference and a FDR less than 0.05 (FDR &#x0003c;0.05, |log2FC| &#x02265;1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S7</xref>). All of them displayed high usages in the liver of pigs with low androstenone, and 36 protein-coding genes harboured them. Gene ontology analysis indicated that the significant high-usage PAS-associated genes were mainly involved in lipid binding, steroid metabolic process, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and the metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) in terms of molecular function, biological process and KEGG pathway enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S8</xref>). These results indicate that the high-usage PASs have a close relationship with liver function in pigs with a low level of androstenone.</p><p>In the testis, 29 PASs showed different usages that were statistically significant (FDR &#x0003c;0.05, |log2FC| &#x02265;1) between high and low androstenone conditions. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S9</xref>), and 19 associated genes harboured the PASs. Gene ontology analyses displayed that some of the genes were involved in spermatogenesis, translation and gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S10</xref>), suggesting that the different-usage PASs might be related to the testis function of pigs at the androstenone level.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>PAS usage participates in the immune response of pigs after salmonella inoculation</title><p>One of the RNAseq data sets we downloaded was collected from 16 pigs, including 8 pigs with low shedding and 8 pigs with persistent shedding. Peripheral blood was collected before (day 0) and two days after (day 2) salmonella inoculation. After PAS detection, we found 20 PASs with a statistically significant difference in usage between two time points (FDR &#x0003c;0.05, |log2FC| &#x02265;1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S11</xref>). Additionally, 16 porcine genes harboured the different-usage PASs. Gene ontology analysis of the different-usage PAS-associated genes showed the involvement of some of the genes in the inflammatory response and defence response. Two of the genes, <italic>IL18</italic> and <italic>SELL</italic>, were presented as the examples for different-usage PASs under various conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). These results show that PAS with a different usage might participate in the immune process after salmonella inoculation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>PAS validation</title><p>As two or more PASs could produce more than one transcript with different lengths of the 3&#x02032;UTR for a gene, we detected the expression of 3&#x02032;UTR isoforms to confirm corresponding PASs. We selected five genes (<italic>TRAPPC2</italic>, <italic>HNF4A</italic>, <italic>EIF4H</italic>, <italic>FLVCR2</italic> and <italic>RAB33B</italic>) from annotated PASs we discovered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>), which contained ten PASs in their 3&#x02032;UTRs. To confirm the PASs, we performed RT-PCR with the use of a common proximal primer and two specific distal primers for each gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a&#x02013;e</xref>). The short PCR product corresponds to the expression of total isoforms, and the longer one specified the expression of the long isoform. These assays indicate that the proximal PASs of five genes existed in the testis, and the proximal PAS of <italic>TRAPPC2</italic> was also found in liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we performed qRT-PCR experiments for further confirmation of the PASs with the use of primers that amplify all 3&#x02032;UTR isoforms for a gene (total) or only the longer 3&#x02032;UTR isoform (long) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8f</xref>). The results, displayed as a ratio of total/long isoforms, show the 4- to 9-fold increased expression of all 3&#x02032;UTR isoforms in the testis and approximately 7-fold for first gene in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8g</xref>), which are consistent with the RT-PCR results. Altogether, these analyses confirmed our findings and validated the computational method.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the process of PAS detection, polyadenylated reads were identified with at least ten A or T residues, a standard obviously higher than that with five A or T residues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Additionally, the internal priming was eliminated in the pig genome sequence, which generated PAS with a low false positive rate. Despite the strict criteria used in the process of PAS discovery and the high positive PAS obtained, the results did not represent the comprehensive PAS in pigs due to the lower number of polyadenylated reads. We only obtained 1.92 million polyadenylated reads uniquely mapped to the pig genome from the original 12.2 billion RNAseq reads. The low discovery rate (0.016%) made the wide discovery of PAS in pigs, as well as in some rare sequencing species, difficult. Direct RNA sequencing (DRS) has been used for PAS discovery in humans and yeasts; this process does not require the conversion of RNA molecules to cDNA and eliminates the bias for ligation or amplification<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Additionally, poly(A) site sequencing (PAS-Seq) has also been developed for profiling RNA polyadenylation at the transcriptome level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Recently, whole transcriptome termini site sequencing (WTTS-Seq) is an effective library preparation method to maximize transcriptomic investigation and validate transcriptome-wide APA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Both the methods could obtain more polyadenylated reads than whole transcriptome shot gun sequencing. Therefore, PAS-Seq and other methods should be developed for the more accurate detection of pig PASs in the future.</p><p>In this study, we found that 13,033 PASs overlapped with annotated genes, 26% of which were located in intron regions, probably due to intron retention in the process of mRNA maturation from pre-mRNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and transcript production with a different number of exons. PAS was common in 3&#x02032;UTRs (61%) but occurred less in ORFs (17%), leading to different exon lengths and further protein synthesis. The PAS located in 3&#x02032;UTRs always produces genes with short 3&#x02032;UTRs and increases gene expression by the lack of some microRNA target sequences<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Additionally, Bin Tian found 29,283 and 16,282 PASs in humans and mice, respectively, and 54% and 32% of the PAS-associated genes exhibited alternative polyadenylation, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. In the present study, we found 28,363 PASs associated with 7,403 pig genes, 41% of which harboured alternative polyadenylation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The analysis of PAS annotation showed that 30% of total PASs were located in intergenic regions, which might contain some protein coded genes or small non-annotated RNAs. From the results, we speculated that the current imperfect annotation of pig genes made some PASs difficult to annotate, which might affect PAS annotation in gene features. Further study is needed to fill the gaps in pig gene annotation.</p><p>In our results, we found that the PAS number and usage varies between the liver and testis. More than one PAS can exist in genes, such as <italic>HADHA</italic> and <italic>ACADM</italic> genes. It is difficult to determine which PAS is more highly used than others. However, a usage comparison of the same PAS illustrates that PAS varies among different tissues, which is also supported by other reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Furthermore, the prominent differences in PAS number and usage could indicate alternative polyadenylation, which might alter the gene expression and be associated with different functions among tissues.</p><p>Alternative polyadenylation might depend on the environment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> and is implicated in many diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. PAS number and usage provide the possibility for alternative polyadenylation. With changing environments such as bacterial inoculation, PAS number and usage might also vary, leading to the occurrence of alternative polyadenylation. In this study, we discovered different-usage PASs and associated genes by RNAseq data before and after salmonella inoculation. Some of the PASs displayed high usage after infection and the associated genes were involved in immune responses, which implied that PAS might participate in the immune process as one of the immune mechanisms in disease development.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Data generation</title><p>All pig RNAseq data sets used for PAS discovery and functional analysis were obtained from SRA in NCBI (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra</ext-link>) and one of the data sets was from our own unpublished data.

In step 1, RNAseq data were extracted from sra files downloaded using fastq-dump and the split-3 parameter was used for the extraction of pair-end reads, followed by filtering read quality and read length using Trimmomatic software<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. After that, we aligned RNAseq reads from each data set to the <italic>Sus scrofa</italic> 10.2 genome (Ensembl database) by the bowtie2 program<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. For each data set, alignment was performed with the sensitive setting (<italic>-D 15 -R 2 -N 0 -L 22 -i S, 1, 1.15</italic>) in the &#x02018;end-to-end&#x02019; model. Meanwhile, <italic>un-conc</italic> and <italic>un</italic> parameters in the bowtie2 programme were used to extract unmapped reads from pair-end and single-end data sets, respectively.</p><p>In step 2, the reads that failed to be aligned to the pig genome were examined to identify polyadenylated reads<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. Two strategies were adopted to extracted polyadenylated reads in terms of different libraries building types of RNAseq. For non-strand specific data, we extracted all reads that either started or ended with a run of at least ten consecutive As or Ts. In either case, error bases in homopolymers were allowed with a 10% mismatch. For strand-specific RNAseq data, we extracted the first reads containing at least ten consecutive T at 5&#x02032; end or second reads containing at least ten consecutive A at the 3&#x02032; end, also with a 10% mismatch allowed. The <italic>FindTail</italic> programme was used for the discovery of A and T residues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. Here, we used criteria of at least 10 consecutive A or T with a 10% mismatch allowed in each case, which were higher than those suggested by Dong <italic>et al</italic>.</p><p>In step 3, terminal A or T residues in candidate polyadenylated reads extracted from each data set were trimmed using a custom perl script, and the trimmed reads with a length less than 20 bp were discarded. All the trimmed reads were pooled and mapped back to <italic>Sus scrofa</italic> 10.2 genome by bowtie2 with one mismatch parameter (<italic>N 1</italic>). After that, uniquely mapped reads were selected for the next step.</p><p>In step 4, to eliminate the possibility that reads are not polyadenylated, the internal priming issue was considered due to the common presence of consecutive A or T residues in the genome sequence, which might lead to false positive PAS. The <italic>CleanSam.pl</italic> script was used to scan the sequence of the <italic>Sus scrofa</italic> 10.2 genome around PASs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. Briefly, we removed putative PASs where the downstream genomic regions contained at least nine consecutive A or T residues.</p><p>In step 5, the remaining reads were combined and clustered so that all reads aligning to the same strand and ending within twenty nucleotides were classified into a cluster. In each cluster, PAS covered with at least three reads were retained and the PASs covered by the most reads were determined as positive sites for further analysis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>PAS annotation</title><p>The annotated pig gene file (Sus_scrofa.Sscrofa10.2.81.gtf) obtained from the Ensembl database was used first for PAS annotation; then, de novo transcripts were detected using all RNAseq data to fill the gap in the PAS annotation caused by the former annotated file. Alignment was performed for each RNAseq data set using Hisat2 software with &#x02013;dta-cufflinks parameter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>.
