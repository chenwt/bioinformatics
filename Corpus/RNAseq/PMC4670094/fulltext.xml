Previous studies have shown mutant <italic>HTT</italic> can alter expression of genes associated with dysregulated epigenetic modifications. One of the most widely studied chromatin modifications is trimethylated lysine 4 of histone 3 (H3K4me3). Here, we conducted the first comprehensive study of H3K4me3 ChIP-sequencing in neuronal chromatin from the prefrontal cortex of six HD cases and six non-neurologic controls, and its association with gene expression measured by RNA-sequencing. We detected 2,830 differentially enriched H3K4me3 peaks between HD and controls, with 55% of them down-regulated in HD. Although H3K4me3 signals are expected to be associated with mRNA levels, we found an unexpected discordance between altered H3K4me3 peaks and mRNA levels. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis of the genes with differential H3K4me3 peaks, revealed statistically significantly enriched GO terms only in the genes with down-regulated signals in HD. The most frequently implicated biological process terms are organ morphogenesis and positive regulation of gene expression. More than 9,000 H3K4me3 peaks were located not near any recognized transcription start sites and approximately 36% of these &#x0201c;distal&#x0201d; peaks co-localized to known enhancer sites. Six transcription factors and chromatin remodelers are differentially enriched in HD H3K4me3 distal peaks, including EZH2 and SUZ12, two core subunits of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Moreover, PRC2 repressive state was significantly depleted in HD-enriched peaks, suggesting the epigenetic role of PRC2 inhibition associated with up-regulated H3K4me3 in Huntington&#x02019;s disease. In summary, our study provides new insights into transcriptional dysregulation of Huntington&#x02019;s disease by analyzing the differentiation of H3K4me3 enrichment.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Jerry McDonald HD Research Fund and Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health grants, National Institute of Neurological disorders and stroke (R01 NS073947; Epigenetic Markers in Huntington's disease Brain) National Institute of Mental Health (R01 MH106056; Higher Order Chromatin and Genetic Risk for Schizophrenia).

Neuropathologically, HD patients exhibit neuronal cell loss and gliosis, primarily in the striatum, but also involving the cerebral cortex and other brain regions [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although there are currently no effective treatments for persons afflicted with HD, recent trials of creatine monohydrate among asymptomatic HD gene carriers suggest it may have potential to delay the disease onset [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The cause of HD is an expansion in the number of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the coding region of exon 1 of the Huntingtin (<italic>HTT</italic>) gene [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In comparison to the normal <italic>HTT</italic> allele, which ranges from 8 to 35 triplet repeats, mutant <italic>HTT</italic> (<italic>mHTT</italic>) contains 36 or more repeats resulting in an expanded polyglutamine tract [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Repeats between 36 and 39 units show reduced penetrance [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The toxic <italic>mHTT</italic> expansion induces numerous and widespread aberrant molecular effects. Transcriptional dysregulation has been proposed to be a central component of HD pathogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Altered gene expression has been reported [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and several studies support alterations at one or more of the stages of RNA processing, translation, protein post-translational modification and trafficking [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Previous studies show that mHTT protein physically binds CREB-binding protein (CBP) and blocks both CBP&#x02019;s transcription coactivator function in human and mice [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and its histone acetyltransferase activity in Drosophila [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Studies in mouse models of HD further illustrate that transcriptional dysfunction is associated with histone hypoacetylation [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Elevated expression of ERG-associated protein with SET domain (ESET) in HD patients and in the R6/2 transgenic mouse model increases abnormal trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The decreased expression of acetylcholine receptor 1 (CHRM1) in HD also affects H3K9me3-mediated chromatin remodeling [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Interestingly, the gene expression changes in HD are usually associated with dysregulated epigenetic modifications [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>One of the most widely studied histone modifications is trimethylated lysine 4 of histone 3 (H3K4me3) [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

Recently, studies in the R6/2 HD transgenic mouse model revealed that H3K4me3 may play a critical role in the pathway leading to transcriptional dysregulation in HD [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our earlier study found that epigenetic changes in the <italic>HES4</italic> gene are associated with reduced H3K4me3 and increased DNA methylation in its promoter, and showed that these changes were closely correlated with degeneration in the striatum of HD patients [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These previous findings motivated us to investigate the genome-wide pattern of H3K4me3 in HD. In the current study, we conducted the first chromatin immunoprecipitation using anti-H3K4me3 antibody followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments on NeuN-selected neuronal cell nuclei from post-mortem prefrontal cortical samples for six HD cases and six non-neurologic controls.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>H3K4me3 modification enrichment characteristics</title><p>We analyzed H3K4me3 enrichment in FACS sorted neuronal nuclei derived from postmortem prefrontal cortex (BA9) of six HD cases and six non-neurological controls (<xref rid="pone.0144398.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

We found that most peaks (59.2%) were called in all twelve samples (<xref rid="pone.0144398.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>) and on average 63% of total H3K4me3 ChIP-seq reads were mapped to TSS-proximal peaks. These are consistent with our prior data showing that H3K4me3 is enriched in promoters and similar across different individuals [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

Consistent with our GO analysis above indicating that many genes with down-regulated H3K4me3 in HD are enriched in extracellular or membrane GO terms, our pathway analysis found that these genes tend to be clustered at the cellular membrane and located in the upper ranks in the signaling pathways and the extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction pathway.</p><p>We also calculated the enriched pathways for DEGs.

To investigate their potential regulatory functions, we first assessed whether they overlapped with genomic regions with other regulatory signals. Recent progress in functional genomics has amassed many biochemical data for regulatory elements, including the co-occurring histone marks of H3K4me1 and K3K27ac [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], bidirectional CAGE signal at promoters [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], hotspot of transcription factor binding sites [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], clustered DNaseI hypersensitive sites [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and enriched eQTLs [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. By aligning these signals from prefrontal cortex and other cortical related brain regions with our H3K4me3 data, we found interestingly many of the distal H3K4me3 peaks co-localize with regulatory elements defined by these signals. For example, although the distal peak in <xref rid="pone.0144398.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref> was called in both HD and control samples, it is much stronger in HD. It harbors eleven SNPs that were shown to be eQTLs in brain (black vertical lines in <xref rid="pone.0144398.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). Notably, this region is also centered on ChIP-seq peak of enhancer marks of H3K27ac and H3K4me1 on human frontal cortex from the Roadmap Epigenomics project. Active enhancers often correspond to open chromatin regions, which facilitate binding of transcription factors. Indeed, this region has open chromatin (the DNase track in <xref rid="pone.0144398.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>) and is bound by more than 20 transcription factors (ENCODE TFs ChIP-Seq track in <xref rid="pone.0144398.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>) particularly those known key factors for facilitating the 3D structure of chromatin, such as CTCF [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and SP1 [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Finally, CAGE, a technique for capturing the 5&#x02032; end of mature transcripts, was recently found useful for identifying active enhancers based on a bi-directional signal [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. It showed clear bi-directional signals at this region and an enhancer was predicted by FANTOM5 consortium (CAGE track in <xref rid="pone.0144398.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). Furthermore, we also found that the role of distal peaks as enhancers is also supported by the aggregated signal of CAGE tags, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, and DNase I on all distal peaks (<xref rid="pone.0144398.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Transcription directionality based on the CAGE data from the FANTOM5 project further supports this view (<xref rid="pone.0144398.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>).

We found that the repressed Polycomb state, representing the H3K27me3 signal, is depleted in the distal peak regions with significantly enriched H3K4me3 signal in HD (hypergeometric test p-value = 4.66x10<sup>-5</sup>), but not in control-enriched distal peaks (hypergeometric test p-value = 0.39).

Our result of PRC2 depletion in the regions with increased H3K4me3 in HD might suggest that the epigenetic role of PRC2 inhibition is caused by up-regulated H3K4me3 in Huntington&#x02019;s disease.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec009"><title>Discussion</title><p>While patterns of H3K4me3 have been previously studied in the R6/2 mouse model of HD [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], we believe this is the first genome wide study of this mark in human HD versus control brains. We had previously performed mRNA-sequencing in a series of 20 HD and 49 non-neurological control brains, and therefore, we were able to compare the patterns of H3K4me3 enrichment with 961 differentially expressed mRNAs (FDR q&#x0003c;0.01) in HD and control brains (Labadorf et al. submitted). Because 50% to 90% of neurons have degenerated in the HD striatum, even among low-grade HD cases [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], we chose to analyze the prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9). While the hallmarks of HD pathology (e.g. intranuclear inclusion bodies) are present in the prefrontal cortex, the extent of neuronal degeneration is considerably less severe than that seen in the striatum [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Some of the HD samples studied here have been previously studied by microRNA-sequencing and mRNA-sequencing of the same region of the prefrontal cortex [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] (Labadorf et al. submitted).</p><p>In this study, we sought to minimize the biases introduced by simple neurodegeneration in two ways. First, the H3K4me3 ChIP-sequencing was performed in NeuN+ sorted neuronal nuclei [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Thus, the contrast is specific to neurons in both HD and controls and accounts for possible differences in the densities of specific cell types in the HD brain due to degeneration or reactive gliosis. Second, the prefrontal cortex (BA9), a region with mild neuropathological involvement in HD [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], was selected for analysis. A total of 28,608 H3K4me3 peaks were defined in the combined HD and control samples. While most peaks (93.5%) were called in both HD and control brains and a majority (59.2%) were called in all twelve samples studied, 961 were uniquely called in HD brain and 889 were uniquely called in controls (<xref rid="pone.0144398.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144398.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>). The H3K4me3 mark is known to mark active transcription start sites (TSS), and 65.8% of the called peaks were located within 1,000 bp of an annotated TSS (designated &#x0201c;proximal peaks&#x0201d;). Both the proximal peaks and distal peaks (positioned at greater than 1000 bp of an annotated TSS) were robustly called with confident read depths (<xref rid="pone.0144398.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>).</p><p>In the differential analysis of H3K4me3 peaks, 720 proximal peaks were differentially enriched, and these were primarily down-regulated among HD cases relative to controls (104 up-regulated and 616 down-regulated in HD). In contrast, 260 distal peaks were differentially enriched, and these were primarily up-regulated in HD relative to controls (209 up-regulated and 51 down-regulated in HD). These findings suggest that proximal and distal H3K4me3 peaks perform different functions and respond differently to the pathology initiated by the mutant HTT protein.</p><p>The H3K4me3 mark is known to associate with active gene transcription, and this relationship is confirmed in this study, where high versus low H3K4me3 proximal peak density and was strongly related to high versus low mRNA expression (<xref rid="pone.0144398.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> p-value &#x0003c; 2.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>). It should be noted however, that for the 720+961 &#x0201c;differential&#x0201d; genes, the rho for both HD and controls is reduced, although more in HD (Spearman rho = 0.33) than in controls (rho = 0.4). In contrast however, differentially enriched H3K4me3 proximal peaks were not associated with increased expression of the implicated genes. Few genes with differential enrichment of H3K4me3 density showed differential mRNA levels. The disruption of the regulatory influence of the H3K4me3 enrichment on gene expression in HD brains provides strong evidence for transcriptional dysregulation as a major component in disease expression in HD (see Fig <xref rid="pone.0144398.g002" ref-type="fig">2B and 2C</xref>), as has been previously proposed [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], or it may suggest that additional epigenetic marks or mechanisms are required to better explain the full range of transcriptional dysregulation associated with the disease [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>The genes with the most differentially enriched H3K4me3 marks at their TSS are <italic>ALG14</italic> (Asparagine (N) glycosylation) which regulates protein folding and stability; <italic>LRRTM2 (</italic>leucine rich repeat transmembrane neuronal 2), involved in development of excitatory synapses; <italic>HES4</italic> (Hairy And Enhancer Of Split 4) which is involved in protein dimerization and transcription factor binding; and <italic>COX7B</italic> (Cytochrome C Oxidase Subunit 7B) which is a terminal component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

Notably, 718 (74.7%) of the 961 DEGs are up regulated in HD, suggesting that one might expect to see an increase in differential H3K4me3 enrichment at the TSS of these DEGs. However, only 58 of the 720 differential H3K4me3 proximal peaks are associated with DEGs, and only 20 of these (2.8% of the 720) are in the expected regulatory direction (18 down-regulated DEGs have reduced differential H3K4me3, and 2 up-regulated DEGs have increased differential H3K4me3 enrichment), suggesting that differential H3K4me3 is not responsible for the DEGs. This result holds with a previous study [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] where genome-wide analysis of H3K4me3 and RNAseq in the 12-week cortex of R6/2 mouse revealed a high degree of overlap between genes with decreased expression and decreased H3K4me3 levels (e.g. 293 in down:down, 24 in up:up). Although the mouse data may not be directly comparable, by simply checking the orthologs of the 293 down:down genes in our human data we found that most of these genes also have a down:down relationship (i.e. decreased H3K4me3 levels and decreased expression in HD). While both studies found consistent results for the selected genes and there is a large overlap between genes with same direction change in expression and H3K4me3 levels, nonetheless, a proportion of genes were found not infrequently and unexpectedly in opposite directions in both studies. This discordant pattern holds up in an examination of the concordance of the GO enriched terms for down-regulated DEGs overlap with increased differential H3K4me3 signals described below.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Analysis of GO term enrichment for genes at enriched H3K4me3 peaks</title><p>In an analysis of GO term enrichment only the genes associated with down-regulated peaks in HD showed significant GO terms, with a total of 166 enriched GO terms.

However, several studies support that H3K4me3 can mark enhancers as well [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In this study we projected the commonly known regulatory marks on H3K4me3 peaks and found that the distal peaks show largely similar patterns of aggregation as proximal peaks, as seen in <xref rid="pone.0144398.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>. One possibility is that some distal peaks are promoters of unannotated genes or non-coding RNAs [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. But this explanation does not appear to account for most distal peaks for the following reasons: First, if the distal H3K4me3 signal is an active promoter for an unannotated gene, one may expect a corresponding increase RNA-seq reads derived from the transcription at that position. However, most distal peaks have very low RNA-seq read coverage (0 or 1 read, see <xref rid="pone.0144398.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). Second, in our CAGE tag directionality analysis, distal peaks show a clear pattern of bidirectionality, unlike the uni-directionality for proximal peaks. This finding is consistent with the defining feature of transcribed enhancers (or eRNAs) recently characterized by the FANTOM consortium [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. By intersecting distal peaks with three known sets of enhancers, an estimated 36% of the distal H3K4me3 peaks appear to localize to enhancer sites.</p><p>It is worth noting that the distal peaks are generally less intensive than proximal peaks (<xref rid="pone.0144398.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). Although we had previously checked the specificity of the anti-H3K4me3 antibody we used, for absence of detectable immunoreactivity for the related epitopes of H3K4me2 and H3K4me1 [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], future studies are needed to explore whether the antibody detects other types of histone modification at distal peaks.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>TF differentially bound in distal peaks</title><p>We compared the TFs bound at the proximal and distal peaks, and found that the TFs associated with chromatin structuring are enriched in distal peaks. Chromatin looping allows far-distant enhancers to be brought into the proximity of promoters of protein-coding genes. Enhancers are thought to interact with protein complexes necessary for chromosome looping and to facilitate RNA Polymerase II recruitment of the promoter of the target gene. This result is consistent with the finding from a recent study using ChIA-PET interaction data that cohesin, CTCF, and ZNF143 are the key components of 3D chromatin structure [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Studies in peripheral tissues found that many of the ectopic H3K4me3 sites corresponded to enhancers bound by CTCF and cohesin [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Recently the link between distal H3K4me3 peaks and promoter-enhancer loopings has also been reported for human cerebral cortex [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].</p><p>When looking at the enriched TFs in differentially enriched H3K4me3 peaks between HD and control, we found six transcription factors have enriched binding sites in HD-specific distal peaks, including EZH2 and SUZ12. Previous studies also found the role of EZH2 for DNA hypermethylation in the epigenetic inhibition of the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4), which is important for neurodegenerative disease such as HD and Parkinson&#x02019;s disease [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. These findings may implicate the enrichment of EZH2 in the HD-specific distal H3K4me3 peaks.</p><p>EZH2 and SUZ12 are also core subunits of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Given that PRC2 should recognize the mark that EZH2 generates, the finding that PRC2 is depleted while EZH2 is enriched suggests that the H3K4me3 mark may appear preferentially on those EZH2 target regions that are not regular targets of the PRC2 complex.</p><p>H3K4me3 was recently found to inhibit PRC2 assisted by the Su(z)12 C terminus [<xref rid="pone.0144398.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Our findings of depleted PRC2 in HD-enriched H3k4me3 peak regions may indicate that increased H3K4me3 in HD is associated with PRC2 inhibition.</p><p>In summary, we examined the differential enrichment of H3K4me3 signals and the relationship of this histone mark to RNA levels in both HD and control prefrontal cortex. Genes with differential H3K4me3 signal at their promoters were rarely found to be differentially expressed. These findings support the hypothesis that transcriptional dysregulation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of HD. GO term analysis of the genes with differential H3K4me3 enrichment identified terms only among the set of genes with down-regulated H3K4me3 in HD, and most frequently implicated biological process terms with organ morphogenesis and positive regulation of gene expression. More than 9000 H3K4me3 peaks were located not near to any recognized transcription start sites and approximately 36% of these &#x0201c;distal&#x0201d; peaks co-localized to known enhancer sites. Transcription factors enriched in distal peaks, implicated the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), suggesting that H3K4me3 histone hypermethylation is linked to dysregulated polycomb activity in the HD neuronal epigenome.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec014"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec015"><title>H3K4me3 ChIP-seq sample preparation</title><p>Postmortem brain tissues from the prefrontal cortex Brodmann area 9 (BA9) were obtained from the Harvard Brain and Tissue Resource Center (HBTRC), McLean Hospital, Belmont MA.
