Evidence for the frequent occurrence of diverging ecotypes in species that inhabit multiple ecological habitats is accumulating, but experimental approaches to understanding the biological pathways as well as the underlying genetic mechanisms are still rare. Parasites are invoked as one of the major selective forces driving evolution and are themselves dependent on the ecological conditions in a given habitat. Immunological adaptation to local parasite communities is therefore expected to be a key component of local adaptation in natural populations. Here, we use next-generation sequencing technology to compare the transcriptome-wide response of experimentally infected three-spined sticklebacks from a lake and a river population, which are known to evolve under selection by distinct parasite communities. By comparing overall gene expression levels as well as the activation of functional pathways in response to parasite exposure, we identified potential differences between the two stickleback populations at several levels. Our results suggest locally adapted patterns of gene regulation in response to parasite exposure, which may reflect different local optima in the trade-off between the benefits and the disadvantages of mounting an immune response because of quantitative differences of the local parasite communities.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DGE</kwd><kwd>EST</kwd><kwd><italic>Gasterosteus aculeatus</italic></kwd><kwd>local adaptation</kwd><kwd>three-spined stickleback</kwd><kwd>transcriptome sequencing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The need for individuals to survive and reproduce successfully in a given environment is the ultimate driver of evolution. Understanding the origin and extent of local adaptation among individuals is therefore a key objective of evolutionary biology and ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Greischar &#x00026; Koskella 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Hereford 2009</xref>). Locally adapted individuals are expected to have higher fitness in their local environment in comparison with individuals from a different population and environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Kawecki &#x00026; Ebert 2004</xref>). Such patterns of higher fitness in the native environment are indeed supported by a growing number of studies from an increasing range of species, indicating that local adaptation is a frequent phenomenon in natural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Greischar &#x00026; Koskella 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Hereford 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Fraser <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). However, despite this accumulating evidence at the individual level, the underlying physiological pathways and genetic mechanisms of local adaptation are often unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Bernatchez <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Fraser <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>).</p><p>Progress in this direction has been achieved by recent studies, using two different approaches. Experimental, hypothesis-driven candidate gene approaches have investigated the advantage of locally adapted genotypes, for example at the immunologically important major histocompatibility complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Eizaguirre <italic>et al</italic>. 2012a</xref>) or at genes in involved in heat stress responses (Schwartz &#x00026; Bronikowski This Issue), and provided valuable insights into the selection pressures leading to local adaptation. Other studies have taken a different route and employed exploratory genome-wide screens to identify genes with signatures of divergent selection (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Elmer <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Renaut <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Roesti <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>; Bourret <italic>et al</italic>. This Issue; Bruneaux <italic>et al</italic>. This Issue) or differential expression (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Nolte <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Goetz <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Jeukens <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>) between distinct populations or ecotypes. Such exploratory studies often pave the way for subsequent candidate gene approaches that allow for a more detailed investigation of the underlying selection pressures and mechanisms of local adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Bernatchez <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>). The latter approaches have also been tremendously facilitated by the onset of next-generation sequencing technologies and have improved our understanding of the genetic basis of local adaptation and population differentiation on a broader scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">Tautz <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>). With these new technologies becoming more and more affordable, they offer an exciting and unprecedented opportunity for evolutionary ecology research of model and nonmodel species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Ellegren 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Ekblom &#x00026; Galindo 2011</xref>).</p><p>Here, we make use of this new technological development, but go beyond the exploratory screen for differences between populations. By combining a hypothesis-driven experimental approach with the advantages of an unbiased genome-wide assessment of differential gene expression, we aim at improving our understanding of the genetic basis of local immunological adaptation in vertebrate populations.</p><p>The immune response of hosts is expected to be under strong selection, as parasites represent one of the major selective forces in evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Haldane 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Milinski 2006</xref>). Differences in abiotic and biotic conditions between different habitats are likely to influence the presence and abundance of potential intermediate hosts as well as parasites. Such differences may lead to contrasting and habitat-specific parasite communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">Thompson 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Kaltz &#x00026; Shykoff 1998</xref>), which would in turn select for contrasting local immunogenetic adaptation of hosts that inhabit these different habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Dionne 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Eizaguirre &#x00026; Lenz 2010</xref>). The adaptation to local parasite communities is therefore an intriguing and important aspect of local adaptation in natural populations. However, the investigation into differential immunological adaptation requires detailed knowledge of the study populations and their selective environment, that is, the predominating parasites.</p><p>The three-spined stickleback (<italic>Gasterosteus aculeatus</italic>) represents an ideal study system to investigate local adaptation. It inhabits marine as well as several different freshwater habitats and is well known for its adaptive radiations across the northern hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bell &#x00026; Foster 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">Schluter &#x00026; Conte 2009</xref>). Sticklebacks in northern Germany form genetically distinct populations between lake and river habitats, which are frequently referred to as ecotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Reusch <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Eizaguirre <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). Such reduced gene flow between parapatric lake and river populations is also found for sticklebacks in northern America, indicating a repeated pattern of local adaptation to these different freshwater habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Berner <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Roesti <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). While a number of different ecological factors seem to affect population divergence in sticklebacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Kaeuffer <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>), lake and river sticklebacks have been shown to differ in their resistance to parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Kalbe &#x00026; Kurtz 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">Scharsack <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). In fact, the parasite communities of these two freshwater habitats differ quantitatively and qualitatively in their species composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Kalbe <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Eizaguirre <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>), and it has therefore been suggested that parasites play a significant role in the selection for local adaptation of lake and river sticklebacks. This hypothesis has already been proven for candidate genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which play a key role in the adaptive immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Eizaguirre <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">2012a</xref>), but the genetic basis for potential local immunological adaptation beyond the MHC genes is still elusive.</p><p>While stickleback populations seem to harbour extensive standing genetic variation (Feulner <italic>et al</italic>. This Issue), it has also been shown that gene regulation provides a powerful repertoire for adaptation to new and local environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Jones <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). To better understand the extent of immunological local adaptation in lake and river populations, we therefore exposed laboratory-bred three-spined sticklebacks to three common stickleback parasites and measured the hosts&#x02019; transcriptome-wide regulation of gene expression. This approach aimed at an unbiased estimate of which biological processes are activated in response to the parasite exposure. We hypothesize that lake sticklebacks, which are naturally exposed to a broader diversity of parasite species, have evolved a more potent general immune response, both at the innate and at the adaptive level, while river sticklebacks, which are naturally exposed only to restricted range of predominating parasites, may require more specific immune recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Eizaguirre <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">2012a</xref>).</p><p>The goals of this study are twofold: Our main aim is to explore immune system&#x02013;related transcriptional differences between lake and river sticklebacks, which may have evolved because of the well-characterized ecological differences between these two habitats and which could help explaining the previously observed difference in immunocompetence between these populations. Our second goal is to test the suitability of short read sequencing for genome-wide transcriptional profiling in molecular ecological research. For this, we employed digital gene expression analysis based on the SuperSAGE technique, which captures 26-bp-long sequence tags from the 3&#x02032;-UTR of each gene transcript, originating from a specific restriction site and thus being identical for each transcript of a specific gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Matsumura <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>). As this approach does not require any normalization for transcript length in contrast to RNAseq, it allows for a more direct quantification of the underlying transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">Soanes <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). It is furthermore unbiased with respect to the sequences that can be detected, in contrast to the usual microarray approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">&#x02018;t Hoen <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). In combination with next-generation sequencing, this technique represents a reliable and highly specific method for transcriptome-wide measurements of expression levels at an unprecedented scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Matsumura <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">Sharbel <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>). The specificity of the 26-bp tags per transcript was assured by the availability of the stickleback genome sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Jones <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>) and further secured by sequencing a pool of full-length cDNA sequences from the experimental fish.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Experimental fish, parasite exposure and dissection</title><p>Three-spined sticklebacks from a lake (Gro&#x000df;er Pl&#x000f6;ner See) and a connected river (Malenter Au) were naturally mated in the laboratory to produce pure lake and river families, respectively. Eggs were removed from the nest after fertilization and reared under standardized conditions in well water in aerated glass jars to minimize parental effects. Offspring of two lake and two river pairs, respectively, were raised in the laboratory under homogeneous conditions (18 &#x000b0;C, 16/24 h light, 10 individuals per tank) and a constant supply of frozen food. After five months, 16 randomly selected individuals of each of the four families were individually exposed to three macroparasites, two nematodes (<italic>Anguillicoloides crassus</italic>, <italic>Camallanus lacustris</italic>) and a digenean (<italic>Diplostomum pseudospathaceum</italic>), using established procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">Wegner <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Eizaguirre <italic>et al</italic>. 2012b</xref>). While <italic>A. crassus</italic> and <italic>D. pseudospathaceum</italic> occur in both original stickleback populations, <italic>C. lacustris</italic> is usually only found in lake sticklebacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Eizaguirre <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). Exposure to the three parasites took place in individual 1-l tanks and separately on three consecutive days in the following order: Each fish received nine larvae each of <italic>A. crassus</italic> and <italic>C. lacustris</italic> (via infected copepods as intermediate hosts) and 20 larvae of <italic>D. pseudospathaceum</italic>. This dosage usually results in infection rate and intensity comparable to natural exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Eizaguirre <italic>et al</italic>. 2009b</xref>). 32 randomly selected additional fish of each family were not exposed but treated in the same way, including handling and supply with an equal number of na&#x000ef;ve copepods. Fish were not fed on the day before the first exposure. After exposure, all fish were returned to larger tanks and kept in groups of eight individuals.</p><p>After 14 weeks, ten randomly selected individuals per family of the previously exposed fish were kept and exposed a second time to trigger activation of their adaptive immune system. Additionally, ten of the previously unexposed fish per family were randomly selected and now exposed for the first time. Individual exposure was again spread over three consecutive days, and each exposed fish received the same dose of each parasite larvae as before (for each of the two nematode parasites, larvae were transmitted via three infected copepods as intermediate hosts). The order in which fish were treated was randomized across all families to prevent any sequence effect between families. To serve as control, another ten of the previously unexposed fish per family were handled in the exact same way, except that their copepods did not contain any parasite larvae. While our digital analysis of gene expression was always aimed at sequencing only 24 individuals, the final number of 120 handled fish guaranteed enough backup to allow for random selection of the 24 individuals actually to be sequenced after all experimental procedures.</p><p>All 120 fish were dissected about 18 h after exposure to their last treatment in the same order as they had been handled the day before. This time point guaranteed activation of innate immunity, for example by the tissue-penetrating <italic>D. pseudospathaceum</italic> larvae, which take up to 24 h to reach their host's eye lenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">Rauch <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>), as well as activation of potential memory cells of the adaptive immune system. Fish were sacrificed with an incision into the brain, because we feared that the stress of swimming in an anaesthetic could alter gene expression in the fish and thus jeopardize the whole experiment. All fish were handled in the same way with head&#x02013;kidneys immediately stored in RNAlater for later RNA extraction. Gut, swim bladder and eyes were checked for <italic>A. crassus</italic>, <italic>C. lacustris</italic> and <italic>D. pseudospathaceum</italic> infection, respectively. All fish were dissected blind with respect to their treatment and origin, thus also unexposed fish were checked for parasites. All animal experiments described were approved by the Ministry of Agriculture, Environment and Rural areas in the State of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA library preparation and sequencing</title><p>RNA was extracted from head&#x02013;kidneys using the NucleoSpin 96 RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer's protocol, including rDNase treatment for removal of DNA. Head&#x02013;kidneys are known to represent an immunologically very active organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Press &#x00026; Evensen 1999</xref>) and are commonly selected for immunological studies in teleosts. Resulting total RNA was subsequently stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C, while an aliquot was kept for quality check on the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, USA). For individual SuperSAGE library preparation, we randomly selected RNA from one male and one female stickleback for each family and treatment among the samples with RIN value &#x02265; 7, leading to 24 individual libraries. SuperSAGE libraries were constructed by GenXPro GmbH (Frankfurt am Main, Germany) essentially as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Matsumura <italic>et al</italic>. (2010</xref>) with slight modifications. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina GA II platform. For each library, 26-bp-long tags were extracted from the sequences using the GXP-Tag sorter software provided by GenXPro GmbH. Sequencing artefacts were reduced according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Akmaev &#x00026; Wang (2004</xref>). To avoid bias during PCR of the tags, GenXPro's &#x02018;TrueQuant&#x02019; method was employed: Each tag was individually barcoded by ligating artificial random 8-base pair oligonucleotides to the tags prior to the PCR. PCR copies were identified by analysing the combination of barcodes and tags, and similar combinations were eliminated from the data set.</p><p>As the published stickleback genome originates from a North American individual, it may exhibit certain sequence divergence from our European sticklebacks, especially in the evolutionarily less-constrained untranslated regions (UTR). To assure that the relatively short SuperSAGE tags would match successfully, we therefore decided to complement the sequence information from the genome with cDNA sequence information from our experimental fish. For whole transcriptome sequencing, we pooled RNA from the above selected individuals with additional RNA from other individuals of the same families and treatments in equal proportions. Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated using a Poly(A)Purist mRNA purification kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Ambion). The normalized, full-length-enriched cDNA library was generated using a SMART cDNA library construction kit (BD Clontech, USA) and a Trimmer Direct cDNA normalization kit (Evrogen, Russia), generally following the manufacturer's protocol but with several modifications. In brief, reverse transcription of 1 &#x003bc;g of poly(A)+ mRNA was performed with an Oligo-dT with a T7 polymerase binding site at its 5&#x02032;-end. The resulting full-length-enriched, normalized cDNAs were linearly amplified by T7 RNA polymerase, resulting in a total of 10 &#x003bc;g RNA. The RNA was further processed for 454 and Illumina GAII sequencing according to the manufacturers&#x02019; protocols.</p></sec><sec><title>Data filtering and bioinformatic processing</title><p>The raw sequences of the normalized full-length cDNA library were cleaned and filtered with the following tools: First, TagCleaner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">Schmieder <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>) was used to detect and trim sequencing adaptors at both read ends. Then the Galaxy pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Blankenberg <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Giardine <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Goecks <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>) was used for grooming of quality scores, for clipping of T7 adaptors, and for quality trimming by sliding window approach (window size of 5 bp and minimum aggregate quality score of 20). Finally, the PrinSeq pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">Schmieder &#x00026; Edwards 2011</xref>) was used to filter the resulting sequences against less than 20 bp length, more than one N base, low complexity (maximum DUST score of 7), and exact read replicates. After filtering, the cDNA reads were used in a hybrid mapping assembly with the MIRA3 program under EST-optimized settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Chevreux <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>), which allows for mapping of reads from different technologies (here 454 and Illumina) against a backbone of reference transcripts and ranks among the most reliable transcriptome assembly tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Mundry <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). Such a reference-guided mapping assembly of transcriptome reads has proven to be more successful than a de novo approach (Vijay <italic>et al</italic>. This Issue). As backbone sequences in MIRA, we used all 21 449 protein-coding stickleback transcripts with associated Gene Ontology ID, representing 16 371 genes, as available through ENSEMBL BioMart (full-length cDNA including UTR sequence, ENSEMBL version 65; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Kinsella <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). The assembled sequences were then converted into a local BLAST database.</p><p>The individual SuperSAGE tags were filtered against the presence of &#x02018;Ns&#x02019; and for the occurrence in at least 7 different libraries to avoid any bias in gene expression analysis by family-specific alleles (our SuperSAGE data set included 6 individuals per family). This very conservative approach ensures that detected differences between populations are not confounded by family-specific sequence variation. It also removes the vast number of low-frequency tags, which have no statistical power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Eveland <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>). The remaining tags were mapped against the assembled transcripts using the BLASTn tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Altschul <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>). Tags were assigned to a given transcript if they matched uniquely (taking into account different splice variants per gene) in the correct orientation with less than two mismatches. Tag counts within each library were combined for genes with several transcripts (splice variants) and normalized to an overall library size of 1 million tags because of slight differences in the absolute number of tags per library (median: 2.3 million, range: 1.1&#x02013;3.6 million), which would otherwise bias expression differences between individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Analyses of differential expression</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed in R (vers. 2.14.2, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">R Development Core Team 2012</xref>). A nonparametric, permutational multivariate analysis of variance (vegan package, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Oksanen <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>) based on the library-specific SuperSAGE tag counts per gene was performed to test for overall differences in the transcriptome-wide response to infection between the two populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b81">Zapala &#x00026; Schork 2006</xref>). Multivariate analysis was based on a Pearson correlation distance matrix, calculated with the function Dist (amap package, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Lucas 2011</xref>), which is suggested as a suitable metric for gene expression data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">D'haeseleer 2005</xref>). The PerMANOVA was run with 999 permutations each on the whole data set and then separately for each treatment group (control, singly exposed, twice exposed).

With the requirement of a unique hit and a maximum of one mismatch between SuperSAGE tag and transcript to score the respective gene, a segregating SNP of which one allele corresponds to the ENSEMBL sequence could lead to allele-specific instead of gene-specific estimates of gene expression.

This suggests that the two populations do not differ in general in their unstimulated gene expression, but that the exposure to parasites seems to trigger different expression responses in lake and river sticklebacks after multiple exposures. In addition to a difference in expression levels between singly exposed male and female fish, which may reflect sex-specific strategies of innate immunity, we also detected a trend towards different overall expression levels between families. With only two families per population, it is difficult to separate the effects of family-specific and population-specific gene expression. However, in twice exposed fish, where we find a significant difference between populations, we did not detect significant family differences, suggesting that the observed difference in gene activation can be attributed to population rather than family origin.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Multidimensional scaling plot of gene expression levels in lake and river fish.

The number of genes additionally up-regulated in fish exposed a second time was substantially lower than from na&#x000ef;ve to first exposure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), which leads to reduced power in detecting significant enrichment for specific GO processes. This is also reflected in the overall GO term enrichment analysis at this stage, with none of the tested GO terms surviving FDR correction (data therefore not shown).

The natural prevalence of this digenean parasite is substantially higher in lake populations, and lake sticklebacks have already been shown to exhibit higher immunocompetence against <italic>Diplostomum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Kalbe &#x00026; Kurtz 2006</xref>). It has been argued that this effect is due to an elevated innate immune response, as the higher resistance shows up already upon first contact with this parasite, which is furthermore known to evade adaptive immunity by migrating to the host's eye lens within about a day after penetrating the host's skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Kalbe &#x00026; Kurtz 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">Rauch <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>).</p><p>Our digital analysis of gene expression on the basis of 5709 detected protein-coding genes showed significant differences between fish from the two populations, each represented by two families, suggesting that lake and river sticklebacks activate different pathways in response to our parasite exposure. This could be seen at the global expression level, using multivariate statistics, and also at the functional level by GO term enrichment analysis. The multivariate analysis also showed that the difference in expression levels was triggered by the parasite exposure and was not due to a general difference in gene regulation between lake and river sticklebacks, as no significant difference in global expression levels could be detected in unexposed fish. While overall, the sticklebacks appeared to activate their immune system upon our experimental parasite exposure as indicated by an enrichment for immune system processes, when focussing on population-specific gene regulation, this pattern could only be observed in lake fish. River fish did not show any particular activation of immune system processes, but instead of cellular catalytic processes. Furthermore, immune system activation in lake fish upon first exposure affected mainly processes of the innate immune system, which follows our expectations as it represents the first line of defence upon first contact to a parasite. Only a substantially smaller number of additional genes were altered upon second exposure, which is when an adaptive immune response would be expected. It may be possible that the relatively high number and infectivity of <italic>Diplostomum</italic> larvae in our experiment to a certain degree dominated the second parasite challenge and thus led to re-activation of the innate immune response. This in turn may render the detection of adaptive immune processes more difficult. On the other hand, the multivariate approach detected overall differences in gene expression between populations especially in the twice exposed fish. It may therefore be that the up-regulation of the adaptive processes is more subtle and was obscured in the GO term analysis by an additional re-activation of the innate immune system.</p><p>Because of the still inherent sample size limitation of next-generation sequencing techniques, we were able to screen two different families per stickleback population, which may limit the interpretation of our results. In addition to local adaptation, transcriptional differences may also partly be due to family effects, genetic drift or other random effects. However, previous experimental work has already established that lake sticklebacks generally exhibit a higher immunocompetence compared with river sticklebacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Kalbe &#x00026; Kurtz 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">Scharsack <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>), which potentially evolved in response to the significantly broader parasite diversity in lakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Kalbe <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Eizaguirre <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). We have also shown previously that the genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), key components of the adaptive immune system, are locally adapted to this difference in parasite diversity and thus partly responsible for the differences in parasite resistance between lake and river sticklebacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Eizaguirre <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">2012a</xref>). In the light of these previous findings and the well-characterized genetic differentiation of these populations in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Reusch <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Eizaguirre <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>), it is therefore justified to suggest that our discovery of an activation of different biological processes in response to parasite exposure between fish from the two populations could indicate population-specific differences in the regulation of the immune system, which may have evolved in adaptation to differences in their local parasite communities.</p><p>We can here only speculate as to whether a potential difference in immune system activation is an adaptation to qualitative differences between lake and river parasite communities or whether it is merely an adaptation to quantitative differences. However, the fact that the functional differences were mainly observable in pathways of the innate immune system may indicate the latter, and it is conceivable that lake sticklebacks have evolved mechanisms to activate a stronger innate immune response upon parasite exposure as a consequence of the stronger and more diverse parasite challenges in their native habitat. An evolutionary response to qualitative differences may indeed require more specific adaptations than the mere differential regulation of immune genes, for example the evolution of locally adapted MHC genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Eizaguirre <italic>et al</italic>. 2012a</xref>), especially given the potential of parasites to co-evolve with their hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Ebert &#x00026; Hamilton 1996</xref>).</p><p>River sticklebacks in turn may have evolved a more diminished activation of the immune system as a consequence of the reduced parasite challenge in their habitat, because especially the components of the rather unspecific innate immunity can be severely damaging. In fact, the immune response is expected to follow a fine-tuned trade-off between the benefits of pathogen resistance and the disadvantages of energetic costs and tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">Schulenburg <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>). Our data could thus indicate a difference in the location of the optimal trade-off between the two populations due to the quantitative differences in their parasite communities. Instead of triggering a broad innate immune response, river sticklebacks may rely on a more specific immune response, for instance facilitated by the antigen-presenting molecules of the MHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b80">Wegner <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Eizaguirre <italic>et al</italic>. 2012a</xref>). The activation of cellular processes in river sticklebacks upon parasite exposure could either indicate a general response to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">de Nadal <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>) or an attempt to increase tolerance to the parasite infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Medzhitov <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). The latter strategy, which has been proposed as an alternative to increasing resistance mechanisms, has for instance been raised in explaining the surprising lack of immune gene regulation in the transcriptomic response of parasite-challenged red grouses (<italic>Lagopus lagopus scoticus</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78">Webster <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Pemberton <italic>et al</italic>. (2011</xref>) describe a surprising lack of differential expression in immune genes between control and infected Scottish blackface lambs (<italic>Ovis aries</italic>), further emphasizing the potential complexity of immune responses in general. An interesting addition to the trade-off scenario is the observed difference in gene expression levels between the sexes after the first exposure, which may reflect additional sex-specific optima for the activation of the rather unspecific and thus more costly innate immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Restif &#x00026; Amos 2010</xref>).</p><p>Overall, our study highlights the suitability of digital gene expression analysis, based on the SuperSAGE protocol, for investigating immunological adaptation of diverging vertebrate populations and provides new insights into the mechanisms that may be involved in this process. With two families per population, we captured only a subset of the variation in gene expression that undoubtedly exists in each natural population, and some of the observed differences between populations may be confounded by family-specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Ma &#x00026; Qin 2007</xref>). Using F1 families, we can also not completely rule out parental effects. While we used a very conservative approach by removing family-specific sequence tags and furthermore did not detect family-specific expression differences in exposed fish, more data are needed to confirm that the observed patterns reflect population-specific local adaption of transcriptome regulation. It also remains to be investigated whether the observed differences are specific to the two study populations or represent a more general scenario for ecotypes that evolve under different parasite communities. In fact, it has already been suggested that regulatory changes provide a potent means for adaptation to new environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Jones <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). Furthermore, in a recent comparison of general transcriptome-wide expression levels between two unchallenged morphs of lake trout (<italic>Salvelinus namaycush)</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Goetz <italic>et al</italic>. (2010</xref>) have also found most differential expression in genes associated with metabolism and immunity, supporting the notion that local adaptation to parasite communities may be a common scenario among diverging populations, a process that may ultimately lead to the formation of distinct species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Eizaguirre <italic>et al</italic>. 2009a</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title/><p>T.L.L. is interested in immunogenetic local adaptation of vertebrates and the maintenance of genetic diversity through host-parasite coevolution.
