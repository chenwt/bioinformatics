cause of oncogenic transformation in human cancers. Specific aspects of altered
tumor metabolism may be amenable to therapeutic intervention and could be
coordinated with other targeted therapies. In breast cancer, the genetic landscape
has been defined most comprehensively in efforts such as The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA). However, little is known about how alterations of tumor metabolism
correlate with this landscape.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In total 25 cancers (23 fully analyzed by TCGA) and 5 normal breast specimens

of the metabolites elevated in estrogen receptor negative (ER-) cancers compared
to estrogen receptor positive (ER+) including many glycolytic and glycogenolytic
intermediates consistent with increased Warburg effects. Glutathione (GSH) pathway
components were also elevated in ER- tumors consistent with an increased
requirement for handling higher levels of oxidative stress. Additionally, ER-
tumors had high levels of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) and the
immunomodulatory tryptophan metabolite kynurenine. Kynurenine levels were
correlated with the expression of tryptophan-degrading enzyme (<italic>IDO1</italic>). However, high levels of 2-HG were not associated
with somatic mutations or expression levels of <italic>IDH1</italic> or <italic>IDH2. BRCA1</italic> mRNA levels
were positively associated with coenzyme A, acetyl coenzyme A, and GSH and
negatively associated with multiple lipid species, supporting the regulation of
<italic>ACC1</italic> and <italic>NRF2</italic> by BRCA1. Different driver mutations were associated with
distinct patterns of specific metabolites, such as lower levels of several
lipid-glycerophosphocholines in tumors with mutated <italic>TP53</italic>. A strong metabolomic signature associated with proliferation
rate was also observed; the metabolites in this signature overlap broadly with
metabolites that define ER status as receptor status and proliferation rate were
correlated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The addition of metabolomic profiles to the public domain TCGA dataset

breast cancers. This heterogeneity is observable at every level of examination from
the macroscopic to the molecular. Recent large-scale efforts to measure and describe
human breast tumor heterogeneity include The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) where a
number of high-throughput &#x02018;omic&#x02019; technologies were systemically applied to hundreds
of primary cancer specimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].
Mutation, germ line polymorphisms, DNA copy number, RNA expression, DNA methylation,
and protein expression analyses were performed in parallel on a large and carefully
curated set of breast cancer specimens to produce the most comprehensive molecular
portrait of the disease to date.</p><p>One significant metric that was not included in TGCA was an unbiased analysis of
tumor metabolism. While metabolic flux cannot be measured in fixed or frozen
specimens, steady-state levels of numerous key metabolites may provide insight into
these fundamental phenotypic traits. A number of studies in cancer have uncovered
relationships between genetic abnormalities and various metabolic reprogramming
suggesting that key metabolic process can be altered as a result of specific
transformation events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Relatively nonspecific cancer-related events
such as increased proliferation may also underlie some of the inferred/observed
metabolic remodeling. Glucose uptake, serine and glutamine auxotrophy, mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation, and cancer-associated fibroblasts all appear to have
roles in defining breast cancer metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, it is
not clear whether these regulatory relationships can be observed in all or subsets
of human tumors.</p><p>Breast cancers are broadly categorized as luminal versus basal types possibly
derived from different precursor cells or at least different committed lineages
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Within these broad categories, alterations in specific driver
genes are believed to produce the heterogeneity observed amongst and within breast
tumor subtypes. While the identity and frequency of driver alterations are generally
different in basal and luminal cancers, there is still considerable overlap. For
example, TP53 mutations are very common in basal tumors and PI3KCA mutations are
common in luminal cancer but neither is subtype exclusive. In contrast, MYC (8q24)
amplification is common in both types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Each of these genetic drivers has been associated with specific
changes in cellular metabolism and therefore may have dominant effects that can be
observed across tumor types.</p><p>Metabolomic profiling via mass spectrometry or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
is now an established approach that has been employed in several studies to analyze
primary human breast tissues (normal and cancer) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Building upon
transcriptional profiling of breast cancer, there have also been several efforts to
integrate steady-state metabolite levels with specific breast cancer subtypes
defined by mRNA expression. Expression subtypes are dominated by estrogen receptor
and ERBB2 status and thus, metabolic profiling was performed to seek an additional
level of information to refine these existing classifications. These analyses
identified a subclassification of luminal A-type cancers based on metabolite levels
and found higher levels of Warburg-associated metabolites in more aggressive cancer
types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A separate study of breast cancer lipidomic identified the
association between palmitate-containing phosphatidylcholines with estrogen receptor
negative and cancer progression and patient survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, none of these studies established associations of
particular metabolites or metabolic pathways with specific somatic mutations or
expression levels that have been extensively characterized in TCGA.</p><p>In order to more fully explore the relationship between genetics, tumor type,
and metabolic state, we took advantage of our participation in the breast cancer
TCGA to perform joint analyses of metabolomics and genetics in a series of primary
cancers. From the current study, we were able to identify several genetic
determinants of the metabolic heterogeneity of human breast tumors that confirm and
extend prior <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> observations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Specimen selection and handling</title><p>Breast tissues were collected, stored and used under Duke University Medical
Center Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols (Pro00012025 and
Pro00021284). A waiver of consent was obtained from the Duke IRB to conduct the
study (Pro00021284) and subjects were not re-consented for participation.
Twenty-five breast cancers (diagnosed and treated from 1989 to 1998) were selected
for the current study based on their inclusion in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
Specifically, we selected cases that were either estrogen receptor (ER) positive
or negative for both estrogen and progesterone receptors (PR) based on the
clinical assay performed at the time of initial diagnosis (clinical and
demographic information is provided in Table S1 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Two of the ER&#x02009;+&#x02009;positive cancers were
classified as PR negative by the clinical assay. In addition to the cancers, we
selected five breast specimens obtained from reduction mammoplasties containing
substantial amounts of normal epithelium. Each block of tissue was cryostat
sectioned to analyze tumor epithelial content based on microscopic examination
with a cutoff of 70% tumor nuclei for inclusion. Additional sections were also
taken and stored desiccated at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C for future use. The remainder of the tissue
block was submitted frozen to Metabolon Inc. (Durham, NC, USA) for extraction and
metabolomic analysis. After trimming away the cryogenic-embedding compound (OCT),
the weight of each sample (27 to 115&#x000a0;mg) was determined and used to normalize the
extraction reagent volume.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Proliferation analysis</title><p>Thin sections were fixed in acetone and then stained with MIB-1 antibody
(Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) that recognizes the Ki-67 proliferation antigen. The
mouse monoclonal antibody was used at a final concentration of 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml and
detected with a biotinylated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. Following
chromogenic detection, each section was scored for the percentage of
nuclear-stained epithelial cells. Two hundred epithelial cells were counted in
each section spanning at least two high-powered (40X) fields. The proliferation
rate was expressed as a percentage of the epithelial cells exhibiting nuclear
staining.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Metabolomic profiling</title><p>The sample preparation process at Metabolon was carried out using an automated
MicroLab STAR&#x02122; system from the Hamilton Company (Reno, NV, USA). Recovery
standards were added prior to the first step in the extraction process for quality
control purposes. Sample preparation was conducted using a proprietary (Metabolon,
Inc.) series of organic and aqueous extractions to remove the protein fraction
while allowing maximum recovery of small molecules. The resulting extract was
divided into two fractions; one for analysis by liquid chromatography (LC) and one
for analysis by gas chromatography (GC). Samples were placed briefly on a Zymark
TurboVap (Phoenix Equipment, Inc., Rochester, NY, USA) to remove the organic
solvent. Each sample was then frozen and dried under vacuum. Samples were then
prepared for the appropriate instrument, either LC/mass spectrometry (MS) or
GC/MS.</p><p>The LC/MS portion of the platform is based on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC (Waters,
Milford, MA, USA) and a Thermo-Finnigan LTQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), which consists of an electrospray ionization (ESI)
source and linear ion trap (LIT) mass analyzer. The sample extract was split into
two aliquots, dried, then reconstituted in acidic or basic LC-compatible solvents,
each of which contained 11 or more injection standards at fixed concentrations.
One aliquot was analyzed using acidic positive ion optimized conditions and the
other using basic negative ion optimized conditions in two independent injections
using separate dedicated columns. Extracts reconstituted in acidic conditions were
gradient eluted using water and methanol both containing 0.1% formic acid, while
the basic extracts, which also used water/methanol, contained 6.5&#x000a0;mM ammonium
bicarbonate. The MS analysis alternated between MS and data-dependent
MS<sup>2</sup> scans using dynamic exclusion.</p><p>The samples destined for GC/MS analysis were redried under vacuum desiccation
for a minimum of 24&#x000a0;hrs prior to being derivatized under nitrogen using
bis(trimethylsilyl) triflouroacetamide (BSTFA). The GC column was 5% phenyl and
the temperature ramp was from 40&#x000b0; to 300&#x000b0;C in a 16&#x000a0;min period. Samples were
analyzed on a Thermo-Finnigan Trace DSQ fast-scanning single-quadrupole mass
spectrometer using electron impact ionization (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The
instrument was tuned and calibrated for mass resolution and mass accuracy on a
daily basis. The information output from the raw data files was automatically
extracted as discussed below.</p><p>For ions with counts greater than 2 million, an accurate mass measurement
could be performed. Accurate mass measurements could be made on the parent ion as
well as fragments. The typical mass error was less than 5&#x000a0;ppm. Fragmentation
spectra (MS/MS) were typically generated in a data-dependent manner, but if
necessary, targeted MS/MS was employed, such as in the case of lower level
signals.</p><p>Identification of known chemical entities was based on comparison to
metabolomic library entries of purified standards. More than 1,000 commercially
available purified standard compounds have been registered into a database for
distribution to both the LC and GC platforms for determination of their analytical
characteristics. The combination of chromatographic properties and mass spectra
gave an indication of a match to the specific compound or an isobaric
entity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Measurement of 2-hydroxyglutarate</title><p>Quantification of L/D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) in biological media/tissues
was performed by LC-ESI-MS/MS as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] with modifications to accommodate different sample matrices
involved in the study. The method utilizes a chiral derivatization agent to
produce diastereoisomers with L- and D-isomers of 2-HG, which can be separated by
conventional reverse-phase LC. D-2-HG, L-2-HG, and diacetyl-L-tartaric anhydride
(DATAN) were from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). Racemic mixtures of L- and
D-2-HG-d4 were prepared by mixing 1&#x000a0;mg of &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate-d6
(Sigma-Aldrich/Isotec) with 1&#x000a0;mg of NaBH<sub>4</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich)
in 0.2&#x000a0;mL anhydrous MeOH (Sigma-Aldrich) followed by 30&#x000a0;min incubation at 60&#x000b0;C.
Tissue or cell line homogenates, 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of deionized water, 1&#x000a0;mL of chloroform,
and 4&#x000a0;mm ceramic beads were vigorously mixed for 45&#x000a0;sec at speed 4 in FastPrep 120
&#x02018;bead-beater&#x02019; instrument (Thermo Savant, Holbrook, NY, USA). After centrifugation
(5&#x000a0;min at 16,100 &#x000d7; g), 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of the aqueous (upper) layer was transferred into
1.5-mL glass vial and dried (50&#x000b0;C, 60&#x000a0;min). The dry residue was treated with
50&#x000a0;mg/mL of freshly prepared DATAN in dichloromethane/glacial acetic acid (4/1 by
volume) and heated at 75&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;min. After drying (50&#x000b0;C, 15&#x000a0;min) the residue was
dissolved in 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L LC mobile phase A (see below) for analysis by LC/MS/MS with an
Agilent 1200 series HPLC (Agilent Technologies, St Clara, CA, USA) and
Sciex/Applied Biosystems API 3200 QTrap (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA). Mobile phase A: water, 3% acetonitrile, 280&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L ammonium hydroxide
(approximately 25%), pH adjusted to 3.6 by formic acid (approximately 98%). Mobile
phase B: methanol. Analytical column: Kinetex C<sub>18</sub>,
150&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;4.6&#x000a0;mm, 2.6&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m, and SafeGuard C<sub>18</sub> 4 &#x000d7; 3&#x000a0;mm

Elution gradient at 1&#x000a0;mL/min flow rate: 0 to 1&#x000a0;min 0% B, 1 to 2&#x000a0;min 0 to 100% B, 2

10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L. The Q1/Q3 (m/z) transitions monitored: 363/147 (2-HG) and 367/151
(2-HG-d4). A set of calibrator samples in corresponding matrix were prepared for
calibration by adding appropriate amounts of pure D-2-HG at the following
concentration levels: 0, 0.16, 0.54, 1.8, 6, and 20 ug/mL. These samples were
analyzed alongside the experimental samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Data analysis</title><p>For pairwise comparison of metabolites from different sample categories
(normal, ER+, ER-), we used Welch&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test. The
false discovery rate was estimated using the <italic>q</italic>
value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>The data were subjected to hierarchical clustering using Cluster 3.0 and
displayed using TreeView [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The
significance analysis of microarray (SAM) analyses were performed as described
using indicated selection criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. For specific metabolite associations with genetic events,
data were analyzed in GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) for
correlation and significance.</p><p>Genetic mutation and copy number, RNA expression data, and designation of
tumor intrinsic subtype were all derived from the publically available TCGA data
sets. Primary data were downloaded from the TCGA data portal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] or analyzed using the online cBioPortal
suite of tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. For the
cBioPortal, some analyses were performed on the &#x02018;TCGA Nature 2012&#x02019; data set and
others on the &#x02018;TCGA Provisional&#x02019; data set.</p><p>For analysis of the correlation between each pair of metabolites, Pearson
correlations of the level of each pair of metabolites (log2 normalized value)
among 399 metabolites from 25 tumors and 5 normal breast tissues were generated.
The correlation coefficients were hierarchically clustered by Cluster 3.0 to
produce the heatmap plot. For analysis of correlation between individual
metabolite and proliferation rate, Pearson correlations between the level of
individual metabolite (log2 normalized value) and Ki-67% (log2 value) were
calculated. The supervised cluster plot was generated based on the correlation
between individual metabolite levels and proliferation rate (Ki-67%) and displayed
by TreeView.</p><p>For combined analysis of receptor status and proliferation, normalized
metabolic data were natural log transformed yielding a symmetric distribution of
the data about the mean. We used normal theory linear regression to assess the
extent to which the metabolic assay data could be predicted by one, the other or
both of the tumor&#x02019;s receptor status and proliferation rate (Ki-67%). We analyzed
each metabolite separately and fit four models for each: (1) the model with
intercept only; (2) the model with intercept and receptor status; (3) the model
with intercept and log2 proliferation rate; and (4) the model with intercept,
receptor status and log2 proliferation rate. We calculated analysis of variance
tables for the two nested progressions of models: (1, 2, 4) and (1, 3, 4). We
report the <italic>P</italic> values based on the associated F
tests for (a) models 2 over 1, (b) 4 over 2, (c) 3 over 1 and (d) 4 over 3. The
<italic>P</italic> values in (a) and (c) are for the
regression of abundance of the metabolite on receptor status and for the
regression of abundance of the metabolite on proliferation rate, respectively. The
<italic>P</italic> values in (b) and (d) are for the
regression of abundance of the metabolite on receptor status while adjusting for
proliferation rate and for the regression of abundance of the metabolite on the
proliferation rate while adjusting for receptor status, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To date, over 900 primary breast cancers have been profiled by the TCGA
initiative over a four-year period using an evolving set of molecular analyses. For
this reason, not all cancers were analyzed by all techniques. For the current
metabolomic study, we chose 25 cancers that had passed quality control and were
accepted for analysis by TCGA: 16 ER positive (all but two were also PR positive)
and 9 cancers that were both ER and PR negative, determined by standard
immunopathologic analysis after cytoreductive surgery. Of these, 23 cancers (15
ER&#x02009;+&#x02009;and 8 ER-) were eventually subjected to comprehensive genetic analysis by TCGA.
In addition to the cancers, we selected 5 samples of normal breast tissue (from
reduction mammoplasties not associated with cancer) that contained a substantial
amount of epithelium based on histologic staining. We cut 20 sections from each
block for <italic>in situ</italic> analyses before extraction for
the quantitative profiling of small molecules (&#x0003c;1,000&#x000a0;Da) that was performed in a
single batch on the Metabolon platform generating data on 399 identifiable
metabolites (Table S2 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>
contains the primary data on metabolites).</p><p>Primary tissues in this study were distributed into three main categories: (1)
normal breast from reduction mammoplasties, (2) ER positive primary breast cancers,
and (3) estrogen and PR negative primary cancers. Of the 25 cancers, all were
accepted for TCGA study but only 23 were actually subjected to genetic analysis. The
cancers are representative of the major subtypes of the disease based on the PAM50
classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] including basal,
HER2, luminal A and luminal B. One sample was designated as &#x02018;not-classified&#x02019; (NC).
None of the tumors were classified as the relatively uncommon &#x02018;claudin low&#x02019;
subtype.</p><p>Hierarchical clustering of the samples based on these metabolites demonstrated
that the 5 normal breast samples were tightly clustered together while the
ER&#x02009;+&#x02009;tumors exhibited significant heterogeneity: 6 of the ER&#x02009;+&#x02009;tumors grouped with
the 5 normal breast samples while the remaining 10 ER&#x02009;+&#x02009;tumors clustered with the 9
ER- tumors (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This relative
heterogeneity of ER&#x02009;+&#x02009;tumors is consistent with previous classification based on
gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Pictured below the hierarchical clustering
dendrogram for 23 of the cancers is TCGA data for the most common gene-based
abnormalities (mutation, amplification, homozygous deletion) found in breast cancer,
most of which are considered to be driver alterations. Also shown is the PAM50
intrinsic subtype classifier (based on gene expression) of the TCGA analyzed cancers
(23 tumors) as well as the not-classified (NC) tumor. From this analysis, it is
apparent that intrinsic expression tumor subtypes do not define the classification
of the tumors by metabolite levels.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

demonstrates several aspects of breast cancer observed across many studies: (1)
hormone receptor expression tracks closely with intrinsic subtype; (2) TP53
mutations are very frequent in basal-type cancers; and (3) PIK3CA mutations are
common in luminal types. The metabolite-based clustering of these specimens places a
group of luminal A cancers with the normal breast specimens and most of the basal
cancers together in a single branch. A middle branch contains a combination of
mostly luminal A and B cancers. HER2 cancers, as assigned by expression subtype
(n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2) or genomic copy number (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) also tend to cluster in this middle branch.
Overall, the cancers in the study appear to have a distribution of receptor status,
intrinsic subtype, and genetic alterations typical of an unselected case
series.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Estrogen receptor status reflects a broad metabolic division in breast
cancer</title><p>Our next step in the analysis was to compare metabolite levels in the cancers
based on ER status (ER&#x02009;+&#x02009;versus ER-), the most consistent division in breast
cancer from both a biologic and therapeutic perspective (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). Overall, ER status was a very strong divisor in
metabolic space. The identity of the metabolites that vary by ER status supports a
series of systematic differences in bioenergetics and biosynthetic pathways. Of
the 399 named metabolites quantified in this study, 75 exhibited a statistically
significant difference between ER&#x02009;+&#x02009;and ER- tumors (Table S3 in Additional file
<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>, unadjusted <italic>t</italic> tests comparing levels between the three groups of samples, ER+,
ER-, and normal breast). Of these, only 8 metabolites were increased in
ER&#x02009;+&#x02009;tumors including 3 carnitine derivatives, suggesting an increase in fatty
acid transportation in hormone receptor positive cancers. Short- and medium-chain
fatty acids were also elevated in ER&#x02009;+&#x02009;tumors whereas long-chain fatty acids and
monoacylglycerols tended to be higher in ER- tumors indicating that systematic
differences in lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation correlate with hormone receptor
status.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>

metabolites (glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate,
and lactate) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D). In contrast,
there was a lower level of glucose in the tumors, especially ER- tumors
(Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D). Warburg metabolism is a
means for rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, to accelerate energy
production through increased glycolysis and lactate production, bypassing the
normal oxidation of pyruvate in the mitochondria. Thus, the metabolic profile of
ER- tumors is consistent with an elevated Warburg effect.</p><p>To validate our results, we compared our data to recently published data on
breast cancers collected using the same metabolomic platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Among the significant metabolites that
tracked with hormone receptor status in our data, 57 of these were found in the
Terunuma dataset and exhibited broadly similar differences between ER&#x02009;+&#x02009;and ER-
cancers (27 reaching significance in both data sets, Figure S1 in Additional file
<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref> and Table S4 in Additional file
<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Therefore, these identified
subtype-specific metabolites can be validated using an independent dataset.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Reduced glutathione (GSH) and gamma-glutamyl amino acids in ER-
tumors</title><p>ER- cancers also had higher levels of gamma-glutamyl amino acids coupled with
increased glutathione synthesis (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E, Figure S2 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Gamma-glutamyl amino acids result from the
transpeptidase-mediated catalytic reaction of amino acids with glutathione (Figure
S2 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). These amino
acid-glutathione conjugates traverse the cell membrane and release the amino acid
intracellularly to regenerate glutathione [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Elevated levels of these gamma-glutamyl conjugates indicate
an increased uptake of amino acids in ER- tumors. This may point to a potential
shift in fuel substrates for energy production that favors amino acid catabolism.
It is interesting to note that the most elevated gamma-glutamyl amino acids were
the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) conjugates of valine, leucine and isoleucine.
Additionally, ER- tumors had increased glutathione (reduced, GSH) and oxidized
glutathione (GSSG) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>F) indicating
a trend toward increased glutathione synthesis, presumably to cope with the higher
levels of oxidative stress.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Metabolite correlations in breast cancers</title><p>We postulated that the level of multiple metabolites derived from the same and
different metabolic pathway might be coordinated and serve as a better indicator
of metabolic activity than any single compound alone. Pearson correlations were
calculated for all pairwise comparisons between each of the 399 metabolites for
all samples (Table S5 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>). The resulting correlation coefficients were then used to
group the 399 metabolites into distinct groups by hierarchical clustering (cluster
3.0) and then displayed with TreeView (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). We found that multiple groups of metabolites were highly
clustered and correlated. These groups include many metabolites that are known to
be in the same metabolic pathways as well as unexpected correlation between
metabolites in different metabolic pathways. Metabolites from different pathways
clustered in the same groups might indicate two different metabolic pathways are
coordinated by the same genetic alteration or affected similarly by the metabolic
reprogramming. For example, we found a cluster of metabolites comprising many
intermediates of various lipids associated with glycerophosphocholines
(Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, cluster 3). We also noted two
separate clusters of amino acids and di-amino acids (glycine-proline,
glutamate-leucine, alanine-tyrosine) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, cluster 4) and N-acetyl-amino acids (N-acetyl-aspartate,
N-acetyl-ornithine, N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, cluster 5). Both clusters may indicate products of protein
degradation and catabolism and can be used to identify tumors with higher protein
catabolism.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>

GSH and GSSH (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, cluster 6). The
co-cluster of these metabolites suggests a high degree of correlation between
these energy metabolites and anti-oxidative capacity among the tumor tissues. We
also noted connected clusters of metabolites related to glycolysis (fructose,
glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate) and glycogenolysis (malto-triose,
malto-tetraose, malto-pentose) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>,
cluster 8), both were elevated in ER- cancers (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Metabolites associated with specific genetic events</title><p>A novel and unexpected finding was the level of the oncometabolite 2-HG,
elevated over 20-fold in ER&#x02009;+&#x02009;tumors compared with normal tissue and over 200-fold
in ER- tumors (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). A single ER-
tumor exhibited 10-fold higher levels of 2-HG compared to any other sample
(unscaled data). We further confirmed the levels of 2-HG in a subset of the breast
cancer extracts using an independent assay based on MS performed at Duke and found
a very high correlation between the results from these two independent platforms
(Figure S3A in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Using
this targeted assay, we also measured 2-HG in a series of breast cancer cell lines
and found that two basal lines (Hs578T and BT20) had the highest levels,
consistent with data from the primary cancers (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). A high level of 2-HG has been associated with missense
mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 in glioma and several other tumor types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and may be an effector of tumor cell
dedifferentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Within the
TCGA breast data set, two cancers (&#x0003c;0.5%) were found to harbor missense
mutations in IDH1 that have a high probability of affecting the function of the
enzyme (R132C, Y235C). Since these data were based on whole genome sequencing that
could overlook specific mutations, we performed targeted sequencing in the tumor
(TCGA-B6-A1KF) with very high levels of 2-HG to look for the recurrent mutations
found in other tumors in IDH1 and IDH2. This tumor was wild type for both genes in
these regions (Figure S3B in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>) suggesting an alternative mechanism leading to 2-HG
production, such as the recently reported activation of the myc pathway
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Levels of IDH1 and IDH2 mRNA
in these specimens also did not show a significant correlation with 2-HG
levels.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>

pathways can result in detectable metabolic changes in cancer. Our study with both
detailed gene expression and metabolomic data provided a powerful means to test
these associations and discover new ones. One of the least complex of such
relationships is the link between the level of the tryptophan-degrading enzyme
indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) and levels of the immunomodulatory metabolite,
kynurenine (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). Whereas the
precursor molecule tryptophan did not vary between ER&#x02009;+&#x02009;and ER- cancers, median
levels of kynurenine were significantly elevated in ER- tumors
(Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D). From RNAseq data of the 23
cancers in our study, we found a significant correlation between IDO1 expression
and kynurenine levels (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E,
r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.55, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01). Comparing levels of IDO1
mRNA within the TCGA data set (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;748) revealed a significant positive
correlation of IDO1 mRNA levels with vimentin expression (a hallmark of basal
cancers). This finding suggests that kynurenine accumulation commonly occurs in
basal cancers and could lead to reduced immunosurveillance in this tumor
type.</p><p>BRCA1 has been implicated in a number of metabolic processes including fatty
acid synthesis and response to oxidative stress. Using the available RNAseq data,
we correlated expression of BRCA1 with metabolite levels in the 23 TCGA cancers
(Table S6 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>). There
was evidence of strong association between high levels of BRCA1 mRNA and elevated
acetyl CoA, CoA, 3&#x02032; dephospho-CoA, and several acylcarnitines all indicative of
higher levels of fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This is consistent with the reported ability of BRCA1 to
inhibit acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase 1 (ACC1/ACACA) leading to reduced fatty acid
synthesis and increased fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation resulting in the accumulation of
acetyl-CoA and CoA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In contrast,
there were strong inverse correlations between BRCA1 levels and membrane
components, long-chain fatty acids, and amino acids further supporting the role of
BRCA1 in regulating the balance between fatty acid synthesis and oxidation
(Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In addition, GSH and another antioxidant,
3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate were also positively correlated with BRCA1 mRNA levels,
supporting its role in activating NRF2, the master regulator of the oxidative
stress response and GSH synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. BRCA1 mRNA
levels did not correlate with proliferation or ER status indicating that this is
an independent set of variables. Furthermore, the BRCA1 mRNA did not correlate
with the mRNA levels of genes in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathways; consistent
with posttranscriptional regulation (Figure S4 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>

cancer, we performed SAM analyses (Table S7 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>) to identify metabolites associated with the
somatic driver alterations (shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, used as categorical variables that is, mutant versus wild
type, amplified/deleted versus diploid). Many of the genetic events are loosely
associated with specific tumor subtypes (for example, PIK3CA mutations were not
found in basal cancers) such that metabolite correlations with specific genetic
features may be confounded by higher level associations. With this in mind, the
results do support several relationships between metabolite profiles and tumor
genetics. Most notably, compared to tumors with wild-type p53, cancers with TP53
alterations show a very specific pattern of decreased lipid glycerophosphocholines
that is not apparent when classifying the cancers by ER status, (Figure S5 in
Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Other significant
associations were observed between PIK3CA mutation and malonylcarnitine and ERBB2
amplification with docosapentaenoate, fucose, and
1-oleoylglycerophosphoethanolamine (Figure S6 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Metabolites associated with proliferation in tumors</title><p>Proliferation rate could impact the level of many metabolites. We measured
proliferation by <italic>in situ</italic> detection of Ki-67
followed by quantitative evaluation of the percentage of epithelial cells positive

to be significantly higher in ER- compared to ER&#x02009;+&#x02009;tumors (mean of 32% versus 14%,
<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.009 in our cohort) and epithelial cells
in normal breast tissue have a very low rate of proliferation (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C). Supervised clustering and correlation analysis
of the metabolites with proliferation rate demonstrated sets of metabolites that
were positively and inversely correlated with proliferation (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A and B, and Table S8 in Additional file
<xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Predictably, the level of glucose
was lower in rapidly proliferating cancers whereas lactate was positively
correlated with proliferation (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D).
N-acetyl amino acids and 2&#x02032;-deoxyinosine were highly enriched in rapidly
proliferating tumors. The biological roles of N-acetyl amino acids are largely
unknown. However, aminoacylase-1 (encoded by ACY1), which is responsible for the
degradation of these N-acetyl amino acids, has been found to be inactivated in
several tumor types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. High levels of 2&#x02032;-deoxyinosine (dI) may be

complementary explanatory factors for many of the metabolites (Figure S7 in

primarily in model and experimental systems but have rarely been tested in primary
human cancers. The current study makes use of the comprehensive genetic data from
TCGA on breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] to test
reported relationships and discover new and unexpected associations between genetics
and metabolism. TCGA data provides an excellent platform in this regard for three
reasons: (1) the tissues were subjected to stringent quality control criteria
including tumor nuclei exceeding 70% and the absence of significant necrosis, (2)
multiple analytes were measured in parallel on the same cancers including DNA
sequence for mutations, DNA copy number assessment, RNA expression including RNAseq
and microarray analysis, methylation, and protein and phosphoprotein levels, and (3)
the data are in the public domain in easily accessible formats with standardized
specimen identifiers that can be directly linked and co-analyzed with other types of
newly generated data such as the metabolite levels that we measured in the current
study. We include the primary data on these samples so that anyone can perform their
own joint analysis on metabolites and genes of interest.</p><p>The frozen tissues were analyzed on a metabolomics platform that has been used
in other cancer-related studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and at the time
of the analysis, included identification and quantitation of 399 named biochemicals
(M<sub>r</sub> &#x0003c;1,000&#x000a0;Da). Unsupervised clustering by metabolite
levels revealed two major categories, one containing the normal breast tissues and a
subset of the ER&#x02009;+&#x02009;cancers, and the other containing all of the ER- cancers and the
remaining ER&#x02009;+&#x02009;ones. Overlaying the TCGA data on these clusters revealed that all of
the cancers clustering with normal breast were of the luminal A intrinsic subtype.
The remaining luminal A and all of the luminal B cancers fell in the other major
cluster along with all of the basal cancers and the two cancers designated as HER2
by PAM50. That the luminal A cancers do not all cluster together is consistent with
a metabolomic study employing high resolution magic angle spinning magnetic
resonance spectroscopy of predominantly luminal cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In this study, three distinct categories of
luminal A cancers were described by hierarchical clustering driven primarily by
varying levels of glycolytic activity. Widely different proliferation rates in the
ER&#x02009;+&#x02009;cancers may at least partially underlie these luminal sub-clusters.</p><p>The basal subtype, a subset of the ER- cancers, demonstrated significant
homogeneity with 4 of the 5 PAM50 basal cancers clustering on one sub-branch of the
metabolomic hierarchical tree. A HER2 cancer was the only other member of this
sub-branch but this cancer does share the common basal trait of having a TP53
mutation. Overlaying the most common genetic driver alterations in breast cancer on
this cluster diagram allowed a visual assessment of whether branches may also be
driven by specific oncogenic events. TP53 mutations and basal cancer status are
nearly coincident and as described, the basal cancers are tightly clustered.
Therefore, it is difficult to disentangle genetics from intrinsic subtype in this
instance. Other notable groupings that may be associated with a specific genetic
driver include MYC amplification and PIK3CA mutation. PIK3CA mutations are tightly
linked to the luminal subtypes whereas MYC amplification is common in both basal and
luminal cancers. It may be noteworthy that none of the MYC amplified tumors
clustered with the normal breast tissue.</p><p>Supervised classification and <italic>t</italic> tests based
on the three categories of specimens (ER+, ER/PR-, normal) exhibited significant
signals for many metabolites. Over half of the 399 identified metabolites were
different between normal and cancer. Moreover, &#x0003e;18% of the metabolites varied
significantly between ER&#x02009;+&#x02009;and ER- cancers. These dramatic differences are
consistent with previous reports showing strong remodeling of central metabolism
between normal breast tissue and breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and between tumor subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Notably, glycolytic- and glycogenolytic-associated metabolites
including lactate were higher in ER- cancers with the prominent exception of low
tumor glucose. The increased lactate production from ER- cancer may be caused by
increased glycolysis and confirm our previous finding of a strong hypoxia program
and the high &#x02018;Warburg&#x02019; phenotype previously described in other studies of ER- cancer
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>From TCGA data (for 23 of 25 of the cancers), we were able to confirm or
identify known and unexpected associations between metabolite levels and various
genetic events. Proof of principle for this approach was demonstrated by the
correlation between kynurenine and the mRNA of its synthetic enzyme, IDO1. IDO1
expression was also found to correlate with the basal phenotype common to ER-
cancers and the high levels of kynurenine produced could result in reduced
immunosurveillance of these cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Increased serum kynurenine/tryptophan ratio has been noted
during the progression of several tumor types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Our findings
support a connection between high IDO levels and kynurenine in ER- tumors. Other
<italic>a priori</italic> associations that were tested included
PKM2 exon 9 versus 10 splice variant levels with proliferation and metabolite levels
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], IDH1 and 2 mRNA and mutations
with 2-hydroxyglutarate levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>],
and levels of GGT1 mRNA and the gamma-glutamyl amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Of these, the strongest association was
between GGT1 and a subset of the conjugated amino acids including leucine and
isoleucine (Figure S8 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>). GGT1 expression has been associated with a subset of basal
cancers and our data indicating elevated levels of gamma-glutamyl amino acids in ER-
cancers provides functional support for this genetic link.</p><p>A number of driver mutational events have been implicated in breast cancer
development including amplification of ERBB2, CCND1 and MYC, loss of PTEN and CDH1,
and missense mutations in TP53 and PIK3CA. Some of these events have been associated
with changes in central metabolism in tumors and experimental systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Using these genetic alterations as
categorical variables, we analyzed our data for signs of metabolic signatures
associated with the most common genetic lesions. The co-existence of TP53 mutation
and reduced levels of a series of lipid glycerophosphocholines was the most
significant association detected. Altered choline metabolism in the form of
decreased glycerophosphocholine (GPC) was reported for several tumor types,
consistent with an association with p53 status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. A specific
connection between p53 and phospholipid metabolism was demonstrated previously with
indication of feedback regulation between phospholipid turnover and p53 activity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. In our data, 8 different long-chain fatty acid
glycerophosphocholines were strongly reduced in p53 mutant tumors suggesting an
underlying regulatory relationship for this consistent association. An important
caveat for this finding is the fact that p53 mutation status is associated with the
basal intrinsic subtype in breast cancer. In our data set, all five of the basal
cancers harbored p53 mutations and only one of the nonbasal cancers (HER2) had a
mutation. Therefore, the strong association we observed between TP53 status and the
levels of these phospholipids may be confounded by intrinsic subtype something that
cannot be distinguished in the current study. Another interesting metabolite-genetic
association is the higher level of fucose in ERBB2+ tumors. Fucose is a simple sugar
that is used to modify proteins and shown to be necessary for key functions of
neoplastic progression of breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The higher level of fucose may suggest that such glycoprotein
modifications play a particular important role in ERBB2+ tumors.</p><p>Our findings with respect to BRCA1 further highlight the potential of these
joint analyses. Germ line BRCA1 mutations typically lead to triple-negative cancers,
but broad variation in mRNA expression is also observed outside of the context of
the hereditary syndrome. High levels of BRCA1 mRNA were positively correlated with a
group of metabolites indicative of elevated fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation and increased
anti-stress response and inversely correlated with medium- and long-chain fatty
acids and membrane components. BRCA1 protein via its BRCT domain was shown to bind
to ACC1/ACACA preventing its dephosphorylation, keeping it in a phosphorylated and
inactive form, thus inhibiting fatty acid synthesis and promoting fatty acid
&#x003b2;-oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. We found a number of
metabolites that fit this mechanism. BRCA1 has also been implicated in redox
homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], potentially through
an interaction with NRF2 that prevents its degradation and promotes its nuclear
accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and we found multiple
metabolites that also fit this activity. These BRCA1 expression-metabolite
associations are entirely consistent with <italic>in
vitro</italic> mechanistic studies implicating BRCA1 in these processes and as
such, constitute direct support for the physiologic relevance of these pathway
connections in breast cancer.</p><p>Rate of proliferation is a key phenotypic property of breast cancers that can be
used as an independent prognostic factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Gene expression indicative of proliferation constitutes a
major component of the OncotypeDx multi-gene recurrence score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. We measured proliferation in our specimens by
scoring Ki-67 staining as a continuous variable and correlated this metric with
metabolite levels. As anticipated, a number of strong correlations with
proliferative rate were found including high levels of lactate and low levels of
glucose consistent with glucose-consumption patterns in rapidly growing cells.
Overall, many of the same metabolites correlated with both receptor status and
proliferation. While proliferation did correlate with ER status in our study (and
others), there were ER&#x02009;+&#x02009;cancers with high proliferation rates and ER- cancers with
relatively low proliferation rates in our sample set. We compared the relative
contribution of these two factors (proliferation and receptor status) to metabolite
levels through statistical analysis and found that a number of analytes were
strongly associated with one parameter but not the other suggesting that there is
some degree of independence. However, these results further highlight the potential
confounding classification issue in breast cancer as receptor status, intrinsic
subtype, and genetic and phenotypic properties are all correlated. The admixture of
cancers we analyzed in the current study reinforces these relationships indicating
that this data set is highly representative of the landscape of the disease. The
inclusion of metabolite profiles as an additional dimension in the TCGA database
provides a new level of resolution to this important public resource. Indexing our
metabolite data to the rigorously curated, comprehensive, and standardized TCGA
platform offers the opportunity for additional hypothesis testing and discovery
based upon metabolic signatures and could produce novel insights for detection,
prognostic, predictive, or therapeutic benefit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have identified categorical differences in the metabolic profile of ER- vs.
ER&#x02009;+&#x02009;breast tumors that may directly impact tumor behavior and clinical phenotypes.
We found notable differences in energy needs, redox potential, protein uptake and
catabolism which in the ER- samples correlated with increases in glutathione
biosynthesis, NAD&#x02009;+&#x02009;production, and proliferative signaling. The data are consistent
with high Warburg metabolism in the ER- tumors, as several biochemical intermediates
of the glycolytic pathway including lactate were found to be increased in these
cancers. Joint analysis with genetic alterations further identified several
gene-metabolite correlations validating the physiologic relevance of reported
<italic>in vitro</italic> associations and providing indications
of novel regulatory relationships between tumor genetics and metabolism. The
addition of metabolomic data to the public domain TCGA dataset provides an important
new tool for the discovery and hypothesis testing of the genetic regulatory of tumor
metabolism.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec16"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13058_2014_415_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>Demographic and clinical data for the breast cancer subjects
