While pathways that control this process have been characterized in the gland as a whole, the contribution of specific cell subtypes, in particular the basal compartment, remains largely unknown. Basal cells provide structural and contractile support, however they also orchestrate the communication between the stroma and the luminal compartment at all developmental stages. Using RNA-seq, we show that basal cells are extraordinarily transcriptionally dynamic throughout pregnancy when compared to luminal cells. We identified gene expression changes that define specific basal functions acquired during development that led to the identification of novel markers. Enrichment analysis of gene sets from 24 mouse models for breast cancer pinpoint to a potential new function for insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1r) in the basal epithelium during lactogenesis. We establish that &#x003b2;-catenin signaling is activated in basal cells during early pregnancy, and demonstrate that this activity is mediated by lysophosphatidic acid receptor 3 (Lpar3). These findings identify novel pathways active during functional maturation of the adult mammary gland.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The adult mammary gland is a complex tissue composed of many different cell types that function together to provide nutrients in the form of milk proteins and lipids, as well as protective immune factors for the offspring. The mammary gland contains two major tissue compartments, the epithelium and the stroma within the mammary fat pad. Luminal cells are the major component of the epithelial layer. They surround the duct, undergoing differentiation into milk-producing alveoli during pregnancy. The basal layer of the epithelium, composed primarily of myoepithelial cells, is a meshwork of cells that enclose the luminal cells and contract during lactation to assist in the secretion of milk. These cells also contribute to the synthesis of the basement membrane, which surrounds the epithelial compartment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Communication between and within the cellular compartments is essential for the functional development and differentiation of the mammary gland<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p><p>The functional development of the mammary gland primarily occurs postnatally. At birth only a rudimentary gland is present<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Proliferation of the epithelial cells and invasion into the mammary fat pad occurs at puberty with the ducts reaching the end of the fat pad, shaping the mature gland<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Once pregnancy begins, the luminal epithelial cells proliferate, producing tertiary branches, whereby they differentiate into milk-producing alveolar cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. The first stage of lactogenesis occurs during late pregnancy when lipid droplets form and milk proteins are produced and secreted. The second stage is characterized by the abundant milk secretion that occurs after parturition, when mature alveolar cells produce and secrete milk into the lumen of the alveoli<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. It is only at this stage that the gland reaches a fully differentiated state<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. After lactation, involution of the mammary epithelium begins resulting in the tightly regulated death of alveolar cells and extensive tissue remodeling to revert the gland to a pre-pregnancy-like state.</p><p>The current knowledge of the functional differentiation and development of the mammary gland is largely based on studies of the luminal epithelial population because luminal cells (i) are the most prevalent cell type in the mammary gland, especially during pregnancy and lactation; (ii) produce milk proteins and lipids, and therefore are accountable for the major function of the mammary gland; (iii) are the origin of the most common and malignant breast cancer subtypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Recent interest in basal epithelial cells has heightened due mainly to the discoveries that this population regulates the structural integrity of the epithelial compartment, communicates with luminal cells to regulate ductal outgrowth and branching morphogenesis during puberty and comprises a minor population of mammary stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Recent evidence reveals that the basal compartment provides signals to coordinate the functional differentiation of luminal progenitor cells during lactogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.</p><p>The genes and signaling pathways driving development of the mammary gland have been extensively characterized<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. These studies have been fundamental to identify pathways governing the various phases of mammary gland development. However, a major limitation of these studies is the use of combined RNA from all cell subtypes present in the adult mammary gland. The results most likely reflect the transcriptional profile of the dominant cell type, the luminal epithelial cells, during mammary gland development. The basal cells are less prevalent; thus, minor development-specific gene expression changes in this subtype may remain undetected. Together with luminal cells, the basal epithelial population undergoes significant changes at the gene expression level when exposed to the ovarian hormones 17&#x003b2;-estradiol and progesterone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Gene expression analysis of four different human and mouse mammary epithelial cell populations (mammary stem/basal cells, committed luminal progenitor, mature luminal and stromal cell) revealed that the basal population contains the largest number of conserved genes between the two species providing insight into conserved lineage-specific pathways functional in the adult mammary gland<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. These studies also validated the use of mouse models for studying gene expression profiles in enriched populations during normal mammary gland development. However, a detailed characterization at the gene expression level of enriched epithelial cell populations during all stages of postnatal mammary gland development remains to be done.</p><p>The work presented here transcriptionally profiles enriched basal populations during eight different stages of murine postnatal mammary gland development compared to enriched luminal epithelial cells. Our results uncover an unexpected dynamic transcriptional activity in basal cells that led us to identify an expression profile that defines the specific functions acquired by these cells during mammary gland differentiation. We discovered novel markers associated with known basal functional pathways. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis of the spatio-temporal gene set with a gene set of 24 mouse models for breast cancer led us to identify a potential new function for insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1r) in the basal epithelium during lactogenesis. Finally, we established that exposure of basal cells to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) triggers a morphological switch in these cells that is associated with &#x003b2;-catenin signaling activation and mediated by lysophosphatidic acid receptor 3 (Lpar3). We propose that during early pregnancy, canonical Wnt signaling is initiated in the basal epithelial cells and that this activity is mediated by Lpar3 signaling. These findings greatly improve the current knowledge of basal cell function during mammary gland development, and provide novel markers for functional validation in normal mammary gland development and breast tumorigenesis.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Generation of CD24<sup>+</sup> CD29<sup>lo</sup> and CD24<sup>+</sup> CD29<sup>hi</sup> RNAseq datasets across murine mammary postnatal development</title><p>To characterize the transcriptional activity of basal cells relative to the luminal population during pregnancy, lactation and involution we first isolated luminal and basal epithelial cells during postnatal development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Across all time points, the mammary epithelial cells consistently separated into two distinct epithelial cell populations, Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup> CD29<sup>lo</sup> and Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup> CD29<sup>hi</sup> (referred to as the luminal and basal subtypes, respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). We worked under the assumption that the expression of the markers used for sorting was not altered during development. As an initial technical validation of luminal and basal cell enrichment, we re-sorted 1,000 cells from each population and confirmed low cross contamination (&#x0003c;2%) between the Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup> CD29<sup>lo</sup> and Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup> CD29<sup>hi</sup> enriched cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Overall, our experimental approach allowed for the collection of a sample set of enriched luminal and basal cells from the murine mammary epithelium during eight time points of postnatal development.</p><p>To identify cell subtype specific gene expression changes occurring during postnatal mammary gland development, we performed transcriptomic analysis using RNA-sequencing on enriched basal cell populations and compared the developmental profile to matched luminal cells in three biological sets. Sample outliers were identified by comparing the Pearson correlation coefficients between samples and sample-sample variability as determined by principal component analysis (PCA). Subsequent analyses excluded the identified outlier (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). We conducted a preliminary technical validation using luminal cells from the early pregnancy and lactation time points and found that 78.5% of the genes tested by RT-PCR validate the RNA-seq findings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). To discern the contribution of technical versus biological variation to global transcriptomic changes, we conducted a PCA on the normalized data set. We used an approach adapted from Teschendorff <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>, in which we calculated a p-value for the association between each covariate and a principal component (PC) using analysis of variance (ANOVA) linear modeling. Since each time point and replicate were sorted independently over a course of several months, we wanted to ensure that this variable did not introduce uncontrolled noise to the dataset and included it as a technical covariate (labeled as Sorting time on the heatmap, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The first two principal components embodied most of the variability (41.3%) observed between the samples. Cell subtype differences were substantially represented in the first principal component with a p-value less than 2.9&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;26</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>) and contributed, as expected, to the most difference. The other variables of biological interest, cell population, specific developmental time point and pregnancy stage, were significantly associated with PC1 and PC2 with p-values less than 2.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;15</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). All technical covariates analyzed displayed an insignificant contribution to PC1 (p-values&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.1). The use of different sequencing lanes, RNA amplification batch and variations due to sorting times were slightly more associated with PC2 (p-values 3.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>, 2.4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> and 7.4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>, respectively), though these associations were minor relative to condition, time point and stage (p-values&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;15</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). We therefore concluded that expression changes were associated with biological functions of mammary gland development, rather than technical variation. The first component differentiates the luminal and basal epithelial cell populations, while the second component was primarily driven by stage-specific differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>,c).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Gene set expression of luminal and basal specific markers remains constant in CD24<sup>+</sup> CD29<sup>lo</sup> and CD24<sup>+</sup> CD29<sup>hi</sup> enriched populations though pregnancy and lactation and defines luminal and basal cell subtypes</title><p>To our knowledge, our dataset is the first of its kind and therefore there are no known, distinct luminal and basal developmental markers. Consequently we manually curated a list of markers commonly used for FACS enrichment of mammary cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, luminal and basal mammary epithelial cell markers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref> and mammary gland development genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. To ensure enrichment of the cell populations at all time points, we first conducted a supervised clustering analysis to test how the samples group relative to the expression of a curated set of luminal and basal cell markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The samples clustered into two distinct groups based on their specific cell subtypes. Surprisingly, the early involution (Id2B) basal population clustered with, yet was still distinct from, the luminal cells. Though genes for several well characterized basal markers, <italic>Acta2</italic> (smooth muscle actin), <italic>Mef2c</italic> (myocyte enhancer factor 2c), <italic>Snai2</italic> (snail homolog 2) and <italic>Lifr</italic> (leukemia inhibitory factor receptor alpha) were maintained at a significantly higher level than in luminal cells (FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01), other well characterized markers such as <italic>Trp63</italic> (tumor protein 63), <italic>Krt5/14</italic> (cytokeratins 5 and 14) and <italic>Id4</italic> (inhibitor of DNA binding 4) appear to be down regulated in this population during early involution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), yet further validation would be required at the protein level. The other basal markers provided additional evidence that the basal population is enriched for basal epithelial cells, and the dynamic expression patterns during the different time points may be reflective of their function during mammary gland development. In the luminal epithelial cells, the well-characterized luminal epithelial cell marker cytokeratin 18 (<italic>Krt18</italic>) was highly expressed throughout development relative to the basal cells. The expression of other luminal markers varied throughout development, but they were predominantly expressed in the luminal population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). As expected, the majorities of the lineage negative markers (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) were not detectable, or were expressed at very low levels in both cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Additionally, the luminal and basal markers used for sorting, <italic>Cd24a</italic> and <italic>Itgb1</italic> (CD29), were consistently highly expressed throughout development, demonstrating that we collected a population of Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup> CD29<sup>lo</sup> and Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup> CD29<sup>hi</sup> cells at all stages of pregnancy, lactation, and involution. We therefore concluded that the sorted populations consist of basal and luminal cells at all stages analyzed.</p><p>We next sought to determine if the transcriptomes of these populations reflect their known developmental functions. The initial principal component analysis demonstrated that the expression profile distinguishes the lactogenic and early involution stages from the non-pregnant and early pregnancy time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). To confirm that the variability in gene expression reflects the functional changes that occur during postnatal mammary gland development, we assessed the expression of several genes known to be involved in lactation, and cell contraction during lactation and involution of the mammary gland. We found that these genes displayed both stage and cell subtype specific expression patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). This demonstrates that our novel transcriptomic data set also reflects the functional changes that occur in luminal and basal epithelial cell populations during postnatal mammary gland development. Taken together, we have established a unique RNA-seq data set that allows for an in depth investigation of cell subtype-specific expression changes during mouse postnatal mammary gland development.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Spatio-Temporal Transcriptomic Analysis Reveal that the Basal Epithelial Cell Population is More Transcriptionally Dynamic Relative to the Luminal Population During Lactation and Involution</title><p>We next hypothesized that basal cell transcription profiles are unique at each stage of postnatal mammary gland development. To characterize the basal epithelial cells and identify potential novel cell subtype-specific mammary gland development genes, we explored the spatio-temporal transcriptome profile of the enriched basal population relative to luminal cells. From the PCA, we determined that the developmental stages separate based on the onset of lactogenesis, represented by the late pregnancy time point in this dataset (P14.5). The non-pregnant time points cluster close together with early pregnancy (P3.5) and therefore are more tightly associated at the gene expression level than the later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). The lactogenesis and involution time points are not as strongly associated to one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>), suggesting that the gene expression profile of both cell populations during lactogenesis and early involution is highly dynamic.</p><p>With this study, we aimed to assess the global transcriptome dynamics of luminal and basal epithelial cells with an emphasis on identifying novel basal specific pathways. We used ANOVA to filter for genes that were differentially expressed (DE) in at least one cell population during a minimum of one time point (FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01), and found that 12,663 (71.9%) of the 17,606 normalized genes met this criterion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). To identify genes that were spatially or temporally regulated, we set a conservative, arbitrary threshold of &#x0003e;2-fold change and FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01. Given that within our samples cell population and stage specific differences contributed the most to variability, we did not include the technical covariates in the linear model. We found that, of the spatially and temporally expressed genes, 8,718 (68.8%) genes were spatially DE between luminal and basal cells in at least one time point, and 9,821 (77.6%) genes were temporally DE between any two time points in either cell subtype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Additionally, 50.7% of the 12,663 expressed genes were both spatially and temporally DE within the cell populations, meaning that of the spatially regulated genes, 73.6% were also temporally differentially expressed. Based on these findings, we concluded that most (95.7%) of the genes expressed in adult luminal and basal mammary epithelial cells are spatially and temporally regulated during pregnancy, lactation and involution.</p><p>To characterize the individual cell populations during the developmental time points, we focused our analysis on changes of temporal patterns within the group of spatially DE genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). We defined luminal and basal specific genes as those that were upregulated in either the luminal or basal population in at least one time point during development relative to the other population (fold change &#x02265;2, FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). Of the 8,718 spatially DE genes, 35.8% were luminal specific, 46.7% were basal specific and a subset of the genes (17.5%) switched between luminal and basal specificity throughout development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Of the luminal specific genes, 570 (18.3%) were specific to the luminal population throughout all stages of development, and of the basal specific genes, 1,292 (31.7%) were specific to this population. These findings indicate that the majority of the differentially expressed genes in each population were not population specific across all the developmental time points analyzed and support the premise for a temporally regulated pattern.</p><p>The basis of the present characterization of the luminal and basal populations during postnatal mammary gland development was to identify genes that are time point and/or stage specific. As the primary functional and morphological changes occur in the mammary epithelium during pregnancy, lactation and involution, we expected a dynamic expression profile during these time points in both cell subtypes. We performed pairwise comparisons between each time point/stage and the remaining time points (or stages) and selected genes that were statistically significant across all comparisons (fold change &#x02265;2 and FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). All genes that met this threshold are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>. Stages are defined in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Procedures Table 1</xref> with the exception of lactogenesis (P14.5, L3 and L10), lactation-involution (lact-invo, L3, L10 and Id2) and lactogenesis-involution (lacto-invo, P14.5, L3, L10 and Id2). A larger number of differentially expressed genes were detected in luminal cells during late pregnancy, lactation and early involution time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, top). The stage specific temporal analysis allowed for the detection of additional novel genes that were differentially regulated across multiple time points. We found that the lactation (L3 and L10 time points) and lactatogenesis-involution (lacto-invo, P14.5, L3, L10 and Id2 time points) stages had the largest number of DE genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, top). The basal population had an overwhelmingly larger number of significant DE genes in both the time point and stage specific analysis relative to the luminal population, 3,144 versus 1,559 unique DE genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>,c). Most of the changes in the basal population occurred in the P3.5, L3, L10 and Id2 time points, and during the lactation and lactogenesis-involution stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>,c, bottom).</p><p>To biologically validate our dataset, we assessed the enrichment of the spatio-temporal gene set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>,c) in a published dataset of murine and human luminal and basal specific genes.

We also observed a significant enrichment of stromal genes in our basal gene sets. This was consistent with the published data set, where of the 1,257 basal genes identified, 277 (22%) were also identified in the stromal population. This suggests that the basal population expresses stromal genes, which may result from and assist with the communication between the two cell populations. This analysis demonstrates that our gene sets biologically validate with an independent enrichment of adult virgin cell subtypes and are conserved in human, confirming the identity of the enriched luminal and basal populations throughout the development of the mammary gland.</p><p>Based on the sorting conditions we used, the enriched basal epithelial population appears to be more transcriptionally dynamic than the luminal population. From the temporal analysis, we found that the majority of the cell population specific genes are temporally regulated during pregnancy, lactation and involution. These results suggest that the expression changes observed in the sorted populations reflect functional changes that occur during postnatal mammary gland development.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Analysis of Lactation Specific Pathways Reveals Novel Functional Targets in Each Cell Population</title><p>To establish whether the transcriptome dynamics during pregnancy, lactation and involution reflect the developmental function of these cell subtypes, we tested for the enrichment of the time point and stage specific genes in functional groups annotated in the gene ontology (GO), KEGG and Reactome databases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>.

When we set a cutoff of a FDR of 0.05, we found a significant enrichment of genes upregulated in the basal population during lactation and downregulated in the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (Igf1r) overexpression mouse model relative to the other tumor models. Igf1r has been shown to be necessary for normal alveolar proliferation and differentiation during pregnancy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>. However, a basal cell specific function for Igf1r has yet to be established. We hypothesized that Igf1r signaling is diminished in the basal cells during lactation to inhibit proliferation and promote terminal cellular differentiation. To gain insight into a potential function of Igf1r in the basal epithelium during lactation, we observed the expression trajectories of Igf1r signaling associated genes and conducted a GO analysis on the identified gene targets. Our trajectory analysis demonstrates though that Igf1r was consistently expressed throughout development in both cell populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). The basal specific expression of various insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (Igfbps 2, 4 and 6) and the inhibitor of Igf1r signaling, <italic>Grb10</italic>, suggested that these factors may restrict the signal transduction of Igf1r in the basal cells during lactation. GO analysis of the targets downregulated by Igf1r signaling (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;339 L10, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;422 lactation and n&#x02009;=&#x02009;304 overlapping genes) and upregulated during lactation revealed that many of these genes are involved in development and differentiation processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>).

We detected a significant correlation between the gene set downregulated in the basal cells during early involution and downregulated in the LPA receptor overexpression model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). This suggests that LPA receptor signaling activation may take place during early involution. Given our initial discovery that GPCR signaling is important during lactogenesis and involution in the basal epithelial compartment and the fact that LPA receptors are GPCRs, we investigated their association with early involution further. To determine which receptor may be activated, we assessed the expression of the three LPA receptors overexpressed in the murine breast cancer model and <italic>Enpp2</italic> (ATX) at the gene expression and protein levels. We found that <italic>Enpp2</italic> is expressed specifically in the basal population with the highest induction during late pregnancy and into early involution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). Of the LPA receptors, <italic>Lpar1</italic> is uniquely upregulated during early involution in the basal population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>).

Because of the specific timing of expression in basal cells, we investigated this gene further. To confirm the expression pattern at the protein level, we used confocal microscopy to test for Lpar3 expression in early pregnancy (P3.5) and week 10 (W10) mammary tissues. We observed low levels of Lpar3 (Lpar3<sup>lo</sup>) throughout the mammary epithelium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). However, a subset of cells demonstrated high levels of Lpar3 expression (Lpar3<sup>hi</sup>) irrespective of K14 levels, suggesting the presence of a LPA responsive subpopulation of cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). There were no detectable Lpar3<sup>hi</sup> or Lpar3<sup>lo</sup> regions of interest (ROIs) in the non-primary antibody negative control, and we did not detect these staining patterns in the W10 tissue, supporting that the Lpar3 staining is accurately reflective of expression status (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>).

Mock treated HME50 cells display the typical morphology of elongated myoepithelial cells, while LPA treated cells have a more cuboidal morphology characteristic of cells generating polarized epithelia. In addition, LPA exposure induces the formation of protrusion resembling lamellipodia, the cytoplasmic sheets that extended at the front of migrating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>, top row, bottom left inserts). Staining for luminal K18 and basal K14 specific markers show a significant increase in the expression of the luminal marker K18 in LPA exposed basal cells when compared to the mock treated control cells with some cells expressing both K18 and K14 markers suggesting the expression of markers for both epithelial cell lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e,f</xref>). To confirm that basal HME50 cells exposed to LPA undergo a differentiation switch, we measured the expression levels of two well characterized mammary epithelial luminal differentiation markers, Forkhead Box A1 (<italic>FOXA1</italic>) and Mucin1 (<italic>MUC1</italic>), as well as three genes known to be expressed in cells primed for milk production, E74 Like ETS Transcription Factor 5 (ELF5), Milk Fat Globule-EGF Factor 8 Protein (<italic>MFG-E8</italic>) and Lactotransferrin (<italic>LTF</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref>).

The trajectory analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>) and <italic>in vitro</italic> results demonstrate that LPAR3 and &#x003b2;-catenin are co-expressed in mammary epithelial cells during early pregnancy and LPA exposure activates &#x003b2;-catenin in basal mammary epithelial cells through LPAR3 signaling. To further confirm that &#x003b2;-catenin signaling is active in the basal population during early pregnancy, we conducted an enrichment analysis of our gene sets in a dataset in which &#x003b2;-catenin was constitutively activated resulting in tumor formation (GSE43825).

GFP positive cells co-localize with Lpar3 positive cells at P10.5 as shown by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>, merged layers) supporting our proposed model of Lpar3 basal specific activation via &#x003b2;-catenin during the early stages of pregnancy. Collectively, our results support the hypothesis that &#x003b2;-catenin is active during pregnancy in the basal population, and we propose that its activation through Lpar3 signaling events initiate a basal to luminal differentiation process that, during early pregnancy, is necessary to populate the mammary gland with cells of the milk production lineage.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present work provides the first spatio-temporal transcriptome analysis of the luminal and basal population during mammary gland development.

We speculate that this could also be due, in part, to differences in population heterogeneity, with the basal population being more homogeneous than the luminal. The finding that the basal gene set is significantly more conserved than the luminal when comparing independently generated mouse and human gene sets supports this hypothesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. The luminal population consists of a mosaic of hormonally responsive cell populations, while the basal population is thought to be composed primarily of myoepithelial cells with a minor stem/progenitor cell population. However, ductal and alveolar myoepithelial cells are structurally distinct and exhibit different expression patterns of smooth muscle cell markers, suggesting that a heterogeneous population of cells is also present within the basal layer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78">78</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">79</xref>. Therefore, the data collected thus far do not allow for a definitive understanding as to whether basal epithelial cells are indeed more transcriptionally active, or if this is a reflection of the complexity and heterogeneity of these two main mammary epithelial cell subtypes. This data set, however, can be utilized to identify new markers for further enrichment of specific subpopulations of differentiated and progenitor mammary epithelial cells, making it possible to further explore the differences in transcriptional activity and functionality of these cells.</p><p>The transcriptional dynamics of the mammary epithelium throughout development are highly controlled by intrinsic and systemic signaling. Histologically, the basal epithelial cells create a barrier between the luminal epithelium and the surrounding stroma, and may serve as an intermediate of communication between both cellular compartments. During lactation, we observed an upregulation of genes involved in cell-ECM (ILK-PINCH-Parvin (IPP) complex and type I hemidesmosome components). Type I hemidesmosomes maintain the integrity and structure of tissues by linking the basal epithelial cell keratin cytoskeleton to the ECM, yet are able to quickly disassemble to allow for cell division, differentiation and migration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b80">80</xref>. Therefore, it is likely that these genes may be important in maintaining the structural integrity of the mammary epithelium during lactation where the epithelial compartment has drastically expanded and the myoepithelial cells are contracting to push milk through the ducts. Hormonal stimulation from prolactin and &#x003b2;1 integrin interaction with the ECM promotes milk protein production and epithelial cell differentiation through ILK signaling and activation of the Rho GTPase, Rac1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b81">81</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b82">82</xref>. Activation of Rac1 by ILK could occur through various ILK binding partners (Parvins, PINCH and Paxillin), however the mechanism by which ILK mediateds differentiation has yet to be determined<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>. We found that all genes in the IPP complex are expressed in basal cells during lactation, however we observe a basal population-specific upregulation of <italic>Ilk</italic>, <italic>Lims2</italic> (PINCH2), and <italic>Parvb</italic> (&#x003b2;Parvin) suggesting that the ILK functions observed in previous studies are specific to the basal epithelium and occur through ILK/PINCH2 and ILK/&#x003b2;Parvin interactions. Furthermore, evidence suggests that PINCH2 is not able to activate Rac1, however &#x003b2;Parvin is a direct positive regulator of Rac1 activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>. We therefore propose that ILK/&#x003b2;Parvin interactions promote Rac1 activity within the basal epithelium resulting in pro-differentiation signaling to the luminal epithelium, while the less understood ILK/PINCH2 interactions require further investigation.</p><p>Cell-cell adhesions through adherens junctions are largely mediated by cadherins, a family of proteins important for mediating cell-cell interactions and cell signaling. E- and P-cadherin stabilize the polarized cell shape of the epithelium and maintain the undifferentiated state of the mammary epithelium, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b83">83</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b84">84</xref>. N-cadherin is upregulated in invasive tumors and promotes tumor cell metastasis, however little is known of its function in the normal mammary epithelium (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>). We found a basal population specific upregulation of <italic>Cdh2</italic> (N-cadherin) during lactation, supporting a lactation-specific function in this cell layer. Understanding the function of N-cadherin under physiological conditions in the lactating gland may help to better understand its role in tumorigenesis and the progression to metastasis.</p><p>We have evidence supporting basal-specific upregulation of &#x003b1;-adrenoceptors during lactation. Oxytocin, released from the pituitary gland, stimulates the contraction of myoepithelial cells by binding to the oxytocin receptor, a GPCR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b85">85</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b86">86</xref>. Adrenergic receptors (AR) are essential to cardiac physiology and the &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AR subclass (&#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-, &#x003b1;<sub>1B</sub>- and &#x003b1;<sub>1D</sub>-AR) signal through coupling to G<sub>q</sub>/11 (G&#x003b1;<sub>q</sub>) G-proteins and activate phospholipase C&#x003b2;1 (PLC&#x003b2;1), which results in calcium release from intracellular stores and smooth muscle cell contraction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b87">87</xref>. Additionally, we demonstrated a significant enrichment of genes involved in G&#x003b1;<sub>q</sub> and PLC&#x003b2;1 mediated signaling. Due to the well-characterized function of &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-ARs in regulating smooth muscle cell contraction, we propose that these receptors may also be responsible for simulating myoepithelial cell contraction. We also observed a basal cell-specific upregulation of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-ARs. Given the cell subtype specific function of ARs and the known potential for AR subclasses to interact, further investigation into the function of these receptors in myoepithelial cells should incorporate both subtypes (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b88">88</xref>).</p><p>Though we observed a basal cell specific association with Igf1r overexpression, all three receptors <italic>Igf1r</italic>, <italic>Igf2r</italic> and <italic>Insr</italic> were expressed in both cell subtypes. The expression patterns across development were relatively consistent when comparing both cell subtypes. This suggests that ligand accessibility and downstream mediators facilitate cell subtype-specific functions of these receptors. As previously reported, we showed that <italic>Igf1</italic> expression was increased in the luminal population during lactation and into early involution, both insulin receptor substrates (<italic>Irs1/2</italic>) increased expression during lactation, and the Igfbps were differentially expressed throughout the developmental time points exhibiting basal cell specificity (with the exception of <italic>Igfbp5</italic>). Basal cell specific upregulation of <italic>Igf2</italic> during lactation is consistent with its function as a mediator of morphogenesis during alveologenesis acting as a paracrine factor for the alveolar cells. However, we detected reduced levels of <italic>Prlr</italic> expression in the basal cells during lactation compared with non-pregnant time points (data not shown), suggesting that, in basal cells, <italic>Igf2</italic> expression may not be directly regulated by prolactin as described for mammary epithelial cells as a whole<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref>. The upregulation of <italic>Igf2r</italic> during early involution supports a potential function in the turnover of Igf2 after lactation allowing for local <italic>Igf1</italic> mediated signaling during early involution. This turnover is important because, like Igf1, overexpression of Igf2 has been found to delay mammary involution by increasing cell survival<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b89">89</xref>. Further functional studies are required to demonstrate these proposed functions <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Basal cell specific upregulation of <italic>Igf1</italic> during early involution suggests a potential role in involution. Previous studies have demonstrated that overexpression of Igf1 in the mammary gland results in enhanced focal cell survival during involution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b90">90</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b91">91</xref> and that Igfbp5 interferes with Igf1 signaling, promoting apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b92">92</xref>. Our data suggests that the basal cells, through expression of <italic>Igf1</italic>, may be involved in orchestrating which cells survive, while luminal cell specific Igfbp5 induces apoptosis in the mammary epithelium during involution. Together, analysis of the spatio-temporal expression patterns of IGF signaling factors reveals novel insights into the coordinated signaling events during normal development, and more importantly highlights the importance of the basal epithelium in orchestrating development during lactation and post-lactational regression.</p><p>We obtained novel evidence that supports LPA receptor function in normal mammary gland development. A previous study has demonstrated that overexpression of LPA receptors is sufficient to promote mammary tumor formation and progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b93">93</xref>, however their functions under physiological conditions have yet to be investigated. We demonstrate a basal cell specific upregulation of <italic>Lpar1</italic>, <italic>Lpar3</italic> and their upstream activator <italic>Enpp2</italic> (autotaxin). Considering that Lpar overexpression leads to a high frequency of chronic mastitis, which denotes chronic inflammation, we propose that Lpar1 expression promotes the early inflammatory response previously observed during early involution, which in turn also has the potential to induce the tumor-promoting environment during early involution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b93">93</xref>. We uncovered a novel role for Lpar3 in mediating the transition of basal epithelial cells into a more differentiated state committed to milk production. LPA, through its interaction with different high-affinity receptors, acts on different cell types and tissues to mediate a variety of cellular responses, including platelet aggregation, smooth muscle contraction, cell proliferation and differentiation, protection from apoptosis, stress fiber formation and tumor cell invasion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b94">94</xref>. In pancreatic cell lines, LPA was shown not to act as a mitogen, but as an efficacious stimulator of cell migration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b95">95</xref>. This is in agreement with our results where LPA hinder, proliferation in favor of differentiation. We also demonstrated that the expression profile of the basal population during pregnancy is significantly associated with active &#x003b2;-catenin signaling, an observation that is corroborated by the <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis of TcfLef-H2BGFP mice at P10.5. Given that a clear link between canonical Wnt signaling and the function of &#x003b2;-catenin in promoting lobulo-alveolar development during pregnancy has yet to be established (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b96">96</xref>) and that Lpar3 has been found to activate &#x003b2;-catenin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">77</xref>, we now propose that signaling through Lpar3 may activate &#x003b2;-catenin in basal epithelial cells during early pregnancy. It is interesting to note that while at the mRNA level Enpp2 and Lpar3 increase in expression at early pregnancy, we do not observe active &#x003b2;-catenin signaling in the GFP reporter mouse until P10.5. While it is likely that the delay is caused by the time required for the establishment of the autocrine loop response, our results suggest that pregnancy could provide a robust model for the characterization of the activation of this specific pathway.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mouse Maintenance and Mammary Gland Isolation</title><p>Four week-old male and female FVB/N (Taconic Laboratories Hudson, NY) were housed, bred and maintained under the approved animal protocol #20090502 (Institute for Animal Studies (IAS) of Albert Einstein College of Medicine).

(<bold>c</bold>) Heatmap representation of the enrichment of spatio-temporal gene sets (columns) in gene sets obtained from three stages of a mouse mammary tumor model in which &#x003b2;-catenin was overexpressed (GSE43825, rows). Each row represents genes upregulated (.U) and downregulated (.D) relative to normal samples. Dark red and blue blocks indicate a statistically significant enrichment of genes upregulated and downregulated in spatio-temporal gene sets, respectively (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01).
