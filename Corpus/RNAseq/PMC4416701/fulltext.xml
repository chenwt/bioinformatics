A systematic examination of translation and physiological regulation of ncRNAs has not been conducted. Here, we use computational methods to identify the products of non-canonical translation in mouse neurons by analyzing unannotated transcripts in combination with proteomic data. This study supports the existence of non-canonical translation products from both intragenic and extragenic genomic regions, including peptides derived from anti-sense transcripts and introns. Moreover, the studied novel translation products exhibit temporal regulation similar to that of proteins known to be involved in neuronal activity processes. These observations highlight a potentially large and complex set of biologically regulated translational events from transcripts formerly thought to lack coding potential.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P7">Recent genome-wide transcriptome studies have shown that tens of thousands of loci outside of the defined protein coding regions are transcribed<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> . The resulting transcripts include a plethora of species such as 5&#x02019; leader sequences and 3&#x02019; end regions, introns, micro RNAs (miRNAs)<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, enhancer RNAs (eRNAs)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, small nuclear RNAs (snRNA)<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, anti-sense transcripts<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, and various other short and long RNAs<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. The identification of these transcripts implies a complexity previously unappreciated and has led to the emergence of significant efforts investigating the roles of RNA species traditionally referred to as non-coding sequences<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. In parallel to the identification of transcribed regions throughout the genome, proteomic studies have shown that a fraction of the "high-quality spectra" from mass-spectrometry (MS) based proteomics experiments do not match annotated proteins<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. This led us to hypothesize that some of these unmatched spectra could represent uncharacterized translation events derived from transcribed regions outside coding genes. Consistent with this hypothesis, recent studies have shown that non-coding transcripts are associated with ribosome<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and that some non-coding transcripts lead to translation of short open reading frames<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">Here we report the results of a systematic study that we undertook to investigate and evaluate the existence of non-canonical translation products and their biological regulation under physiological conditions combining RNAseq and quantitative MS approaches. The results of this study not only indicate the presence of a large number of previously undetected protein translational products but they also show that they are temporally regulated suggesting more complex regulatory biochemical mechanisms that have not been previously observed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Work flow and analysis of RNAseq data</title><p id="P9">To systematically investigate the existence of non-canonical translation products and their biological regulation under physiological conditions, we introduced and validated new computational algorithms to compare the transcriptome and the proteome from the same experimental context (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). These algorithms were developed to identify transcripts and corresponding translation products from transcriptome data derived from sequencing total RNA (RNA-seq), including polyA and non-polyA species and mass spectrometry MS peptide sequencing data. The algorithms were applied to data collected from an experiment in which mouse cortical neurons were depolarized by potassium chloride (KCl) to induce activity-dependent expression changes (see Methods). Total RNA-seq transcriptome data after rRNA depletion<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and quantitative MS proteomic data were collected at multiple time-points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). To identify transcribed regions from the total RNA data, a <italic>de novo</italic> transcript-calling algorithm was used<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. This algorithm is well suited to discover unannotated translation products, since it identifies unspliced transcripts, has no sequence biases, and is specifically designed to detect lowly expressed regions of the genome. The algorithm identified 26,169 transcribed regions, 12,108 of which overlapped with annotated protein coding genes (RefSeq, mm9). Here, regions corresponding to unspliced transcripts from total RNA data are searched; thus, our study has the potential to detect a wider range of non-canonical protein products and differs from previous work that was confined to either spliced transcripts<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> or transcripts attached to ribosomes<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>IIdentification of novel non-canonical translational products</title><p id="P10">A multiplexed quantitative MS proteomic data set comprised of 3 biological replicates with 3 technical replicates each, with a temporal profile similar to that of the transcriptomic data yielded 1,131,393 MS spectra. We used an iterative procedure to investigate these peptide fragmentation spectra. The rationale for this iterative strategy was to reduce the random matching spectra derived from annotated peptides to non-canonical sequences, thereby increasing the chances of identifying true spectral matches for non-canonical transcripts. First, the spectra were searched with MASCOT (v2.3) against an annotated mouse protein database (Uniprot Feb 2012, canonical and isoform sequences) to identify matches to annotated peptides; 226,471 (20%) of the spectra matched annotated sequences. These matched spectra (peptide spectral matches, PSMs) corresponded to 15,516 unique peptides and were grouped into 3,284 proteins using a 1% false-discovery rate (FDR) cut-off and a minimum of two peptides per protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Since the focus in this study was to investigate non-canonical translational events, the spectra matching the annotated proteome were then excluded before searching against the custom transcriptome database.</p><p id="P11">While unmatched good quality spectra may be derived from peptides which are post-translationally modified and are not accounted for in the initial searches against the canonical mouse protein sequence database, we asked whether some of the unmatched good quality spectra could constitute translation products from transcripts classified as non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). To investigate this possibility, the remaining un-matched spectra were searched against a custom database, which was generated by translating the transcribed regions from total RNA-sequence data. This custom database contained transcripts derived from total RNA, including unspliced RNAs and also annotated genes. Each transcript was searched in all six reading frames using MASCOT. A 1% FDR was used to select for high confidence PSMs resulting in 7,722 PSMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) (of which 54% were non-redundant). To further restrict subsequent analyses to high quality matches, only the 1,584 matches with a MASCOT expectation value &#x0003c;0.05 were chosen for further analysis. The expectation value is equivalent to the E-value in a BLAST search and thus gives each PSM a probability estimate for being a random match. These parameters provide confidence that these hits represent true positives, even though in some cases only a single instance of a peptide is detected<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. The set of 1,584 PSMs comprised 250 distinct peptides that mapped uniquely to regions of the mouse genome considered non-coding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Seven pairs of peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) matched two different non-coding RNAs that differed only by an isobaric I/L amino acid, while the unambiguous identification of the source of these peptides is not possible, it is clear that these peptides sequences are not found in the canonical mouse protein sequences. Given that RNA sequence information was obtained for both I and L containing peptides, it is possible that both the I and the L containing peptides are present; therefore, all 14 peptides were included for further analysis. Interestingly, both annotated and novel peptides were found for some proteins. For example the initial database search against the annotated Uniprot database resulted in the identification of 9 annotated, unique peptides for Centg2 (Agap1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>), (17% protein sequence coverage); whereas the database search against the custom transcriptome database resulted in the identification of two novel peptides from the first intron of Centg2 (Agap1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The 250 high confidence peptides that were aligned to experimentally defined transcripts are referred to as novel peptides throughout the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Evaluation and validation of novel peptides</title><p id="P12">In addition to the high stringency cut-offs used to select peptides, several experiments were performed to evaluate the novelty of the peptides and the validity of the PSMs. First, each of the 250 novel peptide sequences was searched in non-redundant protein sequences from mouse using BLASTP and the UCSC genome browser. The results showed that 31 of the peptides corresponded to either pseudogenes or unannotated genes, which had been predicted to be translated, based on computational and transcriptional evidence, but lacked any supporting protein evidence. None of the remaining 214 peptides showed a similarity to the annotated proteome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Second, each of the 250 novel peptide sequences was searched against both the peptide atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.peptideatlas.org">http://www.peptideatlas.org</ext-link>) and NIST-Libraries of Peptide Tandem Mass Spectra (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://peptide.nist.gov">http://peptide.nist.gov</ext-link>) databases. None of these novel peptides were identified in those databases, confirming that the novel peptides had not been reported in publicly available databases. Third, synthetic peptides were used to chemically validate the identity of the novel peptides. Fragmentation patterns of the synthetic peptides were compared with the mouse peptides identified from the primary dataset. This is the most stringent method available for validating an identified peptide as it constitutes a chemically synthesized positive control. The fragmentation patterns of 45 peptides are presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2B, Supplementary Fig. 3, and Supplementary Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. 7C</xref>). The similarity between the identified and synthetic spectra was evaluated by computing the rank-ordered Spearman Correlation coefficient; all the peptides showed strong correlation with a significant p-value (p&#x0003c;0.05). In addition, the average number of common fragment ions identified was greater than 90%. Fourth, the 250 novel peptides were compared against published results from a ribosomal foot-printing experiment<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Of note, the ribosomal profiling data were performed on mouse embryonic stem cells, which have a different expression profile from mouse neurons. Nonetheless, 34 of the novel peptides were observed to be associated with ribosomes, providing independent evidence consistent with non-canonical translation events. These analyses and validation procedures lend support to the current proof-of-existence of novel peptides from non-canonical translational events.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Molecular characterization of FARP1</title><p id="P13">Further in-depth molecular characterization of non-canonical translation was carried out for the FARP1 protein. Two unique novel peptides DGIRPSNPQPPQPSTGPASR and HSSLIDDMR, which were in frame with the rest of the protein, were mapped to the FARP1 intron 13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The RNA-seq read density across this intron is ~10-fold higher than that of the other introns and the RNA levels for this intron are comparable to the levels observed for the exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, RT-PCR from three regions of this intron showed good expression in cortical cells from same experimental set up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Closer inspection of the FARP1 intron 13 sequence reveals that the first 983 bps do not contain a stop codon within the reading frame used by the preceding exon. Thus, we hypothesized that there could be novel isoforms present with ~330 additional amino acids. Western blot (WB) validation was performed to investigate FARP1 (F8VPU2) in brain lysates. FARP1 is FERM, Rho-GEF, pleckstrin domain containing protein with several different splice variants and varying molecular weights ranging from 51 kDa to 420 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). To validate that FARP1 isoforms are present in the protein bands corresponding to the western blots, an immunoprecipitation (IP) from mouse brain tissue followed by MS analysis was performed. Briefly, when the IP of FARP1 is separated by size on an SDS PAGE gel and stained using coommassie blue, protein bands are observed at molecular weight ranging from 51 kDa to &#x0003e; 420 kDa as observed from WB results of the whole cell lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). These bands were excised and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The resulting data was searched against the Uniprot mouse proteome database appended with the FARP1 (F8VPU2) intron sequence that was identified as a translation product in the global proteomics experiment. The novel peptides from the presumed intron were identified in three of the bands as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure. 2D</xref>. This extensive validation using IP and MS suggests that the bands observed in the WB do indeed contain various splice variants of FARP1, some of which include the novel intron. Furthermore, the fragmentation pattern of one of the novel peptides identified for FARP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>) matches that of its synthetic peptide. Taken together, the transcriptional and translational evidence suggest that this novel intron region is part of a larger unannotated variant of FARP1. The WB validation lends support to the genome-wide strategy for discovering novel non-canonical translation events. To predict the functional consequences of this large novel intron in the FARP1 protein, a disorder prediction analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iupred.enzim.hu">http://iupred.enzim.hu</ext-link>) and domain mapping (SMART) was carried out. These analyses predicted a highly disordered region for this novel intron and domain mapping using ELM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elm.eu.org">http://elm.eu.org</ext-link>) indicated numerous regulatory regions in this novel intron sequence when compared to the whole sequence. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref> illustrates the quantitative estimation of a subset of regulatory regions which is enriched in the novel intron as compared to the entire protein sequence suggesting that this region is possibly a hotspot for regulation by post-translational modifications. Additionally, ribosomal foot-printing data and RNA-seq data from HeLa cells provide further support for the expression of this FARP1 intron (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Mapping of novel peptides to genomic regions</title><p id="P14">The novel peptides were mapped to their genomic origins, and compared with existing annotations and the RNA-seq data. These comparisons led to a categorization of the novel peptides into 5 sub-groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Forty-nine of the novel peptides belonged to the set of peptides identified in the BLASTP search or were derived from 5&#x02019; leader sequences or 3&#x02019; end regions (Group 1). A second group comprised 31 peptides that mapped to annotated pseudogenes (Group 2). Ten of the peptides in this group were also identified in the BLASTP search as having computational evidence suggesting protein-coding potential. This result is consistent with previous studies showing that pseudogenes can be translated<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). A third group, (Group 3) included 79 peptides that mapped onto introns. These examples may reflect the existence of unannotated exons or intron inclusion events. One such example is the FARP1 locus discussed above. A particularly intriguing and unexpected group of 66 peptides (Group 4) mapped onto the reverse strand from (n = 63) or near (n = 3) known exons and introns in protein coding genes. Three of the peptides were found in the region upstream of the promoter, suggesting that they are derived from upstream anti-sense RNAs<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> in mouse cortical neurons<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. One example is Flnb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>), which shows evidence of a ~5 kb long anti-sense transcript based on our RNA-seq data as well as RNA-seq data in both the mouse liver and kidney<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. To validate the expression levels of a subset of identified &#x02018;hit&#x02019; transcripts, total RNA was isolated, tested for its integrity and reverse transcribed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 7A</xref>). Sequence verification confirmed the presence of the targeted anti-sense transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7B</xref>). One of the novel peptides anti-sense to Cox17 (IILMPSLPAR), located on chromosome 16 overlapping but anti-sense to its second intron was validated by synthetic peptide validation as discussed above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7C</xref>). All of the novel peptide groups described above were located within or in the vicinity of known protein-coding genes. Finally, a second unexpected set consisted of 25 peptides that mapped onto extragenic regions removed from any known protein-coding gene were found (Group 5). Three of these peptides were also found in the ribosomal foot-printing data<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Quantitative analysis of the novel peptides</title><p id="P15">Having determined the genomic context of the novel peptides, we set out to determine whether they were physiologically regulated in response to enhanced neuronal activity. Neuronal activation induces a gene expression program involving several hundred genes as well as non-coding RNAs<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. In the experimental setup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), mouse cortical neurons were stimulated using KCl, and TMT labeling were used to quantify the relative abundance of each peptide at different time-points following KCl stimulation. For each TMT channel the same amount of protein, 100 &#x000b5;g, was used, and labeling bias was tested by assessing the median of log<sub>2</sub> intensities from all the channels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). The medians across the channels had a standard deviation of 0.16 and a coefficient of variance of 0.02. This suggests that there is no inherent mixing irregularities in the total pool of labeled sample and the differential peptide abundance observed among time-points are true observations and hence could be biologically relevant. In addition, TMT labeling efficiency was evaluated to be 99.5% of all unique and high-confidence peptides of which 98.3% are fully labeled (labeled on N-terminal and internal Lysine residues) with TMT reporter ions indicating that there is no significant loss of peptides that would affect quantitation. All the above validations highlight our careful and comprehensive assessment of the quantitative changes of the novel peptides and hence indicate that the abundances of the known proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>) and novel peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) are modulated by KCl depolarization.</p><p id="P16">To identify patterns of co-regulation between the known proteins and novel peptides, the known protein abundance changes along with the novel peptide abundance changes were clustered together in an unbiased way using GProX (version 1.1.12) software. Results of the clustering analysis indicate that eight clusters identify discerning patterns of co-regulation of known proteins and novel peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The number of novel peptides in each of the clusters is listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>. Extrapolating from this data and from our own previous analyses<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, it can be predicted that these novel peptides are co-regulated in similar manner as the known proteins in each of the clusters. Some of these known proteins include CamKIId, Gria1 and Shank2, that are known to be temporally regulated with KCl stimulation in neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S9"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">Using a custom unprocessed transcriptome database from the same experimental context as reported here for the unbiased examination of the proteome, is a robust means to identify the existence of peptides derived from regions classified as non-coding throughout the genome. Although it is possible that some of these non-canonical peptides are the result of biological noise, this interpretation would require &#x0201c;errors&#x0201d; at multiple levels including: transcriptional sloppiness by RNA polymerase, followed by the stable survival of non-polyA transcripts, export of these species into the cytoplasm, recognition by the ribosomal machinery and translation. The consistency of the findings, which are derived from pooling large numbers of cells, together with the validation, cast doubt on an interpretation purely based on biological noise. Instead, the discovery of non-canonical translation products and the validation of 250 novel peptides is consistent with several different lines of evidence, including ribosomal profiling studies<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, characterization of short open reading frames<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> and studies examining translation of pseudogenes<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, which have pointed to a more extensive proteome than what is described by current databases. Most MS analyses, including the one presented here, are not saturating, and the number of detected protein products is much lower than the number of mRNAs detected by RNA-seq. Our RNA-seq data identified ~12,000 transcripts corresponding to canonical protein sequences, the proteomics data gave evidence for ~25% of the canonical transcripts. Extrapolating from this observation, it can be estimated that at least 4 times as many novel peptides are yet to be discovered under the current experimental conditions. Furthermore, it can be speculated that examining other tissues and biological conditions will uncover an even richer set of non-canonical translational events.</p><p id="P18">The biological function, if any, of the novel peptides described here is not known. Several studies have suggested that evolutionarily conserved regions are more likely to be functionally important. Sequence conservation for the 250 novel peptides was investigated in 28 vertebrate species using the MultiZ alignment<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. The results show that there are 30 peptides with significant evidence of purifying selection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), and that the translated sequences found in many species are more likely to show evidence of purifying selection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>), consistent with studies of proto-genes in yeast<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. The observation that peptides derived from non-canonical translational events show dynamic regulatory patterns under physiological conditions similar to those characterized for well-established proteins further suggests the possibility that these peptides may also play functional roles. Future examination of other tissues and conditions combined with functional studies will shed light on the biological roles of the uncharted proteome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Brief overview of the experimental design and Mass Spectrometry analysis (MS)</title><p id="P19">Neuronal cultures were grown, depolarized with potassium chloride (KCl) for 0, 1, 2, 3 and 6 hrs (three biological repeat experiments were performed independently).

Protein samples from multiple time points after depolarization were digested, labeled with isobaric tags and analyzed by quantitative proteomic analyses (Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry-LC-MS). (B) The resulting spectra were subjected to the database search procedure for filtering and matching peptide spectra. 20% of the spectra matched to the known mouse proteome (Uniprot Dec. 12th, 2011, incl. canonical and isoform sequences). The remaining 904,922 spectra were searched against the custom RNA-Seq transcriptome database in 6 frames and the resulting matched spectra were filtered using stringent criteria as mentioned in the text and of these 250 novel peptides were selected for further analyses.
