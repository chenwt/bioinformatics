A common polymorphism in IFIH1 (rs1990760, A946T) confers increased risk for autoimmune disease, including type 1-diabetes (T1D). Coxsackievirus infections are linked to T1D and cause beta-cell damage <italic>in vitro</italic>. Here we demonstrate that the rs1990760 polymorphism regulates the interferon (IFN) signature expressed by human pancreatic islets following Coxsackievirus infection. A strong IFN signature was associated with high expression of IFN&#x003bb;1 and IFN&#x003bb;2, linking rs1990760 to the expression of type III IFNs. In the high-responding genotype, IRF-1 expression correlated with that of type III IFN, suggesting a positive-feedback on type III IFN transcription. In summary, our study uncovers an influence of rs1990760 on the canonical effector function of MDA5 in response to an acute infection of primary human parenchymal cells with a clinically relevant virus linked to human T1D. It also highlights a previously unrecognized connection between the rs1990760 polymorphism and the expression level of type III IFNs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The interferon-induced helicase-1 (IFIH1) gene encodes the melanoma differentiation associated protein 5 (MDA5), an intracellular pattern recognition receptor (PRR) of importance for the recognition of certain viruses. The MDA5 protein consists of two N-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs), a central helicase domain, and a C-terminal domain (CTD). MDA5 monomers bind to long double stranded (ds)RNA molecules formed during the viral replication cycle. This initiates the formation of a MDA5 filament along the dsRNA, where multiple CARD domains assemble and recruit the signalling adaptor interferon promoter stimulator 1 (IPS1) (also denoted mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein, MAVS). Activated IPS1/MAVS initiates the downstream signalling events leading to the activation of the transcription factors NF-&#x003ba;B and IRF-3, followed by the production of type I and III interferons (IFN)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p><p>The rapid production of IFNs is an essential component of the immune response against many viruses. Type I and III IFNs have potent antiviral activities; they act in an auto- and paracrine manner to induce the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) leading to an antiviral state in uninfected cells. They also promote innate and adaptive immune responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Activation of type I and III IFN gene transcription is dependent on the activation of specific transcription factors, NF-&#x003ba;B and IRF-3. Besides these two, the transcription factor IRF-7 is required for the transcriptional activation of IFN&#x003b1; and possibly also IFN-&#x003bb;2 and -3 genes. IRF-7 is constitutively expressed by some immune cells, but rarely by parenchymal cells. IRF-7 is often induced following exposure to JAK/STAT-activating cytokines, such as the IFNs themselves, thus establishing a positive feedback loop for IFN expression. IRF-1 is another IFN inducible transcription factor. It has binding sites in the type I and III IFN promoters and can also contribute to a positive feedback on IFN gene transcription. Recent studies have suggested that IRF-1 has a role in activating type III and not type I IFNs during infections with RNA viruses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p><p>The human IFIH1 gene contains numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The non-synonymous SNP (nsSNP), rs1990760 (A946T), is associated with an increased risk for development of several autoimmune diseases including T1D diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis (e.g.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Little is known on how this nsSNP regulates risk for development of these inflammatory diseases, and therefore information on the biological effects of this nsSNP may provide useful insights.</p><p>Previous studies using ectopic overexpression of MDA5 in cell lines have reached contrasting conclusions with regards to the impact of the rs1990760 nsSNP on the activities of MDA5. Some studies reported no influence on function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, while another study suggested that the risk allele T (946&#x02009;T) encodes a constitutively active MDA5 protein that is unable to respond to a natural ligand (encephalomyocarditis virus, EMCV<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). These contrasting results illustrate that additional studies are required to reveal if and how the rs1990760 affects the function of MDA5.</p><p>Recent studies have shown that the functional impact of disease-associated SNPs may vary depending on the cell type studied (e.g.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). This, together with the recent notion that the antiviral effector mechanisms of MDA5 may vary in response to different types of viruses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, suggest that studies using relevant human primary cells and pertinent natural ligands (i.e. clinically relevant viruses rather than viral mimics such as poly I:C) are needed to gain a better understanding of the function of the disease-associated variants of IFIH1.</p><p>Enterovirus infections, in particularly those with Coxsackievirus (CVBs), have been associated with the development of T1D in humans. The link between CVB infections and T1D is supported by case reports, epidemiological data and by observations indicating that enteroviruses are present in the remaining beta cells of individuals with T1D diabetes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. We have shown that human pancreatic islets express MDA5<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, and together with others demonstrated that MDA5 is important in the host immune response to CVBs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Human pancreatic islets are easily and reproducibly infected by CVBs <italic>in vitro</italic> (e.g.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). This makes the islets a relevant and useful model to study a primary cell response to a CVB infection and to assess whether the rs1990760 nsSNP affect this response. In the present study, we used human pancreatic islets (primary cells) and a virus of clinical relevance (Coxsackievirus) as natural ligand, to provide a better understanding of the functional consequences of this polymorphism. Our study reveals previously not described relationships between the rs1990760 polymorphism and the magnitude of the innate response to Coxsackievirus infection.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Whole transcriptome analysis identifies an IFN signature in CVB3 infected islets</title><p>Infections with CVBs are associated with human diseases, including aseptic meningitis, myocarditis and autoimmune T1D.

Here, pancreatic islets from a total of 23 human donors were infected with CVB3 for 48&#x02009;h. The islets were highly permissive to infection as shown by the measurements of high titers of infectious virus particles released into the tissue culture media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>) and concomitant expression of viral RNA in the infected islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><p>Genotyping for rs1990760 was performed on DNA isolated from each individual islet batch.

None of the donors carried the protective genotype CC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). In parallel, the islet cohort was genotyped for the rs3747517 SNP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).

Using a stringent statistical method (see Methods) this analysis identified a total of 166 mRNA transcripts that were significantly altered in infected compared to uninfected islets (FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Functional annotation of the differentially expressed coding genes (DEGs) using MetaCore<sup>TM</sup> (Thomson Reuters) suggested significant enrichment of biological pathways related to inflammation, innate immunity and response to viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). With the same software, we identified several transcription factors critical for robust antiviral responses (e.g. IRF-1, STAT-1 and -2), as well as both type I (IFN&#x003b2;) and III IFN (IFN&#x003bb;1&#x02013;3) genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). We also observed an increased expression of genes encoding negative regulators of IFN expression and signalling (e.g. USBP18, TRIM21, GBP4, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Because we noted an upregulated expression of type I and III IFNs, which are known to induce a wide range of genes (so-called ISGs), we used the Interferome v2.0 database<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> to identify how many of the DEGs were ISGs. This analysis revealed that the majority (80.7%) of the 166 DEGs were ISGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The magnitude of the human islet immune response to CVB3 infection is linked to the rs1990760 genotype</title><p>Most of the DEGs identified in the RNAseq analysis (97%) were shared between donors carrying the TT and TC genotypes, with only 4 DEGs unique to donors with the TC genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Hierarchical clustering based on the 134 genes identified as ISGs distinguished two major clusters, in which the majority (3/4) of donors carrying the TT genotype were placed in a cluster with low relative gene expression levels. The majority of islets carrying the TC genotype (3/4) were clustered together based on high relative gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h</xref>). Taken together, the transcriptome analysis demonstrated that CVB3 infection induces a robust immune response in human pancreatic islets. These studies also indicated that the strength of this response might be regulated by the rs1990760 genotype.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The rs1990760 TC genotype is associated with a high type III IFN response and a strong IFN signature</title><p>We next validated some of the results from the transcriptome analysis using conventional qPCR. By analysing cDNA from the whole islet cohort (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;23) we verified that type I (IFN&#x003b2;) and III IFNs (IFN&#x003bb;1 and IFN&#x003bb;) showed increased expression following CVB3 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a and b</xref>). Similarly, the expression levels of a number of the identified DEGs including PRRs (e.g. the IFIH1/MDA5 gene itself and DDX58/RIG-I), and genes encoding proteins involved in cellular antiviral defence (e.g. Mx1/MXA) or recruitment of lymphocytes and with relevance for T1D (CXCL10<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c,e,f</xref>) were elevated. Western blot or ELISA measurements revealed that the induced gene expression translated into increased protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>) and secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g</xref>).</p><p>We attempted to measure secreted type I and III IFNs, but our pilot studies using an ELISA and a sensitive bioassay failed to detect IFNs in the culture media of both control and CVB3 infected islets (data not shown). This is likely due to that enteroviruses, including CVB3, have developed mechanisms to impair type I and III IFN production and release<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, and that the secreted IFNs are locally consumed due to binding to receptors expressed by the cultured cells.</p><p>When stratifying our donors according to the rs1990760 genotype no statistically significant difference was detected in the expression of IFN&#x003b2; mRNA between the islets carrying the TT and TC genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). In contrast, islets from donors carrying the TC genotype expressed significantly higher levels of type III IFNs when compared to islets carrying the TT genotype (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Similarly, TC islets expressed higher levels of the studied genes (ISGs), and the difference was observed also when comparing the fold induction (i.e. &#x00394;&#x00394;Ct-values) (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 and p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c&#x02013;g</xref>). In line with the gene expression data, the secretion of the chemokine CXCL10 was also significantly higher in islets from donors with the TC genotype compared to those with the TT genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h</xref>). In contrast, the expression levels of the studied genes did not differ between the mock-infected islets of the TT and TC genotypes <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c&#x02013;g</xref>). The titers of virus accumulating in the media during the whole 48&#x02009;h culture period, as well as the expression of viral RNA at 48&#x02009;h p.i., were not statistically different between the donors, although the latter was close to reaching significance (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.09, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3i</xref>). Collectively, this shows that the human islets carrying the rs1990760 TC genotype have a higher type III IFN and ISG response to CVB3 than islets carrying the rs1990760 TT (risk) genotype.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>A high type III IFN response to CVB3 infection in TC donors is associated with a strong expression of IRF-1</title><p>IFN expression is regulated by the activities of transcription factors as well as negative regulators<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Our transcriptome analyses identified several transcription factors as being inducible by CVB3 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). A few of these showed significantly different expression levels between the TT and TC genotypes (BATF2 and STAT1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). In addition to this, the expression of IRF-1 was significantly increased only in infected islets with the TC genotype (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Four negative regulators of type 1 IFN signalling, IFI35, IFIT1, OASL, USP18<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, showed a different level of expression in the two genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). All four were expressed at a higher level in the TC genotype (high responders) as compared to the TT genotype (low responders). Thus, it is unlikely that these genes contributed to a higher expression of type III IFNs in islets from donors with the TC genotype per se, and these four genes were therefore not further studied.</p><p>The transcription factor IRF-1 has been shown to specifically regulate type III and not type I IFN expression during RNA virus infections<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Thus, we next analysed the expression of IRF-1 in the whole islet cohort by real-time PCR and confirmed that CVB3 infection induces the expression of IRF-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). We found no difference in the basal expression levels of IRF-1 when control islets from TT and TC donors were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). After CVB3 infection, islets with the TC genotype expressed higher levels of IRF-1 mRNA compared to islets with the TT genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Infected islets with the TC genotype also had a stronger increase in their IRF-1 mRNA expression relative to uninfected control islets (i.e. &#x0201c;fold induction&#x0201d;) as compared to islets with the TT genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>).</p><p>We next investigated whether there was a correlation between the levels of IRF-1 and type I and III IFN mRNA expression. When analysed for the entire human islet cohort the levels of expressed IRF-1 mRNA correlated with the expressed levels of IFN&#x003b2;, IFN&#x003bb;1 and IFN&#x003bb;2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). However, when analysing the TT and TC donors separately it was found that the levels of IRF-1 mRNA correlated with the levels of the type III IFNs (IFN&#x003bb;1 and IFN&#x003bb;2) only in TC and not TT donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c,d</xref>). This suggests that higher IRF-1 expression in the TC donors contributes to the stronger expression of type III IFNs via a feedback mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The expression of T1D-related genes does not differ between donors with the rs1990760 TT and TC genotypes</title><p>Risk for T1D development has been linked to polymorphisms in numerous genes besides IFIH1.

Here, we assessed whether the rs1990760 polymorphism affects the immune response to Coxsackievirus infection, and made a number of observations that oppose the early assumptions that this nsSNP would not have an impact on MDA5 function.</p><p>A well-characterized function of MDA5 is the sensing of viral RNA and thereafter activation of down-stream signalling events leading to the expression of type I and III IFNs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. MDA5 is expressed by human islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) and contributes to the host immune response to CVBs (e.g.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Here, we observed significantly higher expression levels of both IFN&#x003bb;1 and IFN&#x003bb;2 mRNA in CVB3 infected islets carrying the TC genotype compared to the TT genotype (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). This is a novel and previously undiscovered correlation between rs1990760 and the magnitude of type III IFN expression in response to a relevant human pathogen. Because we noted a difference in type III and not type I IFN expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>), these observations also indicate that the impact of the rs1990760 polymorphism may be cell type and/or tissue dependent, and highlight the importance of studying disease relevant cell types when assessing the impact of disease-associated SNPs (e.g.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>).</p><p>A previous study uncovered differences in the intracellular events leading to IFN&#x003b2; and IFN&#x003bb; production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>; while the transcription of both IFN families is induced through the activation of the RIG-I like PRRs (RIG-I and MDA5) via the adaptor protein MAVS, the organelle association of MAVS determines which types of IFNs are transcriptionally induced following microbial stimulation. MAVS associated with mitochondria has the ability to induce both type I and III IFNs, while MAVS associated with peroxisomes selectively induces type III IFN production following viral infection in an IRF-1 dependent fashion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Given that our study discovered a distinct rs1990760 genotype-specific IFN&#x003bb; expression we speculate that in infected human islet cells MDA5 might primarily act through peroxisomal MAVS to induce IFN&#x003bb; expression. IFN&#x003b2; mRNA expression showed no such correlation to the rs1990760 TT and TC genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>), suggesting that type I IFNs might be induced via other PRR(s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have shown that the transcription factor IRF-1 specifically regulates the expression of type III IFNs (and not type I IFNs) in response to infection with RNA viruses (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Here, we found that the expression of IRF-1 was significantly induced in CVB3 infected islets from donors with the TC genotype but not in islets from donors carrying the TT genotype (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). We also discovered a correlation between the gene expression levels of IRF-1 with those of IFN&#x003bb;1 or IFN&#x003bb;2 in islets with the TC genotype but not the TT genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). Based on this we hypothesize that varying levels of IRF-1 expression contribute to the differences in type III IFN expression observed between the two genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p>IRF-1 is an IFN-inducible gene and its expression is induced in human pancreatic islets by IFN-treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. It is therefore possible that IRF-1 contributes to type III IFN production in CVB3 infected islets via a positive feedback loop, and that the overall stronger type III IFN response in islets with the TC genotype is a result of a stronger positive feedback on type III IFN gene expression. The transcription factor BATF2 was recently shown to interact with IRF-1 and to positively influence the transcription of a subgroup of genes in IFN&#x003b3; stimulated macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Our transcriptome analysis suggested that CVB3 infected islets with the TC genotype express more BATF2 mRNA than islets with the TT genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Thus, it is possible that BATF2 interacts with IRF-1 and that this further augments type III IFN gene expression. Future studies are needed to assess the role for BATF2 in regulating IFN gene transcription.</p><p>Our transcriptome analyses and functional annotations showed that human islets respond to CVB3 infection by upregulating numerous ISGs (often referred to as the type I IFN signature, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). The expression pattern resembled that previously observed in human pancreatic islets stimulated with type I or type III IFNs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, further supporting a key role for IFNs in inducing gene transcription following CVB3 infection. We also discovered that islets carrying the TC genotype respond to CVB3 infection with a stronger ISG gene expression than islets carrying the TT genotype. This difference was not limited to gene expression, but was also evident on the protein level as demonstrated by differences in secreted CXCL10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h</xref>). A more substantial IFN signature in the islets from TC donors lend further weight to the hypothesis that donors carrying this genotype produce more IFNs following infection compared to TT donors. In addition to this, our results also suggest that in this setting, donors carrying the T1D risk genotype (TT) have a weaker response to CVB3 infection than donors carrying the protective TC genotype. In support for this conclusion, we recently observed that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from donors carrying the rs1990760 TC genotype respond with a higher ISG expression upon stimulation with CVB-antibody complexes as compared to PBMCs from TT carriers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>.</p><p>As suggested by virus titrations and PCR measurements, TT and TC genotypes do not differ dramatically in their ability to control Coxsackievirus replication in pancreatic islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3i</xref>). Still, there was a trend towards higher expression of CVB3 RNA in islets from donors carrying the TC genotype as compared to donors carrying the TT genotype (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.09). Interestingly, Cinek <italic>et al</italic>. measured the presence of enterovirus RNA in peripheral blood samples from healthy children genotyped for the rs1990760 polymorphism and reported a higher frequency of enterovirus RNA in individuals with the heterozygous genotype (TC, 14.4%) compared to individuals with the TT (9.5%) or CC (7%) genotypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Taken together, this and our study suggest that there may be subtle, yet important biological differences between the genotypes in terms of controlling enterovirus replication. This is in line with other investigations indicating a weak but possible link between the rs1990760 polymorphism in the clearance of both enterovirus 71<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> and hepatitis C virus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.</p><p>Based on the observations we made in this study, we propose that IRF-1 contributes to CVB3 induced type III IFN expression via a positive feedback loop. We also suggest that the more potent type III IFN response in islets with the TC genotype is a result of an overall stronger positive feedback on type III IFN gene expression, and that this leads to a more robust ISG response. The mechanism behind the stronger positive feedback in donors with the TC genotype remains speculative. We however suggest that subtle differences in virus replication, with slightly higher levels of virus replication in TC donors, results in a stronger activation of MDA5 in islets from donors with this genotype. Via positive feedback mechanisms, including the expression of genes coding for transcription factors important for the expression of type III IFNs, this somewhat greater response unfolds in a statistically significant stronger type III IFNs and ISG response in TC donors as compared to TT donors.</p><p>In summary, our study provides important insights into how the host immune response to a clinically relevant virus may differ depending on the rs1990760 (A946T) genotype. Our studies also put an emphasis on the fairly newly described group of type III IFNs. The link between the strength of their expression and the rs199760 polymorphism in IFIH1 warrants further investigations on the role of type III IFNs in infectious and autoimmune diseases.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Human pancreatic islets</title><p>Human pancreatic islets were isolated by the Nordic Network for Islet Transplantation in Uppsala, Sweden, as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>.

MDA5 binds dsRNA and activates mitochondrial and peroxisomal associated MAVS. This initiates a signalling cascade leading to the phosphorylation and dimerization of IRF-3 through TBK-IKK&#x003b5;, and the degradation of I&#x003ba;B from the NF-&#x003ba;B complex through TRAF6 and TAK1. The activated transcription factors IRF-3 and NF-&#x003ba;B translocate to the nucleus where they bind to the promoter regions of type I and type III IFNs and initiate their expression. In addition, peroxisome associated MAVS leads through unknown mechanisms to the activation of the transcription factor IRF-1, which binds solely to the promoter regions of type III IFNs and selectively initiate their expression. Expressed and secreted type I and type III IFNs bind in an auto- and paracrine manner to their receptors IFNAR and IFN&#x003bb;R, respectively. This in turn activates JAK-TYK2 kinases leading to the formation of the ISGF3 complex and the expression of a large number of ISGs. Infection of islets from donors carrying the rs1990760 TC genotype (MDA5, 946&#x02009;T/A) (lower model) results in stronger type III IFN gene expression compared to that induced in islets from TT donors, possibly through the peroxisome associated MAVS mediated activation of IRF-1. The stronger type III IFN expression is accompanied by a more robust ISG expression in TC donors compared to TT donors. This includes the expression of IRF-1, which may further amplify the type III IFN expression through a positive feedback mechanism. Why MDA5 activation in donors carrying the rs1990760 TC genotype leads to a stronger activation of peroxisome associated MAVS compared to mitochondrial associated MAVS is still to be discovered.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="srep39378-f6"/></fig></floats-group></article>
