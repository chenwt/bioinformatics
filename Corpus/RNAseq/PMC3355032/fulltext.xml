For example, sugarcanes carry even multiples of a haploid complement of x = 10 or x = 8 chromosomes, and exhibit polysomic inheritance that presumably arose via auto-polyploidy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] over the past several million years. This scenario is consistent with the similar monoploid DNA content of sugarcane (approximately 750 million base pairs (Mbp) for <italic>S. spontaneum, </italic>930 Mbp for <italic>S. officinarum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and 730 Mbp for <italic>Sorghum bicolor </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The ten chromosome pairs of diploid <italic>S. bicolor </italic>likely represents the ancestral Saccharinae condition. Polyploidy in <italic>Saccharum </italic>arose at least twice, and chromosome number in sugarcane is so flexible as to allow a range of natural and artificial auto- and allo-polyploids up to dodecaploid.</p><p>In contrast, the genus <italic>Miscanthus </italic>has a base chromosome number of x = 19, with nominally diploid (2 N = 2x = 38) and tetraploid (2 N = 4x = 76) species, plus the highly productive triploid interspecific hybrid, <italic>Miscanthus x giganteus</italic>. Among a number of possibilities for the distinctive chromosome number, the most likely is the whole genome duplication (tetraploidization) of an ancestor possessing N = 10 pairs of chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], although this has not been demonstrated. Direct comparisons of the DNA content of <italic>Miscanthus </italic>to sorghum and sugarcane is not obviously informative, as the N = 19 monoploid DNA content of <italic>Miscanthus </italic>spans 2150-2650 Mbp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], more than three times longer than the monoploid content of eusorghum (745-818 Mbp) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The possible origin of the nearly doubled chromosome number and tripled haploid size via polyploidy is further obscured by the high repetitive content of the <italic>Miscanthus </italic>genome, recently shown by sample sequencing to be ~95% in <italic>M</italic>. x <italic>giganteus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Chromosome numbers can be unreliable indicators of even relatively recent polyploidy. For example, 2 N = 20 maize is a paleopolyploid comprising two sub-genomes that diverged ~12 Mya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Comparative mapping and sequence analysis reveals that the progenitors of these sub-genomes also had 2 N = 20, a fact obscured karyotypically by subsequent chromosome fusions in the maize lineage. Conversely, while diploid <italic>Sorghum bicolor </italic>has 10 pairs of chromosomes, other diploid <italic>Sorghum </italic>species with comparable DNA content have only five pairs, presumably a consequence of chromosomal fusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Similarly, diploid <italic>Brachypodium distachyon </italic>has 2 N = 10 chromosomes, but other <italic>Brachypodium </italic>species with comparable DNA content have 2 N = 20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In any event, even in a whole-genome duplication scenario, the odd base chromosome number of <italic>Miscanthus </italic>would require additional chromosome-scale events such as loss or fusion. The description of <italic>M. sinensis </italic>as "diploid" with 2N = 38 chromosomes is based on chromosome counting, and the observations that chromosome pairing during meiosis regularly produces bivalents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Despite <italic>Miscanthus</italic>' unusual chromosome and DNA complement relative to other Saccharinae, relatively few genetic resources have been developed for elucidating the relationship of the <italic>Miscanthus </italic>genome to those of its close relatives. This is in part due to the fact that the most widely grown <italic>Miscanthus </italic>biomass crop is the vegetatively propagated triploid <italic>M</italic>. x <italic>giganteus </italic>(3x = 57), which produces no viable seed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and therefore no segregating progeny. <italic>M</italic>. x <italic>giganteus </italic>is among the most productive known grasses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and evidence to date indicates it derives from a cross between a diploid <italic>M. sinensis </italic>father and a tetraploid <italic>M.sacchariflorus </italic>mother [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Another complicating factor is self-incompatibility, which makes the production of homozygous genotypes difficult and forces the independent mapping of meiotic products from each parent in F1 progeny.</p><p><italic>M. sinensis</italic>, the likely diploid parent of <italic>M</italic>. x <italic>giganteus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], is widely grown as an ornamental grass with rich genetic diversity, and is itself highly productive. Although a preliminary genetic linkage map for <italic>M. sinensis </italic>using RAPD markers and an "offspring cross" mapping strategy has been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], this map resolves 28 linkage groups (LGs), many more than the expected 19 LGs. The marker density of the map is not sufficient for fine-scale mapping and the reproducibility of RAPD markers is difficult. These problems can be mitigated by utilization of simple sequence repeat (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, which are plentiful in the <italic>Miscanthus </italic>genome and are also reproducible across laboratories. Additionally, SSR markers can be used for the search of homoeologous chromosomes in the mapping of polyploid plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Here we report the discovery of genetic variation in <italic>Miscanthus sinensis </italic>using SNP markers discovered by both deep transcriptome sequencing and amplification of SSRs that were previously shown to be variable in sugarcane. Analysis of the segregation of these variants in a reciprocal F1 cross, as well as genotyping two doubled haploids and their diploid parents, reveals both allelic (segregating) and widespread paralogous (fixed) sequence differences. We obtained a dense map of all 19 linkage groups in <italic>M. sinensis </italic>with 846 segregating markers. Comparison with the <italic>Sorghum bicolor </italic>genome reveals a whole-genome duplication in <italic>Miscanthus</italic>, with a single chromosome fusion accounting for the odd base chromosome number of the genus. The two sub-genomes of <italic>Miscanthus </italic>are quite similar, resulting in variant frequencies among paralogs that are only modestly higher than those observed between alleles. Despite this recent duplication, whether by allo- or auto-tetraploidy, our map is consistent with disomic inheritance in <italic>Miscanthus</italic>, in contrast to the polysomic inheritance found in the closely related polyploid sugarcane. Our genetic map of <italic>Miscanthus </italic>provides a valuable resource that can be used to apply both functional genomics to this perennial C4 grass, and marker-assisted breeding to biomass crop improvement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Grosse Fontaine x Undine reciprocal mapping population</title><p>A full sib (F1) population was produced by reciprocally crossing two ornamental <italic>M. sinensis </italic>accessions, 'Grosse Fontaine' (GF) and 'Undine' (UN) propagated in the greenhouse (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), from rhizomes of single plants established at the SoyFACE plot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>; plant locations SF20 and SF5 respectively) located at the Crop Sciences Research and Education center, on the University of Illinois campus.

Genotypes were called using Genome Studio (Illumina), which characterizes each genotype according to the signal intensities measured for the alternate nucleotides that define a SNV. Here and below we denote these alternate nucleotides "A" and "B."</p><p>For each SNV, Genome Studio clusters signal intensities to define homozygous and heterozygous genotype calls. For a segregating (diploid) SNP, one or two homozygous clusters and one heterozygous cluster are expected, depending on whether or not the SNP is variable in both parents (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref> show clusters observed in biallelic SNPs). In contrast, a SNV that represents a fixed single nucleotide difference between paralogs (<italic>i.e</italic>., a non-segregating variant at two unlinked loci) is revealed when both parents, and the entire F1 population, form a single "heterozygous" cluster (data not shown). SNVs that are fixed at one locus but segregating at another form two or three clusters as for a conventional diploid SNP, but with skewed signal intensities (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>).

Across both accessions, we generated over 21 Gbp in predominantly paired 80 bp Illumina GA II reads (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>: Table S2, NCBI Short Read Archive accession number SRA051293). From these RNAseq data we assembled a unified set of 29,933 contigs longer than 100 bp (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). The median contig length was 522 bp, with half of the total contig length accounted for by 6,433 contigs longer than 1,071 bp (the contig N50). We identified SNVs by realigning the RNAseq reads against the assembled transcriptome contigs and requiring strong support for two alternate variants embedded in otherwise nearly identical flanking sequence, to enable straightforward high-throughput genotyping. Other variation observable in the dataset was not considered further.</p><p>Since our aim was to define variants that could be genotyped by a GoldenGate assay with genomic rather that transcriptomic samples, we excluded from consideration probe sequences that spanned a putative exon-exon boundary. To do this in the absence of a <italic>Miscanthus </italic>genomic reference, we took advantage of the extensive conservation of exon-exon boundaries in grasses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] to identify and reject likely exon-junction-spanning probe sequences by comparison with the genomes of sorghum, maize, and rice. To facilitate syntenic comparisons between <italic>Miscanthus </italic>and related species, we also chose for genotyping those SNVs that (1) could be readily assigned to homologs in sorghum by sequence similarity and (2) had homologs that were distributed across all sorghum chromosomes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>: Figure S1).</p></sec><sec><title>Results of GoldenGate genotyping</title><p>Out of 1,536 putative markers on the <italic>Miscanthus </italic>GoldenGate array (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Table S3), 1,243 showed one or more clusters in GoldenGate signal space (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), indicating consistent genotyping across individuals. The remaining 293 putative markers showed dispersed or very low signal in Genome Studio and were considered failed assays, and not investigated further. Of the 1,243 successful oligonucleotide assays, we found that 93 assays showed signal for only one probe, and appear to be homozygous across both parents and their progeny or represent cases where the second oligo probe failed. After excluding these failed or invariant assays, we were left with 1,150 markers, of which 658 formed 2 or 3 clusters in signal space. The remaining markers appear as either a single centrally located cluster, more than three clusters, or dispersed signal, and were not considered further.</p></sec><sec><title>Intepretation of GoldenGate SNP genotypes</title><p>By considering the patterns of genotypes across our F1 mapping population, we found that many of the SNV's discovered by RNAseq analysis are indeed segregating biallelic markers (<italic>i.e</italic>., single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs). Others, however, represent fixed differences between closely related paralogous loci. Furthermore, many segregating biallelic markers have their GoldenGate signal affected by a closely related paralog that has the same sequence as the marker allele. Signal from such paralogous alleles causes the cluster positions in Genome Studio to be skewed in a characteristic manner that is readily recognized. A plot of normalized theta (ratio of signal intensities assayed for A and B SNP alleles) against normalized R (signal intensity) per marker for each individual can be used to visualize genotypes in a segregating population (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A-2F</xref>). The values of normalized theta are close to 0 in samples where the genotype is AA, close to 0.5 if it is AB and close to 1 if it is BB.</p><p>In situations where more than one locus is being sampled, and where the sequence of a second (paralogous) locus matches one of the two allelic states of the SNV in the segregating locus, the clusters are skewed towards the allele sharing the common nucleotide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, locus 1 is heterozygous for A and B SNVs in both parents and hence produces AA, AB, or BB progeny, whereas the second paralogous locus is fixed for the B SNV in both parents and progeny. This results in all three clusters being skewed to the right due to the higher dosage of SNV B. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref> shows a scenario where the GF parent is AB and the Undine parent BB at locus 1, whereas the second locus is fixed for SNV A in both parents and progeny, which shifts clusters to the left due to higher dosage of SNV A. A similar situation is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref> where UN rather than GF is segregating at locus 1. For mapping of segregating loci, panels A and B indicate markers that are heterozygous in both GF and UN parents, panels C and D show markers heterozygous in only the GF parent, and panels E and F markers heterozygous in only the Undine parent. Markers shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref> share the feature where the genotype of the two different sampled doubled haploid lines carry either the A or B SNV, but no progeny share the B/B genotype because their parents have either an A/A (GF) or A/B (UN) genotype.</p><p>Notably, 26% of the two-cluster SNV's showed skewed signal intensities in the GoldenGate assay, indicating that the two alternative sequences are not present in equal dosages. This observation is consistent with the sequence variants being detected from more than one locus, and suggests that many of the variant sequence pairs A and B appear as heterozygous alleles at one locus (A/B) but are fixed at a second locus (<italic>i.e.</italic>, A/A or B/B), resulting in a ~3:1 ratio of signal intensities on the GoldenGate assay. If both parents show allelic variation at one locus but are fixed for the same allele at a second paralogous locus, then segregating progeny may show 2:2, 3:1, and 4:0 dosages, consistent with observations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>. EBI 832, EBI 693 and EBI 635).</p><p>A second class of SNV (33%) formed only a single cluster of genotypes (data not shown). For these SNVs, both parents and all progeny had the same genotype. This is consistent with the pattern expected from fixed differences between paralogous loci (e.g., A/A at one locus and B/B at another) that do not segregate in progeny. These SNV's are not useful as genetic markers, since both parents and all progeny fall into a single "heterozygous" cluster and there is no genetic segregation of alleles. The proportion of both single cluster and skewed two-cluster SNVs (59%) should not be used as a direct estimate of the degree of paralogy due to the potential biases introduced by our SNV discovery and selection. These paralogous loci, however, do suggest extensive paralogy in the <italic>Miscanthus </italic>genome, which is corroborated by the genetic map as shown below.</p><p>Only a small minority (5 out of 1536) of the SNVs that we identified by RNAseq analysis formed more than three clusters in signal space, and could not be simply interpreted either as segregating alleles or fixed paralogous variants. The rarity of such SNV's in this analysis suggests that a similar RNAseq-based protocol could be useful in SNP discovery from other <italic>Miscanthus </italic>populations and species lacking genomic reference sequences.</p><p>For 658 out of 1,150 genotyped <italic>Miscanthus </italic>SNVs, the GoldenGate intensities in our F1 mapping population could be grouped into two (467) or three (191) clusters of genotypes in signal space, indicating variants that are found in both homozygous and heterozygous states in the population. We interpreted the two-cluster class of SNV's as segregating SNPs that are heterozygous in one parent and homozygous in the other, with progeny of both types. Similarly, the three-cluster classes of SNVs are interpreted as SNPs that are heterozygous in both parents, allowing for homozygous offspring of two types as well as heterozygotes. The interpretation of these SNV as segregating SNPs in our cross is supported by the integration of these markers into a consistent linkage map with limited segregation distortion (below).</p></sec><sec><title>Corroboration of allelic and fixed differences using doubled haploid lines</title><p>To test our hypothesis that many SNV's represent fixed differences between paralogous loci, we also genotyped two <italic>M. sinensis </italic>double haploid lines and their parents. Since the doubled haploids were developed by another culture from outbred diploid parents (Glowacka, unpublished observations), we had two expectations.</p><p>First, for the SNV's that are inferred to be biallelic SNPs in our F1 cross, we expect that some of them will correspond to heterozygous loci in other <italic>M. sinensis </italic>accessions, including the outbred parents of the doubled haploid lines. If these SNV's are <italic>bona fide </italic>allelic variants, however, then the doubled haploids should be homozygous for all such variants. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref> shows the segregation of alleles in the GoldenGate assay. In situations where two or three clusters are observed in the GoldenGate, consistent with a biallelic SNP, the double haploids are either A/A or B/B homozygotes while the mapping population has all three allelic states, as expected.</p><p>Second, for SNV's that are inferred to be fixed differences between paralogs, both variant states should be observed in the doubled haploids as well as their parents. This is observed as a single AB cluster on the GoldenGate array (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Genotyping summary</title><p>Taken together, our analyses of the F1 mapping population and the two doubled haploid lines show that we can distinguish segregating allelic variants at a single locus from fixed differences between paralogs, even in the face of extensive gene duplication. These data suggest that many <italic>Miscanthus </italic>genes have a closely related paralog that cannot be easily differentiated in the short read transcript data, but which assort independently. Using segregation patterns from a high density of genetic markers a linkage map can be constructed.</p></sec><sec><title>SSR primers from sugarcane identify allelic and paralogous polymorphism in <italic>Miscanthus</italic></title><p>Since Saccharum (sugarcane) is a close relative of <italic>Miscanthus</italic>, we reasoned that primer pairs that amplify simple sequence repeats in <italic>Saccharum </italic>would also be likely to amplify polymorphic SSRs in <italic>Miscanthus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Sixty-eight percent of the 2,640 SSRs primer pairs mined from sugarcane ESTs produced amplicons when tested with <italic>Miscanthus</italic>.

Of these, 188 EST- and 237 genome-derived primers generated polymorphic amplicons between the two parental genotypes. Primers that produced non-specific amplicons were excluded. We genotyped the F1 mapping population using 107 primers pairs (29 and 78 primers from EST and intergenic sequences, respectively) out of 425 polymorphic primers. One hundred and seven primers produced 20 marker configurations (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Table S4, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>: Figure S2). Among them, 69 primers follow disomic marker configurations but 38 primers (35.5%) do not fit disomic configurations, producing more than 3 amplicons in one or both parents (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Table S4). One hundred and seven primers produced a total of 301 amplicons and among them, 210 were polymorphic between two parental genotypes and segregated in progeny populations. One hundred ninety three amplicons out of 210 were actually mapped (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>: Table S5).</p></sec><sec><title>An integrated linkage map for <italic>M. sinensis</italic></title><p>Using the 868 segregating markers defined above, we constructed an integrated linkage map for <italic>M. sinensis </italic>using JoinMap 4.1. We took advantage of a newly implemented multipoint maximum likelihood model for constructing a map from an F<sub>1 </sub>cross of two outbred parents, using the Haldane mapping function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In contrast to a pseudo-testcross approach, which utilizes markers that are heterozygous in one parent but homozygous in the other, the new method can also incorporate markers that are heterozygous in both parents. While pseudo-testcross based analysis results in separate maps for each parent, the combined approach allows direct integration into a single map of crossovers that occur in either or both parents by using the markers that are heterozygous in both parents as anchors.</p><p>Only 48 out of 868 markers show segregation distortion (p &#x0003c; = 0.005 using the chi-squared goodness of fit test). Of these, 35 were highly distorted markers, and not included in the initial framework map. These highly distorted markers include 21 with a segregation ratio greater than 2:1 when they should have been 1:1, and 14 with a segregation ratio greater than 10:1 when they should have been 3:1 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Of the remaining 833 segregating markers (641 SNPs and 192 SSRs), 829 were incorporated into 19 major linkage groups using a minimum logarithm of odds (LOD) score of 11 and maximum recombination frequency of 0.4. The JoinMap 4.1 maximum likelihood method was used to calculate the map order of the framework map. Four SNP markers that were placed more than 40 cM away from the nearest marker on the linkage group were excluded and marker order for those linkage groups was recalculated. An attempt was then made to replace the 35 highly distorted markers on the ML map, keeping the marker order of the framework map constant and using the same map calculation parameters as before. Seventeen of the 35 highly distorted markers were incorporated. This map with 846 markers is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Integrated genetic map for <italic>M. sinensis</italic></bold>.

The total length of the 19 linkage groups on the ML map is 1782 cM, with an average intermarker spacing of 2.7 cM (excluding markers with identical map positions). Thus we expect that the missing map length from the telomeric ends of the linkage groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] accounts for roughly 2 &#x000d7; 19 &#x000d7; 2.7 cM = 102 cM, for a total estimated map length of 1884 cM. In the Grosse Fontaine map, 94% of the markers lie within 10 cM of each other, while in the Undine map only 90% meet this criterion. In the integrated map, 97% of the mapped markers lie within 10 cM of another marker, attesting to the dense coverage of the map.</p></sec><sec><title>Disomic inheritance and limited segregation distortion</title><p>Transmission of each linkage group is consistent with pure disomic inheritance in <italic>M. sinensi</italic>s (<italic>i.e</italic>., complete preferential pairing of homologs), with no evidence for tetrasomic inheritance (<italic>i.e.</italic>, pairing and recombination between homoeologs). Furthermore, very few markers show segregation distortion (48 out of 868; p &#x0003c; = 0.005 using the chi-squared goodness of fit test), and those that do are concentrated on Ms2, Ms3, Ms4, Ms12, and Ms13. Overall there is more segregation distortion in Undine. Twenty of the 24 distorted UN markers lie on Ms4 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S12">12</xref>: Table S6). Potential causes of segregation distortion include the following three possibilities: (1) Failure to complement deleterious recessive alleles heterozygous in both GF and UN parents that reduce viability of F1 progeny; (2) Interactions between genomes, e.g., meiotic drive in F1 gametophytes, gametophytic competition or pollen-pistil interactions like self-incompatibility; (3) Proximity to areas of suppressed recombination like centromeres and nucleolus organizer regions. The design of our cross makes it difficult to differentiate among these possible explanations.</p></sec><sec><title>Whole genome duplication with extensive conserved synteny to sorghum</title><p>Since our <italic>Miscanthus </italic>markers were derived from (1) transcribed regions with reduced sequence variation (SNPs) and (2) sequences from conserved ESTs and intergenic regions (SSRs), many of them could be unambiguously assigned to orthologous (<italic>i.e.</italic>, evolutionarily homologous) positions on the <italic>Sorghum bicolor </italic>genome sequence by straightforward sequence alignment. Out of 653 SNP loci on the integrated <italic>Miscanthus </italic>map, 618 could be placed on the sorghum genome. Similarly, out of 193 SSRs on the map, 126 could be placed on the sorghum genome.</p><p>A simple dot plot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) strikingly reveals complete whole-genome duplication in <italic>M. sinensis </italic>relative to sorghum, with most chromosomes showing near perfect colinearity at the scale of our genetic map. After recognizing this extensive synteny, we oriented and renumbered the <italic>Miscanthus </italic>linkage groups to emphasize this correspondence between <italic>Miscanthus </italic>and sorghum. Every sorghum chromosome exhibits nearly complete marker synteny with a pair of <italic>Miscanthus </italic>linkage groups. Eight sorghum chromosomes are completely duplicated, showing a 1:2 correspondence to <italic>Miscanthus </italic>linkage groups. We infer the whole genome nature of the duplication by the density of colinear markers in sorghum euchromatin, where our gene-biased markers are found. The only evident rearrangement in these chromosomes is a small inversion near the top of Sb4 relative to Ms8 and Ms9. Since Ms8 and Ms9 share the same ordering in this region, this inversion either occurred in the sorghum lineage, or in the stem lineage of <italic>Miscanthus </italic>prior to the tetraploidization event, or is an error in the sorghum genetic map or sequence assembly.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Tetraploidy of <italic>Miscanthus </italic>relative to sorghum, with extensive colinearity and a single chromosome fusion</bold>. <bold>Panel A</bold>.

Duplication and colinearity of nearly all chromosomes is evident (markers in magenta). A copy of sorghum chromosome 7 (markers in sky blue) has been inserted into a copy of sorghum chromosome 4 (markers in green) to produce <italic>Miscanthus </italic>linkage group 7.

Ms8 is an intact copy of Sb4, and Ms13 is an intact copy of Sb7. The second copies of these two sorghum chromosomes, however, are fused into the single linkage group Ms7. Ms7 then appears as a copy of Sb7 inserted into the centromeric region of Sb4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). This single fusion explains the odd base chromosome number of <italic>Miscanthus</italic>. By following the relative orientations of sorghum chromosome arms in <italic>Miscanthus</italic>, we see that this fusion has the characteristic form of a type of insertion previously observed in other grasses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Since all <italic>Miscanthus </italic>species have the same base chromosome number, this fusion presumably occurred in the lineage leading to the last common <italic>Miscanthus </italic>ancestor.</p></sec><sec><title>Mapping C4-PPDK loci in <italic>Miscanthus</italic></title><p>C4 photosynthesis in the Panicoideae (including maize, Saccharinae, millet, switchgrass, <italic>Miscanthus</italic>) is facilitated by a C4-specific form of the pyruvate, phosphate dikinase enzyme (C4-PPDK).

The closely related <italic>Sorghum bicolor </italic>has a single C4-PPDK gene located on chromosome 9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Sequencing of cloned cDNAs from triploid <italic>Miscanthus </italic>x <italic>giganteus </italic>identified five distinct transcripts, including one apparent pseudogene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], which suggests even greater genetic complexity than three homoeologous C4-PPDK alleles. Based on our observation of whole genome duplication, we reasoned that <italic>M. sinensis </italic>might have an unlinked pair of paralogous C4-PPDK genes. Based on synteny considerations, we expected that these C4-PPDK's would lie on <italic>Miscanthus </italic>LG's, 16 and 17, both of which are syntenic to Sorghum 9.</p><p>To look for C4-PPDK paralogs in <italic>M. sinensis</italic>, and to identify the genetic map position or positions of these gene(s), we designed primers to amplify the third intron of the gene based on the single previously known <italic>Miscanthus </italic>C4-PPDK. Two amplicons were observed in both parents, and both were cloned and sequenced. Cladistic methods identified two distinct paralogs of C4-PPDK (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>), which we named C4-PPDK1 and C4-PPDK2.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Mapping PPDK</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Phylogenetic tree of representative C4-PPDK sequences showing the clear separation of the two paralogous sequences. <bold>(B) </bold>Placement of the C4-PPDK markers, EBI 847 and EBI 848 (pink) on the linkage map. <bold>(C) </bold>Synteny of corresponding linkage groups (Ms16 and Ms17) to Sorghum chromosome 9.

The divergences between Ms C4-PPDK1 and sorghum and sugarcane C4-PPDK are comparable, suggesting that the origin of <italic>Miscanthus </italic>could be contemporaneous with the split between sorghum and sugarcane. Ms C4-PPDK2 branches outside of the Ms C4-PPDK1/sorghum/sugarcane clade, which could indicate that the other parent involved in <italic>Miscanthus </italic>tetraploidy was more divergent. These inferences, however, are weak due to the limited sequence length used in the analysis.</p><p>To map the two evident paralogs of C4-PPDK, we designed markers for each gene based on observed intronic sequence variation. Marker EBI 847 is a Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequence (CAPS) marker designed to detect the SNV at position 397 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>: Figure S6A, and marker EBI 848 is a sequence length polymorphism (SLP) marker that detects two indels between 1354 bp and 1388 bp (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>: Figure S6B). Both markers show a 1:1 segregation ratio (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S13">13</xref>: Table S7). EBI 847 maps to <italic>Miscanthus </italic>linkage group Ms16 at 36.8 cM on the integrated map (41.2 cM on the GF maximum likelihood map) while EBI 848 is placed on linkage group Ms17 at 19.2 cM on the integrated map (20.1 cM on the UN maximum likelihood map). <italic>Miscanthus </italic>linkage groups 16 (C4-PPDK1) and 17 (C4-PPDK2) are the homoeologs of <italic>S. bicolor </italic>chromosome 9, which contain sorghum C4-PPDK (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). This demonstrates both the utility of our genetic map and sorghum synteny for mapping genes in <italic>Miscanthus</italic>. This is the first documentation of the presence of two paralogous (indeed, homoeologous) C4-PPDKs in <italic>Miscanthus</italic>. The presence of two paralogs provides an opportunity for regulatory divergence and could contribute to the ability of <italic>Miscanthus </italic>to perform cold tolerate photosynthesis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>All grasses are paleopolyploid by virtue of an ancient whole genome duplication that occurred ~70 million years ago (mya) in a common ancestor of extant Poaceae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Many lineages within the grasses have also experienced more recent polyploidization events superimposed on this early event. Here we have shown that <italic>Miscanthus sinensis </italic>is a recent polyploid. Through comparative analysis of our <italic>M. sinensis </italic>genetic map with the <italic>Sorghum bicolor </italic>genome, we account for the base chromosome number x = 19 of the genus <italic>Miscanthus </italic>by a doubling of the ancestral Sacccharinae number x = 10, and a subsequent chromosome fusion. Some taxonomists have included in the <italic>Miscanthus </italic>genus several African accessions that have a base chromosome number of x = 15 (Amalraj and Balasundaram 2006; Hodkinson et al. 1997; 2002) and Himalayan accessions where 2N = 40 (Amalraj and Balasundaram 2006). These may represent ancestral configurations (e.g., 2N = 40), additional karyotypic changes (x = 15), or misclassifications.</p><p>Since most common <italic>Miscanthus </italic>species (<italic>M. sinensis, M. sacchariflorus, M. lutarioriparia, M. floridulus</italic>) share the base chromosome number 19, both the genome duplication event and the chromosome fusion likely occurred within the last several million years, at or near the base of the <italic>Saccharinae</italic>. Although we cannot rule out recurrent polyploidizations in the lineages of multiple <italic>Miscanthus </italic>species, a single origin is most parsimonious. Our <italic>M. sinensis </italic>map is consistent with disomic inheritance, without pairing of homoeologous chromosomes despite their limited sequence divergence. The situation in Miscanthus is similar to that found in hexaploid wheat, where closely related species hybridized in allopolyploid fashion, retaining their original chromosomal pairing patterns in a larger genome. Tetraploidization provides the opportunity for a lineage to explore the regulatory and functional diversification of duplicated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>Remarkably, when measured in map units, the <italic>M. sinensis </italic>and <italic>S. bicolor </italic>genetic maps are linearly related, indicating that the inserted repetitive sequence in the <italic>Miscanthus </italic>genome is not recombinogenic (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S14">14</xref>: Figure S5). The total length of the 19 linkage groups of our <italic>M. sinensis </italic>map (~1890 cM) is comparable to the map length of the 10 linkage groups in the <italic>S. bicolor </italic>genome (~1605 cM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]). Naively, the doubling of chromosome number would be expected to substantially increase the total map length, based on the rule of thumb that each chromosome arm experiences approximately one crossover per meiosis. This suggests that the <italic>Miscanthus </italic>duplication is recent enough that whatever cellular mechanism is responsible for regulating crossover frequency has not had time to adjust to the new karyotype.</p><p>It is tempting to speculate that the ensuing chromosome fusion was a critical evolutionary event that established the genus through reproductive isolation of the nascent <italic>Miscanthus </italic>population. Subsequent radiation could then have produced numerous <italic>Miscanthus </italic>species, some of which (e.g., tetraploid <italic>M. sacchariflorus</italic>) underwent additional polyploidization. The nature of these later events is unknown. The ancestral chromosome fusion itself can be understood as arising from the insertion of one chromosome into the centromeric region of another (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Insertional fusions have been inferred in other grasses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], and an insertion with the same orientational properties that we observed has been described for <italic>Aegilops tauschii </italic>chromosome 4D.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Mechanism for insertional dysploid reduction of ancestral chromosomes </bold>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].

Note that the original telomeres of 7 lie within the fused chromosome, and are presumably lost. Only one of the two centromeres (shown as mix of orange and blue) survives. An analogous event is proposed to have produced chromosome 4 of <italic>Aegilops tauschii </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-13-142-6"/></fig><p>The recent and extensive nature of the <italic>Miscanthus </italic>genome duplication, coupled with our use of RNA-seq to discover single nucleotide variant markers, required a careful analysis of segregation patterns in our F1 mapping population to extract <italic>bona fide </italic>allelic polymorphisms from a background of comparable sequence variation that arises from fixed differences between paralogous (and nominally homoeologous) loci. Given the large genome size of <italic>Miscanthus</italic>, deep RNA-seq was an efficient and cost-effective way to identify many single nucleotide variants. Our integration of the resulting single nucleotide polymorphism markers with simple sequence repeat markers confirms the validity of this approach. We took advantage of a new maximum likelihood method for full sib mapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] that allows the integration of parental maps. These methods may be useful for rapidly developing markers and maps for other species with complex ploidy.</p><p>Since our <italic>M. sinensis </italic>genetic map has good coverage of all 19 linkage groups, and shows limited segregation distortion that is clustered in three regions, we anticipate that it will be useful for further exploration of the <italic>Miscanthus </italic>genome. As a first step in this direction, we used our genetic map and the knowledge that <italic>Miscanthus </italic>is recently duplicated relative to sorghum to discover and map two homoeologous copies of the C4 pyruvate, phosphate dikinase enzyme (C4-PPDK), which appears at the expected syntenic position relative to sorghum C4-PPDK. Whether or not the two C4-PPDK genes have distinct roles is unknown. The ability to separate homoelogous loci suggests that our map could be valuable for both identifying quantitative trait loci in <italic>Miscanthus</italic>, and for marker-assisted breeding improvement of this emerging bioenergy crop.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>LG: Linkage group.
