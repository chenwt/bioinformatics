Recent studies have identified small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) as important factors for regulating gene expression and pathogenicity of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>. Increased speed and reduced costs of high throughput sequencing (HTS) techniques have made RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) the state-of-the-art method to study bacterial transcriptomes. We created a large transcriptome dataset of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> containing a total of 21 million reads, using the SOLiD sequencing technology. The dataset contained cDNA sequences generated from <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> RNA collected under intracellular and extracellular condition and additionally was size fractioned into three different size ranges from &#x0003c;40 nt, 40&#x02013;150 nt and &#x0003e;150 nt. We report here, the identification of nine new sRNAs candidates of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> and a reevaluation of known sRNAs of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> EGD-e. Automatic comparison to known sRNAs revealed a high recovery rate of 55%, which was increased to 90% by manual revision of the data. Moreover, thorough classification of known sRNAs shed further light on their possible biological functions. Interestingly among the newly identified sRNA candidates are antisense RNAs (asRNAs) associated to the housekeeping genes <italic>purA</italic>, <italic>fumC</italic> and <italic>pgi</italic> and potentially their regulation, emphasizing the significance of sRNAs for metabolic adaptation in <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF ERA-NET Pathogenomics Network to the sncRNAomics project (62080061) to T.H. as well as the German Centre for Infection Research, Justus-Liebig University Giessen.

The collected pellets were washed with SET buffer [50 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA and 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0)]. After centrifugation at 16000&#x000d7;g for 3 min pellets were resuspended in 0.1 ml Tris-HCl (pH 6.5) containing 50 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma), 25 U of mutanolysin (Sigma), 40 U of SUPERase (Ambion), 0.2 mg of proteinase K (Ambion) and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min at 350 rpm. QIAzol (Qiagen) was added, mixed gently and incubated for 3 min at room temperature. An additional incubation at room temperature was done after adding 0.2 volume chloroform followed by centrifugation at 16000&#x000d7;g at 4&#x000b0;C for 15 min. The aqueous phase, containing RNA, was transferred to a new collection tube and 1.5 volumes of 100% ethanol was added and mixed thoroughly. The probes containing RNA were transferred into columns supplied with the miRNeasy Kit (Qiagen) and treated according to the manual including an on-column DNase digestion (RNase-Free DNase, Qiagen). RNA was eluted by RNase-free water and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until needed. The quantity of the isolated total RNA was determined by absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm, and the quality was assessed using Nano-chips for Agilent's 2100 Bioanalyzer. For detection and estimation of the small RNA fraction within the isolated total RNA, a small RNA-chip (Agilent) was used, which visualizes RNAs with sizes ranging from 20 to 150 nucleotides.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>RNA sequencing</title><p>6 &#x000b5;g of total RNA of the intracellular and the extracellular sample was used as starting material. The quality was checked by Nanodrop and Agilent Pico RNA Chip.

After the rRNA depletion the samples were checked on the Pico RNA Chip from Agilent showing remaining rRNA in the sample. However, due to the small starting amount the rRNA depletion couldn't be repeated. Subsequently, the RNA was treated with Tobaco-Acid-Pyrophosphatase (TAP) from epicenter &#x000ae; for 1.5 h at 37&#x000b0;C and purified with the RiboMinus Concentration Module. Fragmentation of the RNA was done with RNaseIII (LifeTechnologies, RNA-Seq Kit) (37&#x000b0;C, 10 min) and again purified with the RiboMinus Concentration Module. The samples were dried with a Speed Vacuum Pump, resuspended in 3 &#x000b5;l of nuclease-free water and the SOLiD Adapters were ligated (65&#x000b0;C, 10 min; 16&#x000b0;C, 5 min).

Purification was done with the flashPAGE Clean up Kit (Ambion). The samples were dried with a Speed Vacuum Pump, resuspended in 3 &#x000b5;l of nuclease-free water and the SOLiD Adapters were ligated (65&#x000b0;C, 10 min; 16&#x000b0;C, 5 min). After ligation, small RNAs were reverse transcribed into cDNA with Array Script&#x02122; Reverse Transcriptase, (Life Technologies, RNA-Seq Kit) and purification was done with Qiagen's MinElute PCR Purification Kit, eluting in 20 &#x000b5;l. Afterwards, the small RNAs (cDNA) were size-selected on a 10% TBE Urea Gel (Novex-System, Invitrogen). Different size ranges were collected from the gel (60&#x02013;80 nt, 80&#x02013;120 nt, 120&#x02013;150 nt) and amplified with 16 PCR cycles using the same 5&#x02032;-Primer for each sample and four different 3&#x02032;-Primers including the barcode sequences (SOLiD Multiplexing Barcoding Kit 01-16). PCR purification was done with the Micro PCR Purification Kit (Invitrogen Corporation). A total of six purified and barcoded DNA libraries were analyzed on a HS-DNA Chip on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 and subsequently pooled in equimolar amounts.</p><p>Next generation sequencing. The pooled libraries were diluted to a concentration of 60 pg/&#x000b5;l. DNA was amplified monoclonally on magnetic beads in an emulsion PCR. Emulsions were broken with butanol and the remaining oil was washed off the double-stranded beads. DNA molecules on the bead surface were denatured to allow hybridization to polystyrene enrichment beads. Using a glycerol cushion null beads can be separated from the templated beads. In an additional denaturation step, the templated beads were separated from the enrichment beads. The 3&#x02032;-ends of the DNA molecules on the bead's surface were enzymatically modified for deposition on the sequencing slide. The beads were loaded onto a slide and sequenced on a SOLiD 3 Plus analyzer producing reads of 50 nt length.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Data processing</title><p>To identify and characterize new candidates as well as to compare known sRNAs to our transcriptome data set we implemented a novel computational pipeline.

In brief, the pipeline first maps reads onto a reference genome using a short read mapper. We compared different mapping programs for this purpose, including SHRiMP, Bfast and BWA, and performed a parameter evaluation to achieve an optimal mapping. Based on this evaluation we chose BWA as mapper with a maximum mismatch rate per read of 2. Our pipeline then utilizes annotation data as well as coverage information from different size fractions to filter the dataset and identify large RNA molecules expressed on the genome. The <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> genome annotation was obtained on 28/09/2011 from NCBI RefSeq: (<ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/Listeria_monocytogenes_EGD_e_uid61583/">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/Listeria_monocytogenes_EGD_e_uid61583/</ext-link>). Our pipeline considers reads of smaller fractions that were aligned to a region in which a larger fraction indicated a transcript as degradation products originating from the larger transcript. After masking of all known transcripts as well as degradation products, an expanding window algorithm identified putative novel sRNA candidates within the remaining transcriptome.</p><p>The pipeline also implements a number of downstream analysis tools. These include an automatic comparison tool to identify equivalent sRNAs between different size fractions, samples, or studies, enabling us to quickly compare other studies of the same organism or differential expression between experimental conditions. An automated classification system is also part of the pipeline to classify transcription start sites, asRNAs, and classical sRNAs. A last tool enables a more fine-grained statistical analysis of differential expression between two given datasets. It visualizes the data in an MA-plot and lets the user select custom thresholds depending on average expression, to fine-tune the significance of the differential expression.</p><p>The pipeline as well as the corresponding java program ncFinder are accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fileshare.csb.univie.ac.at/ncFinder_associated_files/pipeline.tgz">http://fileshare.csb.univie.ac.at/ncFinder_associated_files/pipeline.tgz</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fileshare.csb.univie.ac.at/ncFinder_associated_files/ncFinder.zip">http://fileshare.csb.univie.ac.at/ncFinder_associated_files/ncFinder.zip</ext-link> respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Differential expression analysis</title><p>We used NOIseq <xref rid="pone.0083979-GarciadelPortillo1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> to perform a differential expression analysis.

The pipeline makes use of fractionated RNA data, to improve on the distinction between degradation products of large RNA molecules and independent small non-coding RNAs. Since distinction between long UTRs and sRNAs located 5&#x02032; of genes or polycistronic transcription and intergenic sRNAs is often inaccurate based solely on annotational data and read-pileup-shapes, a manual analysis of the data is still advised where the complete context of gene expression in an area can be assessed.</p><p>The pipeline was designed for use with SOLiD specific color-coded sequencing data as an input, but is easily usable with other next generation sequencing technologies as well, making it universally applicable. While it is possible to analyze and identify sRNAs based on a single RNA-Seq experiment with this pipeline, particularly projects with a multitude of datasets with RNA of different size fractions will strongly benefit from the pipelines capabilities of integrating information from between different datasets. Furthermore downstream analysis tools integrated into the pipeline help in the fast interpretation of acquired data. They include a clustering algorithm to identify the same sRNAs in different samples or studies, an automated sRNA classification system based on size, position, and read pattern of a candidate, as well as differential expression analysis to compare data taken under different conditions. The pipeline can be easily modified to meet a wide range of requirement for the analysis of transcriptomic data.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>lasRNA</title><p>Long antisense RNAs are a type of non-coding RNAs that have been described previously <xref rid="pone.0083979-ToledoArana1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083979-Wurtzel1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. These lasRNAs are significantly longer than typical, short asRNAs and typically stretch over whole genes instead of just covering the UTR of a gene. Wurtzel and colleagues proposed some of these lasRNAs have a double function both as mRNA and asRNA and introduced a related structure called excludon <xref rid="pone.0083979-Wurtzel1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In this structure, two adjacent, yet oppositely arranged genes overlap with the other gene with their corresponding transcript and forms corresponding lasRNAs. This structure has the potential to create an expression regulation by mutual exclusion, where one gene cannot be expressed while the other is, as the transcript for one gene will also act as asRNA for the other.</p><p>We were able to identify four previously known asRNAs <xref rid="pone.0083979-ToledoArana1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083979-Wurtzel1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> showing similar properties: anti2046, anti2259, anti2678 and anti2717 were all found to be significantly longer than originally proposed. All four candidates have been originally described to cover part of a single gene, but in our data were found to cover four to six genes instead. See corresponding comments in supplementary table S1 and the read pileups in supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083979.s007">Fig. S2</xref>. Given the length of the lasRNAs, structures comparable to the excludons described by Wurtzel and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0083979-Wurtzel1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> are likely for these lasRNAs. The most likely reason for us to identify those sRNAs as significantly longer than before described, is the higher sequencing coverage in our experiments. It enables us to identify weekly but consistently transcribed areas better than before, leading to the discovery of previously unidentified long transcripts that were originally thought to be distinct or shorter.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Identification of nine new sRNA candidates</title><p>Automated identification of asRNA in the data and manual refinement of results revealed nine new sRNAs candidates in <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>. Most notably among these are four asRNAs opposite of the genes <italic>lmo2225</italic> (<italic>fumC</italic>), <italic>lmo2330</italic>, <italic>lmo0055</italic> (<italic>purA)</italic> and <italic>lmo2367</italic> (<italic>pgi</italic>).</p><p>The prophage A118 can be found in the <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> EGD-e genome inserted between the genes <italic>lmo2271</italic> and <italic>lmo2332</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0083979-Glaser1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. At the very end of this prophage region, covering the 3&#x02032; end of <italic>lmo2331</italic> and the 5&#x02032; end of <italic>lmo2330</italic> we identified another down-regulated asRNA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083979-g005">Fig. 5 (C)</xref>). <italic>lmo2331</italic> is predicted to encode a cell wall lipoprotein, while <italic>lmo2330</italic> is similar to the phage protein <italic>gp33</italic>. Antisense transcription of the prophage genes has previously been reported and this might be an additional case of such <xref rid="pone.0083979-Mraheil1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0083979-Wurtzel1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Apart from this general antisense transcription it might represent specific and active repression of phage gene expression, as phage control by means of antisense transcription is a long known phenomenon <xref rid="pone.0083979-Wagner1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. More recently Irnov and colleagues also reported the expression of asRNA in prophages of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and suggested a function in maintaining the phage host equilibrium <xref rid="pone.0083979-Irnov1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Antisense of the <italic>purA</italic> gene we were able to identify an asRNA at the 5&#x02032; end of the gene. The <italic>purA</italic> gene encodes a putative adenylosuccinate synthetase with assumed function in the de novo purine synthesis pathway, making it an essential enzyme in the synthesis pathway of purine nucleobases. Purine synthesis seemingly plays an important role for intracellular growth of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0083979-Schauer1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and a <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> serotype 4b strain with a mutation of <italic>purA</italic> is known to be strongly attenuated in the infection of mice <xref rid="pone.0083979-Faith1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. This makes a lifestyle dependent regulation of <italic>purA</italic> very likely, and asRNAs are known to play a major role in the adaption to rapid environmental changes in general <xref rid="pone.0083979-Mehta1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> as well as the transition of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> from saprophytic to virulent lifestyle in particular <xref rid="pone.0083979-Storz2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. However, no classical or obvious regulation pattern could be found when analyzing expression of both the <italic>purA</italic> gene and its corresponding asRNA within the RNA-Seq data which could be also observed by qRT-PCR (data not shown). We observed increased expression of asRNA anti0055 under intracellular versus extracellular growth condition using qRT-PCR analysis as well as northern blot analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083979-g005">Fig. 5 (A and B)</xref>). The biological relevance of this up-regulated asRNA has to be characterized in future.</p><p>We identified a new asRNA anti2225 opposite of the <italic>fumC</italic> gene, coding for a fumarate hydratase typically with central function in the TCA-cycle. Interestingly, an antisense transcript of the homologous gene has also been found in the Gram-negative <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> and experimentally verified by northern blot and RT-PCR <xref rid="pone.0083979-Xiao1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In addition, many asRNAs of housekeeping genes of <italic>Cyanobacterium synechocystis</italic> have been identified <xref rid="pone.0083979-Georg1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, demonstrating that such asRNAs are a common mechanism of transcriptional regulation. Furthermore <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> is already suspected to have an interrupted TCA-cycle <xref rid="pone.0083979-Eisenreich1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Also it shown that even an interrupted TCA-cycle may serve as an essential generator for purine for which we already propose a regulation by means of PurA <xref rid="pone.0083979-Huynen1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Furthermore Schauer and coworkers have shown the central role of purine biosynthesis for intracellular growth <xref rid="pone.0083979-Schauer1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Here we could show that expression of the <italic>fumC</italic> gene (data not shown) as wells as anti2225 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083979-g005">Fig. 5(C)</xref>) is up-regulated after transition to the intracellular lifestyle. Biological interpretation of these finding is challenging at this point and needs further experimental validation. Signs of classical asRNA regulation patterns can be found expressed opposite of the gene <italic>lmo2367/pgi</italic> for anti2367. Inspecting the sequencing data of the intracellular and extracellular growth condition, the expression of either the gene or the asRNA seems to be mutually exclusive, giving a hint for a causal link and a possible regulation mechanism interfering with the expression of <italic>pgi</italic> on the transcriptional level. This pattern is clearly visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083979-g004">Fig. 4(D)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083979-g005">Fig. 5(D)</xref> showing the mapped reads for both the intracellular and the extracellular condition which could be also confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis. Expression of the <italic>pgi</italic> gene is low for the intracellular growth, and high for the extracellular growth, while expression of the corresponding asRNA on the opposite strand is high for the intracellular and low for the extracellular condition (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083979-g005">Fig. 5(D)</xref>). <italic>lmo2367</italic>/<italic>pgi</italic>, encodes a glucose-6-phosphate isomerase with central function in the interface between glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. Previous reports link the transition from extracellular to intracellular growth of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> to a reduced expression of <italic>pgi</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0083979-Chatterjee2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and a corresponding shift in metabolic pathways leading to the degradation of glucose phosphate by the pentose phosphate pathway <xref rid="pone.0083979-Fuchs1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Furthermore a proteomic study was able to identify the <italic>pgi</italic> corresponding peptides under two different extracellular conditions but not within intracellular conditions of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0083979-GarciadelPortillo1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. As a housekeeping gene, <italic>pgi</italic> is under the control of a housekeeping promoter, and hence requires promoter independent specific regulation of this gene. The identification of anti2367 sheds lights on the metabolic adaptation on transcriptional level by antisense RNAs in <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The high coverage and strong strand specificity of our data revealed a substantial amount of general antisense transcription over the <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> genome. Similar general antisense transcription has been described previously <xref rid="pone.0083979-Georg1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083979-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. The biological relevance of this phenomenon is not yet fully understood, but the finding of such in another bacterial organism underlines its importance of further inquiry of the matter. Given the high number of newly identified asRNAs as well as the identification of exceptionally long non coding antisense RNAs, lasRNAs, it is obvious that antisense transcription is an important factor in the regulatory network of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> and it should be investigated whether similar types of regulation are common in other bacterial species.</p></sec></sec><sec
