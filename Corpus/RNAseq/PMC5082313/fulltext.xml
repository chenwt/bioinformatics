specific mRNA and protein isoforms. Alternative splicing factors determine the
relative abundance of each isoform. Here we focus on MBNL1, a splicing factor
misregulated in the disease myotonic dystrophy. By altering the concentration of
MBNL1 in cells across a broad dynamic range, we show that different splicing
events require different amounts of MBNL1 for half-maximal response, and respond
more or less steeply to MBNL1. Motifs around MBNL1 exon 5 were studied to assess
how <italic>cis</italic>-elements mediate the MBNL1 dose-dependent splicing
response. A framework was developed to estimate MBNL concentration using
splicing responses alone, validated in the cell-based model, and applied to
myotonic dystrophy patient muscle. Using this framework, we evaluated the
ability of individual and combinations of splicing events to predict functional
MBNL concentration in human biopsies, as well as their performance as biomarkers
to assay mild, moderate, and severe cases of DM.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Our studies provide insight into the mechanisms of myotonic dystrophy, the most
common adult form of muscular dystrophy. In this disease, a family of RNA
binding proteins is sequestered by toxic RNA, which leads to mis-regulation and

members to study how these RNA binding proteins function in the absence of the

for regulation of expression of specific isoforms in a developmental and
tissue-specific manner. Regulation of alternative splicing is integral for a variety
of biological processes including erythropoiesis, neuronal differentiation, and
embryonic stem cell programming [<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].
Misregulation of alternative splicing alters isoform ratios and can cause cancers,
muscular dystrophies, and neurological diseases [<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Isoform ratios can be altered by
differential expression of tissue specific factors [<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Active areas of investigation in the
alternative splicing field include how concentrations of alternative splicing
factors affect isoform ratios, and what properties determine whether an isoform is
responsive to a broad range of splicing factor concentrations or sensitive to a
threshold level of activity.</p><p>To address these questions, we focused on alternative splicing regulation by MBNL1,
an RNA binding protein involved in muscle, heart, and CNS development [<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the disease myotonic dystrophy, the
activities of MBNL1 protein and its paralogs, MBNL2 and MBNL3, are reduced via
sequestration to toxic RNAs, resulting in a titration of MBNL proteins away from
their pre-mRNA substrates. MBNL proteins bind to YGCY motifs using Zn finger RNA
binding motifs [<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], including sequences found
in the toxic RNAs (expanded CUG and CCUG repeats) that cause both myotonic dystrophy
type 1 (DM1) and myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) [<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. As has been observed in other
microsatellite repeat diseases, the average length of the repeat in patients is
loosely correlated with age of onset; repeat lengths also vary across cells and
tissues within a single patient, potentially sequestering MBNL proteins to differing
degrees [<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. MBNL splicing
targets are differentially affected by the disease; DM1 patient samples exhibit a
broad range of alternative exon inclusion levels, as compared to control samples
containing low numbers of repeats [<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and
MBNL1-dependent splicing events were shown to behave differently in response to
different doses of MBNL1 protein [<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Tunable systems can be used to control expression of specific genes and they can be
used to produce a range of mRNA and protein isoforms, and phenotypes that change
gradually or sharply, in response to stimuli [<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Here, we use a tunable system to
demonstrate that splicing events are responsive to MBNL1 dose, and characterize
their behavior over a range of MBNL1 protein levels. We found that dose-responsive
behaviors differ in their steepness, and differ in the protein concentration
required to reach half-maximal splicing activity. By further studying a splicing
event that is highly conserved between species, we assessed the importance of MBNL1
cis-element organization in controlling dose-response behavior. Similar to the
cell-based studies, analysis of muscle biopsies from DM1 patients revealed that
splicing events are not perturbed uniformly; here we characterize those splicing
events across patients and calculate the inferred MBNL dose, or predicted free MBNL
protein concentration, in each patient. These studies lead to predictions for which
alternative splicing events are the most robust disease biomarkers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>A cell model with a broad concentration range of MBNL1</title><p>A tetracycline-inducible Flp-In T-REx system (Invitrogen) was utilized to express

<italic>CLASP1</italic> exon 19, an exon that was identified to be

<italic>CLASP1</italic> event, to our knowledge, has not been described
previously. MBNL1 promotes exon inclusion of the <italic>CLASP1</italic> exon in
this study likely through binding to YGCYs within the 5' region of the intron

MBNL1 binding adjacent to enhanced exons [<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A previous study reported that MBNL1
promoted skipping of an exon within the <italic>CLASP1</italic> gene, but this

approximately three times more MBNL1 protein than <italic>MBNL2</italic>.
Estimated EC50 values partially correlated to previously reported affinity

15 nM, 11 nM, and 5.8 nM, respectively [<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]); exons with higher EC50s
(<italic>INSR</italic>, <italic>NFIX</italic>) tended to have weaker binding
(K<sub>D</sub>s of 120 nM and 55 nM, respectively) [<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], [<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]). Absolute values of slopes ranged from

central deletion mutant, del3, had the largest effect on the dose-response. This
18 nucleotide deletion resulted in removal of a single YGCY in the center of the
ISS, and led to both a shallower slope and a greater EC50 relative to WT. To
rule out additional explanations for why del3 exhibited a distinct
dose-response, another minigene reporter, 3M, was created in which the YGCY

not bind, YCCY (UCCCCU) [<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

events</title><p>In the HEK293 system, we observed that &#x003a8; of each splicing event exhibits a
characteristic sigmoid shape with respect to MBNL1 concentration. This
well-controlled system allowed us to derive these relationships, and directly
measure functional MBNL1 levels by Western blot. However, a major goal in the DM
field is to estimate the functional, non-sequestered concentration of MBNL in
tissue of DM patients. This metric is impossible to obtain from tissue using
current technologies, as free versus sequestered pools of MBNL are dynamic.
However, the dose-dependent curves we characterized suggested that &#x003a8; could be
used to infer the concentration of functional MBNL in cells. While we observed
that <italic>cis</italic>-element organization plays an important role in
dictating the shape of each dose-response curve, the
<italic>trans</italic>-factor environment also likely plays a role, and
therefore dose curve parameters will vary across tissues.</p><p>First, we assessed whether it was possible to infer MBNL concentration, given a
set of &#x003a8; values measured across a range of MBNL doses. We framed the task of
estimating [MBNL] and all sigmoid curve parameters, &#x003a8;<sub>min</sub>,
&#x003a8;<sub>max</sub>, EC50, and slope, as a Bayesian estimation problem. Since we

be similar, but not identical between HEK293 and tibialis anterior (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006316.s005">S5 Fig</xref>).
Interestingly, while curve shapes were similar across both cell types, those in

Posterior distributions for [MBNL] were derived for 30% of the data (red

the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; [MBNL] as estimated using 100% of the data (blue,

splicing event to predict &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; [MBNL] was calculated across 120 random
subsets of training and test sets, where 70% of samples were used for
training, and 30% for testing. Predictive power was defined as the
posterior probability estimate at &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; [MBNL] assessed using all the

patient subgroups&#x02013;severe ([MBNL] &#x0003c; 0.33), moderate (0.33 &#x0003c; [MBNL]
&#x0003c; 0.66), and mild ([MBNL] &#x0003e; 0.66) DM1, as well as across the
entire patient cohort. Mean predictive power for each patient subgroup
was plotted versus mean predictive power across the entire cohort, or
all patients; splicing events that perform better in specific subgroups
relative to the entire cohort are labeled. (C) The ability to estimate
changes in [MBNL] depends on the splicing event used to infer [MBNL], as
well as the disease severity at which treatment is initiated.
Hypothetical changes in [MBNL] of +0.4 and +0.3 during a therapeutic

respectively in left panels. The posterior probability estimates of
[MBNL] are illustrated in right panels. (D) A greater number of
biomarkers can improve predictive power of estimates of [MBNL]. The
posterior probability distribution for [MBNL] is shown when using 1, 2,
5, or 10 biomarkers for severely affected tibialis (top panel) or
moderately affected tibialis (bottom panel). The value of [MBNL]
obtained when using 100% of samples is shown as a dotted line; the
posterior probability at this value of [MBNL] increases as the number of
biomarkers increases. (E) Mean predictive power increases when using
more biomarkers, up to a point. The best possible combination of
biomarkers was chosen for each cross-validation trial, and predictive
power was averaged across 120 cross-validation trials.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1006316.g005"/></fig><p>We then used the trained parameters to estimate a posterior probability

The &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; estimates for [MBNL], previously calculated using 100% of
the data, are displayed in blue, green and orange vertical lines. Apparent from
these estimates is that the precision with which [MBNL] can be predicted is
dependent on the shape of the sigmoid curve. For example, a precise value for
[MBNL] in a severely affected individual (based on ADF measurements) is more
difficult to obtain using <italic>NFIX</italic> as compared to
<italic>CLASP1</italic>, because <italic>NFIX</italic> offers little
discriminatory power between 0 and 0.5 [MBNL] units. In contrast, the predictive
power of <italic>NFIX</italic> is slightly better than that of
<italic>CLASP1</italic> for mildly affected patients, as the sigmoid curve
for <italic>NFIX</italic> changes more steeply than <italic>CLASP1</italic> at
the high end of [MBNL]. <italic>CLASP1</italic> is an excellent predictor in the
moderate range (green); the posterior probability estimate at the &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; [MBNL]
value is close to 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006316.g005">Fig
5A</xref>).</p><p>These examples illustrate the principle that some splicing events are better than
others for predicting [MBNL], and that their predictive power is dependent on
disease severity. To quantitate the performance of each splicing event to
estimate [MBNL], we calculated the mean predictive power of each splicing event
to estimate &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; [MBNL] across 120 randomly sampled 70%/30% training/testing
cohort divisions, where predictive power is defined as the posterior probability
estimate at &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; [MBNL]. We calculated the mean predictive power for each
event across several patient subgroups&#x02013;severe ([MBNL] &#x0003c; 0.33), moderate (0.33
&#x0003c; [MBNL] &#x0003c; 0.66), and mild ([MBNL] &#x0003e; 0.66) DM1, as well as across the
entire patient cohort. Splicing events best suited to predict [MBNL] in mild DM1
are distinct from those best suited to predict moderate or severe DM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006316.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Interestingly,
splicing events best suited to predict [MBNL] in moderate DM1 are also those
best suited to predict [MBNL] across the entire spectrum
(<italic>CLASP1</italic>, <italic>PDLIM3</italic>.<italic>2</italic>,
<italic>CACNA2D1</italic>). Analyses of sigmoid curves for the best

within the range of [MBNL] being predicted.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Measurement of therapeutic rescue requires proper biomarker selection, and
usage of multiple biomarkers improves measurement accuracy</title><p>It is well established that the goal of many therapeutic efforts for DM is to
increase the free, functional concentration of MBNL in cells and tissues;
therefore, it is critical to be able to measure changes to this metric before
and after a clinical study/trial. A hypothetical change in [MBNL] may or may not
lead to changes in &#x003a8; for any given splicing event; the change in &#x003a8; is dependent
on the shape of the sigmoid curve, as well as the starting point and ending
point within the curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006316.g005">Fig
5C</xref>). For example, a positive change of 0.4 [MBNL] units for a
severely affected DM1 patient will result in changes to &#x003a8; for
<italic>CLASP1</italic> but not <italic>NFIX</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006316.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, left panels, purple points and

curve parameters are poorly separated for <italic>NFIX</italic>, yet well
separated for <italic>CLASP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006316.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, purple shading). In contrast, a
positive change of 0.3 [MBNL] units for a moderately affected DM1 patient
results in well separated pre- and post-treatment [MBNL] estimates for both
<italic>NFIX</italic> and <italic>CLASP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006316.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, brown data points).</p><p>Thus far, our analysis has made use of only one biomarker at a time to estimate
[MBNL]. We tested the ability to improve estimates by incorporating multiple
biomarkers; we essentially computed the joint probability distribution of [MBNL]
as estimated by each separate biomarker. We identified biomarker combinations
that would maximize predictive power across all disease severities, again using
70%/30% cross-validation training/test sets. For each cross-validation trial, we
first identified the single best biomarker with maximum predictive value for
[MBNL]; we then identified the next best biomarker that minimized errors in
concert with the best biomarker, then the third in concert with the first two,
and so on. We performed this analysis across all 120 cross-validation trials,
and recorded the biomarker sets with highest mean predictive power across all
trials. Shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006316.g005">Fig 5D</xref> are
posterior estimates of [MBNL] for a severely affected biopsy and moderately
affected biopsy, using the best 1, 2, 5, or 10 biomarkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006316.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). As expected, the probability
distribution becomes sharper and more centered on the &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; [MBNL]. Adding more
biomarkers can improve the estimation up to ~30 markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006316.g005">Fig 5E</xref>), after which further marker addition
decreases performance. The decrease in performance is likely due to use of &#x003a8;
values from splicing events whose inclusion is not as tightly linked to
[MBNL].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec010"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Splicing events exhibit distinct responses to MBNL concentration</title><p>We studied the behavior of 7 splicing targets in a cell line we developed, in

exhibited a unique, sigmoidal dose-response curve, with distinct EC50 and slope

a cooperative fashion and that high affinity binding would lead to a lower EC50,

The relationship between MBNL binding site number, location and affinity almost
certainly play an important role in determining MBNL1 dose-responses, but it is
also likely that other splicing factors, RNA structure and gene expression
levels can modulate these curves. Other factors that regulate splicing in DM1 TA

were more critical than others.</p><p>The site that most dramatically altered dose-dependent behavior was a single,

regions while del1/5 only had reduced cooperativity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006316.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). MBNL1 may bind to central sites
first causing the surrounding sites to become more accessible, consistent with

and that the RNA was generally not structured. Notably, previous studies
indicate that MBNL1 binds to regions of short single stranded RNAs through the
Watson-Crick face of short unstructured RNAs [<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Alternatively, differences in

increased sensitivity to MBNL1 concentrations, while the alternative structure
may be a weaker substrate for MBNL1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006316.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). Indeed, recent data suggests a
model where MBNL1 interacts with the toxic CUG RNA when it is destabilized by

levels of MBNL proteins in human tissue. Using the cell-based system, we
developed and validated a computational method to estimate MBNL1 concentration,
as well as splicing curve parameters, using &#x003a8; alone. The strong correlation
between estimated and measured MBNL1 protein levels in the cell-based system
motivated us to take a similar approach in human tibialis biopsies from DM1
affected and non-affected individuals, where free MBNL proteins vary between
individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006316.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). We
estimated tibialis-specific splicing curve parameters, which differed from those
observed in the cell-based system, and also estimated the levels of functional
MBNL protein remaining in tissue. As MBNL proteins regulate the splicing of many
pre-mRNA substrates, a major unresolved question is which splicing events are
most informative about disease status, and which splicing events in combination
are best suited to measure therapeutic rescue in a clinical trial. It is well
established that the remaining functional level of MBNL protein in tissue is
informative about disease status, and here, we demonstrate that we can estimate
this value using &#x003a8; alone, provided we first build a model using &#x003a8; from a number
of splicing events across a spectrum of disease severities.</p><p>We showed that the range of [MBNL] across which &#x003a8; varies is different across
events, and that this characteristic determines which subset of patients (mild,
moderate or severe) for which that biomarker exhibits the greatest predictive
power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006316.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). This has
implications for being able to accurately place patient samples along the
continuum of disease severities observed in DM, and for being able to accurately
measure the extent of therapeutic rescue in a clinical trial. Furthermore,
splicing biomarkers whose &#x003a8; values are invariant across a particular [MBNL]
range do not provide as much information as biomarkers whose &#x003a8; values change
dramatically across that same range. Finally, we showed that using multiple
biomarkers in combination to predict [MBNL] holds more predictive power than
using single biomarkers alone. The best biomarkers significantly overlap with
those previously described [<xref rid="pgen.1006316.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]; we found the top set of five biomarkers for tibialis to be

normal, heterozygote, and homozygote MBNL1 knockouts. The relationship of &#x003a8; to
[MBNL1] was slightly different in myoblasts versus muscle, depending on the

mediates dose-dependent behavior, with differing stoichiometry in different

performed Bayesian inference again, framing the problem as computing the

training data, so that events with observed &#x003a8; values that closely match
predicted &#x003a8; are more highly favored as biomarkers. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006316.g005">Fig 5A</xref> shows example posterior distributions
of [MBNL] for points highlighted in blue, green, and orange. We defined
&#x0201c;predictive power&#x0201d; as the value of the posterior distribution of [MBNL] where
[MBNL] equals that estimated when using 100% of the data. To compute the mean
&#x0201c;predictive&#x0201d; power for mild, moderate, or severely affected samples, we averaged

predictive power when using multiple splicing events as biomarkers, rather than
take an exhaustive approach, which would require testing upwards of billions of
combinations of splicing biomarkers (for example, to sample 46 choose 10 is ~4
billion), we took a recursive addition approach, where we identified the best
biomarker, then identified a second biomarker yielding the best performance in
concert with the best biomarker, then a third biomarker yielding the best
performance in concert with the first 2 biomarkers, and so on (the best
biomarkers are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006316.g005">Fig
