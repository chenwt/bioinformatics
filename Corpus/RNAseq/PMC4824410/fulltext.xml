Bridger, Oases, and SOAPdenovo-Trans used a small multiple k-mer (SMK) strategy consisting of the k-mer lengths of 21, 25, 27, 29, 31, and 33. Additionally, Oases and SOAPdenovo-Trans were performed using a large multiple k-mer (LMK) strategy consisting of k-mer lengths of 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, and 85. Eleven metrics were used to evaluate each assembly strategy including three genome related evaluation metrics (contig number, N50 length, Contigs &#x0003e;1 kb, reads) and eight transcriptome evaluation metrics (mapped back to transcripts (RMBT), number of full length transcripts, number of open reading frames, Detonate RSEM-EVAL score, and percent alignment to the southern platyfish, Amazon molly, BUSCO and CEGMA databases). The assembly strategy that performed the best, that is it was within the top three of each evaluation metric, was the Bridger assembly (10 of 11) followed by the Oases SMK assembly (8 of 11), the Oases LMK assembly (6 of 11), the Trinity assembly (4 of 11), the SOAP LMK assembly (4 of 11), and the SOAP SMK assembly (3 of 11).</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study provides an in-depth multi <italic>k-mer</italic> strategy investigation concluding that the assembler itself had a greater impact than <italic>k-mer</italic> size regardless of the strategy employed.

This increasingly accessible technology provides an efficient and cost-effective approach for analyzing the transcriptome of non-model organisms that lack a fully-sequenced genome [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It has been employed to identify novel transcriptome sequences, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), simple sequence repeats (SSRs), splicing variants, transcript isoforms, new large intergenic noncoding RNAs, and relative levels of transcript expressions [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153104.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. With the arrival of NGS technologies, the number of publications characterizing <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies for non-model organisms have steadily been on the rise [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p><italic>De novo</italic> transcriptome assembly is performed by taking the enormous amount of short read sequences produced by NGS and overlapping them to form contiguous sequences (contigs) [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The quality of the assembly output is reliant on the user designated <italic>k-mer</italic> value defined as the sequence overlap between two reads forming the contig [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Low <italic>k-mer</italic> values have a tendency to recover less abundant transcripts, while producing a large amount of contigs, with a number of them highly fragmented due to sequencing errors and lack of overlap [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153104.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. High <italic>k-mer</italic> values will produce a more contiguous assembly consisting of high coverage transcripts and splice variants. However, the assembly will contain fewer contigs leading to lower transcript representation [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153104.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, utilizing a single <italic>k-mer</italic> approach when performing a <italic>de novo</italic> assembly can result in loss of relevant biological information due to the lack of transcript diversity [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A logical approach to resolve this dilemma is to cluster multiple single <italic>k-mer</italic> assembles together in order to take advantage of the characteristics of both the low and high <italic>k-mer</italic> values and thereby improve the accuracy of the assembly [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Investigations that compare the quality of transcriptome assembly using one or multiple <italic>k-mer</italic> values will contribute to standardizing NGS data processing.</p><p>The number of <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome programs developed for assembly of short sequence reads has increased within the past few years. In 2010, Trans-AByss was reported to have the ability to merge multiple individual <italic>k-mer</italic> assemblies, allowing the transcriptome to be represented by wide levels of transcript expression [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In 2011, Trinity was reported to be able to fully reconstruct a large fraction of transcripts with low base error rates and have the ability to report alternative splice isoforms [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Trinity is currently regarded to be the best single <italic>k-mer</italic> assembler [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In 2012, Oases was reported to improve significantly on the Trans-ABySS and Trinity assemblers by merging the use of multiple k-mers presented in Trans-AByss with a topological analysis similar to that presented by Trinity [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In 2014, SOAPdenovo-Trans was reported to be able to perform multiple individual <italic>k-mer</italic> assemblies and provide higher contiguity, lower redundancy and faster execution when compared to Trinity and Oases [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. All of these assemblers are founded on the <italic>de Bruijn</italic> graph-based assembly method to which programmers add their own algorithms [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153104.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153104.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In 2015, Bridger, which employs a new <italic>de novo</italic> assembly method that does not construct <italic>de Bruijn</italic> graphs, was created [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This assembler uses a rigorous mathematical model, called the minimum path cover, to construct splice graphs that are used to build compatibility graphs for transcriptome reconstruction from short RNA-seq reads [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This multiple <italic>k-mer</italic> assembler aims to build a bridge between the key concepts of two popular assemblers, the reference-based assembler, Cufflinks [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and the <italic>de novo</italic> assembler, Trinity [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Given the number of programs available, there is a need for more definitive information on what assemblers and parameters work best for constructing a <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153104.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Much effort has been dedicated towards improving the capabilities of <italic>de novo</italic> assembly software. However, methods to evaluate the assembler&#x02019;s performance are still a few steps behind. For example, a common approach to assess genomes assemblies is to evaluate statistics such as the number of contigs, the amount of contigs over 1,000 bps, and the N50 value. The N50 value is defined as the length of the largest contig from all the contigs ranked smallest to largest that represents 50% of the assembly length [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, these metrics are also routinely used to evaluate the quality of <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assemblies even though they may be misleading regarding their accuracy [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Evaluating mRNA characteristics such as the percentage of assembled full length transcripts and the number of long open reading frames (ORFs) are other common metrics for evaluating transcriptome assemblies [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153104.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153104.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A novel reference-free evaluation method to assess the quality of transcriptomes is Detonate RSEM-EVAL [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This program produces a statistically principled evaluation score using multiple factors, such as the compactness of the assembly and its support from the RNA-Seq reads used to create it [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Annotation-based metrics describe the percentage of sequences within an assembly that match protein sequences found in a related species or curated database [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. An accurate assembly should contain a high percentage of these conserved proteins while a low percentage reflects mis-assemblies. These types of metrics can be challenging for non-model species that do not have an annotated phylogenetically related species to which it can be aligned. If the evolutionary distance between the two species is too great, then orthologs may have undergone nucleotide changes making alignments less likely to occur [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A database to gauge the performance of an assembly strategy in the absence of a well annotated phylogenetically related species is the CEGMA (Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach) database [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This is a manually curated database that contains 248 core proteins present in a wide range of taxa [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The same approach can be achieved by utilizing the manually curated BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) protein set for the quantitative assessment of transcriptome assembly and annotation completeness [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Using this database, assemblies are matched to 3,023 vertebrate genes and results return the percentage of unaligned sequences. Annotation metrics are useful for assessing both genome and transcriptome assemblies.</p><p>Evaluation metrics are important for assessing the quality of genome and transcriptome assemblies. Unfortunately, there is a lack of consensus as to which evaluation metrics work best let alone how many of them to use. For example, Chropra <italic>et al</italic>. performed a comparison study using peanut (<italic>Arachis</italic> spp.) RNA-Seq data. Assemblies were evaluated based on the N50 length, average contig length, number of contigs, the novelty of each assembly using the Mummer tool, the accuracy determined by RMBT, and the continuity by estimating the number of full length transcripts [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreton <italic>et al</italic>. relied on the RMBT and CEGMA percentages as well as the N50 length, the number of transcripts, and the number of transcripts &#x0003e;1kb when evaluating different assemblies of the duck (<italic>Amas platyrhynchos</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. He <italic>et al</italic>. assessed the assemblies of sweet potato fungus (<italic>Trametes gallica</italic>) and wild rice (<italic>Oryza meyeriana</italic>) based on N50 length, average contig length, number of contigs &#x0003e; 1,000 bps, as well as their ORFs and percent annotation using BLASTX results against phylogenetically related species [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. More information on which evaluation metrics best predict the quality of <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assemblies would help establish &#x0201c;best practices&#x0201d; particularly for less experienced users.</p><p>The study presented compares assembly programs, <italic>k-mer</italic> strategies, and various metrics for determining <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly quality. Assembly performance is evaluated using the testis transcriptome of <italic>Fundulus heteroclitus</italic>, an estuary fish that is a sentinel teleost species commonly used in environmental toxicology studies [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. To date, this is the first study to compare the performances of the commonly used <italic>de Bruijn</italic> graph-based <italic>de novo</italic> assemblers, Trinity, Oases, and SOAPdenovo-Trans, with a new <italic>de novo</italic> method employed by Bridger. This is also the first study to evaluate the effects of using a small and large multiple <italic>k-mer</italic> strategy for the Oases and SOAPdenovo-Trans assemblers within the same study. Based on the eleven evaluation metrics presented above, it was found that the product of those assemblies was more influenced by the assembler itself than the <italic>k-mer</italic> strategy.

It is known that different <italic>de novo</italic> assemblers using the same transcripts with similar user defined parameters have produced assemblies that vary amongst each other [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153104.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153104.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153104.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. One of the goals of this work was to compare four recently published <italic>de novo</italic> assemblers and one user defined parameter, the <italic>k-mer</italic> value, to determine if one strategy was better than another for <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of a non-model organism transcriptome. The assemblers included Trinity, Oases, and SOAPdenovo-Trans (commonly used <italic>de Bruijn</italic> graph-based <italic>de novo</italic> assemblers) as well as Bridger (uses the minimum path cover model to construct splice graphs that are used to build compatibility graphs). Additionally, eleven metrics of assembly quality were compared in order to better form a consensus as to which ones should be used to assess <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assemblies. Overall, eleven metrics were used to evaluate six assembly strategies.</p><p>Commonly used evaluation statistics, such as the number of contigs, the N50 value, and contig length, were developed for genome assemblies but have also been used to evaluate transcriptome assemblies [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Better assemblies should theoretically have more reads assembled into longer contigs and thereby higher N50 values. However, importance of the N50 metric has been questioned [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153104.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Research indicated that N50 values could be artificially increased based on <italic>k-mer</italic> strategy and or the user defined minimum contig length. Short contigs occurred when high <italic>k-mer</italic> values did not assemble short reads of low abundance transcripts or low <italic>k-mer</italic> values assembled short fragmented transcripts due to lack of overlap [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153104.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In both cases, if the resulting transcripts were shorter than the minimum contig length parameter established by the user, they were eliminated by the program ultimately generating artificially high N50 values. In the study presented, the influence of high (LMK) and low (SMK) <italic>k-mer</italic> values on evaluation statistics was determined for SOAP and Oases assemblies. Both showed somewhat higher N50 values for low <italic>k-mer</italic> assemblies, but greater differences were found for the assembler. For example, the N50 lengths for SOAP LMK and SMK were 917 and 1,042, respectively, while those for Oases LMK and SMK were 1,676 and 1,743, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0153104.t002">Table 2</xref>). Bridger also used a low <italic>k-mer</italic> strategy, and results showed that contig number as well as contigs over 1k were twice those of the other assemblies. Taken together, the assembler program had more influence on these traditional, genomic metrics than the <italic>k-mer</italic> values, and the Bridger assembler performed the best in two out of the three metrics.</p><p>The quality of an assembly can be assessed by its ability to construct transcripts that align to genes in publically available databases. In the study presented, the six assemblies were evaluated using two well annotated phylogenetic tree relatives, the CEGMA database, and the BUSCO database. For the phylogenetic tree analyses, killifish transcriptome assemblies were aligned to the reference databases of southern platyfish (<italic>X</italic>. <italic>maculatus</italic>) and Amazon molly (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>formosa</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153104.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Oases assemblies had the best percentages of alignments ranging from 47.00 to 51.82%. Results for the other assemblies were similar but lower with alignments ranging from 32.68 to 39.35%. The low percentage of killifish matches in general could be attributed to the evolutionary distance between killifish and the other two species as other <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly studies using non-model fish had similar findings [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Additionally, the BLASTX results were based on aligning the testis transcriptome of killifish with the entire genomes of the southern platyfish and Amazon molly. This would have inherently caused a lower percentage of matches. Furthermore, some of the unannotated contigs may be short and consist of sequences lacking well characterized protein domains, comprised of 3&#x02019; or 5&#x02019; untranslated regions, or be non-coding RNAs [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Results also showed that the general performance of each assembly&#x02019;s BLASTX alignment was more dependent on the assembler software than <italic>k-mer</italic> value. For example, assemblies using Oases SMK and LMK had percent alignments of 47.00 and 50.14% in southern platyfish while SOAP had percent alignments of 35.22% and 34.60% for the same species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0153104.t003">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>CEGMA and BUSCO evaluated assembly quality by aligning contigs to core proteins. For CEGMA, most of the 248 core proteins were found with each assembler; therefore, this metric did not distinguish between them (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0153104.t004">Table 4</xref>). Interestingly, some assemblers left out CEGMA proteins found by others. This indicated that particular assemblers had different proficiencies in reassembling clean reads into transcripts as previously reported by Naksugi et al. [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For example, KOG0292 (Vesicle coat complex COPI, alpha subunit) was only present in the SOAP SMK an LMK strategies, and KOG2311 (NAD/FAD-utilizing protein possibly involved in translation) was only present in Trinity. In addition, both SOAP and Oases were unable to properly assemble the same transcripts regardless of the <italic>k-mer</italic> strategy. For example, both SOAP SMK and LMK did not assemble at full length KOG0261, KOG0209, KOG0462 or KOG2311. Both Oases SMK and LMK did not assemble at full length KOG0292, KOG2311 or KOG4392. This indicated that the assembler&#x02019;s algorithms had a more influential role than the <italic>k-mer</italic> selection when assembling transcripts. BUSCO showed greater differences between assemblers than CEGMA most likely due to the larger database of 3,023 vertebrate genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153104.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Missing BUSCO genes for the six different assemblies ranged from 675 (22.3%) in Trinity to 1,030 (34.1%) in SOAP LMK. As with CEGMA and BLASTX alignments, this metric showed that the assembler rather than the <italic>k-mer</italic> strategy had more influential over the outcome. Both the SMK (28.7%) and LMK (31%) strategies of Oases outperformed the SMK (32.4%) and LMK (34.1%) strategies of SOAP. Overall, results indicated that for either genomes or transcriptomes, if a user&#x02019;s goal was to annotate the most genes possible for a non-model organism, Oases was the assembler of choice. If the goal was to assemble the most accurate transcriptome, Trinity or Bridger would be the best choice. As of 2015, CEGMA is no longer actively supported and has been essentially replaced by BUSCO.</p><p>This study incorporated several evaluation metrics specifically for transcriptomes including number of full length transcripts, ORFs, Detonate&#x02019;s RSEM-EVAL and RMBT. Shown here as well as other studies, the Trinity assembler proved able to reconstruct the most full length transcripts [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153104.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Alignment coverages were greater than 70% (8,168) and 90% (5,664) even though it utilized a single <italic>k-mer</italic> value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153104.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). The Bridger assembler was able to reconstruct the most ORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153104.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Results showed that transcripts of &#x0003e;799 bps, &#x0003e;999 bps, and &#x0003e; 1199 bps had 3,189, 1,377 and 593 ORFs, respectively. This number of ORFs was 23.9% (&#x0003e;799 bs), 19.3% (&#x0003e;999 bps), and 16.3% (&#x0003e;1199 bps) higher than those for Trinity, the next closest assembler. SMK and LMK assemblies of Oases and SOAP were similar for both full length transcripts and ORFs; therefore, the overall quality of each assembly's performance was not reliant on the <italic>k-mer</italic> strategy. Detonate&#x02019;s RSEM-EVAL provided a reference-free evaluation score where a high value indicated an accurate transcriptome assembly. Results showed that the Trinity assembly appeared slightly better than the Bridger and SOAP LMK (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0153104.t005">Table 5</xref>). However, all scores were similar (ranging from 5,426.0 x10 &#x002c4;6 to 6,125.0 x10 &#x002c4;6); and therefore, this metric did not distinguish well between the assemblers. The RMBT statistic determined assembly accuracy based on the philosophy that the higher the amount of processed reads that can be mapped back to an assembly the fewer the errors (i.e. mis-assembly) introduced by the assembler program. Results for the six assembly strategies evaluated showed RMBT percentages ranging from 87.71% for the Bridger assembly to 80.77% for the SOAP SMK assembly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0153104.t002">Table 2</xref>). Other studies comparing assembly strategies also reported differences in RMBT percentages [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153104.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153104.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153104.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In the study presented, the assembler software and not the <italic>k-mer</italic> strategy appeared to have the greater impact. RMBT results showed that the SMK and LMK assemblies for both SOAP (80.77 and 83.78%, respectively) and Oases (84.18 and 85.28%, respectively) performed similarly. Overall, both Trinity and Bridger performed well according to transcriptome-specific metrics and <italic>k-mer</italic> sizes were not a factor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec029"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This research presents a comprehensive multi <italic>k-mer</italic> strategy assessment with a thorough multiple assembler performance evaluation analysis. To date, this is the first study to compare the performances of the commonly used <italic>de Bruijn</italic> graph-based <italic>de novo</italic> assemblers- Trinity, Oases, and SOAPdenovo-Trans with a new <italic>de novo</italic> method employed by Bridger. Additionally, this is the first study to analyze a small and large multiple <italic>k-mer</italic> strategy for the same assembler software. Based on eleven evaluation metrics, it was found that the assembler had more influence than the <italic>k-mer</italic> strategy. This contradicted Chopra et al., 2014, Chang et al., 2015, and Surget-Groba and Montoya-Burgos, 2010, who highlight the advantages and disadvantages between low and high <italic>k-mer</italic> values (11, 13, 18). For assemblers, killifish data indicated that Bridger performed more often within the top three of each evaluation metric performed better in more of the matrices tested (10 of 11) than the other programs. Oases generated the most alignments with phylogenetically related species. Trinity generated the most full length transcripts, while Bridger generated the most ORFs. Bridger and Trinity also both performed well with BUSCO and Detonate&#x02019;s RSEM-EVAL. Something that differentiated Trinity and Bridger was time for transcriptome assembly. Bridger was faster, which the authors found to be an important consideration. Other researchers have shown that Trinity takes longer to assemble transcriptomes than other programs including SOAPdenovo-Trans and Oases [<xref rid="pone.0153104.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Overall, Bridger was the preferred assembler program for producing a quality <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of the killifish testis transcriptome based on its performance within the top three of each evaluation metric along with its time for completion.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Dr. Keith Cooper and Dan Milemann at Rutgers University, for their technical support in capturing and housing the killfish.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0153104.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Gordo</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Pinheiro</surname><given-names>DG</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Moreira</surname><given-names>EC</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Rodrigues</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Poltronieri</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name>, <name><surname>de Lemos</surname><given-names>OF</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal><article-title>High-throughput sequencing of black pepper root transcriptome</article-title>. <source>BMC Plant Biology</source>
