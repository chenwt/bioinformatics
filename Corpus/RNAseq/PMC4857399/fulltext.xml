They can either undergo myogenesis to promote muscle regeneration or differentiate into adipocytes and other cells to compromise regeneration. How the differentiation and fate determination of PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells are regulated, however, remains unclear. Here, by utilizing a conditional knockout mouse line, we report that PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell-derived laminin inhibits their proliferation and adipogenesis, but is indispensable for their myogenesis. In addition, we show that laminin alone is able to partially reverse the muscle dystrophic phenotype in these mice at the molecular, structural and functional levels. Further RNAseq analysis reveals that laminin regulates PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell differentiation/fate determination via gpihbp1. These data support a critical role of laminin in the regulation of PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell stemness, identify an innovative target for future drug development and may provide an effective treatment for muscular dystrophy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="i1" xlink:href="ncomms11415-i1.jpg"/>Muscle PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells are interstitial stem/progenitor cells with myogenic potential.

Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD), a severe type of MD, usually has its onset at or near birth and affects almost all the voluntary muscles in the body<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Although physical therapy and other medical management have been found beneficial, there are no effective treatments for this devastating disorder. Stem cells with myogenic activity have been suggested as a promising therapy for MD. Satellite cells, postnatal myogenic precursor cells, demonstrate great potential by actively repairing muscle damage and promoting regeneration after injury<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Their clinical application, however, is hampered by their limited migration ability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, low survival rate after injection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> and reduced differentiation potency after expansion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p><p>In addition to satellite cells, muscle-resident PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells also have myogenic activity. Using lineage-tracing technique, we found that PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells include two populations: pericytes and PICs. There is evidence showing that pericytes, multipotent perivascular cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, can differentiate into myogenic cells and repair damage after muscle injury<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Pericytes, on the other hand, can also differentiate into adipocytes, which contribute to muscle degeneration. It has been demonstrated that PICs are myogenic <italic>in vitro</italic> and contribute to skeletal muscle regeneration efficiently <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. These data suggest that PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells may be used to treat MD. How PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell stemness (self-renewal, differentiation and fate determination) is regulated remains unknown. Under physiological conditions, these cells are embedded in the basement membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, which usually gets degraded upon injury. This direct contact suggests that the basement membrane may regulate the stemness of PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells.</p><p>Laminin, a trimeric protein containing &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-subunits, is a major component of the basement membrane. Loss of laminin &#x003b1;2 (<italic>Lama2</italic>) subunit leads to progressive MD and has been used as a mouse model of CMD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Recent research demonstrates that laminin-&#x003b1;1&#x003b2;1&#x003b3;1 (laminin-111) is able to reduce muscle pathology, enhance viability and improve muscle repair in a <italic>Lama2</italic>-deficient CMD model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. In addition, laminin-111 also significantly improves muscle pathology and increases muscle strength/resistance in mdx mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, a Duchenne muscular dystrophy model. These data strongly suggest a therapeutic function of laminin in MD. The mechanism underlying laminin's beneficial role in CMD, however, remains unclear. Previous studies in our lab showed that (i) astrocyte-derived laminin maintains the blood&#x02013;brain barrier integrity by preventing brain pericytes differentiating from the resting stage to the contractile stage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> and (ii) aortic stem/progenitor cell-derived laminin modulates their proliferation and differentiation, contributing to blood pressure regulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Given that PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells also produce laminin that covers themselves in skeletal muscles, we hypothesized that PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell-derived laminin regulates their stemness in skeletal muscles.</p><p>By using conditional knockout mice with laminin deficiency in PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells and RNAseq analysis, we show that (i) PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell-derived laminin negatively regulates their proliferation and adipogenesis, but promotes their myogenesis, (ii) gpihbp1 is an important mediator of these effects and (iii) laminin-111 is able to partially rescue the muscle phenotype in these mice at molecular, structural and functional levels.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Loss of PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell-derived laminin leads to MD</title><p>We generated homozygous Laminin &#x003b3;1 (<italic>Lamc1</italic>) floxed (F/F) mice by targeting the exon 2 of <italic>Lamc1</italic> gene as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. The F/F mice were then crossed with <italic>Pdgfr&#x003b2;-Cre</italic> transgenic mice to generate F/F:<italic>Pdgfr&#x003b2;-Cre</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> (termed PKO) mice. The PKO mice were born at the Mendelian ratio and were indistinguishable from their heterozygous and wild-type littermates at early postnatal stage. Starting from approximately postnatal day (P)10, the PKO mice became significantly smaller than their littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). The PKO mice usually died within 4 months as demonstrated by their survival rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). In addition, the PKO mice developed a severe skeletal muscle deficit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>), similar to that in <italic>Lama2</italic>-deficient mice, a widely used genetic model of CMD. All hindlimb muscles, including tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, soleus, plantaris and gastrocnemius, were significantly smaller in the PKO mice 7 and 24 weeks after birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Haematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) staining revealed well-developed myofibres in 2-month-old control muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). The myofibres in age-matched PKO muscles, however, varied in size and contained centrally nucleated nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>), suggesting active muscle degeneration/regeneration. Like the <italic>Lama2</italic>-deficient mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, the PKO mice also showed signs of muscle necrosis and fibrosis in pathological analyses. In addition, a large number of nuclei were observed in the interstitium of the PKO muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Further immunohistochemical analyses revealed significantly increased infiltration of T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g,i</xref>) and macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h,i</xref>) in the PKO muscles, compared with the controls. Inflammatory cell infiltration, a hallmark of CMD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, is also observed in the <italic>Lama2</italic>-deficient mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Consistent with these changes, electron microscopy study revealed well-developed myofibres wrapped by a clearly defined basement membrane in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1j</xref>). In the PKO muscles, however, well-developed myofibres and a clearly defined basement membrane were missing and were instead replaced by gaps (&#x00023;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1j</xref>) containing adipocytes with lipid droplets. In addition, we also performed CD31 staining and found no differences in CD31 density or intensity between the control and PKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1k,l</xref>), suggesting that the observed phenotype is less likely due to vascular defects. Interestingly, the muscle pathology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a and b</xref>) and inflammatory cell infiltration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>) were absent in the PKO mice at P6. A time-course study showed that the PKO phenotype started at approximately P10. Previous study demonstrated that in the <italic>Lama2</italic>-deficient mice, muscle pathology appeared at P9 and became apparent at P14 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). Collectively, our data demonstrate that the gross phenotype, muscle pathology and timing of disease onset/development are comparable between the PKO mice and <italic>Lama2</italic>-deficient mice, suggesting that the PKO mice may be used to study CMD.</p><p>To investigate the specificity of <italic>Pdgfr&#x003b2;</italic>-driven <italic>Cre</italic>, the <italic>Pdgfr&#x003b2;-Cre</italic> mice were crossed with the Ai14 reporter line, which contains a floxed STOP sequence before tdTomato (TdT). In the resulting Ai14:<italic>Pdgfr&#x003b2;-Cre</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mice, TdT expression co-localized with pericyte marker PDGFR&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Satellite cell maker Pax7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>), fibro/adipogenic progenitor (FAP) marker PDGFR&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>) and endothelial marker CD31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>) rarely co-localized with TdT, suggesting that <italic>Lamc1</italic> is not targeted in these cells. Interestingly, PW1, a marker for PICs, co-localized with TdT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Lamc1</italic> in PICs is also targeted. In addition, we also examined the expression pattern of these markers with TdT in F/F:Ai14:<italic>Pdgfr&#x003b2;-Cre</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mice and similar results were found (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a-e</xref>). In these mice, hematopoietic (CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) cells infiltrated into the muscles and they were not labelled by TdT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>), suggesting that the floxed allele is not targeted in these CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells. Consistent with these data, we found dramatically reduced laminin &#x003b3;1 expression in PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in the PKO muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>). The western blots showed similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, we isolated PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from skeletal muscles by FACS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>) and examined laminin &#x003b3;1 expression on these cells. Fluorescence-minus-one control for PDGFR&#x003b2;-PE was used to set its gating (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). Laminin &#x003b3;1 expression was observed in sorted control but not the PKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>), indicating that laminin expression is indeed diminished in PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in the PKO mice. To determine the cell types in PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> population, we checked the expression of various markers on these cells. Sorted PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells expressed either pericyte markers, including NG2, CD13, SMA and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or PIC marker PW1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a and b</xref>). These PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, however, were negative for satellite cell marker SM/C-2.6 and FAP marker PDGFR&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>), suggesting that sorted PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells contain pericytes and PICs, but not satellite cells or FAPs. In addition, we also isolated satellite cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, FAPs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> and PICs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> from the control and PKO muscles by FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d,g,j</xref>). Representative plots and gating boundaries were shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b&#x02013;d</xref>. Sorted satellite cells expressed SM/C-2.6 and Pax7, but were negative for PDGFR&#x003b2;, CD13, PDGFR&#x003b1; and fibroblast marker Reticular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4c and d</xref>). Comparable levels of laminin &#x003b3;1 were observed in satellite cells from the control and PKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>), suggesting that laminin expression is not affected in satellite cells in the PKO mice. Sorted FAPs expressed PDGFR&#x003b1;, but were negative for PDGFR&#x003b2;, CD13 and Pax7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h</xref>). Like satellite cells, laminin &#x003b3;1 expression was unaffected in FAPs isolated from the PKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3i</xref>). Consistent with previous report, sorted PICs were PW1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Pax7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3k</xref>). These cells also expressed PDGFR&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3k</xref>). In contrast to satellite cells and FAPs, laminin &#x003b3;1 expression was absent in PICs isolated from the PKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3l</xref>). Altogether, our data suggest that laminin expression is abrogated in pericytes and PICs, but not satellite cells or FAPs in the PKO mice.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Laminin inhibits proliferation of PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells</title><p>Enhanced PDGFR&#x003b2; expression was observed in the PKO muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f,g</xref>). To investigate whether this is due to proliferation, we examined the incorporation of Edu, a BrdU analogue, <italic>in vivo</italic>. Compared with the control, 10-fold more Edu<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were found in the PKO muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). Double immunostaining revealed significantly more proliferating pericytes (PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Edu<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and ALP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Edu<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) in the PKO muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,c</xref>), suggesting that loss of PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell-derived laminin leads to proliferation of these cells. Consistent with the time-course study, no differences in PDGFR&#x003b2; expression and PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Ki67<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell count were observed at P6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a-c</xref>). We next examined the proliferation of PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and found that the PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells freshly isolated from PKO muscles incorporated significantly more Edu than those from control muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d,e</xref>). Interestingly, exogenous laminin (laminin-111) dramatically decreased Edu incorporation in the PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells isolated from the PKO but not control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d,e</xref>), suggesting that laminin negatively regulates the proliferation of PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells. In addition, although more caspase-3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were found in the PKO muscles, no difference in the number of caspase-3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells was found between the control and PKO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>).

In the first model, the wild-type mice were injected with CTX in both tibialis anterior intramuscularly, followed by daily administration of saline and laminin to the left and right tibialis anterior, respectively. Four days after the injury, a large number of Edu<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were observed in saline-injected tibialis anterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>). These cells, however, were dramatically reduced in laminin-injected tibialis anterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>).

Histology studies revealed dystrophic myofibres with infiltrated/accumulated cells in saline-injected muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>).

Next, gpihbp1 expression in the PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from saline- or laminin-treated PKO mice were examined.

In addition, we also examined gpihbp1 expression in dyW (<italic>Lama2</italic>-disrupted) mice, a widely used CMD model.

These findings are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9</xref>. The novelty and significance of this work are (i) we generated a new mouse line, which can be used in CMD research; (ii) we found that laminin actively regulates the stemness of PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells; (iii) we showed that exogenous laminin is able to partially rescue the muscle deficit in the PKO mice at the molecular, structural and functional levels; and (iv) we performed RNAseq analysis and identified gpihbp1 as a key regulator and molecular target for the differentiation of the PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells.</p><p>One of the most widely used CMD models is the dy<sup>2J</sup> mice, which express near-normal amount of truncated protein due to a point mutation in the <italic>Lama2</italic> gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.

Like the <italic>Lama2</italic>-deficient mice, our PKO mice show muscle pathology in all voluntary muscles beginning at early postnatal stage (about P10) and progress rapidly, which closely replicates the time course observed in CMD patients. In addition, since only PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell-derived laminin is abrogated in the PKO mice, myelination defect is not detected in these mice. Furthermore, the PKO mice have a longer life span compared with the <italic>Lama2</italic>-deficient mice, enabling research at an older age possible. It should be noted, however, that (i) there are no known human CMD patients with <italic>Lamc1</italic> mutations and (ii) like the dy<sup>2J</sup> and <italic>Lama2</italic>-deficient mice, the PKO mice are smaller in size, a phenotype not associated with human CMD pathology. Together, these data suggest that the PKO line may be used as an alternative, if not better, model in CMD research.</p><p>Lineage-tracing experiment and immunocytochemical analyses reveal that the PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> population we isolated contains pericytes and PICs, but not satellite cells or FAPs. In our model, wild-type PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells undergo myogenesis and contribute to muscle development/regeneration, suggesting that these cells, like satellite cells, have myogenic capability. These data are consistent with previous reports that transplantation of human pericytes into immune-deficient mdx mice generates myofibres expressing human dystrophy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, that pericytes participate in postnatal muscle growth/regeneration in both physiological and pathological conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, and that PICs are myogenic <italic>in vitro</italic> and contribute to muscle regeneration <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. The next question then becomes: what are the differences between these cells and satellite cells in term of myogenesis? A time-course study demonstrated that satellite cells and pericytes have different kinetics in the expression of various myogenic transcription factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Another study elegantly showed that Pax7 is indispensable for the myogenic specification of PICs, whereas loss of Pax7 does not affect the proliferation and differentiation potential of satellite cells <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. These studies strongly indicate that pericytes, PICs and satellite cells are three different populations with distinct myogenic kinetics and potentials. In addition, three labs independently report that muscle regeneration fails when Pax7<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> satellite cells are genetically ablated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, suggesting that the myogenesis of pericytes and/or PICs is dependent on the presence of satellite cell population.</p><p>On loss of laminin, the PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells diminish their myogenic activity and obtain enhanced adipogenic activity. This observation is consistent with previous findings that both pericytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> and PICs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> have adipogenic potential. We, for the first time, report that laminin regulates the differentiation and determines the fate of PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (pericytes and PICs). In addition, collagen IV, another component of the basement membrane, has been shown to control the self-renewal of satellite cells and regulate muscle regeneration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. These data indicate that the basement membrane, which has direct contact with PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells and satellite cells, is more than just a supporting matrix. It more likely serves as an important niche to regulate the biological properties of these cells, probably via signalling the cells using its components. Further studies on how individual basement membrane components regulate the biological properties of these cells and how they interact with each other to form a cohesive/coordinate network will significantly enrich our knowledge on basement membrane biology and promote innovative therapies for many diseases, including MD.</p><p>Although laminin significantly improved muscle pathology/function, the PKO mice were still smaller and their muscles were weaker compared with age-matched controls. This partial recovery may be due to the local (only hindlimbs) intramuscular injection of laminin. In contrast to previous reports that systemic administration of laminin-111 reduced muscle pathology in <italic>Lama2</italic>-deficient mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, we found intramuscular injection to be more efficient in the PKO mice. This discrepancy may be explained by the compromised vessel integrity in <italic>Lama2</italic>-deficient mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>, which may allow for the leakage of systemically delivered laminin to target organs. It should be noted, however, that intramuscular injection of laminin is impractical for human CMD patients owing to the large muscle size and limited diffusion of laminin. To find an alternative therapeutic option, we performed RNAseq analysis and identified gpihbp1 as a molecular target. Previous studies demonstrate that gpihbp1 is expressed in capillary endothelial cells and transports lipoprotein lipase from interstitial space to capillary lumen to regulate lipid metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. It remains unclear, however, whether PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> pericytes, which cover endothelial cells in capillaries, are involved in this process. We, for the first time, report that PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells also express gpihbp1, suggesting that these cells may also regulate lipid metabolism and/or lipoprotein lipase transportation, possibly via gpihbp1. In addition, we show that gpihbp1 reversibly regulates the myogenesis and adipogenesis of PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, indicating a critical role of gpihbp1 in PDGFR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell differentiation/fate determination.
