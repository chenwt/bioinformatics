In vertebrates, segment patterning depends on oscillations of gene expression coordinated as travelling waves in the posterior, unsegmented mesoderm. Recently, waves of segmentation gene expression have been clearly documented in insects. However, it remains unclear whether cyclic gene activity is widespread across arthropods, and possibly ancestral among segmented animals.

We show that a segmentation clock is involved in segment formation: most segments are generated by cycles of dynamic gene activity that generate a pattern of double segment periodicity, which is only later resolved to the definitive single segment pattern. However, not all segments are generated by this process. The most posterior segments are added individually from a localized sub-terminal area of the embryo, without prior pair-rule patterning.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data suggest that dynamic patterning of gene expression may be widespread among the arthropods, but that a single network of segmentation genes can generate either oscillatory behavior at pair-rule periodicity or direct single segment patterning, at different stages of embryogenesis.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Segmentation clock</kwd><kwd>Oscillation</kwd><kwd>Pair-rule genes</kwd><kwd>Single segment patterning</kwd><kwd>Arthropod</kwd><kwd>Evolution</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Most arthropods, like most other segmented animals, couple the processes of segmentation and growth, adding segments progressively to the posterior of the body. This process is termed short germ or sequential segmentation, to distinguish it from the long germ mode of segmentation seen in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> where all segments are generated simultaneously by a cascade of genetic interactions taking place in the blastoderm
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Despite considerable effort in recent years, we still understand little of the mechanisms that drive segmentation in sequentially segmenting arthropods. Particular interest has focused on the nature of the so-called &#x0201c;growth zone&#x0201d;, or &#x0201c;segment addition zone&#x0201d;, a region of apparently undifferentiated tissue at the posterior of the embryo from which segments emerge. In all of the short germ arthropods so far examined, homologues of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> pair-rule segmentation genes are expressed in this region, often in rather broad domains around the site of invagination of the proctodeum
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Patterned stripes of gene expression emerge from this posterior domain, through the apparent repression of expression in the interstripe regions. One major concern of this paper is the nature of the patterning process in this posterior region, and in particular, whether dynamic oscillations of gene expression precede segment patterning. Such cyclic gene expression has recently been documented unambiguously in one insect
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], suggesting parallels between segment patterning in short germ insects, and somite patterning in vertebrates
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>In some arthropods (for example, the myriapods <italic>Lithobius</italic> and <italic>Glomeris</italic>, the spider <italic>Cupiennius</italic>), this initial pattern appears to have a single segment periodicity, as defined by the subsequent expression of <italic>engrailed</italic> and other segment polarity genes in register with these primary stripes, and by the appearance of definitive segment morphology shortly afterwards
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In other cases, including several well documented cases in short germ insects (<italic>Tribolium</italic>, <italic>Schistocerca</italic>), the earliest stripes to resolve are at a double segment or &#x0201c;pair-rule&#x0201d; periodicity, just as they are in <italic>Drosophila</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The single segment repeat is then generated either by the subsequent splitting of these stripes, or by the intercalation of secondary stripes between them, before the appearance of definitive segment pattern defined by <italic>engrailed</italic> and segment morphology.</p><p>The geophilomorph centipede <italic>Strigamia maritima</italic> provides a particularly clear example of double segment patterning
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In most short germ arthropods the growth zone contains relatively few cells, and pair-rule stripes resolve to a single segment shortly after they have appeared. In <italic>Strigamia</italic>, a large population of unpatterned cells is generated before segmentation starts, forming a large posterior disc. Within this population, several cycles of the &#x0201c;pair-rule&#x0201d; pattern persist before resolution to the single segment pattern, particularly during the early stages of trunk segment addition. We have previously documented this pattern for homologues of the pair-rule genes, including <italic>even-skipped</italic>, <italic>hairy</italic>, <italic>runt</italic> and <italic>oddskipped</italic>, and also for genes of the Notch signaling pathway - most strikingly, the gene encoding the Notch ligand <italic>Delta</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In all of these cases, the early &#x0201c;pair-rule&#x0201d; patterning of the genes extends as complete rings around a focal point: initially this focus is marked by an area of reduced cell density that we interpret as being the blastopore, based on morphology
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and on gene expression data (Jack Green, unpublished data). Later, the proctodeum will invaginate close to this point, and the pattern becomes centered on the proctodeum. Within the area closest to the center of this pattern, gene expression appears highly variable, even in embryos of similar age. We have proposed
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] that gene expression may be dynamic in this &#x0201c;peri-proctodeal&#x0201d; area, with cells near the proctodeum showing oscillating gene activity, and a pattern emerging through the fixation of a travelling wave of gene expression to give rise to a static pattern of cell states in the transition zone, where the germ band emerges, before a further round of gene interactions defines the single segment pattern.</p><p>However, interpretation of the observed gene expression patterns is complicated by the accompanying movement of cells, as the posterior disc converges to form the germ band, and as anterior parts of the germ band condense towards the head
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It has not previously been clear to what extent patterns of transcript accumulation in the posterior disc and emerging germ band reflect dynamic aspects of gene expression, and to what extent they reflect these cell movements.</p><p>In this paper we document more robustly the evidence for dynamic patterns, using embryos that are staged by independent criteria to different phases of a single cycle of gene activity. We define more precisely the limits of dynamic gene expression, concluding that this is limited to the region within, and including, the first resolved &#x0201c;pair-rule&#x0201d; stripe, but that the movement of the remainder of the pattern is largely the result of cell movement.</p><p>We extend our observations to earlier stages of patterning, when the head segments are being defined. Using the <italic>even-skipped</italic> genes as representative of the pair-rule gene network, and the <italic>Delta</italic> gene as representative of the Notch signaling pathway, we show that both of these pathways are apparently involved in the patterning of all segments from the intercalary back, and that the earliest aspects of segment patterning appear to involve dynamic gene activity qualitatively similar to the patterning of the trunk.</p><p>We also show that the relative timing of double and single segment patterning shifts as more trunk segments are added, until at about the time that the 39<sup>th</sup> segment is patterned, the oscillation that generates double segment periodicity appears to shut off; the last 10 or so segments resolve singly from a domain of ubiquitous and continuous posterior <italic>even-skipped</italic> expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Segmentation in <italic>Strigamia</italic> proceeds from anterior to posterior
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Five segments of the head appear first during stage 3 and then, after a short pause, leg-bearing segments (LBS) appear in sequence, initially at a uniform rate of 1 segment every 3.2&#x000a0;hours until about 39 LBS are visible at the end of stage 4. Thereafter, segments are added much more slowly, with the process pausing completely during the movements of germ band flexure in stage 6. The final leg-bearing segment is not demarcated until shortly before hatching.</p><p>In this paper, we have used the genes <italic>Delta</italic>, <italic>even-skipped</italic> (<italic>eve1</italic> and <italic>eve2</italic>) and <italic>engrailed</italic> to monitor the progress of this molecular patterning. <italic>Delta</italic> is a marker for cell interaction processes that are known to be important in the co-ordination of vertebrate segmentation, as well as in many other developmental processes; <italic>eve</italic> is a member of the primary pair-rule gene set that generates the first periodic, double segment pattern in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. It is also expressed later during <italic>Drosophila</italic> segmentation, with single segment periodicity. <italic>Engrailed</italic> is a widely used marker for the definitive segment pattern. It is expressed in the posterior part of each segment throughout the arthropods.</p><p>In <italic>Strigamia</italic>, both <italic>Delta</italic> and <italic>eve</italic> are expressed with a primary double segment periodicity as concentric rings around the site of invagination of the proctodeum, but out of phase with one another
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. As the segmentation process continues, the appearance of intercalary stripes of <italic>eve1</italic> and <italic>Delta</italic> within the forming germ band defines the single segment repeat (Figures&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), and shortly thereafter, <italic>engrailed</italic> is activated in every segment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A second <italic>even-skipped</italic> gene, <italic>eve2</italic>, is co-expressed with <italic>eve1</italic> during the primary, double segment phase, but is never activated in segmental stripes

This is visible, for example, in the series of embryos presented in Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, where the primary <italic>Delta</italic> expression corresponding to LBS 15 arises as a patch adjacent to the proctodeum, becomes the first ring in slightly older embryos, and is then displaced anteriorly as the next ring resolves behind it.</p><p>In part, this movement results from a condensation of the whole surface epithelium of the egg towards the anterior. This is most obvious in the germ band, as the head extends forward and the first formed segments become relatively smaller (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; see also
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]). However, this movement also affects the territory outside the germ band. This is clear from the expression of a number of markers, including <italic>decapentaplegic</italic> (<italic>dpp</italic>) (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), which is expressed in a double segment pattern that mirrors earlier segmentation markers. This expression persists in the extra-embryonic territory after the resolution of segments in the germ band. The whole pattern can be seen to extend anteriorly in continuity with the morphological segments of the germ band.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Segmentation dynamics of </bold><bold><italic>Delta </italic></bold><bold>across mid-late stage 4.</bold> Flat mounted embryos are aligned from top to bottom according to developmental age <bold>(A, B, C, D)</bold>, indicated on the left by the number of the last formed LBS. During this interval the distance from the stomodeum (red dotted line) to the proctodeum (magenta dotted line) is almost constant. The appearance of new stripes/rings of <italic>Delta</italic> expression and their forward movement is associated with the convergence of the germ band toward the anterior/cephalic region, as shown by black dotted lines marking the 1<sup>st</sup> and the 16<sup>th</sup> leg-bearing segment (LBS). Note, though, that the length of the germ band from the 16<sup>th</sup> to the 35<sup>th</sup> LBS (or the primary stripe that precedes it) is, if anything, expanding during this interval.

It is presumably driven by cell proliferation in the posterior of the embryo, with space for the movement being generated by the continuing condensation of the head and anterior germ band, which continues throughout the period of segment addition.</p><p>However, this condensation of the germ band and surrounding epithelium is clearly not sufficient to account for the very dynamic patterns of gene expression seen in the region immediately around the site of invagination of the proctodeum (Figures&#x000a0;

We here define this region as the &#x0201c;peri-proctodeal region&#x0201d; to distinguish it from the larger area of the posterior disc, or growth zone, which encompasses the whole area of unsegmented tissue posterior to the emergence of segments. We have previously suggested that the appearance of the double segment pre-pattern in this peri-proctodeal region reflects a dynamic process of gene expression akin to that observed in the vertebrate pre-somitic mesoderm

Embryo A (six LBS, intercalated stripe 17 visible), has a relatively well resolved primary ring of <italic>eve1</italic> expression corresponding to LBS 26, but little or no <italic>eve1</italic> expression within this ring, closer to the proctodeum.

These composite images suggest that primary <italic>eve1</italic> ring 26 resolves by the loss of expression from its internal margin, closer to the proctodeum, and by a limited expansion of the outer part of the ring. This expansion will presumably continue as subsequent primary rings appear, but any later expansion must be much slower than the resolution of the primary rings: on the timescale of this series, (and accepting the limitations of these composite embryo montages) there is no perceptible shift in the position of the older rings (for example, ring 24 marked by arrows; see also in Additional file

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>H), in sharp contrast to the alternating expression that characterizes the earlier pair-rule activation of <italic>Delta</italic> and <italic>eve</italic> (for example, Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>C). By the time segment addition has paused at late stage 5, around the 43 LBS stage, <italic>Delta</italic> expression has become restricted to a single apparently stable band just posterior to the last formed segment (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>Q, R) and only one or two <italic>eve</italic> stripes persist after resolution (Figure&#x000a0;

However, the available data make a strong argument that the patterns of expression observed for <italic>even-skipped</italic> and <italic>Delta</italic> reflect repeated cycles of transcription within this whole cell population. It is likely that the similar patterns shown by homologues of the pair rule genes <italic>hairy</italic>, <italic>runt</italic> and <italic>oddskipped</italic> reflect similar dynamic patterns
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] (C. Brena, data not shown).</p><p>This oscillatory activity is apparent during the main phase of trunk segmentation. For <italic>eve2</italic> and <italic>Delta</italic> (at least), each cycle initiates at paired lateral sites adjacent to the proctodeum, once in each double segment cycle. This activation spreads, somewhat unevenly, throughout the majority of the peri-proctodeal area. Transcript is then cleared from the inner part of this area, leaving an ill-defined ring that sharpens and becomes more regular as it expands somewhat further.</p><p>The dynamic nature of this pattern is particularly clear during early stages of the segmentation process, when the primary rings that will give rise to the mouthparts and the most anterior leg-bearing segments are generated. During these earliest cycles, transcription of <italic>eve</italic> is activated throughout almost the entire posterior hemisphere of the egg excepting the area of the blastopore itself, and then cleared from all of this territory except an anterior marginal ring. Given that the cell density remains broadly uniform across the posterior hemisphere of the egg (which at this stage is the multilayered blastoderm
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], it is not feasible that the loss of expression from the posterior territory in each cycle is due to movement of all of these cells into the marginal ring.</p><p>The pacemaker for these oscillations seems to lie at or adjacent to the blastopore throughout the segmentation process. Initially, new cycles of gene expression appear concentrically around the extended blastopore, but as the morphology of the proctodeum develops, the initiation becomes bilateral, with new cycles of expression initiating at foci that appear as two patches lying antero-laterally just outside the proctodeal ring; tissues of the proctodeum itself do not show oscillating gene expression. This posterior territory is already multilayered
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and clearly divided into a number of populations expressing distinct cell markers (data not shown). Oscillatory expression of the pair rule genes is restricted to the outer, ectodermal cell layer
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] at least by the 15 to 20 LBS stage. The observation that this oscillation can be maintained in an embryo that lacks any obvious sign of germ band formation (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A) suggests that axial patterning is distinct from the generation of periodicity that underlies segmentation.</p><p>It appears that gene expression becomes stable in individual cells at or shortly after the time that each ring becomes well resolved. The further slow expansion of this primary pattern reflects tissue movement driven by continuing proliferation of the posterior disc, and convergent extension of the forming segments as the whole egg epithelium condenses anteriorly and cells move into the germ band. However, we cannot at present say precisely where the transition from oscillatory to stable gene expression occurs.</p></sec><sec><title>The prevalence of clock-like segmentation processes in arthropods</title><p>The oscillation of <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>Delta</italic> expression that we infer in <italic>Strigamia</italic> is similar to that recently reported for <italic>odd-skipped</italic> and <italic>eve</italic> in <italic>Tribolium</italic>, by Sarrazin <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and El-Sherif <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. These authors have shown by culturing bisected embryos, by comparing series of closely staged embryos and by tracking cell movements in the posterior of the germ band that the early stripes of <italic>odd-skipped</italic> and <italic>eve</italic> expression are indeed waves of oscillatory gene expression moving across cells. These waves are of double segment periodicity, and move in register but out of phase.</p><p>In no other arthropod has oscillatory gene expression been documented unambiguously, but the phenomenology of gene expression suggests that it exists quite widely. It was first suggested for opisthosomal segment patterning in spiders
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and has been proposed for abdominal segment addition in at least one hemimetabolous short germ insect
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The concentric expression of segmentation genes around the proctodeum in the millipede <italic>Glomeris</italic> appears strikingly similar to what we observe in <italic>Strigamia</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Concentric patterns have been observed, at least for <italic>even-skipped</italic>, in another centipede, <italic>Lithobius</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, in all of these cases the patterns of gene expression define a single segment periodicity, rather than the double segment periodicity observed in <italic>Strigamia</italic> and in <italic>Tribolium</italic>. This raises some question as to the homology of the oscillatory mechanisms that may exist across the arthropods. However, it may be that the processes which generate primary single segmental stripes in <italic>Glomeris</italic>, and perhaps other arthropods, may be homologous to the mechanisms that generate primary pair-rule patterning in <italic>Strigamia</italic>.</p><p>Dynamic oscillation of gene expression also occurs in the pre-somitic mesoderm of vertebrates, where the oscillatory mechanism has been analyzed in some detail
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The precise mechanism of the oscillator appears to vary between species
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], but in all vertebrates examined, the oscillation is of single somite periodicity, and is limited to the mesoderm, whereas in arthropods primary segment patterning involves the ectoderm. In zebrafish (at least) the oscillation seems to be a cell autonomous process, and the role of Notch signaling is to co-ordinate the phase of oscillation between cells
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The extent to which similar mechanisms underlie oscillatory gene expression in vertebrates and arthropods remains to be documented: modeling suggests that it may be rather easy to generate either (or both) spatial and temporal oscillation from gene networks that generate pattern
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Intriguingly, a cell autonomous circuit of pair-rule gene interaction has been described in <italic>Tribolium</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] but this might serve either to generate dynamic behavior, or to ensure that cell states are mutually exclusive once pair-rule periodic expression is established.</p></sec><sec><title>Anterior segment patterning - clock-like or gap-gene based?</title><p>In even the most extreme of short germ insects, the segments of the mouthparts and anterior thorax appear to be patterned from cells generated during cleavage. Most authors have assumed that these segments in all insects are patterned by a gap-like mechanism dependent on localized factors upstream of the pair-rule genes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and we thought it likely that the same would be true in <italic>Strigamia</italic>. We therefore expected to see that the dynamic patterning of <italic>Delta</italic> in association with <italic>eve</italic> would initiate posterior to the first formed segments, approximately at the position of the first leg-bearing segment.</p><p>Our data confirm that segments of the trunk, from the second leg-bearing segment backwards, do appear to be generated by a simple repeat of the same cycle of gene expression states. However, to our surprise, both <italic>Delta</italic> and <italic>eve</italic> show patterns of dynamic expression that initiate at the very onset of segment patterning, and relate to the generation of pattern from the intercalary segment back.</p><p>For <italic>eve</italic>, this early expression takes the form of an initial activation throughout the entire posterior hemisphere of the egg, and then the resolution of stripes within this domain. This is reminiscent of early <italic>eve</italic> expression in insects, the only other arthropods that have been studied at these early stages. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the resolution of stripes within this early domain depends on the regulation of <italic>eve</italic> by gap genes.</p><p>It is possible that for <italic>Strigamia</italic> too, the early resolution of the <italic>eve</italic> pattern depends on upstream &#x0201c;gap like&#x0201d; factors. Gap gene domains themselves may shift dynamically due to gene interactions, and the expression of dependent pair-rule genes then follows them, as has been documented in the dipteran insect <italic>Clogmia albipunctata</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, the observation that the dynamics of <italic>Delta</italic> parallel those of <italic>even-skipped</italic>, even for these very first stripes, and that the whole early pattern appears to move so dynamically across the blastoderm as it resolves, raises the question as to whether the patterning of even the most anterior segments, the intercalary and mouthpart segments, might depend on signaling interactions similar to those inferred for the more posterior trunk segments.</p></sec><sec><title>The origins and significance of pair-rule patterning</title><p>Pair-rule patterning during segmentation was first described in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where the mechanism is relatively well understood. In most other insects studied, at least some homologues of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> pair-rule genes are expressed with a double segment periodicity, although the function of some genes appears to differ between species. No pair-rule expression has been reported for segmentation genes in some short germ insects
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], in the few crustaceans studied
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], or for most segments in spiders
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], though in the latter the most anterior stripes of gene expression are involved in a splitting phase
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. There is one report of pair-rule patterning for a <italic>paired</italic> (Pax3/7) homologue in the prosoma of a mite
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>The pair-rule nature of primary segment patterning in <italic>Strigamia</italic> is very clear. However, no such pair-rule patterning is apparent in the lithobiomorph centipede <italic>Lithobius atkinsoni</italic>, where <italic>even-skipped</italic> expression has been studied in relation to segment polarity marker genes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. There is also no trace of pair-rule patterning during trunk segment patterning in the millipede, <italic>Glomeris marginata</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], although stripe splitting is observed in the head
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Thus, among the myriapods, pair-rule patterning of trunk segments has been observed uniquely in <italic>Strigamia</italic>. It may, therefore, be a feature that has evolved within centipedes, and may prove to be unique to geophilomorphs, or to the single derived lineage leading to geophilomorphs and scolopendromorphs
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], which is the clade of centipedes that shows the highest segment numbers. <italic>Lithobius</italic>, showing single segment addition, lies basal to the origin of this clade.</p></sec><sec><title>The final phase of segment addition - from pair-rule to single segment periodicity</title><p>The transition from double to direct single segment patterning appears to be accompanied by a broad change in the regulatory regime occurring in the unsegmented posterior tissue: <italic>eve1</italic> expression becomes stable, and <italic>eve2</italic> and <italic>Delta</italic> expression are switched off in the posterior tissue at the time of this transition. At least one other transcription factor not previously active during the main phase of segmentation, <italic>knirps</italic>, is switched on. In contrast to the earlier phase of patterning, segmental stripes resolve only in the region of the germ band, and not around the entire periphery of the peri-proctodeal area. There is no indication that the whole tissue is undergoing dynamic cycles of gene expression.</p><p>This final phase of single segment addition undermines the argument we have made previously
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], that pair rule patterning might explain an observed constraint on the number of segments in centipedes. All centipedes have an odd number of pairs of leg-bearing segments as adults and, hence, an even number of trunk segments including the poison claw segment. This constraint is particularly striking for the geophilomorph centipedes, which show great inter- and intra-specific variability in the number of leg-bearing segments, which ranges from 27 to 191
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>This observation is readily explained as a developmental constraint if all trunk segments are generated in pairs. However, if the last segments are generated singly, we can only preserve this explanation by proposing that there is no variation in the number of singly patterned segments, and that the variation available within populations is restricted to the phase of double segment patterning. In this context, it is relevant that <italic>Lithobius</italic>, which appears to make its trunk segments singly
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], belongs to a clade that indeed shows no variation in segment number: all lithobiomorph centipedes have 15 pairs of leg-bearing segments. Invariant segment number is in fact frequent in all major arthropod lineages, particularly among relatively short bodied forms (for example, of no more than 20 segments). Thus it is not unreasonable to propose that, in the long bodied geophilomorphs, the variable generation of segments by pair rule patterning has been imposed on an invariant underlying body plan.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The dynamic appearance of gene expression during segment patterning in <italic>Strigamia</italic> reflects two processes - an intrinsically dynamic process of gene expression in cells around the proctodeum, and the overall movement of cells in the germ band more anteriorly. A pair-rule segmentation oscillator underlies the generation of all anterior trunk segments, and may also be involved in patterning of head segments from the intercalary back. However, there appears to be a transition in the dynamics of segment addition at stage 4.3, such that oscillatory gene expression is suppressed, and the last 10 trunk segments are patterned individually, without a pair-rule pre-pattern. These alternative modes of behavior for the segmentation gene network in one species suggest that the different modes of segmentation observed in different arthropods may evolve rather readily from a largely conserved underlying gene network.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p><italic>Strigamia maritima</italic> eggs were collected, cultured, fixed, stained and photographed as described in
