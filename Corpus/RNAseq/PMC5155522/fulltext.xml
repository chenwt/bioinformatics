The repression of String generates a temporary G2 arrest that synchronizes the cell cycle in the wing epithelium during early pupa wing elongation and flattening. As ecdysone levels decline after the larva-to-puparium pulse during early metamorphosis, Broad expression plummets, allowing String to become re-activated, which promotes rapid G2/M progression and a subsequent synchronized final cell cycle in the wing.

The insect steroid hormone ecdysone is a critical regulator of developmental transitions in hemi- and holometabolous insects, and has long served as a model to study the mechanisms by which steroid hormones control developmental timing (<xref rid="BIO017525C70" ref-type="bibr">Yamanaka et al., 2013</xref>). The ecdysone nuclear hormone receptor signaling pathway is most closely related to the retinoic acid signaling pathway in vertebrates, which also acts a key modulator of cell differentiation in many cell types (<xref rid="BIO017525C8" ref-type="bibr">Breitman et al., 1980</xref>). A pulse of ecdysone signaling occurs during the initiation of metamorphosis at the larva-to-puparium transition (<xref rid="BIO017525C4" ref-type="bibr">Ashburner, 1989</xref>), where extensive changes in proliferation, cell shape, apoptosis and cell adhesion take place. For example, the strong ecdysone pulse at the larva-to-puparium transition leads to activation of apoptotic programs in many larval cell types such as the salivary gland, muscle and midgut (<xref rid="BIO017525C33" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 1997</xref>, <xref rid="BIO017525C34" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; <xref rid="BIO017525C38" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="BIO017525C71" ref-type="bibr">Yin and Thummel, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="BIO017525C74" ref-type="bibr">Zirin et al., 2013</xref>) while in other tissues such as the abdominal histoblasts or dorsal adult progenitor (DAP) cells of trachea, proliferation of adult progenitors is triggered (<xref rid="BIO017525C18" ref-type="bibr">Djabrayan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="BIO017525C48" ref-type="bibr">Ninov et al., 2009</xref>). In the case of abdominal histoblasts, these cells remain quiescent in the G2 phase of the cell cycle during larval development, and are poised to enter mitosis and proliferate when the rate-limiting G2-M cdc25c phosphatase String (Stg) is induced by ecdysone. Normally as a regulator of mitotic entry, Stg itself is not sufficient to drive the entire cell cycle or, therefore, proliferation (<xref rid="BIO017525C46" ref-type="bibr">Neufeld et al., 1998</xref>). However, the dramatic proliferative response in histoblasts to the induction of Stg occurs because these cells accumulate high levels of the G1-S rate-limiting cyclin, Cyclin E (CycE), during the G2 arrest. The accumulation of CycE drives the subsequent G1-S transition, making Stg induction in these cells uniquely sufficient to induce a rapid proliferative response to remodel the abdomen during pupal stages (<xref rid="BIO017525C48" ref-type="bibr">Ninov et al., 2009</xref>). In this manner, the pulse of ecdysone that triggers the larval-puparium transition also induces rapid and sustained cell-type specific changes in cell cycle dynamics.</p><p>In contrast to the abdominal histoblasts, other adult precursors such as the imaginal eye, wing and leg discs exhibit reduced proliferation during the early pupal stages and ultimately become post-mitotic one day after the larva-to-puparium transition (<xref rid="BIO017525C11" ref-type="bibr">Buttitta et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="BIO017525C25" ref-type="bibr">Graves and Schubiger, 1982</xref>; <xref rid="BIO017525C43" ref-type="bibr">Milan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="BIO017525C55" ref-type="bibr">Schubiger and Palka, 1987</xref>). How can we explain the different cell cycle and survival responses of tissues to the same system-wide pulse of hormone? The differential effects of ecdysone on specific cell types has been postulated to be due in part to different ecdysone receptor (EcR) isoform expression (<xref rid="BIO017525C12" ref-type="bibr">Cherbas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="BIO017525C17" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="BIO017525C23" ref-type="bibr">Gautam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="BIO017525C57" ref-type="bibr">Schubiger et al., 2003</xref>). The ecdysone receptor complex is a heterodimer of two nuclear receptors, EcR and Ultraspiracle (USP). Upon binding of the ecdysone ligand to EcR the EcR/USP heterodimer activates or de-represses target gene transcription. The <italic>EcR</italic> gene locus in <italic>Drosophila</italic> encodes 3 isoforms (EcR-A, EcR-B1 and EcR-B2). Each isoform has identical DNA and ligand binding domains but they differ in their N-terminal domains. In the wing, the focus of our study here, EcR-A and EcR-B1 are both expressed in the pouch which gives rise to the future wing blade, but during early metamorphosis EcR-B1 levels drop and the predominant EcR in the wing becomes the EcR-A isoform (<xref rid="BIO017525C57" ref-type="bibr">Schubiger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="BIO017525C67" ref-type="bibr">Talbot et al., 1993</xref>). The EcR-A isoform of the receptor is thought to contain a repressive domain that is absent from the other isoforms, such that in the absence of ecdysone it represses target gene expression, but in the presence of ecdysone, these targets become de-repressed (<xref rid="BIO017525C75" ref-type="bibr">Mouillet, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="BIO017525C58" ref-type="bibr">Schubiger et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast to the wing, the imaginal histoblasts predominantly express EcR-B1 (<xref rid="BIO017525C67" ref-type="bibr">Talbot et al., 1993</xref>), but this changes upon the larval-puparium transition after which histoblasts express both EcR-A and EcR-B1 isoforms (<xref rid="BIO017525C47" ref-type="bibr">Ninov et al., 2007</xref>). While different EcR receptor isoforms may shape some of the differential responses to ecdysone in the imaginal discs versus other tissues, it is becoming clear that many targets for each receptor isoform can also be cell-type specific (<xref rid="BIO017525C63" ref-type="bibr">Stoiber et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have investigated how ecdysone signaling impacts the cell cycle in larval imaginal discs. For example <italic>ecdysoneless</italic> (<italic>ecd</italic>) temperature-sensitive mutants, which severely reduce ecdysone production at the restrictive temperature, exhibit disruption of cell cycle progression in a proliferative region of the developing eye disc, termed the second mitotic wave (SMW). This wave of proliferation is preceded by the front of initial photoreceptor differentiation in the developing eye disc, termed the morphogenetic furrow, which sweeps across the disc from the posterior to anterior during late larval and early prepupal stages. In the SMW of <italic>ecd</italic> mutants, proliferation and expression of the mitotic cyclin, Cyclin B (CycB), is dramatically reduced (<xref rid="BIO017525C9" ref-type="bibr">Brennan et al., 1998</xref>). Consistent with ecdysone signaling promoting proliferation, disruption of the USP component of the ecdysone receptor complex also leads to fewer proliferating cells in the area of the SMW (<xref rid="BIO017525C72" ref-type="bibr">Zelhof et al., 1997</xref>). Ecdysone signaling has also been linked to proliferation in the larval wing imaginal disc. For example, larval wings with suppressed ecdysone signaling contain fewer and smaller cells, in part due to upregulation of the growth suppressor Thor (<xref rid="BIO017525C28" ref-type="bibr">Herboso et al., 2015</xref>). Ecdysone signaling is also required for expression of the zinc-finger transcription factor Crooked legs (Crol), which is required in the larval wing for proper cell proliferation and survival (<xref rid="BIO017525C44" ref-type="bibr">Mitchell et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, ecdysone signaling acts through Crol and Wingless to indirectly regulate CycB levels at the wing margin, an area at the dorso-ventral wing boundary where the cell proliferation pattern is distinct from the rest of the developing future wing blade (<xref rid="BIO017525C45" ref-type="bibr">Mitchell et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, ecdysone signaling impinges on another critical growth, survival and proliferation pathway in the wing, the Hippo signaling pathway (<xref rid="BIO017525C54" ref-type="bibr">Saucedo and Edgar, 2007</xref>). An EcR co-activator Taiman (Tai) binds to the downstream Hippo pathway transcription factor Yorkie, and is also required for normal proliferation in the larval wing pouch (<xref rid="BIO017525C73" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, in the larval stages where wing cells are largely asynchronously proliferating, ecdysone signaling is required to promote proliferation and growth.</p><p>By comparison, the response of the imaginal wing disc to ecdysone during the larval-puparium transition and metamorphosis is quite different. In contrast to the asynchronous proliferation of larval wings, during metamorphosis wings undergo a series of precise temporally regulated cell cycle alterations, followed by a permanent cell cycle exit. In the prepupal wing, a temporary G2 arrest occurs at 4-6&#x02005;h after puparium formation (APF). This G2 arrest is followed by a roughly synchronized final cell cycle between 12-24&#x02005;h APF. Finally, the cells permanently exit the cell cycle at 24&#x02005;h APF (<xref rid="BIO017525C21" ref-type="bibr">Fain and Stevens, 1982</xref>; <xref rid="BIO017525C43" ref-type="bibr">Milan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="BIO017525C49" ref-type="bibr">O'Keefe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="BIO017525C55" ref-type="bibr">Schubiger and Palka, 1987</xref>). A temporary G2 arrest also occurs with similar timing in the leg discs during metamorphosis (<xref rid="BIO017525C25" ref-type="bibr">Graves and Schubiger, 1982</xref>), which subsequently undergo a final cell cycle and ultimately arrest proliferation at the same time as the wings in metamorphosis. These cell cycle alterations coincide with strong systemic pulses of ecdysone, suggesting a role for ecdysone signaling in their regulation. The temporary G2 arrest occurs as ecdysone titers drop following the pulse that triggers the larval-puparium transition, and the final cell cycle arrest occurs during the strong ecdysone pulse that triggers the onset of metamorphosis at 24&#x02005;h APF (<xref rid="BIO017525C4" ref-type="bibr">Ashburner, 1989</xref>).</p><p>A link between ecdysone signaling and the synchronized cell cycle alterations that occur in pupal wings and other appendages is consistent with observations made over 30&#x02005;years ago that 20-hydroxyecdysone (HE) exposure in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissue culture cells can induce a cell cycle arrest in G2 phase (reviewed in <xref rid="BIO017525C19" ref-type="bibr">Echalier, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="BIO017525C62" ref-type="bibr">Stevens et al., 1980</xref>). Even more provocatively, removal of 20-HE from cultured cells after a 3&#x02005;day exposure, which was thought to simulate a long ecdysone pulse, triggered a transient mitotic re-entry, potentially analogous to the final cell cycle observed in imaginal discs after the G2 arrest (<xref rid="BIO017525C6" ref-type="bibr">Besson et al., 1987</xref>). Despite thorough descriptions of these ecdysone-induced cell cycle alterations in cell culture, the mechanisms underlying the response of the cell cycle machinery to ecdysone, and how they might relate to the cell cycle changes observed <italic>in vivo</italic> during wing metamorphosis, have remained largely unknown. Here we reveal a pathway by which ecdysone signaling in the wing can modulate the cell cycle to coordinate cell cycle arrest with the events of cellular differentiation during metamorphosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>20-HE induces cell cycle arrest in G2 phase</title><p>The levels of ecdysone signaling in specific tissues are difficult to manipulate <italic>in vivo</italic> without disrupting other aspects of metamorphosis. We therefore wondered whether <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell culture could be used as a model to examine the effects of ecdysone signaling on the cell cycle during wing metamorphosis. First, we examined the cell cycle arrest induced by 20-HE in a wing disc-derived cell line, Clone 8 (cl-8) (<xref rid="BIO017525C50" ref-type="bibr">Peel and Milner, 1990</xref>). Cl-8 cells arrest proliferation with a G2 DNA content in response to 0.1-1&#x02005;&#x003bc;g&#x000a0;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> HE treatment for 24&#x02005;h (<uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.017525.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</uri>) (<xref rid="BIO017525C15" ref-type="bibr">Cottam and Milner, 1997b</xref>). Unfortunately this cell line had a propensity to clump due to the secretion of cuticle proteins in response to 20-HE (<xref rid="BIO017525C14" ref-type="bibr">Cottam and Milner, 1997a</xref><xref rid="BIO017525C15" ref-type="bibr">,b</xref>), which inhibited acquisition of clean, quantitative cell cycle profiles for cl-8 cells by flow cytometry. We therefore examined the cell cycle response to 20-HE in other cell lines. Treating the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic plasmatocyte-derived cell lines Kc167 (Kc) and S2R+ with 20-HE also induced a G2 cell cycle arrest, similar to what we observe with cl-8 cells (<xref rid="BIO017525C6" ref-type="bibr">Besson et al., 1987</xref>; <xref rid="BIO017525C13" ref-type="bibr">Cherbas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="BIO017525C62" ref-type="bibr">Stevens et al., 1980</xref>).

At time points after 24&#x02005;h of exposure, the cell cycle arrest is sustained and accompanied by cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO017525F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>E, <uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.017525.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</uri>) (<xref rid="BIO017525C6" ref-type="bibr">Besson et al., 1987</xref>). Prolonged exposure to 20-HE beyond 3&#x02005;days selected for a small population of cells that remain rounded and resistant to the cell cycle arrest and cell death. These results are consistent with previous observations that long-term exposure selects for cells that failed to respond, or become non-responsive, to 20-HE (<xref rid="BIO017525C6" ref-type="bibr">Besson et al., 1987</xref>; <xref rid="BIO017525C62" ref-type="bibr">Stevens et al., 1980</xref>).

This is in comparison to over 50% of the mock control, which suggests that roughly one half of cells can re-enter a subsequent cell cycle following a 20-HE-induced G2 arrest and 20-HE removal. Cells exposed to 20-HE continually for 46&#x02005;h also exhibit a low level of EdU incorporation (about 16%), which may be due to a combination of prolonged cell death and arrest over 2&#x02005;days, selecting for a population of cells that failed to arrest initially or cells that lose responsiveness to 20-HE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO017525F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>A,B). Thus, a transient pulse of 20-HE initiates a temporary G2 arrest, followed by re-entry into the cell cycle after 20-HE removal.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>20-HE removal leads to prolonged alterations in cell cycle dynamics</title><p>The proliferation rate of cells after a 20-HE-induced arrest also remains slower than that of mock treated controls, even up to 97&#x02005;h after 20-HE removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO017525F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>C). This could be due to persistent cell death that continues in response to the 20-HE even after removal (<xref rid="BIO017525C6" ref-type="bibr">Besson et al., 1987</xref>), or an alteration of the subsequent cell cycle, such as a prolonged G1 or G1 arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO017525F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>D). To distinguish between these two possibilities, we performed a time course analysis of the cell cycle phase after 20-HE removal. We performed this time course under conditions that reduce the amount of apoptosis in response to 20-HE, by reducing the concentration of 20-HE to 0.5&#x02005;&#x003bc;g&#x000a0;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Under these conditions, as quickly as 8&#x02005;h after 20-HE removal, a substantial fraction of cells have re-entered the cell cycle and proceed through mitosis and into the subsequent G1 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO017525F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>E). By 24&#x02005;h after 20-HE removal many cells are in G1 phase (42%). By 32-48&#x02005;h after 20-HE removal we begin to see an increase in cycling cells in S and G2 phases, but the majority of the population remains in G1 (55%), suggesting a substantially prolonged G1 or a subsequent G1 arrest in a significant portion of the population occurs following 20-HE removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO017525F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>E, quantification in <uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.017525.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S2A</uri>).</p><p>We were surprised to find that few cells were in S or G2 phase 24&#x02005;h after 20-HE removal, considering that our EdU labeling experiment indicated that about half of cells can re-enter the cell cycle and proceed through an S-phase after 20-HE removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO017525F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>A,B). This suggests that a prolonged G1 or G1 arrest may follow cell cycle re-entry after 20-HE removal. To test this hypothesis we performed an EdU pulse chase experiment to follow the cell cycle timing of cells that re-enter S-phase after a pulse of 20-HE. We exposed cells to 20-HE to 0.5&#x02005;&#x003bc;g&#x000a0;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for 36-40&#x02005;h followed by removal. Cells were allowed to recover for 6&#x02005;h, then pulsed with EdU for an hour followed by a chase without EdU or 20-HE for the indicated times. We then assayed the EdU-labeled cells by FACS, starting 4&#x02005;h after the EdU pulse, which is equivalent to 12&#x02005;h after 20-HE removal. At this time, 15.2-23.2% of EdU-labeled cells have progressed from S-phase through mitosis to the subsequent G1 phase. This is in contrast to 3.8% of the mock-treated control, indicating that after 20-HE release the subsequent progression from S-phase to the next G1 proceeds much more rapidly than in mock-treated controls. By 20-23&#x02005;h after 20-HE removal (13-16&#x02005;h post EdU labeling) 60.1-74.0% of 20-HE-pulsed cells have completed mitosis and now exhibit a G1 DNA content, while only 24% have done so in the mock-treated control. Altogether this suggests that after the release from a 20-HE-induced G2 arrest, cells that re-enter the cell cycle exhibit a rapid S/G2/M progression, followed by a subsequent prolonged G1 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO017525F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>D). This is consistent with the large G1 population we observe 24 and 32&#x02005;h after 20-HE removal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO017525F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>E.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Cell cycle changes during wing metamorphosis are similar to those induced by pulsed 20-HE in cell culture</title><p>The pattern of cell cycle changes we observed in cell culture in response to a pulse of 20-HE is highly reminiscent of the cell cycle dynamics in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing blade during early pupal stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO017525F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>A, <xref rid="BIO017525C49" ref-type="bibr">O'Keefe et al., 2012</xref>). The wing blade transitions from a largely asynchronously proliferating tissue in the late third instar larval stage (L3), to a mostly G2-arrested tissue at 6&#x02005;h after the larval-puparium transition (hours after puparium formation or h APF). After the G2 arrest in the wing, a fraction of cells re-enter the cell cycle at 12-18&#x02005;h APF and progress through an additional cell cycle followed by a sustained G1 arrest as the wing becomes quiescent and begins terminal differentiation (<xref rid="BIO017525C43" ref-type="bibr">Milan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="BIO017525C49" ref-type="bibr">O'Keefe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="BIO017525C55" ref-type="bibr">Schubiger and Palka, 1987</xref>). Since the larval-puparium transition is triggered by a pulse of ecdysone (<xref rid="BIO017525C4" ref-type="bibr">Ashburner, 1989</xref>), we wondered whether the temporary G2 arrest at 6&#x02005;h in the wing may be caused by ecdysone signaling at 0&#x02005;h APF, similar to what we observed in cell culture. The EcR-A/USP complex, the predominant ecdysone receptor complex in the wing, has been shown to repress target genes in the absence of ecdysone, and binding of ecdysone to EcR-A is thought to relieve this repression. Therefore, we reasoned that knockdown of all EcR isoforms early in wing development could be used to mimic a precocious ecdysone exposure at 0&#x02005;h APF, similar to previous findings (<xref rid="BIO017525C24" ref-type="bibr">Ghbeish et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="BIO017525C56" ref-type="bibr">Schubiger and Truman, 2000</xref>). To determine whether the G2 arrest in the early pupal wing is due to ecdysone signaling, we knocked down all EcR isoforms by expressing an EcR RNAi in the dorsal wing using <italic>apterous-Gal4</italic>, <italic>UAS</italic>-<italic>GFP</italic>, <italic>Gal80<sup>TS</sup></italic> (<italic>ap-Gal4</italic>) for 24-96&#x02005;h and collected wings at 0&#x02005;h APF. We examined the cell cycle distribution in wings by FACS to determine the relative percentages of cells in G1 and G2 compared to controls without the EcR RNAi. Consistent with the G2 arrest we observe in cell culture, we find that knockdown of EcR in the wing resulted in a significant fraction of cells at 0&#x02005;h APF exhibiting a precocious G2 arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO017525F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>B).

Cell cycle genes showed generally similar behavior during wing metamorphosis with high expression in the proliferating L3 wing and during the final cell cycle at 18&#x02005;h APF, but lower expression during the 6&#x02005;h G2 arrest and very low expression after completion of the final cell cycle at 24 and 36&#x02005;h APF. We observed reduced mRNA expression for many G2/M cell cycle regulators during the G2 arrest at 6&#x02005;h APF including the mitotic <italic>aurora-A</italic> and <italic>polo</italic> kinases, the G2/M cyclin <italic>cyclinB</italic> and the mitotic checkpoint regulators <italic>mad2</italic>, <italic>bub3</italic> and <italic>fizzy</italic>, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of cdc20 (<uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.017525.supplemental">Table&#x000a0;S1</uri>).

Importantly, we also found Broad-Z1 to be specifically enriched in wings at 6&#x02005;h APF by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO017525F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>B) and immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO017525F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>C-E), coincident with the G2 arrest. We also detected total Broad expression in wings using an antibody to the Broad-core region that recognizes all Broad isoforms. We found that other isoforms of Broad, most likely transcripts encoding the Z3 isoform (based on our RNAseq data), are expressed in the larval wing prior to the larval-puparium transition. However, we saw no Broad expression at 27&#x02005;h APF following the largest ecdysone pulse, suggesting ecdysone only induces Broad-Z1 in the early prepupal wing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO017525F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>F-H). Thus, Broad expression, particularly the Z1 isoform, coincides with the ecdysone-induced G2 arrest in early pupal wings.

Ecdysone signaling at the larva-to-puparium transition induces Broad, which in turn represses Stg to generate a temporary G2 arrest, which synchronizes the cell cycle in the wing epithelium. As ecdysone levels decline, Broad expression plummets, allowing Stg to be re-activated resulting in a pulse of cdc2 activity that promotes a rapid G2/M progression during the final cell cycle in the wing. This ultimately culminates in the relatively synchronized cell cycle exit at 24&#x02005;h APF (<xref rid="BIO017525C43" ref-type="bibr">Milan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="BIO017525C55" ref-type="bibr">Schubiger and Palka, 1987</xref>), coinciding with the second large pulse of ecdysone. This second pulse in the pupa activates a different set of transcription factors (not Broad), promoting the acquisition of terminal differentiation characteristics in the wing. In this way, two pulses of ecdysone signaling can both synchronize the final cell cycle by a temporary G2 arrest and coordinate permanent cell cycle exit with the acquisition of terminal differentiation characteristics in the wing.

In the wing, ecdysone relieves EcR/USP repression of Broad, which in turn regulates Stg. The outcome is opposite to that of the recently worked out molecular pathway for G2 progression in the abdominal histoblasts (<xref rid="BIO017525C68" ref-type="bibr">Verma and Cohen, 2015</xref>).

This cell cycle response to a pulse of 20-HE is reminiscent of the cell cycle changes that occur during early metamorphosis in the pupal wings and legs (<xref rid="BIO017525C25" ref-type="bibr">Graves and Schubiger, 1982</xref>; <xref rid="BIO017525C49" ref-type="bibr">O'Keefe et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>It is worth considering why Kc and S2 cells, which are thought to be derived from embryonic hemocytes, would exhibit a similar cell cycle response to 20-HE to the imaginal discs. Relatively little is known about how ecdysone signaling impacts embryonic hemocytes, although recent work suggests that ecdysone signaling induces embryonic hemocyte cell death under sensitized conditions (<xref rid="BIO017525C60" ref-type="bibr">Sopko et al., 2015</xref>). More is known about larval hemocytes, which differentiate into phagocytic macrophages and disperse into the hemolymph during the first 8&#x02005;h of metamorphosis (<xref rid="BIO017525C26" ref-type="bibr">Grigorian et al., 2011</xref>). Ecdysone is involved in this maturation process, as lymph glands of <italic>ecdysoneless</italic> (<italic>ecd</italic>) mutants fail to disperse mature hemocytes and become hypertrophic in the developmentally arrested mutants (<xref rid="BIO017525C61" ref-type="bibr">Sorrentino et al., 2002</xref>). This suggests that the high levels of systemic ecdysone signaling at the larval-puparium transition mediate a switch from proliferation to cell cycle arrest and terminal differentiation for lymph gland hemocytes during metamorphosis. Without ecdysone signaling, hemocytes may continue to proliferate and fail to undergo terminal differentiation leading to the hypertrophic lymph gland phenotype observed. Interestingly, while the loss of <italic>broad</italic> also prevents proper differentiation of hemocytes similar to loss of <italic>ecd</italic>, loss of <italic>broad</italic> does not lead to the hypertrophy observed in <italic>ecd</italic> mutants (<xref rid="BIO017525C61" ref-type="bibr">Sorrentino et al., 2002</xref>). Further studies will be needed to examine whether the ecdysone induced cell cycle arrest in larval hemocytes occurs in the G2 phase, or whether their cell cycle arrest proceeds via a similar pathway to that shown here for the wing.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>The ecdysone receptor is a repressive complex in the wing</title><p>Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the ecdysone receptor complex in the larval wing acts as a repressor for certain early pupa targets and that the binding of ecdysone to the receptor relieves this repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO017525F7">Fig.&#x000a0;7</xref>). For example loss of EcR by RNAi or loss of the EcR dimerization partner USP, de-represses ecdysone target genes that are high in the early pupal wing such as Broad-Z1 and &#x003b2;Ftz-F1 (<xref rid="BIO017525C24" ref-type="bibr">Ghbeish et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="BIO017525C56" ref-type="bibr">Schubiger and Truman, 2000</xref>). The EcR/USP heterodimer also cooperates with the SMRTR co-repressor in the wing to prevent precocious expression of ecdysone target genes such as Broad-Z1 (<xref rid="BIO017525C27" ref-type="bibr">Heck et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis that a repressive EcR/USP complex prevents precocious expression of Broad-Z1 and thereby a precocious G2 arrest, inhibition of SMRTR can also cause a G2 arrest (<xref rid="BIO017525C51" ref-type="bibr">Pile et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, in the context of the early pupal wing, we propose that the significant pulse of ecdysone at the larval-to-puparium transition relieves the inhibition of a repressive receptor complex, leading to Broad-Z1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO017525F7">Fig.&#x000a0;7</xref>). Consistent with this model, high levels of Broad-Z1 in the larval wing lead to precocious neural differentiation at the margin (<xref rid="BIO017525C58" ref-type="bibr">Schubiger et al., 2005</xref>) and in our hands precocious inhibition of <italic>stg</italic> expression in the wing pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO017525F5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>). Interestingly, a switch in Broad isoform expression also occurs during the final cell cycle in the larval eye, such that Broad-Z1 becomes high in cells undergoing their final cell cycle and entering into terminal differentiation (<xref rid="BIO017525C10" ref-type="bibr">Brennan et al., 2001</xref>). However, in this case, Broad-Z1 expression is not associated with a G2 arrest and occurs in an area of high Stg expression, suggesting the downstream Broad-Z1 targets in the eye may be distinct or regulated differently from those in the wing.</p><p>The ecdysone receptor has also been shown to down regulate Wingless expression via the transcription factor Crol at the wing margin, to indirectly promote CycB expression (<xref rid="BIO017525C45" ref-type="bibr">Mitchell et al., 2013</xref>). While a loss of EcR at the margin decreased CycB protein levels, the effects of EcR loss on CycB levels in the wing blade outside of the margin area were not obvious (<xref rid="BIO017525C45" ref-type="bibr">Mitchell et al., 2013</xref>). We suggest that in the wing, the role for EcR outside of the margin acts on the cell cycle via a different mechanism through <italic>stg</italic>.

In addition, we identified known ecdysone targets that are affected differently in the wing during the first larval-to-pupal ecdysone pulse and the second, larger pulse at 24&#x02005;h APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO017525F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>). Ecdysone signaling induces different direct targets with distinct kinetics (<xref rid="BIO017525C36" ref-type="bibr">King-Jones and Thummel, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, specific targets, for example Ftz-F1, can modulate the expression of other ecdysone targets to shape the response to the hormone (<xref rid="BIO017525C37" ref-type="bibr">King-Jones et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, we expect that a pulse of ecdysone signaling leads to sustained effects on gene expression and the cell cycle, even after the ecdysone titer returns to its initial state. These factors together with the differences in the magnitude of the ecdysone pulse may contribute to the differences in the response to the early versus later pulses in the wing.</p><p>Ecdysone signaling can also affect the cell cycle and cell cycle exit via indirect mechanisms such as altering cellular metabolism. This is used to promote cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation in neuroblasts, where a switch toward oxidative phosphorylation leads to progressive reductive divisions (divisions in the absence of growth) leading to reduced neuroblast cell size and eventually terminal differentiation (<xref rid="BIO017525C29" ref-type="bibr">Homem et al., 2014</xref>). Although reductive divisions do occur in the final cell cycle of the pupa wing (<xref rid="BIO017525C1" ref-type="bibr">Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>, our unpublished data), this type of mechanism does not provide a temporary arrest to synchronize the final cell cycle in neuroblasts as we see in wings. Importantly, we do see a striking reduction in the expression of genes involved in protein synthesis and ribosome biogenesis in the wing during metamorphosis, consistent with the lack of cellular growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO017525F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>, <xref rid="BIO017525C49" ref-type="bibr">O'Keefe et al., 2012</xref>). Instead the increased surface area of the pupal wing comes from a flattening, elongation and apical expansion of the cells due to interactions with the extracellular matrix creating tension and influencing cell shape changes (<xref rid="BIO017525C20" ref-type="bibr">Etournay et al., 2015</xref>). This is also consistent with our findings that a significant number of genes associated with protein targeting to the membrane are increased as the wing begins elongation in the early pupa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO017525F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>). Further studies will be needed to determine whether the changes in expression of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and protein targeting to the membrane are controlled by ecdysone signaling, or some other downstream event during early wing metamorphosis.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Tissue-specific responses to ecdysone can mediate opposite effects on the cell cycle through the same target</title><p>Perhaps the most interesting and least understood aspect of steroid hormone signaling is how a diversity of cell-type and tissue-specific responses are generated to an individual hormone. Cell cycle responses to ecdysone signaling are highly cell type specific. For example, abdominal histoblasts, the progenitors of the adult abdominal epidermis, become specified during embryogenesis and remain quiescent in G2 phase during larval stages. During pupal development, the abdominal histoblasts must be triggered to proliferate rapidly by a pulse of ecdysone to quickly replace the dying larval abdominal epidermis. This is in contrast to the behavior of the wing imaginal disc, where epithelial cells undergo asynchronous rapid proliferation during larval stages, but during metamorphosis the cell cycle dynamics become restructured to include a G2 arrest followed by a final cell cycle and entry into a permanently post-mitotic state, in a manner coordinated with tissue morphogenesis and terminal differentiation.</p><p>How does the same system-wide pulse of ecdysone at the larval-to-puparium transition lead to such divergent effects on the cell cycle in adult progenitors? Surprisingly it seems to be through divergent effects on tissue specific pathways that act on the same cell cycle targets. In the abdominal histoblasts the larval-to-puparium pulse of ecdysone triggers cell cycle re-entry and proliferation via indirect activation of Stg (<xref rid="BIO017525C48" ref-type="bibr">Ninov et al., 2009</xref>) by modulating the expression of a microRNA miR-965 that targets Stg (<xref rid="BIO017525C68" ref-type="bibr">Verma and Cohen, 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO017525F7">Fig.&#x000a0;7</xref>). This addition of the microRNA essentially allows ecdysone signaling to act oppositely on the same cell cycle regulatory target as Broad-Z1 does in the wing. Thus, tissue-specific programs of gene regulatory networks can create divergent outcomes from the same system-wide hormonal signal, even when they ultimately act on the same target.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Clone-8 (Cl-8) and S2R+ cells were obtained from the Drosophila Genomics Research Center (DGRC, Bloomington, Indiana, USA).
