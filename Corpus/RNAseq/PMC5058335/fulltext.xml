The establishment and maintenance of memory is governed by structural and functional changes of memory-forming neuronal subpopulations. A hallmark of memory-related structural changes is the strengthening or weakening of existing synapses and the formation of new ones, the so-called &#x02018;synaptic plasticity&#x02019;. These changes are regulated by intracellular signaling cascades that control protein and gene activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref></sup>. Memory-related gene activity changes most probably concur with altered chromatin states, as mutations in chromatin-modifying or chromatin-binding proteins cause learning and memory defects and many neurological and psychiatric diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3&#x02013;6</xref></sup>. These insights are further strengthened by stable and transient memory-related chromatin modification changes in learning genes such as <italic>Reelin</italic>, <italic>Calcineurin</italic>, and <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7&#x02013;10</xref></sup>. So far, studies have primarily used ChIP-qPCR or targeted bisulfite sequencing to scrutinize promoter regions of key memory genes, an approach that is highly sensitive in detecting even small changes but lacks the profound insights into gene-regulatory networks and enhancers that whole-genome techniques could provide. In a nutshell, targeted approaches like ChIP-qPCR yield high precision but very low recall whereas genome-wide approaches like ChIP-seq usually have reduced precision but very good recall.</p><p>In an effort to obtain an unbiased, genome-wide view of chromatin modification changes during short- and long-term memory formation and maintenance we performed ChIP-, MeDIP-, and RNA-seq experiments before and after learning, with brain region and cell type-specifically, for several chromatin modifications in three month old male mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref></sup>. As a learning paradigm we chose the very robust and extremely well characterized contextual fear conditioning (CFC) paradigm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref></sup>. We chose to investigate three time-points that correspond to na&#x000ef;ve mice (no CFC, 0&#x02009;h), short-term memory formation (1&#x02009;h after CFC), and memory maintenance (4&#x02009;w after CFC). On top of the temporal analysis, two brain areas known to be involved in memory formation (hippocampal CA1 region) and memory maintenance (anterior cingulate cortex, ACC) were investigated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref></sup>. From the CA1 and ACC we then extracted nuclei and sorted them into neuronal (NEU) and non-neuronal (NON) populations to very high purity (&#x0003e;95%), using an optimized BiTS-ChIP protocol to gain insights into cell type-specific chromatin modification changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref></sup>. From these cell type-specific nuclei we extracted chromatin for ChIP-seq or DNA for MeDIP-seq experiments using highly-specific, previously validated antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p>We restricted the ChIP-seq experiments to the 1&#x02009;h time-point in the CA1 region, as histone modifications are known to be rather short-lived<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref></sup>. DNA methylation, on the other hand, can be transient or stable and we performed MeDIP-seq analyses in &#x02018;four dimensions&#x02019;, representing the learning paradigms (na&#x000ef;ve&#x02014;N, context&#x02014;C, or context shock&#x02014;CS), the time-point (0&#x02009;h, 1&#x02009;h, 4&#x02009;w), the brain region (CA1, ACC), and the cell type (NEU, NON) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref></sup>. For cell type-specific ChIP- and MeDIP-seq experiments we chose to pool 20 mice per biological replicate since chromatin modification changes were expected to be small, coming from a small population of memory-forming cells. Consequently, the statistical detection of chromatin modification changes required low variance data, which can be obtained by pooling many biological replicates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p>Our aim with this data descriptor is to provide the information to easily confirm and extend our analysis results. To this end, we supply raw and intermediate data and ready-to-use bioinformatics analysis code. Interesting future applications could be integrative analyses of the provided data with various published omics and non-omics datasets. To understand if learning-related genes are preferentially epigenetically altered in brain disease, it would be interesting to compare our data to epigenetic changes in various neurodegenerative diseases, such as a recently published data on Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref></sup>. In order to understand which enzymes are responsible for learning-induced epigenetic changes, published ChIP-seq data of transcription factors and chromatin modifiers in neuronal cell culture and <italic>in vivo</italic> could be analyzed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref></sup>. It could also be very informative to link the observed learning-induced epigenetic network changes to genetic information on &#x02018;cognition genes&#x02019;, highlight commonalities and divergence of memory gene regulatory networks across phyla, and investigate how drugs might affect the signalling pathways that we observed and discuss their potential side-effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p>In summary, this data descriptor provides necessary information, files, and code to reproduce and further analyze learning-related chromatin modification changes, in health and disease.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><p>The methods section includes and extends the information of the original manuscript<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref></sup>. In addition, references to figures, tables and files of the original manuscript will contain the suffix OM (original manuscript) throughout the rest of this data descriptor.</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>Experiment overview and behaviour</title><p>A prerequisite for the proposed study is the use of an established, well characterized, and robust learning model. To investigate the molecular mechanisms governing learning, we make use of the very well defined fear-conditioning paradigm. Classical Pavlovian fear conditioning is one of the most commonly used tests for associative memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref></sup>. In this paradigm mice are trained to associate a novel environment (conditioned stimulus) with an electric foot shock (unconditioned stimulus). The readout for formation of an associative memory is an inborn behavioural response to fear, which is expressed by freezing (no movement). The percentage of the time the animal displays freezing behaviour during context re-exposure correlates with memory strength. This type of contextual fear conditioning (CFC) has been shown to be hippocampus-dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref></sup>. Another relevant area is the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), an area required for long-term memory formation in fear conditioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref></sup>. Importantly, fear conditioning features high penetrance as a single exposure incurs a robust learning response in mice. Additionally, it has a very well defined time-course of immediate early gene expression, granting insight into the timing of primary and secondary transcriptional responses (Supplementary Fig. 1, OM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref></sup>). Lastly, there is ample evidence that epigenetic changes underlie memory formation during fear conditioning, as published among others by the laboratory of David Sweatt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref></sup>. We have established CFC using a fully automated fear conditioning system (Med Associated) connected to a computer and a control unit containing a shock and a tone generator. Animals are allowed to explore the training cage for 3&#x02009;min followed by a mild electric shock (2&#x02009;s, 0.7&#x02009;mA).</p><p>The behavioural analysis was performed with male, 3 month-old mice and only female caretakers conducted the experiments. All mice were acclimatized to housing conditions for 6&#x02013;7 days prior to behavioural analyses. Na&#x000ef;ve, three month-old mice that were not subjected to CFC were used as control (N). Additionally, to separate the associative memory from learning traces associated with the context only, groups of mice were either subjected to the conditioned stimulus only (C) or to the conditioned stimulus and an electric shock (CS).</p><p>Mice were sacrificed 1&#x02009;h (1&#x02009;h) or 4 weeks (4&#x02009;w) after CFC. These time points were chosen to reflect short- and long-term memory formation and maintenance, respectively, and are in accordance with published time-courses of immediate early (IE) gene expression after fear conditioning (Supplementary Fig. 23, OM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref></sup>). To study short-term memory formation and the underlying dynamic epigenetic changes we chose one time point within this window, 60&#x02009;min after CFC. Long-term memory associated epigenetic changes were studied 4 weeks (4&#x02009;w) after CFC.</p><p>Throughout this study, three different cohorts of mice were subjected to CFC:</p><p><list id="l1" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><bold>ChIP- and MeDIP-seq cohort</bold>.

We chose to pool this amount of mice per biological replicate since chromatin modification changes were expected to be small given that they come from a small population of memory-forming cells. As a consequence, detection of chromatin modification changes (from a statistical perspective) required low variance data, which can be obtained by pooling many biological replicates.

After subjecting the ChIP- and MeDIP-seq mouse cohort to CFC (see above), the animals were sacrificed 1&#x02009;h or 4 weeks later and the CA1 and ACC regions were isolated for subsequent nuclear sorting and chromatin and DNA extraction. Whereas MeDIP-seq analyses were conducted for all time-points and regions, ChIP-seq experiments were restricted to cellular consolidation (CA1 1&#x02009;h). This decision has two main reasons. First, HPTM (histone post-translational modification) changes are reported to occur shortly after CFC (1&#x02013;3&#x02009;h) but are rather short-lived<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref></sup>. Second, we did not detect many region-specific changes even during cellular consolidation, which led us to concentrate on the more prominent DNAme (DNA methylation) changes during systems consolidation (ACC 1&#x02009;h) and memory maintenance (4&#x02009;w).</p></list-item><list-item><p>In addition to ChIP- and MeDIP-seq experiments, chromatin from this cohort was also used for immunoblot (IB) analyses as shown in Supplementary Fig. 15 OM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref></sup>.</p></list-item></list></p><p><list id="l2" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><bold>RNA-seq cohort.</bold> For RNA-seq experiments, 5 mice per biological condition were used (5 groups, 1&#x000d7;N, 2&#x000d7;C, 2&#x000d7;CS). In contrast to the ChIP- and MeDIP-seq cohort, the tissue for the RNA-seq experiments was not pooled and not subjected to cell type-specific sorting. In brief, after the RNA-seq cohort was subjected to CFC, the animals were sacrificed either 1&#x02009;h or 4 weeks later, and the RNA from the CA1 and the ACC regions was extracted.

All experiments were performed in the accordance with the animal protection law and were approved by the District Government of Niedersachsen (Lower Saxony), Germany. To study learning and memory processes the CFC paradigm was employed with the exception that animals were not subjected to the &#x02018;test&#x02019; phase after training. All experiments were conducted in the morning. For training, animals were allowed to explore the context either for 180&#x02009;s (group: Context&#x02014;C) or 178&#x02009;s followed by a 2&#x02009;s constant 0.7&#x02009;mA mild foot shock (group: Context Shock&#x02014;CS) and later were housed back in cages. One group of C and CS (40 animals each) were trained and sacrificed after 1&#x02009;h, while another group of C and CS (40 animals each) were sacrificed after 4 weeks of training. Animals that did not undergo CFC were used as na&#x000ef;ve controls (N, 40 animals). To measure the performance of the learning paradigm, an additional group of mice was trained and tested for memory retrieval 30&#x02009;min, 24&#x02009;h, and 4 weeks after context (C) or context shock (CS) exposure (10, 14 and 10 mice per condition, respectively) (see Data Record 1).

Two brain regions implicated in the short- and long-term memory phases of associative learning were dissected and frozen immediately.

The nuclei were washed 4 times with PBS-T and stained for 15&#x02009;min with anti-mouse Alexa 488 (Life Technologies) diluted 1:1000. The nuclei were washed once with PBS-T and stored in PBS-T with 5% BSA until the sorting. After dissociation by passing the samples through a 26&#x02009;G needle 10 times, the nuclei were filtered (70&#x02009;&#x003bc;m) right before sorting on a FACS Aria II (BD Bioscience) into ice-cold conical tubes containing 1&#x02009;ml of 5% BSA in PBS. The &#x02018;gate settings&#x02019; for sorting were based on the size and density of unstained nuclei and both NeuN stained (NeuN+) and unstained (NeuN&#x02212;) fractions were collected. The average purity of the sorted nuclei exceeded 95%, yielding highly cell type-specific material. After nuclei staining and sorting, a small aliquot was stained with DAPI (1:20.000 in PBS) and mounted on a slide to be imaged using a confocal microscope. A control with unsorted nuclei was also included.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>ChIP-seq</title><p>Following the extraction of chromatin, ChIP- or MeDIP-seq experiments were performed.

In order to calculate the average signal over multiple regions of different length, each region is fit to a predefined length by either compressing (for long regions) or extending (for short regions) the available read information (spline interpolation). A moving window (MW) of width 5 was used to smooth the average profiles and 1% of extreme values were trimmed on both ends.</p><p>In addition to gene plots, we used aggregate plots on CRMs and on intergenic regions.

We used aggregate plots to study known cell-type specific genes, global learning-induced HPTM and DNA methylation changes in genes, CRMs, or intergenic regions, on genes classified according to their expression level, and on genes that are differentially expressed upon CFC.

Precision and recall of each chromatin marker was estimated by measuring the predictive power of our data by comparing the enrichment of a certain mark in all cell type-specific genes. To this end, read counts on transcriptional start sites (H3K4me3 and H3K27ac) or gene bodies (H3K79me3, H3K4me1, H3K27me3, and DNAme) were compared using DEseq2(v1.4.5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref></sup>. For promoter/TSS specific markers, the reads in a 3,000 bases window around the TSS (&#x02212;1500 to +1500) were used.

For active chromatin modifications (H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and H3K79me3), genes with significant (FDR&#x0003c;0.05) positive fold changes (neuronal reads&#x0003e;non-neuronal reads) were annotated as neuronal genes and genes showing significant negative fold changes (neuronal reads&#x0003c;non-neuronal reads) were annotated as non-neuronal genes. Thereby, a significant positive fold change in a known neuron-specific gene was considered a TP. A significant positive fold change in an annotated non-neuron-specific gene was considered a FP. A significant negative fold change in an annotated non-neuron-specific gene, and genes with no significant changes, were considered TN (true negatives) using neuronal data. A similar approach was taken to calculate the precision and recall of non-neuron-specific genes. In the case of repressive chromatin modifications (H3K27me3 and DNAme) the opposite correlation was expected.</p><p>It is important to note that the histone modification H3K9ac was not included in precision and recall calculations as it was added to the study relatively late. For the same reason, this modification was also not included in the novel prediction of genes and CRMs.</p><p>Finally, the precision and the recall for neurons and non-neuronal cells in CA1 and ACC were calculated using na&#x000ef;ve samples that were not exposed to CFC.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Prediction of novel cell-type specifically expressed genes</title><p>Given the predictive power of the individual chromatin modifications, especially of histone modifications, cell-type specific gene expression was predicted genome-wide from na&#x000ef;ve neuronal and non-neuronal data of the CA1 and ACC. These predictions are not exclusive, meaning that genes are preferentially expressed in one cell type over the other but are not exclusively expressed in one cell-type. DNA methylation was not used due to its low classification performance and H3K9ac was left out of the analysis because it was included relatively late into the study.</p><p>For the comparison of neuronal and non-neuronal data for each chromatin modification a matrix with the read counts for TSSs or gene bodies was created. Subsequently, DEseq2(v1.4.5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref></sup> was used to identify statistically significant differential coverage between neuronal and non-neuronal signal. The region around the TSS (&#x02212;1500, +1500) was used to compare H3K27ac and H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data, and the full gene body was used for H3K79me3, H3K27me3 and H3K4me1.The results were filtered for an FDR&#x0003c;0.05, a |logFC|&#x0003e;1, and a mean coverage &#x0003e;50. For all comparisons neuronal data was considered as treatment and non-neuronal data as control. Consequently, a positive fold change for activity-related modifications indicates increased gene activity in neurons.</p><p>To assess cell type-specificity we used a heuristic best-out-of-three classifier. Considering all combinations of chromatin modifications the best-out-of-three classifier performed best on a set of known cell type-specific genes that we compiled. For this classifier, genes have to have three out of five chromatin modifications significantly increasing in order to be predicted as cell-type specific genes. It should be noted that better performance values could most probably be obtained with machine learning classifiers (see section CRM prediction).</p><p>To be classified as neuronal gene (meaning more active in neurons than in non-neurons), at least three chromatin modifications have to show statistically significant enrichment (or depletion for H3K27me3) in neuronal data as compared to non-neuronal data. Furthermore, the residual two chromatin modifications should not show enrichment in non-neuronal data. The same procedure was applied to determine non-neuronal active genes.

Subsequently, H3K27ac and H3K4me1 peaks in close genomic proximity (&#x0003c;1000 bases) were merged, obtaining a total of 30,700 chromatin modification-enriched regions.

Promoter regions are a special case of negative regions in that they are defined by the presence of very high H3K27ac and H3K4me1 modifications, whereas regular negative regions have little to no signal. Since promoter regions are relatively scarce throughout the genome we chose to increase their proportion in the random dataset by adding 10% of known promoter regions.

Given a CRM resides inside of a gene, the gene substructure can be annotated, such as 5&#x02032;-UTR, exon, intron, 3&#x02032;-UTR.

For HPTMs that do not reside at predefined genomic positions, such as H3K27ac and H3K4me1, MACS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">ref. 45</xref>) (v.2.0.10.20131028 tag: beta) was used to call peaks from merged BAM files, using parameters shiftsize=FS/2 and q=0.01, where FS is the fragment size estimated by the in-house &#x02018;chequeR&#x02019; package (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3487679">https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3487679</ext-link>), which can estimate fragment sizes based on uniquely mappable regions and genomically informative regions (e.g., transcription start site regions).</p><p>DEseq2 (v1.4.5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref></sup> was applied to identify the differential coverage comparing na&#x000ef;ve to context only (N-C), na&#x000ef;ve to context shock (N-CS), or context to context shock (C-CS) samples of all annotated mouse Ensembl genes and MACS2 peaks. Regions were required to contain at least 2 reads per 50&#x02009;bp in a given TSS, gene body or MACS2 peak when averaging over samples of each condition. Due to the reduction in the number of genes/peaks that have to be statistically evaluated, the multiple-testing burden is decreased, resulting in lower <italic>P</italic>-values for the analysed genes. Lastly, we only considered HPTM changes with an adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value&#x0003c;0.1 and we did not apply any fold-change thresholds. These settings are rather lenient allowing for the detection of small changes while not detecting too much noise due to low coverage variation. It is important to note again that small changes were expected as only a fraction of the cells analysed would partake in the formation of memory (see also main text, OM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref></sup>).</p><p>Differential HPTMs (DHPTMs) for called peaks (H3K4me1 and H3K27ac) were associated with their surrounding genomic context.

This package contains many functions to evaluate the quality of the data (MEDIPS.correlation and MEDIPS.saturation were used) and to identify DMRs between two different conditions. MEDIPS identifies DMRs by binning the genome with a fixed window size and identifying positions with significantly different number of reads.</p><p>In order to obtain optimal results, two MEDIPS parameters need to be adjusted: the window size and the minimum number of reads per window. Whereas big windows generate broad methylated regions by increasing the chance of merging neighbouring peaks, small windows might fail to identify large methylated regions. Thus, whereas small windows increase resolution they carry the heavy burden of a large multiple-testing adjustment, as MEDIPS tests every genomic region for differential enrichment. Similarly, only regions with a reasonable number of reads should be analysed to alleviate the multiple-testing burden.</p><p>When optimising the window size and read number for all possible C-CS comparisons we were unable to detect a single best set of values that would optimize the DMR number for all comparisons. Therefore, we selected average values that performed best overall conditions. Moreover, the MEDIPS parameter 'uniq' was set to &#x02018;true&#x02019; in order to discard PCR duplicates.</p><p>Finally and importantly, we first thought of using a false-discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1 for all comparisons in order to detect small methylation changes, as only a subset of cells was expected to represent a network correlate of memory and therefore change their methylation. Surprisingly, the number of DMRs in N-C and N-CS comparisons was high so that we decided to reduce the <italic>P</italic>-value to 0.05 for these comparisons. Consequently, DMRs for N-C and N-CS comparisons have an adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value&#x0003c;0.05 whereas C-CS DMRs have an adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value&#x0003c;0.1.</p><sec disp-level="3"><title>DMR details</title><p>For MeDIP-seq analyses, the MEDIPS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref></sup> package (v1.16.0) was used.

For each window size, minimum read numbers ranging from 1% of the window length to 15% of the window length were tested (e.g., for window size 100 and a 1% minimum read number at least 1 read has to be found). It was noticed that the optimum curve shows notable changes in number of DMRs depending on the analysed sample (data not shown). We found the optimum (highest number of significant DMRs) window size between 500 and 800 bases with read filtering values around 4&#x02013;6%. A window size of 700 bases and 5% minimum read filtering were chosen for all comparisons. Reads were extended by 250 bases ('extend'=250). DMRs were filtered by FDR&#x0003c;0.05 in all N-C and N-CS comparisons and by FDR &#x0003c;0.1 in all C-CS comparisons.

This is almost always a balance between expected biological and technical variation within groups versus the money and amount of specimen available. Given unlimited biological material and money the choice is simple, the more the better because statistical inferences become more robust. Unfortunately, data and resources are limited so one needs to rely on statistical approaches on how to choose an &#x02018;optimal&#x02019; experimental design. However, how do you validate statistical considerations such as sample size?</p><p>In our specific case we had to estimate what expected benefit pooling would yield. Although the mathematical model of pooling was described in the section &#x02018;Experiment overview and behaviour&#x02019;, we went a step further and validated the statistical considerations with a pooling simulation for count data and the effect it has on the calling of differentially occupied/expressed genomic loci as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>.</p><p>For this analysis we used small RNA-seq data given that several studies exist in the literature that analyse over 20 biological replicates; in contrast, we were unable to find a single published ChIP- or MeDIP-seq dataset with more than three biological replicates. In brief, small-RNA sequencing from psoriasis and Alzheimer data (Data Citation 11 and Data Citation 12, respectively) where subsampled with different numbers of replicates for both control and treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). Boxplots with white background show precision (blue), recall (red), and F-scores (green) for single replicates randomly chosen from the total set of replicates. Boxplots with blue background show precision, recall, and F-scores for in silico pooled samples. In order to pool samples in silico, reads of true biological replicates were sampled randomly and merged into a single pooled sample. The total number of randomly sampled reads for the pooled sample was equal to the average number of reads from the single replicate input samples. This resulted in the pooling of 5 individual replicates per biological pooled replicate for the Psoriasis data and 20 (10) for the Alzheimer data (20 for the AD and 10 for the control cases).</p><p>For the psoriasis data, the precision/recall (a) and F-score (b) for 2 pooled replicates is comparable to that of 5&#x02013;6 single replicates. For the Alzheimer data, precision/recall (c) and F-score (d) for 2 pooled replicates is comparable to 6&#x02013;8 single replicates. These simulation results strongly suggest that pooling of samples reduces the variability and increases the power to detect statistically significant changes in count-based NGS experiments, further validating our statistical considerations and experimental setup. We believe that this kind of analysis is simple to perform and can be a very helpful technical validation of study design.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Behavioural experiments</title><p>All analysis results and interpretations rely on the assumption that mice that were exposed to the learning paradigm did actually form a memory. We should remark that this is only an assumption, given that individual mice, just as humans, tend to behave and learn quite differently. In order to confirm that the chosen learning paradigm (CFC) induces a robust and long-lasting memory, 40 mice were tested for freezing behaviour 4 weeks after CFC exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). Mice that were only exposed to the novel environment (C) should show no increased freezing, whereas mice that were exposed to the novel environment paired with a shock (CS) should show increased freezing behaviour. In all tested cases, the CFC protocol resulted in robust learning, as all CS-exposed mice showed increased freezing behaviour 4 weeks after learning.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Tissue-and cell type-specificity</title><p>To validate that the brain regions that were dissected really corresponded to the hippocampal CA1 and the cortical ACC regions we performed qPCR on region specific marker genes, specifically of Lphn2 (CA1), Bok (CA3) and Hkdc1 (ACC). Given that CA3 and CA1 are in close proximity and their tissues may have been accidentally mixed, the CA3 region was used as a negative PCR control to verify the purity of the CA1 region. Average fold-change values for six mice showed clear specificity for all regions, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 4 OM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p>The purity of cell type-specific sorting (BiTS-ChIP/-MeDIP protocol) was confirmed by re-sorting of samples and visual inspection under a microscope of stained specimen.

This is especially true for deep sequencing approaches that involve many processing steps at different levels. This paragraph will highlight the steps that we take on a routine basis to assess our sequenced datasets. As a first step, ChIP-, MeDIP-, and RNA-seq data was subjected to an in-house quality control workflow. In brief, sequencing data was analysed for general read quality, genome alignment, average per base coverage, read saturation, replicate correlation, enrichment, and was visually inspected in a genome browser at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://memory-epigenome-browser.dzne.de">http://memory-epigenome-browser.dzne.de</ext-link>.

Read duplication events were analysed to exclude samples with high PCR bias. The percentage of high quality aligned and uniquely aligned reads was used to estimate possible sequencing biases or contamination. Furthermore, we assessed if samples were sequenced deep enough (number of total reads) by analysing the average per base coverage and the saturation correlation for all samples. To estimate the variance between biological replicates the Pearson correlation was calculated. Principle component analysis (PCA) was performed to assure that samples cluster into their respective biological groups (e.g., for chromatin modification, cell type, brain region) (Supplementary Fig. 3, OM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref></sup>). ChIP-seq peak enrichment was assessed by calculating normalized strand cross correlation (NSC) and relative strand cross correlation (RSC) coefficients using the in-house R package &#x02018;chequeR&#x02019;. In general, good quality libraries have an <italic>NSC&#x0003e;1.05</italic> and an <italic>RSC&#x0003e;0.8</italic> although these values also depend on the analysed modification or histone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref></sup>.

Finally, ChIP and MeDIP (differential) enrichment was assessed by qPCR to validate the integrity of sequencing libraries and corroborate statistically significant differences. The data was analysed using pyQPCR (section &#x02018;Quantitative PCR&#x02019;) with absolute quantification using dilution of inputs as standard samples. An overview of the general data quality can be found in Supplementary Table 3 OM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref></sup>, containing read quality, alignment, saturation, correlation, and enrichment information.</p><sec disp-level="3"><title>Quality control details</title><p>Read quality was assessed using fastqc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref></sup> (v0.10.1) and alignment was analysed using samtools flagstat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref></sup> (v0.1.18) with default parameters. To calculate the saturation and correlation of ChIP-seq and MeDIP-seq samples the MEDIPS R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref></sup> was used. The saturation function splits each library in fractions of the initial number of reads (10 subsets of equal size) and plots the convergence. The correlation between biological replicates was evaluated using Pearson correlation (function MEDIPS.correlation). By using MEDIPS R objects for all samples, the principal components were plotted based on the read density distribution of each sample.

The ACC and CA1 brain regions are then taken from each mouse. For samples that would be used for RNA-sequencing, each tissue sample is used to produce one replicate, resulting in 5 replicates for each combination of condition, time-point and tissue. For samples that would be sequenced with ChIP- and MeDIP-seq, 20 tissue samples are pooled for each tissue to generate two replicates, and the cells within the tissues are sorted by their type (neuronal-NEU or non-neuronal, -NON). <italic>Right</italic>; computational analysis used to process the ChIP-, MeDIP- and RNA-seq data.
