It evolved to optimize seed survival by avoiding germination under non-optimal environmental conditions. Depth and duration of dormancy are largely regulated by genetic and environmental factors, with temperature during seed development having a major role in determining dormancy acquisition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Many crop plants exhibit weak dormancy as a result of the selection for rapid and uniform germination to maximize synchronization of crop production. In many instances this has led to seeds that are prone to pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) following wet and cool conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In cereals such as bread wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.), PHS can cause large economic losses exceeding $US1 billion per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] due to adverse effects on grain quality and yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. As a result, identification of genes controlling cereal grain dormancy has become a major goal for breeders to eliminate the incidence of PHS in modern wheat cultivars. The introgression of dormancy-related quantitative trait loci (QTL) into commercial varieties still remains the principal strategy to provide protection against this major agronomic problem. Such QTL have been previously identified in wheat (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]). Some are specific to populations whilst others have been identified across multiple populations, including the major QTL which is located on chromosome 4AL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This QTL can explain up to 40&#x000a0;% of the dormancy variability in some populations and, although it has been a major target for scientists and breeders over the past decade, its genetic nature has remained unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>The identification and mapping of QTL at high resolution has been accelerated by recent advances in the generation of genetic resources like Multi-parent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC) populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Similarly, next-generation sequencing technologies have led to an explosion in the amount of data available for gene identification projects. For example, since the release of the rice draft genome in 2000, the number of cloned QTL in this crop has increased exponentially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, significant challenges remain for identifying the genetic variants underlying QTL in crops that have large, polyploid and poorly sequenced genomes. Here, we present an approach that combines the use of a MAGIC population with RNA-sequencing to rapidly fine-map and identify candidate genes underlying QTL in wheat. The most powerful aspect of this approach is the ability to exploit the contrast between the multiple alleles carried by the MAGIC parents, which enables accurate detection of QTL-linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and of differential gene expression within a QTL region.</p><p>We have utilized a four-parent MAGIC population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] to identify grain dormancy QTL in multiple environments. We report on the genetic analysis of the major QTL located on chromosome 4AL. Several heterogeneous inbred families (HIFs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] were generated from the mapping population, and used to develop multiple near-isogenic lines (NILs) to validate the QTL within each genetic background and for gene expression analysis during grain development. This method enabled the identification of two adjacent closely related candidate genes that displayed sequence and/or expression changes associated with the dormancy phenotype of the NILs. Those genes, which we called <italic>PM19-A1</italic> and <italic>A2</italic>, encode proteins of the abscisic acid (ABA)-induced Wheat Plasma Membrane 19 (AWPM19) family. The first one was highly expressed in dormant lines while the second had several sequence changes. We demonstrated that the expression of <italic>PM19-A1</italic> and <italic>A2</italic> is suppressed by high temperatures during grain maturation, an environmental condition that suppresses grain dormancy. Finally, by generating transgenic plants with altered <italic>PM19</italic> expression, we confirmed that these genes are positive regulators of grain dormancy in wheat.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Quantitative trait loci mapping using a wheat MAGIC population</title><p>A MAGIC population was developed by intercrossing four wheat varieties, Yitpi, Chara, Baxter and Westonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and was used for mapping grain dormancy QTL. The population was used across three environments, one in glasshouse conditions in 2009 and the two other in the field in 2009 and 2010. Dormancy was measured by calculating the Germination Index (GI) of grain harvested at maturity (see Materials and methods). The grain harvested in 2009 was scored for dormancy under two different conditions, continuous light or darkness. This difference in conditions allowed us to better capture the dormancy phenotype of our material. In darkness grain dormancy is manifested with less strength than under light, so grain that retains high dormancy will show moderate GI in darkness but very low GI under light. On the contrary, grain that retains low dormancy will show a moderate GI under light but will show very high GI in darkness. For example, the grain harvested in 2010 was only scored in continuous light because even under that condition dormancy was low in comparison with previous screenings. Histograms of the GI for the five dormancy screenings are given in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and the mean GI for the parental lines for each screening can be found in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>. A linkage map was generated based on previously published Infinium iSelect SNP assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and utilized for QTL detection. Heritability across all site/year combinations ranged from 0.11 to 0.56 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). In total, 54 QTL were identified across all datasets (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) that, based on their map locations and the pattern of effect sizes from each of the four founders, could represent 39 unique QTL (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Location, size and founder effects of QTL for grain dormancy.

Five F<sub>7</sub> RILs from the mapping population were chosen as founders of HIFs on the basis of being heterozygote for the <italic>4A-1</italic> QTL region (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), while maximizing homozygosity for the background genome (about 97&#x000a0;% homozygosis). From them, five F<sub>8</sub> HIFs were obtained by self-pollination and were phenotyped and genotyped. In every HIF, homozygote individuals for the Yitpi allele showed low GI while homozygous for the other alleles showed high GI. Heterozygous individuals showed intermediate GI values in at least four out of the five HIFs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). From each HIF, homozygous individuals with contrasting QTL effects were selected and self-pollinated to generate five F<sub>9</sub> sets of NILs. Those NILs were finally grown together with the four parent varieties, and grain samples collected at 15, 25 and 35&#x000a0;days post-anthesis (DPA). RNA was isolated from those samples and pooled together in two groups, one containing all samples coming from NILs carrying the QTL (pool A) and the other containing all samples coming from NILs without the QTL (pool B). Samples collected from the four parents at the same DPA were also included in the corresponding RNA pool. This innovative pooling approach allowed us to distinguish a real signal coming from the targeted selected region (segregating equally in each set of NILs) while background noise coming from the rest of the genome is neutralized (different in every set of NILs).</p><p>Using the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) flow-sorted Chromosome Survey Sequence (CSS) contigs of Chinese Spring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] as a reference, the pooled sequence reads were mapped as described in Materials and methods. Differential expression analysis based on mapped reads identified a total of 39 differentially expressed CSS contigs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>A), four of them on the 4AL chromosome. Only one of them, Chr4AL_7123764, was within the <italic>4A-1</italic> QTL region (CSS contigs were mapped to the QTL region by directly aligning them against the physical QTL supercontig sequence described below in the &#x02018;Physical mapping&#x02019; section) and that contig was ranked first based on statistical significance. Furthermore, SNP analysis between the two pools identified thirteen SNPs in seven CSS contigs, all on chromosome 4AL (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). In three of those contigs the SNPs caused an amino acid change in an annotated gene (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>), and only two of them were mapped to the QTL region: Chr4AL_7123764 (which was also differently expressed) and Chr4AL_7174272. Both of these contigs contained a gene that belonged to the same family and these were chosen as the best candidates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Description of the candidate genes <italic>PM19-A1</italic> and <italic>A2</italic></title><p>Chr4AL_7123764 contained a single gene with similarity to a gene encoding the AWPM19 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], which we named <italic>PM19-A1</italic>.

We also screened the BAC library using primers from a conserved <italic>PM19</italic> region in order to identify BACs carrying <italic>PM19</italic> genes. Seven BACs (see Materials and methods) were identified as positive for one of several of our markers. Those BACs were sequenced and assembled into three supercontigs (see Materials and methods). Each one spanned multiple mapped CSS contigs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>) which were used to assign the supercontigs to the chromosomes 4AL, 5BL and 5DL. BLAST-based searches identified several genes within each supercontig (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). In the supercontig mapped to chromosome 4AL, we found the gene <italic>PM19-A1</italic> next to <italic>PM19-A2</italic>. In addition, we identified genes encoding a myosin, an ACC-like oxidase, a Yucca protein, a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme and a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase, all of which were expressed at low levels in our transcriptomic data and none of which were found differentially expressed or with polymorphisms causing amino acid changes. The markers that flanked the interval with the highest probability to contain the <italic>4A-1</italic> QTL were found inside the 4AL supercontig for which we have the whole physical sequence (the marker wsnp_Ex_c66324_64493429 is in the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase and the marker CD920298 is in <italic>PM19-A2</italic>).</p><p>In the 5BL supercontig two <italic>PM19</italic> genes were found (named <italic>PM19-B1</italic> and <italic>B2</italic>) along with genes encoding a myosin and an ACC-like oxidase.

The presence of almost the same pattern of genes in the three supercontigs indicates that they are homeologous regions.

A QTL in the same region has been previously reported in other bi-parental populations as a major source of dormancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. We utilized an allelic series of HIFs chosen so that historical recombinants were tiled across the target <italic>4A-1</italic> QTL site. These HIFs were used to develop five independent sets of NILs that were analyzed in an innovative transcriptomic pool comparison to identify SNPs and differentially expressed sequences in the QTL region. A similar multi-NIL transcriptomic approach has been suggested previously as a method for detecting candidate genes for QTL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], but to our knowledge this is the first attempt to use it successfully. Our NILs are derived from a MAGIC population, and consequently a greater number of alleles are segregating at any given locus, which allows a more robust contrast analysis. This pipeline revealed <italic>PM19-A1</italic>, a newly identified gene whose high expression during late grain maturation is associated with the dormant genotypes. We also identified a second gene, <italic>PM19-A2</italic>, which showed changes in sequence between the genotypes segregating for the QTL. In addition we identified several differentially expressed genes that did not map to the QTL region but to other locations. Those could be part of the downstream transcriptional response of the targeted QTL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and their putative functions are being investigated.</p><p>Two allelic variants for <italic>PM19-A1</italic> and <italic>A2</italic> were identified in the founders of our mapping population. In each case, the dormant allele differed from those of the other three founders. Several polymorphisms were found in each gene and we observed an intermediate dormancy phenotype in the heterozygous individuals from the HIFs, which demonstrates the semi-dominant inheritance of this QTL. A reduction in dormancy in independent transgenic lines having reduced <italic>PM19</italic> expression directly links the dormancy phenotype with the activity of these genes. In the temperature study, we found differences in expression of <italic>PM19-A1</italic> and these were highly correlated with the loss of dormancy with increasing temperature. These results support that <italic>PM19-A1</italic> expression could explain the QTL and we propose that the deletion in the promoter of <italic>PM19-A1</italic> is the most likely cause of the expression variation observed. This deletion affects the spacing between two ABRE motifs and two CE3 motifs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), which are well-characterized motifs involved in responsiveness to ABA, a key dormancy-promoting factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The spacing between those motifs is critical for ABA responsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Analysis of a panel of wheat varieties showed that the <italic>PM19-A1</italic> expression profiles observed in the parental lines of our mapping population were also found across genetically diverse varieties. The two wheat lines carrying a 4A chromosome from durum (Bellaroi and AUS29638) had high expression (Yitpi-like) of <italic>PM19-A1</italic>, suggesting the expression pattern predates the formation of hexaploid bread wheat about 10,000&#x000a0;years ago. All the other varieties tested that had the Yitpi promoter haplotype also displayed high <italic>PM19-A1</italic> expression. The six varieties tested that had Chara-like promoters all had low gene expression. Interestingly, the existence of the low-expression promoter in Australian wheat varieties also hints that the non-dormant-type allele may have previously been a target of positive selection during domestication, although this remains to be tested. In relation to <italic>PM19-A2</italic>, we found that the 12-bp deletion in the coding region was always completely linked to the <italic>PM19-A1</italic> 18-bp promoter deletion in all varieties, despite extensive sharing of polymorphisms at nearby markers. This evidence for historical recombination between <italic>PM19-A1</italic> and <italic>A2</italic> but retention of the two deletions in coupling may indicate that these two variants operate epistatically to cause the QTL phenotype. The co-inheritance of these two polymorphisms across such diverse material also suggests it will be difficult to find lines in which the independent effects of these two polymorphisms can be tested.</p><p>The temperature effect on the expression of this gene provides an explanation of why the <italic>4A-1</italic> QTL was not detected in the 2009 field trial. Changes in temperature during late maturation have been linked to the suppression of dormancy and PHS incidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and have a critical effect on the expression of the QTL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In agreement with that, 2009 was the hottest year in the last 10&#x000a0;years at the location where our field experiments were performed (see Materials and methods). While expression of <italic>PM19-A2</italic> was also temperature regulated, we did not detect clear differences between genotypes or in the responsiveness of this gene to ABA or to after-ripening between the wheat varieties. This indicates that the polymorphisms we identified in the promoter of <italic>PM19-A2</italic> have no effect on the dormancy behavior (even when some ABREs are affected). However, we cannot rule out that the four amino acid difference in PM19-A2 between Yitpi and the non-dormant cultivars could have an impact. As we discussed in the previous paragraph, it is also very likely that the combination of both changes in those genes could be the reason for the detection of this QTL. In any case, the new gene-based markers identified here will improve the accuracy of the QTL selection and remove the current risk of misclassification in breeding programs.</p><p>Apart from <italic>PM19-A1</italic> and <italic>A2</italic>, we identified five other genes within the <italic>PM19</italic> family, which we named <italic>PM19-B1</italic>, <italic>B2</italic>, <italic>D1</italic>, <italic>D2</italic> and <italic>D3</italic> (previously named <italic>AWP-1</italic> and <italic>TaPM19-1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The genes <italic>PM19-A1</italic> and <italic>A2</italic> are located in the centromeric region of chromosome arm 4AL, while <italic>PM19-B1</italic> and <italic>B2</italic> are located on the telomeric region of chromosome 5BL and <italic>PM19-D1</italic>, <italic>D2</italic> and <italic>D3</italic> on the telomeric region of 5DL. These locations can be explained by the ancestral translocation that occurred between chromosome 4A and 5A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and implies that the <italic>4A-1</italic> QTL was translocated in that event from chromosome 5AL. The <italic>PM19</italic> orthologues from <italic>Brachypodium</italic> (Bradi1g00600) and barley (AF218627) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] are found in the telomeric region of chromosomes 1 and 5HL, respectively, which further supports the <italic>4A-1</italic> translocation hypothesis. The barley <italic>PM19</italic> orthologue was shown to be embryo-specific, with expression that decreased upon germination but stayed high in dormant embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Very interestingly, a major dormancy/malting QTL (named SD2) in barley located in the telomeric region of chromosome 5HL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] is thought to be syntenic with the wheat 4AL QTL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the orthologue gene <italic>AWPM19-like</italic> (At1g04560) maps inside the region associated with the seed dormancy QTL <italic>Delay of Germination 2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], which makes it a good candidate for that QTL in this species as well.</p><p>The seven wheat <italic>PM19</italic> genes described in this work show great similarity at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels (over 90&#x000a0;% protein identity), which could suggest that they all have a role as dormancy promoters. However, our expression results indicate that the expression of <italic>PM19-A1</italic> and <italic>A2</italic> is clearly higher in comparison with the others, suggesting that the genes on chromosome 4AL may make a bigger contribution. Analysis of the AWPM19 protein sequence showed it is highly hydrophobic and it has four putative membrane-spanning domains. Similarities between AWPM19 and the soybean <italic>GmPM3</italic> gene product were identified, indicating that AWPM19 is conserved and exist across a wide range of higher plant species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Members of the <italic>PM19</italic> gene family have been associated with ABA action. The first description of the AWPM19 protein, encoded by the <italic>AWP-1</italic> gene on chromosome 5D, showed that increased freezing tolerance of ABA-treated wheat suspension-cells was strongly associated with the accumulation of this protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. More recently, this gene has been shown to be highly expressed in grain during late maturation and to be induced by ABA in the roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Our results demonstrate also that our candidate genes <italic>PM19-A1</italic> and <italic>A2</italic> are highly expressed in grains during late maturation in both embryo and de-embryonated grain. We have also proven that these genes are strongly induced by ABA in imbibed grains, thus supporting their role as dormancy promoters. In agreement with that, we have also shown that, in Yitpi, both <italic>PM19-A1</italic> and <italic>A2</italic> are more highly expressed in dormant than in after-ripened grains.</p><p>Apart from being related to ABA, the function of PM19 protein and the mechanism by which it regulates dormancy are unknown. Previous studies in wheat indicated that PM19 is localized in the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and other indirect studies in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> identified it in the seed oil bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. These findings indicate that PM19 could be part of a regulatory pathway linking ABA with the membrane/lipidome. Recently, a strong gene candidate was proposed for another major wheat dormancy QTL located on chromosome 3AS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. That gene, named <italic>MOTHER OF FT AND TFL1</italic> (<italic>MFT</italic>), belongs to a family of genes encoding the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding proteins and is involved in dormancy acquisition during grain maturation in response to temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Phosphatidylethanolamine is an abundant membrane phospholipid in seeds. Both the <italic>PM19</italic> genes and <italic>MFT</italic> share several similarities: their effects on grain dormancy are affected by the temperature in which the grain develops and their functions could be linked to the plasma membrane. Future studies will address if these two classes of genes interact or have independent functions, and also will investigate if the different <italic>PM19</italic> genes have similar or distinct roles during dormancy acquisition and germination.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Increasing grain dormancy in wheat is an important goal for breeders globally in order to reduce the risk of pre-harvest sprouting. However, the identification of dormancy-related genes has been hampered by the complexity of the wheat genome. We have established a new pipeline for cloning QTL in wheat, and we have demonstrated its use by applying it to target the major grain dormancy QTL located on chromosome 4AL. Using this approach we have identified in the QTL region two adjacent candidate genes of the same family displaying sequence and expression changes. Functional analysis revealed that those genes, named <italic>PM19-A1</italic> and <italic>PM19-A2</italic>, are positive regulators of dormancy in wheat. The new gene-based markers identified here will improve the accuracy of QTL selection in breeding programs. Our multi-NIL transcriptomic analysis provides a new QTL-to-gene method for the rapid identification of both candidate genes and new markers for fine mapping.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Population and genetic map construction</title><p>A four-way MAGIC population consisting of 1579&#x000a0;F<sub>7</sub> RILs developed by intercrossing four Australian wheat varieties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] was used for this study.

To do so, a random effects working model is used in which all intervals are allowed to contain a possible QTL. A forward selection approach is used to select QTL. A likelihood ratio test of significance is conducted to decide if selection of a putative QTL is warranted or if selection should cease. An outlier statistic is used to select the most likely location for each QTL at the stage of the forward selection process. The approach allows for any non-genetic effects, such as experimental design terms, to be easily included in the base models.

Each library was individually barcoded and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform using v2 chemistry. After initial quality control, the sequence datasets were pooled by technical replicate and three time points (15 DPA, 25 DPA and 35 DPA) into 84 pairs of paired-end read data files (168 files), in total consisting of 4,261,599,592 raw reads. Quality control and alignment steps are foundation elements to downstream SNP detection and differential expression. Given the size and complexity of the CSS that we used as reference set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], two differing alignment approaches, Biokanga [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and Gydle (Gydle Inc.

Within Gydle, sequence reads were filtered using Nuclear (Gydle Inc.) and pair-end aligned to the wheat CSS contigs using Nuclear with moderately stringent parameters enabling two mismatches per read. Within Biokanga (version 3.4.5), reads were filtered to exclude exact duplicate reads by sequence and those reads whose sequence was not supported by at least two other overlapping reads to reduce the effect of potential sequence errors and PCR artifacts. In total, 1,467,808,800 reads were filtered, and the analysis was performed on the remaining 2,793,790,792 clean reads. Retained reads were pair-end aligned to the IWGSC CSS contigs. Alignment allowed at most two nucleic acid mismatches and only accepted reads with a single unique best alignment in each dataset. When aligned against the Chinese Spring survey sequences, 652,224,208 reads were accepted. Alignment yields were similar across all samples at around 20&#x000a0;% for both the Chinese Spring survey sequences. The second technical run showed approximately 40&#x000a0;% more reads and alignments compared with the first run, and 25 and 35 DPA displayed more reads aligned compared with 15 DPA.

A custom R function was written to filter SNP results to identify candidate trait-linked SNPs based on allelic distribution observed in the parent cultivars and family progeny with QTL presence or absence. Applied criteria included: (1) the allele present in the founder Yitpi must be distinct from all other founders, including Baxter, Chara, and Westonia; (2) alleles observed in Yitpi must be either homozygous (&#x02265;95&#x000a0;% of reads in agreement for the allele) or absent; (3) four out of the five families must have the same SNP as a founder for that pool - Yitpi was the single founder for the QTL-positive pool, while Baxter, Chara, and Westonia were the founders for the QTL-negative pool; and (4) any candidate SNP marker must have had a minimum of two read coverage.
