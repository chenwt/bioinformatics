However, such studies provide no definitive information on the translational landscape. Here, we use a combination of high-throughput transcriptome and proteome-profiling approaches to more rigorously understand protein expression in two mycobacterial species. RNA-seq and ribosome profiling in <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>, and transcription start site (TSS) mapping and N-terminal peptide mass spectrometry in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, provide complementary, empirical datasets to examine the congruence of transcription and translation in the <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> genus. We find that nearly one-quarter of mycobacterial transcripts are leaderless, lacking a 5&#x02019; untranslated region (UTR) and Shine-Dalgarno ribosome-binding site. Our data indicate that leaderless translation is a major feature of mycobacterial genomes and is comparably robust to leadered initiation. Using translational reporters to systematically probe the <italic>cis</italic>-sequence requirements of leaderless translation initiation in mycobacteria, we find that an ATG or GTG at the mRNA 5&#x02019; end is both necessary and sufficient. This criterion, together with our ribosome occupancy data, suggests that mycobacteria encode hundreds of small, unannotated proteins at the 5&#x02019; ends of transcripts. The conservation of small proteins in both mycobacterial species tested suggests that some play important roles in mycobacterial physiology. Our translational-reporter system further indicates that mycobacterial leadered translation initiation requires a Shine Dalgarno site in the 5&#x02019; UTR and that ATG, GTG, TTG, and ATT codons can robustly initiate translation. Our combined approaches provide the first comprehensive view of mycobacterial gene structures and their non-canonical mechanisms of protein expression.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The current paradigm for bacterial translation is based on an mRNA that includes an untranslated leader sequence containing the ribosome-binding site upstream of the initiation codon. We applied genome-scale approaches to map the protein-coding regions in the genomes of <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. We found that nearly one-quarter of mycobacterial transcripts are leaderless in mycobacterial species, thus indicating that ribosomes must recognize these mRNAs by a novel mechanism and suggesting that there are alternative modes of bacterial translation beyond the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> paradigm. Our translational profiling showed that many mycobacterial proteins are mis-annotated, and also found many new genes encoding small proteins that had been previously overlooked, which are likely to play novel roles in diverse cellular processes. We also developed a new reporter system that provides mechanistic insights into translation initiation through deep sequencing. Our data show that leaderless translation is a robust process that is conserved in mycobacteria, that leaderless translation only requires that the mRNA begin with a start codon, and predict that mycobacteria encode hundreds of small proteins. This work will help us understand gene structure, genome organization and protein expression in bacteria, and how the translational machinery differs in different organisms.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov">www.niaid.nih.gov</ext-link>, grants AI097191-01A1, to TAG KMD JTW JW MM PL SMF, the National Institutes of Health, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov">www.niaid.nih.gov</ext-link>, 5F32AI085911-02 to SSS, the National Institutes of Health, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov">www.niaid.nih.gov</ext-link>, grant 2T32AI049928 and 5T32AI007535-15, to RG, and the National Institutes of Health, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov">www.nih.gov</ext-link>, grants U19 AI107774 and 1DP2OD001378-01, to SMF.

Canonical translation initiation in bacteria is a multistep process that begins with the binding of a small (30S) ribosomal subunit to a Shine-Dalgarno element in the 5&#x02019; UTR of an mRNA. The Shine-Dalgarno sequence is generally centered 8&#x02013;9 nt upstream of the start codon and interacts with a complementary sequence in the 16S rRNA of the 30S ribosomal subunit to help position this ribosomal subunit [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A complex, comprising the mRNA-bound 30S subunit, fMet-tRNA, and initiation factors, recruits the large (50S) ribosomal subunit, forming a complete 70S ribosome for initiating translation of the open reading frame (ORF). Although almost all studies of bacterial translation initiation have focused on mRNAs that contain a Shine-Dalgarno, non-canonical mechanisms of translation initiation have also been described, including re-initiation and leaderless translation.</p><p>Translation of genes embedded in polycistronic mRNAs can be coupled to translation of the respective upstream gene in a process known as re-initiation, if the downstream start and upstream stop codons are positioned close to one another. Once translation of the upstream gene has terminated, the ribosome scans until it finds a suitable start codon further downstream [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Low levels of ribosome recycling factor (RRF) impair post-termination disassembly, allowing intact ribosomes to re-initiate translation [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Closely spaced or overlapping stop/start codons lead to the most efficient coupling [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The precise mechanism of re-initiation is unclear.</p><p>&#x0201c;Leaderless&#x0201d; transcripts lack a 5&#x02019; UTR and Shine-Dalgarno sequence. In such cases, 70S ribosomes must bind directly to the first nucleotide of the mRNAs to initiate translation. Few leaderless genes have been identified and analyzed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, and those that have are mostly of mobile DNA origin, including from &#x003bb; and P2 phage, and from Tn1721 [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. More recently, the expansion of genome sequence information, gene expression data, and computational analyses into bacterial species other than <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, suggest that leaderless gene structures may not be so unusual [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Leaderless genes also appear to be more common in some archaeal species [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and in mitochondria [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These isolated reports hint at a very broad distribution of leaderless genes, suggesting that it is an ancient&#x02014;and possibly the original&#x02014;mode of translation initiation [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Paradoxically, almost all mechanistic studies of bacterial leaderless translation have used <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> as a model system, despite the relative paucity of leaderless genes in this species. It is likely that fundamental differences in translation underlie robust leaderless translation in those species with pervasive leaderless gene structures.</p><p>Leaderless translation is poorly understood, compared with canonical leadered translation. Early studies established the absolute requirement for a 5&#x02019; ATG (AUG in the mRNA) for translation [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Leaderless translation is less robust in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> than leadered and early studies focused on identifying factors that contributed to this difference. Leaderless transcripts are likely recognized by 70S ribosomes, rather than the 30S subunit [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. 70S binding is stimulated by initiation-factor 2 [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], whereas initiation-factor 3 inhibits leaderless translation likely by destabilizing codon-anticodon interactions [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], an effect enhanced by the S1 protein [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. More recent studies suggest that at least some leaderless translation is mediated by a distinct sub-population of 70S ribosomes that have been modified by the stress-induced endoribonuclease, MazF [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. MazF cleaves the 3&#x02019; end of the 16S rRNA, thereby removing the anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence. Hence, these so-called &#x0201c;stress-ribosomes&#x0201d; fail to initiate translation of canonical leadered mRNAs but their translation initiation of leaderless transcripts is unimpaired. Thus, based on <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> studies, leadered and leaderless translation processes are functionally distinct.</p><p>In contrast to bacteria, eukaryotes utilize ribosome-scanning translation initiation mechanisms. Small open reading frames are frequently found in the 5&#x02019; UTRs of eukaryotic genes, and these upstream ORFs (uORFs) can attenuate translation of the annotated downstream ORF [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Less clear is whether similar upstream ORFs meaningfully regulate expression of the downstream proteins in prokaryotes. In bacteria, short ORFs have been identified upstream of some genes. However, this phenomenon has been described far less frequently than uORFs in eukaryotes [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Independent of putative roles in <italic>cis</italic>-regulating downstream ORFs, short ORFs may encode small proteins with <italic>trans</italic> activities. Regulatory functions have been attributed to encoded small proteins themselves [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] in response to environmental cues such as amino acid availability [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], global translation levels [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and ATP abundance [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>The genus <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> includes major pathogens as well as non-pathogens. There have been very few studies of translation initiation mechanisms in mycobacteria, although a recent study inferred widespread leaderless translation in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> by mapping transcription start sites (TSS) onto an annotated reference genome[<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Here, we use RNA-seq coupled with ribosome profiling to map RNAs and translated RNAs, respectively, in the model mycobacterial species, <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>. In parallel, we use TSS mapping coupled with mass spectrometry detection of protein N-termini to map the sites of initiation of the transcriptome and proteome of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>. These complementary approaches in related species reveal widespread non-canonical translation initiation, including leaderless translation and the use of alternative start codons. Lastly, we developed a next-generation sequencing-based translational reporter system, which allows a controlled assessment of the requirements of translation initiation in mycobacteria. This assay demonstrated that the requirements for leaderless and leadered translation are distinct, and supports the use of alternative start codons for leadered translation. Thus, our collective data provide the first systems-level description of key translational parameters in mycobacteria, a genus that exhibits significant endogenous leaderless translation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>RNA-seq and ribosome profiling analyses of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> indicate widespread leaderless translation</title><p>The initial report of leaderless translation in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> relied on annotation pipeline predictions [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which in turn are predicated on rules derived from canonical leadered translation systems. To generate a dataset that did not inherently rely on annotation predictions, we sought to empirically determine the genomic placement of active transcripts as well as their translated ORFs. The coordinate application of RNA-seq and ribosome profiling allowed simultaneous assessment of the relative levels of all transcripts and their translated regions genome-wide in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> without reliance on annotations. As each genome-wide approach has strengths and weaknesses, combining independent criteria or datasets provides higher confidence results. In this study, we used standard growth conditions including rich media and harvesting RNA from cells at mid-exponential phase to profile those genes most relevant to common experimental conditions. Mapped read depth tended to be greatest near the 5&#x02019; ends of the genes, facilitating our search for TSSs and translation initiation sites as the leading edge of stacked sequence reads from RNA-seq and ribosome profiling, respectively.</p><p>Focusing on the upstream boundaries of regions of sequencing signal in either the total RNA or ribosome profiling datasets, we identified putative TSSs and translation initiation sites for genes in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> that were sufficiently expressed. We noted that many (206) upstream boundaries of mapped RNA-seq reads aligned perfectly with a ribosome profiling boundary, and also coincided with a putative ATG or GTG (collectively, RTG) initiation codon (<xref rid="pgen.1005641.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Of these RTGs, 130 (63.1%) matched the 5&#x02019; start of an annotated gene. This convergence of transcription and translation initiation is consistent with leaderless mRNAs (<xref rid="pgen.1005641.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). The alignments of RNA-seq and ribosome footprinting boundaries that also align with an RTG codon in the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> genome are collectively very stringent criteria. We observed 1412 RNA-seq boundaries, 2709 ribosome profiling boundaries, and 444,642 RTG occurrences in a genome of 13,976,418 bases (total for both strands), combining for a chance alignment genome-wide at 0.0087&#x02014;far below the 206 we observed. Therefore, RTG codon occurrences are enriched at the 5&#x02019; boundaries of transcripts.</p><fig id="pgen.1005641.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1005641.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Leaderless and leadered genes produce distinct RNA-seq and ribosome profiling 5&#x02019; boundaries.</title><p>(A) The transcription start site (TSS) and translation initiation site are the same in leaderless genes. No 5&#x02019; UTR and no Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence imply that an assembled 70S ribosome engages the 5&#x02019; terminal initiation codon directly, followed by elongation to translate the ORF. Individual sequence reads from RNA-seq (green) and ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq, orange) analyses were mapped to the genome, and the abundance of the individual reads is indicated by the height of the peaks. In leaderless translation RNA-seq and ribosome profiling have coincident 5&#x02019; boundaries. The 5&#x02019; triplet is nearly always ATG or GTG and, in the typical example shown, corresponds to the predicted N-terminus of the annotated ORF. (B) Traditional gene structures generate nested ribosome profiling profiles, with a 5&#x02019; UTR that includes an SD ribosome-binding site upstream of the initiating methionine codon (ATG). The 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits assemble at the SD to form a complete 70S ribosome that begins translation at the adjacent AUG with an N-terminal formylated methionine (fM) amino acid residue. RNA-seq reads (green) indicate positive-strand transcription at this locus, and upstream of an annotated ORF. Mapped ribosome profiling reads (orange) begin downstream of the onset of RNA-seq reads, and ~17&#x02013;35 nt upstream of the initiation codon of the annotated ORF. In both examples, JCVI correctly predicted the respective ORFs (black).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1005641.g001"/></fig><p>Our identification of abundant leaderless mRNAs in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> lends empirical support for their presence in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], as well as validating our experimental approach. A putative initiating RTG triplet at the other 76 RNA-seq and ribosome profiling 5&#x02019; boundaries identified unannotated start codons. Most corresponded to a new in-frame upstream (26) or downstream (28) start codon for an annotated gene, thereby extending or reducing the length of the annotated ORF, respectively (<xref rid="pgen.1005641.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005641.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). The remaining 22 RTGs initiated new ORFs that had not been predicted by genome annotation pipelines (see below).</p><p>Leaderless transcripts generate distinctive 5&#x02019; read boundary profiles; their ribosomal footprints characteristically begin abruptly at the initiation codon. In addition, mRNAs with high ribosome occupancy can be enriched relative to their corresponding RNA-seq read depth in paired libraries that are otherwise comparable. Therefore, while some transcripts were not expressed highly enough to meet our read depth-mapping threshold in RNA-seq, ribosome isolation enriched those mRNAs enough to surpass the mapping threshold. Omitting the criterion of a coincident RNA-seq boundary from our analysis (still requiring a 5&#x02019; ribosome footprint aligning with an RTG) identified 762 candidate leaderless transcript boundaries. While we expect more false positives in this list of 762 transcripts, 457 (60.0%) matched a predicted annotated start, which was very similar to the 63% observed for the most stringent list, conferring confidence to those candidate initiation sites generated by this approach. Of the remaining 305 candidate leaderless RTGs, 175 (23%) were in-frame with annotated genes, predicting new upstream (99 instances) or downstream (76 instances) start codons for those ORFs (<xref rid="pgen.1005641.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>).

The range of footprint created by the ribosome on the 5&#x02019; UTR creates ambiguity in confidently assigning the start codon. We reasoned that leaderless and leadered mRNAs would fundamentally differ in their RTG codon placement relative to the onset of the ribosome profiling footprint: leaderless RTGs would map to the 5&#x02019; ribosome profiling boundary, whereas ribosome occupancy would protect the 5&#x02019; UTR of leadered transcripts most proximal to the initiating RTG codon. We therefore plotted the distance between the 5&#x02019; ribosome profiling boundary and the next downstream RTG triplet as a candidate initiation codon. This generated two peaks: the major leaderless peak with no separation (762 candidates, as described above), and a second broad peak with a mode (103) at 24 nucleotides of separation (<xref rid="pgen.1005641.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005641.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>).</p><p>Conservatively bracketing the second broad peak to include spacing of 20 to 30 nt of separation between the footprint boundary and the next RTG, identified 731 candidate leadered initiation RTG codons.

Other RTG codons within this 20 to 30 nt footprint window were in-frame with the annotated ORFs, but were either upstream (45) or downstream (133) of the predicted start codon, indicating probable mis-assigned start codons. The remaining 130 RTG triplets within this ribosome footprint range could represent either initiation codons for new unannotated ORFs (as for the leaderless RTGs), or background internal RNA fragments that fortuitously include an RTG sequence.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Independent demonstration of leaderless mRNAs in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> by TSS mapping and N-terminal mass spectrometry</title><p>We also took an independent approach in the related pathogenic species, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>, to determine whether non-canonical translation initiation mechanisms are conserved throughout the genus.

A subset of this class comprises proteins for which the TGA stop codon of the upstream peptide also formed the second two nucleotides of the RTG start codon of the downstream ORF; we refer to these small proteins as &#x0201c;coupled&#x0201d;.</p><fig id="pgen.1005641.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1005641.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Small protein ORFs are frequently coupled to the ORF downstream.</title><p>(A) <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> leaderless transcripts initiate unannotated small protein ORFs that terminate at the start of the annotated gene downstream more often than expected.

Forty-nine of these small ORFs appear to be encoded on transcripts separate from annotated genes under the conditions analyzed, while others appear to be encoded polycistronically and followed by annotated genes. Collectively, our data are consistent with mycobacterial small proteomes comprising hundreds of unannotated small proteins.</p><p>Coupled small proteins require a precise overlap of two codons (one Opal stop, one start). Our data indicate that these structures are significantly overrepresented in mycobacteria (<xref rid="pgen.1005641.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>, Fisher&#x02019;s Exact Test p &#x0003c; 0.0003).

Sometimes only the genomic placement and coupled architecture of divergent small proteins are conserved between <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic>, suggesting that the coupled linkage is under greater selection than the encoded small protein sequence (see example <xref rid="pgen.1005641.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). The relative contribution of coupling to the total translation initiation of the downstream ORF may augment overall gene expression by maximizing ribosome occupancy.</p><p>We identified orthologous uORFs in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005641.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). These small proteins shared not only their genomic context, but also significant amino acid identity. The juxtaposition of the encoded small proteins and downstream genes suggests an operonic structure, with possible regulatory effects. Small uORFs in other bacterial species are often found at the 5&#x02019; end of polycistronic mRNAs dedicated to biosynthetic pathways for amino acids, wherein the amino acid product of the biosynthetic operon is overrepresented in the encoded peptide. An abundance of that amino acid transcriptionally attenuates the downstream biosynthetic genes in the operon. Inspection of the encoded peptides for enrichment of amino acids identified several candidates for attenuating peptides. One predicted small ORF contained a cluster of codons for cysteine at its C-terminus, and was located upstream of the <italic>cysA2</italic> gene, Rv0815 (<xref rid="pgen.1005641.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). The relative location and sequence of this encoded protein is conserved in mycobacteria, strongly supporting its identification as a functional small ORF. Our ribosome profiling of the orthologous locus in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> showed robust 70S ribosome occupancy of both the small ORF and the downstream genes (<xref rid="pgen.1005641.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). We speculate that cysteine homeostasis or redox status may influence ribosome processivity through the small ORF, affecting the transcription or translation of the linked operon genes downstream. We found other upstream-encoded small proteins that were conserved in mycobacteria, and enriched in cysteine residues upstream of putative hypothetical or cysteine-metabolic genes (<xref rid="pgen.1005641.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B and 7C</xref>, respectively). We note that in each of the examples shown, the JCVI annotation predicted a gene encoded on the opposite (negative) strand to these uORFs; our data find no negative-strand transcripts to support those predicted annotations. These examples illustrate the functional potential of a few of the members of the mycobacterial small proteome, providing testable hypotheses for these candidates (e.g., through cysteine or redox modulation), while others may have less obvious&#x02014;but no less important functional roles. The location of many unannotated uORFs as the first genes in their operons, suggests new possibilities for regulatory and functional interactions of the small proteins with the downstream operon and encoded proteins.</p><fig id="pgen.1005641.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1005641.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Examples of conserved small proteins encoded by leaderless mRNAs in mycobacteria.</title><p>Small ORFs were identified upstream of annotated orthologous genes (A) <italic>cysA2</italic>/Msmeg_5788, (B) Rv0485/Msmeg_0932, and (C) <italic>nirA</italic>/Msmeg_4527, in the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> genomes.

Our findings collectively indicate that translational mechanisms and the gene architectures they process differ from the canonical models derived from extensive studies in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. A prominent non-canonical feature is the frequency, translational robustness, and conservation of leaderless mRNAs in mycobacteria. Experimentally determining translation initiation sites of actively translated ORFs provides empirical evidence for the prevalence of mycobacterial leaderless transcripts, and significantly refines and extends leaderless gene predictions derived from genome annotations [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We find 2166 TSSs also identified by Cortes et al. in addition to many novel initiation sites, while our independent <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> approach provides evolutionary depth in a tractable model bacterium. There does not appear to be a unifying criterion for leadered and leaderless gene structures. They have comparable GC content, initiate genes of similar length, begin operons of similar composition, and&#x02014;under standard growth conditions&#x02014;are not enriched for functionally related proteins.</p><p>We developed novel reporters to begin to address mechanistic hypotheses about <italic>cis</italic>-sequences that affect leaderless and leadered translation initiation in mycobacteria. Our data show that any mRNA beginning with ATG or GTG (AUG or GUG in mRNA) will be translated as a leaderless mRNA in mycobacteria. Strikingly, no other codon initiates leaderless translation, in contrast to leadered translation, which can initiate with a wide variety of codons, including rare start codons such as TTG and ATT. In addition to Shine-Dalgarno dependence, differing start codon requirements indicate fundamental mechanistic differences between leadered and leaderless translation initiation. However, there is currently insufficient understanding of leaderless translation to determine why this difference exists.</p><p>The combination of multiple, independent observations strongly indicate that a +1 RTG codon is both necessary and sufficient for leaderless translation initiation. We did not identify any sequences beyond the start codon that were enriched in leaderless genes, either in mycobacterial genomes or by our viability reporter assays, suggesting that the RTG start codon is not supported by an enhancing downstream box [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Leaderless genes in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> are frequently leaderless in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>, in spite of sequence variation (indicating an absence of a functionally important element) near the initiating RTG codon. We observe robust leaderless initiation regardless of the reporter context, none of which have mycobacterial origins that could contain leaderless support elements. Varied contexts and disparate assays consistently produce robust leaderless translation efficiencies in mycobacteria. Thus, an ATG or GTG at the TSS is the only discernable criterion for translation initiation at that same site.</p><p>Previous studies in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> have indicated that ATG was optimal for leaderless initiation, with &#x0003c;10% activity for GTG [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, leaderless expression from even an optimal ATG initiation codon in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> is weak (10%) compared to initiation from a leadered transcript [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005641.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>], again contrasting to the relatively similar levels of expression from leadered and leaderless mRNAs in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic>. Together, these observations indicate that recognition and translational initiation of leaderless mRNAs in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> occurs by a distinctly different mechanism than that described for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. Overall leaderless gene expression appears to be controlled by a balance of promoter activity, mRNA stability, and protein turnover; leadered gene expression has an additional level of control provided by features of the 5&#x02019; UTR, including the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and RNA secondary structure. We speculate that this additional level of expression modulation may have provided the evolutionary impetus for leadered gene structures.</p><p>Analyses of TSS mapping data indicate that RNA polymerase exhibits context bias in selecting a TSS. For example, a cytosine at the -1 is preferred, followed by a pyrimidine at the +2 [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Could RNA polymerase sequence preferences be responsible for driving the enrichment of RTG (1098/4979, 22%) triplets at the transcription start sites of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>? Substituting chemically similar but translationally inert nucleotides into the second and third positions of the RTG triplet, we see that they are found at TSSs much less often: RCG is found at 270 (5.4%) of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> TSSs, and RTA at 121 (2.4%). Clearly, the over-representation of RTG at TSSs (Fisher&#x02019;s Exact Test, p &#x0003c;0.0001) indicates that there is a strong evolutionary selection for RTGs at the TSS in mycobacteria.</p><p>We conservatively defined leaderless genes as those that have an RTG beginning at the first (+1) nucleotide of their corresponding transcript. Leaderless genes have also been more broadly defined as those having a potential initiation codon from +1 through +5 [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], with the rationale that a miniscule 5&#x02019; UTR could not include a Shine-Dalgarno element. Convergence mapping of our protein N-termini and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> transcriptional start sites provides some experimental assessment of the accuracy of this broader definition. While N-termini were identified for 51 of 1098 (4.7%) leaderless +1 TSSs, only 4 of 558 (0.7%) candidate RTG codons from +2 to +5 had associated N-termini (<xref rid="pgen.1005641.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005641.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). Many factors affect peptide identification in mass spectrometry analyses; therefore the relative paucity of N-terminal peptides initiated by +2 to +5 leaderless codons is not definitive. Nevertheless, our data suggest that translation initiation efficiency is greater for RTG codons at +1 than from +2 through +5. Independent of the N-terminal mapping, the non-random distribution of RTG triplets in the first five positions of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> transcripts supports RTG enrichment specifically at the +1 nucleotide. If leaderless translation initiation utilizes any near-TSS RTG equivalently, RTGs should be evenly distributed throughout this window. However, the 1098 RTG triplets at the +1 are greater than the next four positions combined (558) (<xref rid="pgen.1005641.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). Including RTG codons downstream of the +1 position in the definition of leaderless mRNAs should therefore carry the caveat that their initiation efficiencies are likely to be lower than an absolute leaderless codon. The enrichment of RTGs at the TSS in mycobacteria clearly indicates a positive selection for leaderless translation in the genus, and not simply a tolerated inefficiency of a promiscuous initiation mechanism.</p><p>Leaderless translation is far more efficient in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic>, and presumably <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>, than in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. The reason for this disparity is unclear, although there are many differences in ribosomal proteins between mycobacteria and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Importantly, almost all studies of leaderless translation have used <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> as a model system. As illustrated in our genomic landscape profiles, the mutually exclusive presence of a -10 hexamer or a Shine-Dalgarno ribosome-binding site upstream of the initiation codon can distinguish leaderless from leadered genes. Our data suggest that other species with a high frequency of predicted leaderless gene structures [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] are also likely to initiate leaderless translation efficiently and by a different initiation mechanism than that for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>.</p><p>The unbiased sequence-panning approach we developed to define <italic>cis</italic> elements that support translation initiation clearly show that a Shine-Dalgarno sequence is required for efficient leadered initiation. The purine-rich consensus of the recovered zeocin-resistant constructs agreed well with the canonical motif defined in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The functionally selected ribosome binding sites also agreed well with our genomic sequence analyses of the 5&#x02019; UTRs of leadered transcripts in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> (DNA Logo in <xref rid="pgen.1005641.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005641.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). The conservation of canonical Shine-Dalgarno elements in 5&#x02019; UTRs and cognate anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequences in 16S rRNA tails, suggests that the mechanism aligning the ribosomal subunits with a leadered translation initiation codon in these two species is conserved.</p><p>Our focus on structurally and functionally defining the 5&#x02019; ends of genes led us to identify large numbers of small ORFs that are likely to be translated in mycobacteria. The prevalence and efficiency of leaderless translation initiation that we see in mycobacteria support the prediction that leaderless ORFs will be translated. It is possible that upstream small ORFs enhance translation initiation of the annotated genes downstream, particularly in cases of RTGA coupling. This may be through non-canonical re-initiation of 70S ribosomes that remain intact while tracking into the downstream ORF. Alternatively, traditional Shine-Dalgarno mediated initiation of the downstream ORF may be augmented by an increased local concentration of ribosomal subunits at the junction of the two ORFs. Previous studies of re-initiation have focused exclusively on pairs of ORFs within operons. Operons comprise annotated ORFs that are frequently coupled at their junctions as well, which may offer efficiency advantages through ribosome loading of the downstream gene. Alignments of annotated operon gene junctions clearly show that wobble positions of the codons are guanine/adenine enriched for dual use as a Shine-Dalgarno sequence embedded in coding sequence (<xref rid="pgen.1005641.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). This suggests that translation initiation of the downstream gene can occur by two distinct mechanisms (non-canonical re-initiation, and canonical Shine-Dalgarno directed), or that a Shine-Dalgarno sequence can improve the efficiency of re-initiation. Similar mechanisms may apply to the couplings joining small protein ORFs with their downstream genes as described here. The delivery of ribosomes to the downstream ORF via a coupling tetramer does not depend on the amino acid sequence of the small protein sequence itself, only that, once loaded, the ribosomes make it through that ORF to be near the initiation codon of the downstream ORF. It is possible, however, that the sequence of the encoded peptide might modulate ribosome delivery.</p><p>The conserved candidate cysteine-rich uORFs that we identified would be the first examples of attenuation identified in mycobacteria, and for cysteine-directed attenuation in bacteria. While our hypothesized <italic>cis</italic> regulatory roles for the small protein ORFs are still speculative, they may offer an alternative regulatory mechanism compensating for the loss of the 5&#x02019; UTR in leaderless genes. These possible mechanisms could help modulate protein production beyond promoter-controlled transcription initiation.</p><p>The precedent and the presence of potential <italic>cis</italic> regulatory ORFs are clearest for small proteins encoded at the beginning of an operon[<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Nevertheless, precedent also exists for <italic>trans</italic> activities inherent to the small proteins themselves[<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that upstream leaders are fertile incubators poised for the nascent evolution of expressed sequences as the first gene of an expanding operon. Moreover, some of the predicted small proteins are not apparently affiliated with another nearby ORF (at least 49 in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>), suggesting that these small protein singletons are not <italic>cis</italic>-regulators. It is unlikely that every member of the mycobacterial small proteome has an individual function, but clearly some of them bear hallmarks of functional features. Small protein ORFs that are part of an operon may function in the pathway encoded by the trailing genes of that operon. Expanded study of the emerging small proteome will help to identify the likely candidates, determine their functional roles, and evaluate their collective influence on the phenotype or phenotypic variation of the bacteria.</p><p>We focus on small proteins encoded by leaderless transcripts because of the abundant support for their presence in both mycobacterial species analyzed here. However, as leadered initiation of annotated genes in mycobacteria still outnumber leaderless annotated genes by at least two to one, it is reasonable to speculate that leadered codons will initiate translation of small proteins at comparable rates. Therefore, the small proteome estimates derived solely from leaderless mRNAs under standard rich media growth conditions, as presented here, are conservative underestimates.</p><p>In summary, we have identified widespread, conserved, non-canonical translation initiation in mycobacteria. Abundant leaderless translation initiation, encoded small proteins, and coupled linkages suggest translation mechanisms in mycobacteria are likely to fundamentally differ from those modeled in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. Further, our data may help improve current genome annotation pipelines to more accurately predict leaderless gene structures, transcription and translation isoforms, and translation initiation sites in bacteria. Moreover, we anticipate that genome-scale approaches combining ribosome profiling, TSS, and LC-MS/MS will uncover similar phenomena in diverse bacterial species, challenging long-held paradigms of translation initiation in bacteria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Mycobacteria and growth conditions</title><p>The mc<sup>2</sup>155 strain of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth supplemented with ADC and 0.05% Tween 80 with shaking at 230 RPM at 37&#x000b0;C to an OD<sub>600</sub> of ~1.0. <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (strain H37Rv) was cultured in Middlebrook 7H9 supplemented with OADC, 0.05% Tween 80 and 0.2% glycerol to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.8&#x02013;1.0 for transcriptomics experiments, and the same strain was cultured as described in [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] for mass spectrometry.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Extract preparation for <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic>

Pellets from 18 ml of culture each disrupted in 1 mL Trizol (Life Technologies) in Lysing Matrix B tubes (MP) in a FastPrep-24 (MP) using two cycles of 30&#x02013;45 seconds at 6.5 m/sec. 300 &#x003bc;L chloroform was added, samples were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C, supernatants were mixed with equal volumes of isopropanol, and the resulting samples were incubated for 1 hour at -20&#x000b0;C before centrifugation for 10 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. Pellets were washed with 75% ethanol, resuspended in water, treated with DNase Turbo (Ambion) and purified by RNeasy (Qiagen) as directed by the manufacturer. RNA samples were subject to two consecutive rounds of ribosomal RNA depletion using a MICROBExpress kit (Ambion) as directed by the manufacturer.</p><p>Transcription start sites were mapped as described in [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] with modifications. Briefly: RNA samples from two biological replicates were each processed to create two parallel libraries: a &#x0201c;converted&#x0201d; library, which captured RNA 5&#x02019; ends bearing 5&#x02019; triphosphates and 5&#x02019; monophosphates, and a &#x0201c;non-converted&#x0201d; library, which captured only RNA 5&#x02019; ends bearing 5&#x02019; monophosphates. The resulting libraries bore Illumina TruSeq adapter sequences, with the first base of Read 1 corresponding to the exact 5&#x02019; end of an RNA molecule. To convert triphosphates to monophosphates in the &#x0201c;converted&#x0201d; library, 1.7 &#x003bc;g rRNA-depleted RNA was incubated with 1 &#x003bc;L 5&#x02019; Polyphosphatase (Epicentre) in a 20 &#x003bc;L reaction for 1 hour at 37&#x000b0;C. For the &#x0201c;non-converted&#x0201d; library, 1.7 &#x003bc;g rRNA-depleted RNA was incubated in parallel in a mock reaction lacking enzyme. Samples were purified by RNeasy (Qiagen) and eluted in 100 &#x003bc;L water containing RNaseOUT (Life Technologies) and DTT. One &#x003bc;L 100 mM Tris pH 7.5 was added and samples were concentrated to 8 &#x003bc;L by vacuum centrifugation. Concentrated samples were mixed with 1 &#x003bc;L of 5 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;L oligo SSS392 (TCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCC<italic>GAUCU</italic>; normal font indicates deoxyribonucleotides and italics indicate ribonucleotides), denatured at 65&#x000b0;C. for 10 minutes, and cooled in an ice-water bath. Three &#x003bc;L 10X T4 RNA ligase buffer (New England Biolabs), 1 &#x003bc;L RNaseOUT, 10 &#x003bc;L 50% PEG8000, 3 &#x003bc;L RNaseOUT, 10 &#x003bc;L of 10 mM ATP, 3 &#x003bc;L DMSO, and 1 &#x003bc;L T4 RNA ligase I (New England Biolabs) were added and reactions incubated 18 hours at 20&#x000b0;C. Seventy &#x003bc;L water was added and samples were purified by RNeasy (Qiagen) and eluted in 126 &#x003bc;L water. Samples were sheared in a Covaris sonicator in AFA MicroTubes (Covaris) as follows: exposure time, 180 seconds; duty cycle, 10%; intensity, 5; cycles/burst, 200. One &#x003bc;L each Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM DTT, and RNaseOUT (Life Technologies) were added and samples concentrated to 11.25 &#x003bc;L. One &#x003bc;L of 2.2 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;L SSS397 (CTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTNNNNNN, where &#x0201c;N&#x0201d; represents a degenerate base) was added, samples were incubated at 65&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes and cooled in an ice-water bath. Four &#x003bc;L 5X first-strand buffer (Life Technologies), 1 &#x003bc;L dNTP mix containing 10 mM each dNTP, 0.5 &#x003bc;L RNaseOUT (Life Technologies), 0.25 &#x003bc;L of 1 mg/mL actinomycin D, 1 &#x003bc;L 100 mM DTT, and 1 &#x003bc;L Superscript III (Life Technologies) were added and reactions incubated 18 hours at 42&#x000b0;C. RNA was degraded by treatment with 10 &#x003bc;L each 1 N NaOH and 500 mM EDTA at 65&#x000b0;C. for 15 minutes, 25 &#x003bc;L 1 M Tris pH 7.5 was added, and cDNA was purified by MinElute kit (Qiagen) and eluted in 60 &#x003bc;L water.</p><p>To add the remaining adapter sequences, samples were subject to PCR as follows: 10 &#x003bc;L 5X HF buffer (Finnzymes), 2.5 &#x003bc;L of 10 &#x003bc;M oligo SSS398 (AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTC), 2.5 &#x003bc;L of 10 &#x003bc;M reverse oligo (CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATXXXXXXGTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCT, where &#x0201c;XXXXXX&#x0201d; is a 6 nt Illumina index sequence), 20 &#x003bc;L 5 M betaine, 0.5 &#x003bc;L Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes), 0.4 &#x003bc;L dNTP mix containing 25 mM each dNTP, and 14.1 &#x003bc;L purified cDNA from the previous step. Thermal cycler settings: 1 cycle of 98&#x000b0;C for 3 minutes, 8 cycles of 98&#x000b0;C for 80 seconds, 60&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds, and 72&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds, 1 cycle of 72&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes. Reaction volumes were set to 100 &#x003bc;L on the thermal cycler to increase ramp time [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Three reactions were performed for each sample. Products between 150 and 500 nt were size-selected on a 1.5% agarose gel, purified by a Qiagen gel extraction kit, eluted in 40 &#x003bc;L water, and replicates were pooled and concentrated by vacuum centrifugation to a final volume of 50 &#x003bc;L per library. Samples were further purified by Ampure XP beads (Agencourt) using a beads:sample ratio of 1.8 and an elution of 50 &#x003bc;L water. To enrich for molecules with full-length adatpers, products were subject to an additional PCR as follows: 10 &#x003bc;L 5X HF buffer (Finnzymes), 2.5 &#x003bc;L of 10 &#x003bc;M oligo SSS401 (AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATC), 2.5 &#x003bc;L of 10 &#x003bc;M oligo SSS402 (CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT), 20 &#x003bc;L 5 M betaine, 0.5 &#x003bc;L Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes), 0.4 &#x003bc;L dNTP mix containing 25 mM each dNTP, and 14.1 &#x003bc;L purified PCR product from the previous step.

Samples were concentrated by vacuum centrifugation and cDNA was synthesized by adding 3 &#x003bc;g of random primers (Life Technologies), incubating at 70&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes and snap-cooling in an ice water bath, adding 4 &#x003bc;L 5X first-strand buffer (Life Technologies), 1 &#x003bc;L dNTP mix containing 10 mM each dNTP, 0.5 &#x003bc;L RNaseOUT (Life Technologies), 0.5 &#x003bc;L of 1 mg/mL actinomycin D, 1 &#x003bc;L 100 mM DTT, and 1 &#x003bc;L Superscript III (Life Technologies) and incubating overnight at 42&#x000b0;C. RNA was degraded and cDNA purified as described above for 5&#x02019; end mapping libraries. Each first-strand cDNA sample was divided into 8 replicate second-strand synthesis reactions. Approximately 100 ng cDNA was mixed with 3 &#x003bc;g of random primers (Life Technologies) and 2 &#x003bc;L 100 mM Tris pH 7.5, incubated at 95&#x000b0;C for 3 minutes, cooled rapidly to 50&#x000b0;C, and then cooled from 50&#x000b0;C to 4&#x000b0;C at a rate of -0.4&#x000b0;C/second. The following were added before an overnight incubation at 16&#x000b0;C: 8 &#x003bc;L NEBNext Second Strand Synthesis (dNTP-free) Reaction Buffer, 1.6 &#x003bc;L dNTP mix containing 10 mM each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dUTP, 4 &#x003bc;L NEBNext Second Strand Synthesis enzyme mix, and water to a final volume of 80 &#x003bc;L. Reactions were purified with MinElute columns (Qiagen). 1 &#x003bc;g of purified second-strand synthesis reaction was then subject to end repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation using a TruSeq DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Following the ligation and subsequent clean-up steps, the entire product was run on a 2% agarose gel and the region between approximately 250 and 600 bp was excised and extracted with a Qiagen gel extraction kit. Each sample was divided into 4 reactions containing approximately 80 ng DNA, 1 &#x003bc;L 100 mM Tris pH 7.5, and 2 &#x003bc;L USER enzyme mix (NEB) and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes. The following were added for PCR: 10 &#x003bc;L 5X HF buffer (Finnzymes), 5 &#x003bc;L primer mix from Illumina TruSeq kit, 0.4 &#x003bc;L dNTP mix that contains 25 mM each dNTP, 20 &#x003bc;L 5 M betaine, and 0.5 &#x003bc;L Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes). Thermal cycler conditions were as follows: 1 cycle of 98&#x000b0;C. for 3 minutes, 10 cycles of 98&#x000b0;C for 1 minute, 60&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds, and 72&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds, 1 cycle of 72&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes.

The 1<sup>st</sup> base of &#x0201c;Read 1&#x0201d; (hereafter called &#x0201c;1<sup>st</sup> nt&#x0201d;) was extracted to determine the number of RNA 5&#x02019; ends mapped to each genome coordinate. Zero values were replaced by 0.5. To identify above-background peaks in 5&#x02019; end coverage, the mean coverage at each coordinate in the two biological replicate &#x0201c;converted&#x0201d; libraries was averaged and the ratios of &#x0201c;1<sup>st</sup> nt&#x0201d; coverage at each coordinate relative to the positions 10 nt upstream and 10 nt downstream were determined. Approximately 22,000 peaks were identified where at least one of the two ratios was over 25. These peaks in 5&#x02019; end coverage were subject to the following filters: (1) peaks with a mean &#x0201c;converted&#x0201d; library coverage under 20 were removed; and (2) the ratio of mean &#x0201c;converted&#x0201d; library &#x0201c;1<sup>st</sup> nt&#x0201d; coverage to mean RNA-seq expression library coverage in the 200 nt region upstream of the &#x0201c;1<sup>st</sup> nt&#x0201d; peak was determined, and only peaks with ratios of at least 0.7 were retained.</p><p>For each filtered RNA 5&#x02019; end, the &#x0201c;1<sup>st</sup> nt&#x0201d; coverage in the replicate libraries was summed and the ratio in the converted/non-converted libraries was determined. The distribution of ratios was bimodal, and Gaussian mixture modeling was used to estimate the means and standard deviations for two skewed normal distributions (one comprised of processed 5&#x02019; ends, and one comprised of unprocessed 5&#x02019; ends corresponding to transcription start sites). RNA 5' ends with ratios greater than 1.74 had a cumulative probability of &#x02264;0.01 of belonging to the processed 5&#x02019; end population (after adjusting for multiple comparisons by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure) and were therefore designated transcription start sites (TSSs). Because transcriptional initiation is imprecise, the 6,900 statistically significant TSSs were filtered to remove all but the single TSS with the highest converted-library coverage in each 11 nt window. 4,978 TSSs passed this filter and are included in <xref rid="pgen.1005641.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Proteomic analyses</title><p>Whole-cell protein lysates were prepared as described in [<xref rid="pgen.1005641.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Pelleted lysates were resuspended in 6 M urea/50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Protein content of each sample was measured using Pierce BCA protein assay. 20 mM DTT was added to 500 &#x003bc;g of protein and samples were incubated for 30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C. Iodoacetamide was added at a final concentration of 50 mM and samples were incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature. Prior to trypsin digestion, urea concentration was diluted to less than 1 M by adding water and pH adjusted to 8 with a 1 M Tris solution. 10 &#x003bc;g sequencing grade trypsin (Cat. No. V5280, Promega, Madison, WI) was added (1:50 enzyme to substrate ratio) and samples were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C with shaking for 16 hours. The reaction was stopped by addition of formic acid (FA) to a final concentration of 1% and the solution was desalted with a 1 cc (30 mg) Oasis HLB reverse phase cartridge (Cat. No. WAT054955, Waters, Milford, USA) conditioned with 3 x 500 &#x003bc;L acetonitrile (ACN), followed by 4 x 500 &#x003bc;L 0.1% FA. Samples were loaded onto the cartridges and washed with 3 x 500 &#x003bc;L 0.1% FA. Desalted peptides were eluted by 2 applications of 500 &#x003bc;L of 80% ACN/0.1% FA. Eluates were frozen, dried via vacuum centrifugation prior to peptide fractionation. The sample was then fractionated by reverse phase chromatography into 24 fractions and analyzed by liquid chromatography&#x02014;tandem mass spectrometry. Briefly, each of the 24 fractions were resuspended in 20 &#x003bc;L of 3% ACN/ 0.5% FA and 2 &#x003bc;L of the peptide mixture was injected and separated by a 100 min gradient (~0.7%B/min.) of increasing acetonitrile from 5&#x02013;60%B. A PicoFrit column (New Objective, Woburn, MA), with an inner diameter of 75 &#x003bc;m packed with 12&#x02013;14 cm of ReproSil-Pur C18 3 &#x003bc;m particles, was directly interfaced to an Agilent 1100 HPLC coupled Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo) equipped with a custom nano-electrospray ionization source. MS analysis settings for protein identification were as follows. One precursor MS scan at 60,000 resolution in profile mode was followed by data-dependent scans of the top 15 most abundant ions at low-resolution in centroid mode. Dynamic exclusion was enabled with a repeat count of 2, repeat duration of 20 seconds, exclusion duration of 30 seconds and an exclusion list size of 500. MS/MS spectra were collected with normalized collision energy of 28 and an isolation width of 3 amu. The extensive peptide fractionation coupled with in depth MS analysis allowed detection and identification of very low levels of peptides. All MS data were processed using Agilent Spectrum Mill MS Proteomics Workbench (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, USA).</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Directed &#x003b2;-galactosidase assays</title><p>Specific codons were tested for their ability to initiate translation of the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene by generating translational fusions.
