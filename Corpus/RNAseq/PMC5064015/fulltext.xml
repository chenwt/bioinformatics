ER&#x0002b; breast cancers are also known as luminal breast cancers and can be subdivided into A and B subtypes. The luminal B tumours are more aggressive ER&#x0002b; breast cancers characterized by poorer tumour grade, larger tumour size and higher proliferation index. Clinically, such tumours are prone to develop endocrine resistance, which poses a great challenge to clinical management. Identifying the genetic aberrations underlying the enhanced aggressiveness of these tumours, and developing effective therapeutic strategies to target them, are in high demand. Recent prominent success of the CDK4/6-specific inhibitors in clinical trials for advanced breast cancers have attracted wide-spread attention to the potential of cell cycle kinases as viable drug targets in breast cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Thus, discovering new cell cycle kinase targets that can tackle the more aggressive ER&#x0002b; breast cancers will be of critical clinical significance.</p><p>Genomic amplifications lead to deregulations of oncogenes to which cancer cells become often addicted in specific tumours. Such events, however, usually affect a large number of genes in cancer genomes, which make it difficult to identify the primary oncogene targets of these amplifications. In our previous study, we discovered that cancer genes possess distinctive yet complicated &#x02018;gene concept signature', which include cancer-related signalling pathways, molecular interactions, transcriptional motifs, protein domains and gene ontologies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Based on this observation, we developed a Concept Signature (or ConSig) analysis that prioritizes the biological importance of candidate genes underlying cancer via computing their strength of association with those cancer-related signature concepts (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://consig.cagenome.org">http://consig.cagenome.org</ext-link>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. In our previous study, we have applied this analysis to reveal the primary target genes of chromosome 17q amplifications in breast cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Here we postulate that the ConSig analysis may be used to effectively nominate dominantly acting cancer genes from the genomic amplifications in cancer at a genome-wide scale, which can be further translated into viable therapeutic targets by interrogating pharmacological databases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Toward this end, we have assembled a genome-wide analysis called &#x02018;ConSig-Amp' to discover viable therapeutic targets in cancer from multi-dimensional genomic data sets.</p><p>Applying this analysis to the genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) nominated a new oncogene target called <italic>tousled-like kinase 2</italic> (<italic>TLK2</italic>) frequently amplified in aggressive luminal breast cancer. Tousled-like kinases (TLKs) are nuclear serine/threonine kinases that promote chromatin assembly during S-phase and also chromosome segregation during mitosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. The <italic>TLK</italic> gene family includes two members, <italic>TLK1</italic> and <italic>TLK2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Most, if not all, of the reports about the function of TLKs focus on the study of TLK1, while the function of TLK2 and its role in human cancers are still largely unknown. To date, there is no functional characterization of TLK2 in breast cancer, although TLK2 single nucleotide polymorphism has been associated with increased breast cancer risk<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, and most recently TLK2 has been reported as an amplicon-associated highly phosphorylated kinase in luminal breast cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Here we discovered that TLK2 overexpression endows enhanced invasiveness of luminal breast cancers, and appears to be addictive for <italic>TLK2</italic>-amplified breast cancers so that TLK2 inhibition renders decreased cancer cell viability and increased apoptosis. This suggests that TLK2 may serve as an attractive genomic target for the aggressive luminal breast cancers harbouring <italic>TLK2</italic> amplifications.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>TLK2</italic> as a lead target amplified in ER&#x0002b; breast cancers</title><p>To systematically reveal new therapeutic targets, we applied the &#x02018;ConSig-Amp' analysis to the genomic data sets for breast cancers from TCGA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. First, we identified all human genes that are amplified in &#x0003e;5&#x00025; of ER&#x0002b; breast cancers based on copy-number data. Candidates were then benchmarked with the ConSig-Amp score which is calculated by multiplying ConSig score (Methods) by the correlation between gene expression and copy number, to prioritize biologically important targets that are upregulated by genomic amplifications. Potentially druggable candidates were then selected according to a drug-target database compiled from multiple sources<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. This revealed several known kinase targets in breast cancer such as <italic>ERBB2, PAK1, RPS6KB1</italic> and <italic>PTK2</italic> (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), together with a new candidate kinase target, <italic>TLK2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Copy-number data from TCGA show that <italic>TLK2</italic> is amplified in about &#x0223c;9&#x00025; of all breast cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>), and such events are more frequent in ER-positive than negative breast cancers (10.5 versus 2.9&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). <italic>TLK2</italic> locates in a frequently amplified region in chr17q23.2 close to <italic>RPS6KB1</italic> amplifications, and is far apart from the <italic>ERBB2</italic> amplifications in 17q12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Thus <italic>TLK2</italic> is not co-amplified with <italic>ERBB2.</italic>
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3a, b</xref> shows the copy-number data of <italic>TLK2</italic> and known amplified oncogenes in breast cancer in TCGA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> and Metabric<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> data sets. <italic>TLK2</italic> copy number does not correlate with most known oncogene amplifications, except <italic>RPSKB1</italic> (Pearson <italic>R</italic>=0.796 for the TCGA data set and <italic>R</italic>=0.768 for the Metabric data set). While <italic>Her2</italic> amplifications are enriched in <italic>TLK2</italic>-amplified tumours, their copy numbers do not correlate with each other (<italic>R</italic>=0.187 for TCGA data set and <italic>R</italic>=0.201 for the Metabric data set). This suggests that <italic>TLK2</italic> is frequently co-amplified with <italic>RPS6KB1</italic>, but not with other known amplified genes in breast cancer such as <italic>ERBB2, MYC, CCND1</italic>, and so on. Gene expression data show that <italic>TLK2</italic> expression is primarily upregulated by copy-number increase at this locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <italic>R</italic>=0.81), and correlates with increased tumour stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Among all the breast cancer subtypes, luminal B breast cancers most frequently harbour <italic>TLK2</italic> amplifications (21.3&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>), and also present the highest <italic>TLK2</italic> expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Here, the Luminal B subtyping is based on the 50-gene PAM50 predictor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> using Agilent gene expression data, and is provided by TCGA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>TLK2 overexpression correlates with worse clinical outcome</title><p>To examine the prognostic effect of <italic>TLK2</italic> overexpression (OE), we analysed the available survival data for TCGA breast cancer patients and compared the group of patients with <italic>TLK2</italic>-high tumours versus the rest (see Methods). This revealed a significantly worse overall survival of the <italic>TLK2</italic>-high group (based on log-rank test, <italic>P</italic>=0.040). <italic>TLK2</italic> is mostly amplified in ER&#x0002b; breast cancers, which are commonly treated with endocrine therapy. To examine if endocrine therapy can eliminate the prognostic effect of <italic>TLK2</italic> OE, we analysed the gene expression data set by Loi <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> for 263 ER&#x0002b; breast tumours treated with adjuvant tamoxifen monotherapy, which revealed a significantly worse recurrence-free survival of patients with <italic>TLK2</italic>-high tumours (based on log-rank test, <italic>P</italic>=0.001). To further corroborate this finding, we analysed a large gene expression data set for breast cancers with treatment and prognostic information (the Metabric data set)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Among the 220 ER&#x0002b; breast cancer patients with no adjuvant treatment, those with <italic>TLK2</italic>-high tumours showed significantly worse disease-specific survival than the rest of the patients (based on log-rank test, <italic>P=</italic>0.012). The prognostic effect is preserved in the 389 ER&#x0002b; breast cancer patients treated with endocrine monotherapy (based on log-rank test, <italic>P=</italic>0.012). Of note, about 93&#x00025; of the untreated and endocrine-treated ER&#x0002b; tumours of the Metabric data set are Her2 negative. These data support a poorer outcome of patients with <italic>TLK2</italic>-high tumours irrespective of endocrine therapy.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Phenotypic changes following ectopic expression of <italic>TLK2</italic></title><p>To assess <italic>TLK2</italic> expression levels in breast cancer cell lines and benign breast epithelial cells, we analysed the Affymetrix exon 1.0 ST expression array data from a previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. High-<italic>TLK2</italic> expression was observed in multiple breast cancer cell lines (particularly ER&#x0002b;/Her2&#x02212; lines), but not in benign breast epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). This result was further verified through western blot analysis of a subset of these cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). To determine the transforming activity of TLK2, we selected the MCF10A benign breast epithelial cell line and the <italic>TLK2</italic>-low luminal breast cancer cell line T47D (ER&#x0002b;/Her2&#x02212;) for the engineering of <italic>TLK2</italic> ectopic OE models. To achieve tuned TLK2 OE, we engineered the coding region of <italic>TLK2</italic> into a doxycycline-inducible lentiviral vector, which was then transduced into these two cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3a</xref>). Following 2 weeks of TLK2 induction, MCF10A or T47D cells expressing TLK2 did not show significant increase in clonogenic growth compared with the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3b</xref>). However, soft-agar colony formation assays revealed significantly increased anchorage-independent growth after TLK2 overexpression in T47D cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p><p>To test if TLK2 may enhance cell invasiveness, we gauged the cell motility and invasion capability after TLK2 overexpression using transwell migration and invasion assays. Interestingly, inducible TLK2 overexpression in MCF10A or T47D cells strongly enhanced the cell migration and invasion capabilities in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3d</xref>). To attribute this to the excess of TLK2 protein, we abolished TLK2 expression by withdrawing the Dox induction in these cell models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3d</xref>). This eradicated the increased migration and invasion capabilities in both lines, suggesting the dependence of these properties on TLK2 expression itself. These data suggest the role of TLK2 in augmenting cell invasiveness. To examine the cell signalling changes following TLK2 overexpression in the T47D breast cancer cells, we performed western blot analysis of an array of signalling molecules in breast cancer. Interestingly, while the canonical growth factor signalling molecules in breast cancer such as AKT and ERK were not activated with TLK2 overexpression, markedly increased phosphorylation of SRC on Y416 in the activation loop of its kinase domain, as well as modest increased activating phosphorylation of FAK and p38 were observed in the T47D cells overexpressing TLK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). In addition, increased EGFR protein level and phosphorylation at the activating sites (Y845 and Y1068) as well as increased Her2 auto-phosphorylation (Y1248 and Y1221/1222) are observed with TLK2 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Besides these changes, SKP2 protein level was also markedly elevated, and we will discuss later the significance of this alternation. SRC has a key role in breast cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, and activation of the FAK-SRC complex is known to mediate EGF-induced cell motility<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. This suggests the possible involvement of the EGFR/SRC/FAK axis in the enhanced invasiveness driven by TLK2.</p><p>To access the significance of SRC, FAK and EGFR in TLK2-driven cell motility, we silenced SRC, FAK or EGFR using established siRNAs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, and assessed transwell cell migration. Interestingly, silencing of either SRC, FAK or EGFR in TLK2-overexpressing T47D cells significantly diminished the cell migration, suggesting that the EGFR/SRC/FAK axis may be involved in the enhanced invasiveness driven by TLK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). To examine if TLK2 interacts with SRC, we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) of cytoplasm or nuclear fractions of the MCF7 cells expressing FLAG-tagged TLK2 using an established monoclonal antibody against SRC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, and detected the presence of TLK2 in SRC complex with anti-FLAG antibody. As a result, we observed the co-precipitation of TLK2 with SRC in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that EGFR/SRC/FAK axis may be important in TLK2-driven invasiveness in breast cancer cells, and TLK2 may engage this axis via interaction with SRC.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>TLK2 silencing selectively inhibits <italic>TLK2</italic>-high cancer cells</title><p>Next, we went on to examine the effect of TLK2 silencing on breast cancer cell growth. Among the <italic>TLK2</italic>-high breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and MDAMB361 show the highest <italic>TLK2</italic> expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), and also harbour high levels of <italic>TLK2</italic> amplifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). MCF7 and MDAMB361 are both ER&#x0002b; luminal breast cancer cells, and are negative or positive for Her2, respectively. Thus these two cell lines will be ideal to study the effect of TLK2 inhibition in <italic>TLK2</italic>-amplified luminal breast cancer cells with different Her2 status. To affirm the <italic>TLK2</italic> amplifications in these two cell lines, we performed fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) using a TLK2-specific probe and a centromere 17 probe (CEN17). As a result, the FISH assay verified <italic>TLK2</italic> amplifications in the MCF7 and MDAMB361 cells with a TLK2:CEN17 ratio of 3.9 and 2.6, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). In addition to these <italic>TLK2</italic>-amplified breast cancer cell lines, we also selected a ER&#x0002b;/Her2&#x02212; luminal breast cancer cell line with moderately high <italic>TLK2</italic> but without <italic>TLK2</italic> amplification (CAMA1), a <italic>TLK2</italic>-low ER&#x0002b;/Her2&#x02212; luminal breast cancer (ZR75-1), and two benign epithelial cell lines (MCF12A and MCF10A). A MISSION esiRNA (Sigma) against <italic>TLK2</italic> was then introduced into these selected cell lines, and the knockdown efficiency was verified by western blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b, c</xref>). The esiRNA is an endoribonuclease prepared siRNA pool that can deliver highly specific and effective gene silencing with lower off-target effects than single or pooled siRNAs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. In addition, a TLK2 siRNA&#x00023;1 targeting a different region from that of the esiRNA was also selected and verified as above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b, c</xref>). The specificity of these siRNAs against TLK2 but not its paralogue TLK1 was verified by quantitative PCR and western blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a, b</xref>). MTT cell proliferation assays revealed that specific silencing of TLK2 by esiRNA or siRNA potently inhibited the growth of <italic>TLK2</italic>-high breast cancer cells (MCF7, MDAMB361 and CAMA1), but not that of the <italic>TLK2</italic>-low luminal ZR75-1 breast cancer cells or MCF12A and MCF10A benign breast epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>).

Ectopic expression of TLK2 resulted in a significant rescue of the knockdown effect by TLK2 siRNA&#x00023;2 in a dose-dependent manner, which validates the specificity of the TLK2 shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The effect of TLK2 inhibition in a xenograft tumour model</title><p>To examine the therapeutic effect of TLK2 inhibition in a preclinical mouse model, we transplanted the MCF7 cells inducibly expressing the TLK2 shRNA into female athymic nude mice, and assessed the potential therapeutic effect of TLK2 inhibition in the <italic>in vivo</italic> context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). As most ER&#x0002b; breast tumours are treated with endocrine therapy, we also examined the combination effect of TLK2 inhibition together with tamoxifen, the most commonly used endocrine agent. Upon tumour establishment, mice were randomized and treated with vehicle or tamoxifen (Tam), and further subdivided into &#x000b1;doxycycline treatments. To verify the effectiveness of TLK2 inhibition, a subset of tumours were harvested after 2 weeks of treatment, and analysed by western blot. To observe relative long-term therapeutic effects, the rest of the mice were monitored for up to 100 days depending on the duration of tumour control. Our result showed that TLK2 inhibition alone or in combination with tamoxifen substantially inhibited the growth of MCF7 xenograft tumours. Kaplan&#x02013;Meier survival analysis revealed a significant increase in progression-free survival in TLK2 inhibition alone or concomitant TLK2 inhibition and tamoxifen treatment groups compared with the control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). While the tumours in the combined treatment group still re-grew after 70 days of treatment, this could be attributable to the loss of TLK2 inhibition as suggested by the western blot analysis of tumours harvested at the end of the treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Such loss of target inhibition in the inducible knockdown tumour model after long-term induction of shRNA expression may be due to the selective pressure imposed by the target inhibition, which has been observed by others as well<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Together, these data provided a proof of concept for the therapeutic value of TLK2 inhibition in <italic>TLK2</italic>-amplified breast cancers.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The signalling changes following TLK2 inhibition</title><p>To systematically profile the cell signalling changes after TLK2 inhibition, we performed reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis of the MCF7 cells treated with TLK2 siRNAs as well as the xenograft tumours harvested after two weeks of TLK2 inhibition, using 200 validated antibodies against an array of key signalling molecules in cancer. We then isolated the consistently altered signalling molecules across different <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> TLK2 knockdown models based on student's <italic>t</italic>-test at 90&#x00025; confidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). This revealed several consistently altered signalling molecules after TLK2 inhibition, among which BCL2 and ER&#x003b1; are the most significantly down-regulated proteins (based on <italic>t</italic>-test, the average <italic>P</italic> value for BCL2 is 0.0005, and average <italic>P</italic> value for ER&#x003b1; is 0.0252) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a, b</xref>). The downregulation of BCL2 and ER&#x003b1; after TLK2 knockdown were further verified by western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). To test if these effects may be due to the off-target effects of TLK2 siRNAs, we examined the expression of BCL2 and ER&#x003b1; transcripts following TLK2 knockdown by quantitative PCR, which revealed no significant change or even upregulation of the mRNA levels of BCL2 and ER&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>). This suggests that the modulations of BCL2 and ER&#x003b1; by TLK2 knockdown are mainly at the protein level. To examine if TLK2 overexpression upregulates BCL2 and ER&#x003b1; protein level in breast tumour tissues, we compared the BCL2 and ER&#x003b1; protein level in ER-positive breast cancers with or without TLK2 overexpression using the RPPA data available from TCGA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). As a result, we found that ER&#x003b1; protein is significantly elevated in <italic>TLK2</italic>-high breast tumours (based on <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic>=0.041), in spite of a slight increase of ESR1 transcript (based on <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic>=0.158). While both BCL2 transcript and protein are slightly higher in <italic>TLK2</italic>-high tumours, such differences are not statistically significant. This suggests that TLK2 may play a role in modulating ER&#x003b1; protein level in breast tumours, whereas the BCL2 response may be an effect specific to TLK2 inhibition.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>TLK2 silencing impedes G1/S transition and induces apoptosis</title><p>To examine the impact of TLK2 inhibition on cell cycle progression, we performed flow cytometry of DNA content after TLK2 knockdown in asynchronized MCF7 and MDAMB361 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>, TLK2 knockdown led to substantial increase of G1 phase cells and decrease of S-phase cells, suggesting delayed cell cycle progression through the G1/S border. TLK2 inhibition also potently induced apoptosis in MCF7 and MDAMB361 cells, as shown by Annexin V assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). To observe the dynamic cell cycle progression after TLK2 knockdown, we performed a series of flow cytometry analyses following TLK2 knockdown by esiRNA in the MCF7 cells synchronized with a double thymidine (DT) block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). Consistently, we observed delayed cell cycle progression through the G1/S border. In addition, western blot analysis revealed sustained high cyclin E level and low cyclin A level in response to TLK2 inhibition after cell cycle release from the DT block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>), suggesting that these cells were hindered from progressing into S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we also observed a markedly increased p27 protein level, and a decreased level of SKP2, the key E3-ligase of p27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. p27 inhibits the cyclin D/Cdk4 and cyclin E/Cdk2 complexes, and blocks cell cycle progression through the G1/S border<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Thus the impeded G1/S transition may be attributable to increased p27 level. Interestingly, enhanced phosphorylation of p27 at T187 was also observed with TLK2 silencing. The phosphorylation of T187 is known to target p27 to the SCF<sup>Skp2</sup> ubiquitin ligase complex and proteasome-mediated degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. This suggests that the increased p27 protein level may be attributable to the decrease in SKP2, the key E3-ligase of p27, instead of impaired T187 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we also observed a decrease in phosphorylated Rb (S807/S811) after TLK2 inhibition. Since p27 inhibits cyclin D/Cdk4 and cyclin E/Cdk2, the key upstream kinases of Rb (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>), the increased p27 after TLK2 knockdown may prevent Rb phosphorylation and subsequent E2F release<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>.</p><p>To verify the above results, we synchronized the MCF7 cells at M phase via a nocodazole block, and the cell cycle was released in the condition of TLK2 inhibition by the siRNA&#x00023;1 that targets a different region from TLK2 esiRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). Cells were then subjected to flow cytometry analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). The nocodazole mediated mitotic block allowed observing the cell cycle progression from M to G1, then to S-phase. Consistent with the DT block results, TLK2 inhibition delayed cell cycle progression through the G1/S border after MCF7 cells were released from mitotic arrest.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Differential cellular response to TLK2 or TLK1 inhibition</title><p>To observe the different roles of TLK2 and TLK1 in cell cycle regulation, we performed comparative cell cycle analyses of nocodazole-synchronized MCF7 cells in the condition of either TLK2 or TLK1 inhibition. TLK2 inhibition was accomplished using TLK2 esiRNA, whereas TLK1 was silenced using a specific siRNA previously documented<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. To precisely determine the S-phase cell population, we incubated the cells with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU), the S-phase DNA synthesis marker, before cell collection. Cells were then subjected to flow cytometry analysis, and cell cycle distribution was determined based on both DNA content and BrdU incorporation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). In addition, cell signalling changes were monitored for up to 72&#x02009;h to observe if there is enhanced apoptosis following impaired G1/S progression. Interestingly, while TLK2 inhibition led to delayed G1/S progression, TLK1 repression resulted in delayed S-phase progression, consistent with its known function in promoting chromatin assembly during S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. This suggests the distinct roles of TLK1 and TLK2 in cell cycle regulation.</p><p>Consistent with the previous data, western blots showed downregulation of SKP2, upregulation of p27, as well as increased cyclin E and decreased cyclin A levels after TLK2 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref>). Further, we also observed repression of BCL2 and ER&#x003b1; after TLK2 inhibition. BCL2 is an anti-apoptotic factor overexpressed in MCF7 cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Consistent with BCL2 repression, increased cleavage of caspase 3 and of PARP was observed in the TLK2-repressed MCF7 cells, suggesting induction of apoptosis. In contrast, inhibition of its paralog TLK1 did not significantly affect the BCL2 protein level, and there is no significant induction of cleaved caspase 3 or PARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref>, lower panel). To further verify this observation, we performed Annexin V assays after TLK2 or TLK1 silencing in MCF7 and MDAMB361 cells. While TLK2 inhibition significantly induced apoptosis, there was no significant increase in apoptosis after TLK1 silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8c</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these data suggest that, while TLK1 and TLK2 are close paralogs, these two kinases may play different roles in cell cycle regulation. Silencing of TLK1 or TLK2 appears to result in distinct cell cycle alterations and different effects on apoptosis in luminal breast cancer cells overexpressing TLK2.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>A kinase profiling data set reveals potential TLK2 inhibitors</title><p>To identify potential TLK2 inhibitors, we investigated a publicly available kinase profiling data set that profiled the activity of 158 structurally diverse kinase inhibitors against 234 recombinant protein kinases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. We ranked these kinase inhibitors based on their activities against the TLK2 kinase, and evaluated their potential off-target effects based on the number of kinases against which the inhibitors presented stronger activities than TLK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9a</xref>). Interestingly, two PKC inhibitors Go6983 and GF109203X were found to possess relatively strong and selective activities against TLK2. Both compounds are ATP-competitive inhibitors that bind to the ATP pocket of the PKC kinase catalytic domain. Kinase profiling data suggest that both Go6983 and GF109203X inhibit &#x0223c;98&#x00025; of TLK2 kinase activity at 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M. We therefore performed <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays with myelin basic protein as a substrate, using recombinant active TLK2 proteins (SignalChem) treated with different doses of Go6983 or GF109203X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9b</xref>). Both compounds resulted in potent inhibition of TLK2 activity at 5 or 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M. To assess their therapeutic effects via TLK2, we dosed MCF7 cells inducibly expressing TLK2 with 4&#x02009;&#x003bc;M Go6983 or GF109203X, and measured cell viability via clonogenic assays. Both compounds strongly inhibited cell viability, whereas induction of TLK2 overexpression can partially rescue the effect in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9c</xref>). This suggests that the therapeutic effects of these PKC inhibitors are at least partially via their actions against TLK2. Between these compounds, Go6983 showed a better inhibitory effect on cell viability and a stronger rescue effect from TLK2 overexpression. While Go6983 and GF109203X may not be applicable <italic>in vivo</italic> due to their off-target effects and the requirement of high doses to sufficiently inhibit TLK2 activity, these compounds could possibly serve as backbones for the future development of more potent and specific TLK2 inhibitors.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, ConSig-Amp analysis nominated <italic>TLK2</italic> as a candidate kinase target upregulated by genomic amplifications in more aggressive form of luminal breast cancers. <italic>TLK2</italic> amplification is independent of most known amplified oncogenes in breast cancer (that is, <italic>HER2, CCND1</italic> and <italic>MYC</italic>), except <italic>RPSKB1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). While <italic>TLK2</italic> is often co-amplified with <italic>RPSKB1</italic> due to their vicinity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), it is not uncommon that multiple closely located oncogenes are targeted by the same genomic amplifications in breast cancers, such as the co-amplifications of <italic>ERBB2</italic> and <italic>GRB7</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>), <italic>FGFR1</italic> and <italic>WHSC1L1</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>), or <italic>PAK1</italic> and <italic>GAB2</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). In fact, genomic amplifications in cancer usually affect multiple genes in the amplified regions. Besides luminal breast cancer cells, <italic>TLK2</italic> is also overexpressed in a few ER-negative breast cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). However, these cell lines typically do not harbour high <italic>TLK2</italic> amplifications, and TCGA copy-number data suggest that <italic>TLK2</italic> amplifications are much more frequent in ER-positive than negative breast cancers, 10.5&#x00025; versus 2.9&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). Consistently the latest phosphoproteomic study of TCGA breast tumours by The Clinical Proteomic Tumour Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) independently identified TLK2 as an amplicon-associated highly phosphorylated kinases in luminal breast cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, which further support the significance of <italic>TLK2</italic> amplification and its preferential association with luminal tumours. Our study is the first comprehensive analysis of TLK2 function in aggressive luminal breast cancers, which will timely complement the CPTAC paper. Our data showed that ectopic overexpression of TLK2 in the T47D luminal breast cancer cells markedly increased cell migration and invasion, whereas withdrawal of TLK2 expression eliminated this effect, suggesting the direct role of TLK2 in enhanced invasiveness. Furthermore, we found that TLK2 may involve the EGFR/SRC/FAK axis to enhance breast cancer cell invasiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e&#x02013;g</xref>). Future studies will be needed to understand the precise mechanisms of TLK2-driven cell invasiveness and how exactly TLK2 interacts with the EGFR/SRC/FAK axis.</p><p>More important, breast cancer cells that harbour <italic>TLK2</italic> amplifications appear to have been addicted to TLK2 overexpression, so that TLK2 knockdown causes potent growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis. In addition, we observed a selective effect of TLK2 inhibition on <italic>TLK2</italic>-high breast cancer cells versus <italic>TLK2</italic>-low breast cancer cells or benign breast epithelial cells. Of note, these effects appear to be sustained in the breast cancer cells that have already developed resistance to endocrine therapy. Our mechanistic studies suggest that TLK2 inhibition downregulates SKP2, upregulates p27, and impedes cell cycle progression through the G1/S border. In addition, we found that TLK2 inhibition consistently suppresses ER&#x003b1; and BCL2 protein level <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, which may contribute to the substantially decreased cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis after TLK2 inhibition. In contrast, inhibition of the TLK2 paralog, TLK1, resulted in a delay in S-phase progression, and did not significantly induce apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). This is the first observation on a role of TLK2 distinct from that of TLK1 in regulation of cell cycle progression&#x02014;the latter (TLK1) has been known to promote chromatin assembly during S-phase.</p><p>It is interesting to note that ectopic expression of TLK2 in T47D cells did not increase cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). While TLK2 overexpression upregulates SKP2, the key E3-ubiquitin ligase of p27 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>), we found that p27 protein level is not significantly down-regulated. This suggests that additional prerequisites may be needed to fulfill TLK2 function in modulating p27 and G1/S cell cycle progression. One possibility is that <italic>RPS6KB1</italic> is frequently co-amplified with <italic>TLK2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), which may provide additional genetic background for the action of endogenously overexpressed TLK2 in breast cancer cells. Alternatively, the microenvironment of the primary tumours may provide additional signalling required for the action of endogenous TLK2. This reflects the limitations of ectopic expression cell line models in studying the action of amplified oncogenes, as such models may not possess the genetic background or microenvironment required for the full actions of endogenously amplified oncogenes, and therefore may not faithfully reproduce the mechanistic and phenotypic aspects of the oncogenes.</p><p>Furthermore, our <italic>in vivo</italic> data suggest that TLK2 inhibition may possess viable therapeutic value in <italic>TLK2</italic>-amplified luminal breast tumours. As shown by the study of a preclinical xenograft tumour model, TLK2 inhibition significantly improved progression-free survival. Nevertheless, we admit the limitations of our <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> cell line models on predicting therapeutic values, due to excessive clonal evolutions of <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured cells and lack of stromal interactions. Future studies will be required to further evaluate the therapeutic effect of TLK2 inhibition in patient-derived xenograft tumour models, and ultimately in clinical trials of breast cancer. Of note, <italic>TLK2</italic> appears to be more frequently amplified than other known cell cycle kinases or checkpoint kinases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> in breast cancers as shown by TCGA copy-number data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). The selective effect of TLK2 inhibition against <italic>TLK2</italic>-high breast cancer cells as compared with benign breast epithelial cells suggests a possible more selective cellular effect of TLK2 inhibitors as compared with the inhibitors of other cell cycle kinases that do not show cancer cell specificity. Moreover, we have identified two potential TLK2 inhibitors and tested their therapeutic activities against TLK2 <italic>in vitro</italic>. These compounds could serve as backbones for future drug development. Taken together, these facts position TLK2 as an attractive cell cycle kinase target for more aggressive luminal breast cancers that harbour <italic>TLK2</italic> amplifications.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Integrative ConSig-amp analysis</title><p>To discover new therapeutic targets in ER&#x0002b; breast cancer, we analysed the copy number (Affymetrix SNP 6.0) and RNAseq (UNC RNAseqV2) data sets available for breast tumours from The Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.

The cell cycle distributions were determined based on DNA content and BrdU incorporation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). (<bold>b</bold>) Western blot was done to examine the changes of key signalling molecules involved in G1/S cell cycle regulation and apoptosis using the cell lysates obtained from same experiment as in Fig. 8a. &#x02018;Noc' indicates the MCF7 cells synchronized at mitosis by nocodazole block (before cell cycle release).
