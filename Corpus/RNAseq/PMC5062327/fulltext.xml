Here we show that many worm-hunting and snail-hunting cones also express venom insulins, and that this novel gene family has diversified explosively. Cone snails express a highly conserved insulin in their nerve ring; presumably this conventional signaling insulin is finely tuned to the <italic>Conus</italic> insulin receptor, which also evolves very slowly. By contrast, the venom insulins diverge rapidly, apparently in response to biotic interactions with prey and also possibly the cones&#x02019; own predators and competitors. Thus, the inwardly directed signaling insulins appear to experience predominantly purifying sele\ction to target an internal receptor that seldom changes, while the outwardly directed venom insulins frequently experience directional selection to target heterospecific insulin receptors in a changing mix of prey, predators and competitors. Prey insulin receptors may often be constrained in ways that prevent their evolutionary escape from targeted venom insulins, if amino-acid substitutions that result in escape also degrade the receptor&#x02019;s signaling functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>venom</kwd><kwd>insulin gene family</kwd><kwd>diversification</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The fish-hunting geographer cone snail, <italic>Conus geographus</italic>, was recently shown to use a derived venom insulin, Con-Ins G1, in prey capture (<xref rid="msw174-B30" ref-type="bibr">Safavi-Hemami et al. 2015</xref>). The snails appear to release this &#x0201c;weaponized&#x0201d; insulin into the water to induce hypoglycemic shock in the fish on which they prey. Remarkably, Con-Ins G1 is more similar to fish insulins than to molluscan insulins expressed in endocrine cells, and it activates the fish insulin receptor, causing rapid depletion of blood glucose and impaired swimming behavior (<xref rid="msw174-B30" ref-type="bibr">Safavi-Hemami et al. 2015</xref>). Con-Ins G1 is the smallest functional insulin reported to date, and like other venom peptides in cone snails (but unlike any other characterized insulins), it carries several unusual post-translational modifications (&#x003b3;-carboxylated glutamate residues and hydoxylated prolines). These unique features have probably evolved to maximize biological activity in the prey (<xref rid="msw174-B30" ref-type="bibr">Safavi-Hemami et al. 2015</xref>).</p><p>Insulins and related peptides (insulin-like peptides, insulin-like growth factors and relaxins) form a large superfamily of hormones that occurs throughout the animals (<xref rid="msw174-B34" ref-type="bibr">Shabanpoor et al. 2009</xref>). In mammals, insulin is produced and released by the endocrine &#x003b2;-cells of the pancreas where its primary role is the regulation of glucose homeostasis. Insulin consists of an A and B chain, cross-linked by two disulfide bonds and a third disulfide bridge within the A chain (<xref rid="msw174-B1" ref-type="bibr">Adams et al. 1969</xref>). In vertebrates, the structure and physiological role of insulin remains highly conserved (<xref rid="msw174-B11" ref-type="bibr">Ebberink et al. 1989</xref>; <xref rid="msw174-B4" ref-type="bibr">Blumenthal 2010</xref>). By contrast, invertebrate insulins are more variable and can serve more diverse functions, including regulation of haemolymph glucose levels, neuronal signaling, memory, reproduction and growth (<xref rid="msw174-B11" ref-type="bibr">Ebberink et al. 1989</xref>; <xref rid="msw174-B35" ref-type="bibr">Smit et al. 1998</xref>). In mollusks, insulins are produced in endocrine cells associated with the gastrointestinal tract and neuroendocrine cells of the central nervous system (<xref rid="msw174-B11" ref-type="bibr">Ebberink et al. 1989</xref>; <xref rid="msw174-B35" ref-type="bibr">Smit et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="msw174-B12" ref-type="bibr">Floyd et al. 1999</xref>).</p><p>Our recent finding that a fish-like insulin is used as a weapon for prey capture by the fish-hunting <italic>C. geographus</italic> provided the first example of insulin in a venom, and apparently the first example of insulin being used for a nefarious purpose outside of humans (<xref rid="msw174-B30" ref-type="bibr">Safavi-Hemami et al. 2015</xref>). The ancestors of fish-hunting cone snails preyed on worms, as do many extant cone lineages. A few lineages have evolved to feed on molluscs (<xref rid="msw174-B24" ref-type="bibr">Olivera et al. 2015</xref>). Here, we show that many but not all cone snail species express venom insulins (in some cases more than one), and that these unusual insulins evolve rapidly and episodically in a pattern that suggests adaptation to the physiologies of diverse prey species. Although highly diversified in their structures and amino-acid sequences, the venom insulins share a conserved signal sequence that differs from the one required to secrete the cone&#x02019;s endocrine signaling insulin. All <italic>Conus</italic> species appear to express a signaling insulin in their nerve rings, and the amino-acid sequences of these conventional signaling insulins are highly conserved.</p><p>These findings suggest that early in the evolution of cone snails, a duplicated insulin gene was recruited for expression in the venom gland. As cones radiated and diversified ecologically, their venom insulins diverged in sequence and in expression levels, sometimes proliferating to form small families of venom insulins, but sometimes being lost.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Venom Insulins are Widely Expressed in Diverse Cone Snail Lineages</title><p>Transcriptome analysis of venom glands from several cone-snail species representing major branches of the phylogeny led to the identification of a diverse set of insulins that share sequence similarity to the previously described <italic>C. geographus</italic> venom insulin (<xref rid="msw174-B30" ref-type="bibr">Safavi-Hemami et al. 2015</xref>). The inferred amino-acid sequences all include a conserved N-terminal signal sequence, while the region encoding proinsulin (the A and B chains and the C peptide) shows considerable variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msw174-F1">fig. 1</xref>). The average pairwise sequence identity is 84% for the signal peptides, followed by 43%, 60% and 57% for the B chains, C-peptides and A chains, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msw174-F1">fig. 1</xref>). Such close juxtaposition of conserved and hypervariable regions is also seen regularly in cone snail venom toxins (conotoxins) (<xref rid="msw174-B10" ref-type="bibr">Duda and Palumbi 1999</xref>; <xref rid="msw174-B23" ref-type="bibr">Olivera 2006</xref>). Several cone snail species were found to express more than one venom insulin, indicating that the gene family has expanded in some but not all cone-snail lineages. The largest number of distinct venom insulin mRNAs in a single species was seven (found in <italic>C. geographus</italic>). In all, we found 32 distinct sequences in the venom glands of 21 species.

</p><p>Of the 21 species examined, six including the fish-hunting cone snail <italic>C. bullatus</italic> did not express the venom insulin class at detectable levels in their venom glands (<xref ref-type="table" rid="msw174-T1">table 1</xref>). However, by mining the <italic>C. bullatus</italic> venom gland transcriptome we identified an insulin-like sequence that shared little sequence identity with members of the venom-insulin class, although it shared significant similarity to the insulin-like peptide precursor II from the marine gastropod <italic>Aplysia californica</italic> (32% sequence identity, 91% coverage, <italic>e</italic>-value: 2e<sup>&#x02212;14</sup>). A similar sequence was also retrieved from the venom gland transcriptome of the worm-hunter <italic>C. virgo</italic> (96% sequence identity to the <italic>C. bullatus</italic> sequence). Members of the venom-insulin class generally do not show interspecific conservation as high as that seen for the <italic>C. virgo</italic> and <italic>C. bullatus</italic> insulin-like sequences (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msw174/-/DC1">supplementary fig. S1</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msw174/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online, for sequence alignments). Furthermore, with between one and five reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (rpkm), expression levels were close to the lower limit of detection by RNAseq for venom gland transcripts, while reads for the venom insulin class were as abundant as 66,172 rpkm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="msw174-T2">table 2</xref>). This finding implied that there are at least two kinds of insulins in cone snails, one forming a major component of venom (the venom-insulin class), and the other expressed at low levels in endocrine or neuroendocrine cells (the signaling-insulin class).

There is also considerable variation in the lengths of the A and B chains, and in the numbers and placements of cysteine residues. Phylogenetic analysis of amino-acid substitutions in the venom insulins of 15 species yielded an overall branching pattern congruent with recently published phylogenies of the genus <italic>Conus</italic> (<xref rid="msw174-B25" ref-type="bibr">Puillandre et al. 2014</xref>), with distinct groups observed for worm-, snail- and fish-hunters.

For example, in pairwise comparisons among 17 representative sequences from the 15 species shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="msw174-F3">figure 3</xref>, the mean d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>S</sub> (&#x003c9;) over 73 codons present in the proinsulins of all 17 sequences is 2.30, and 71% of the 136 pairwise estimates are &#x0003e;1.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msw174/-/DC1">supplementary table S2</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msw174/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). A tree-structured test for positive selection (comparing M8 to M7 in PAML) strongly favors a model in which 36% of the 73 codons evolve with an average &#x003c9; of 3.09 (M8, lnL&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;2053.87, 36 parameters), in comparison to the otherwise equivalent model where &#x003c9; is constrained to be &#x0003c;1.0 at all sites (M7, lnL&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;2082.08, 34 parameters, 2&#x00394;lnL&#x02009;=&#x02009;56.42, df&#x02009;=&#x02009;2, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.6e-13).</p><p>Branch-specific estimates of &#x003c9; on the phylogeny are mostly &#x0003e;1.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msw174-F5">fig. 5</xref>), but they are much more variable than the pairwise estimates, suggesting that adaptive evolution of the amino-acid sequences may have been highly episodic. This inference is supported by the much higher likelihood of a model with independent estimates of &#x003c9; for each branch (lnL&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;2085.94, 63 parameters) than of a model with one common value of &#x003c9; (=1.23) for all branches (lnL&#x02009;= &#x02212;2113.61, 33 parameters, 2&#x00394;lnL&#x02009;=&#x02009;55.34, df&#x02009;=&#x02009;30, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003). Although this estimate of the overall &#x003c9; for venom insulins suggests that d<sub>N</sub> may have exceeded d<sub>S</sub> on average, the 95% confidence interval (0.77&#x02013;1.69) includes &#x003c9;&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.

</p><p>Even within the hypervariable A and B chains, some amino-acid positions are highly conserved in some species (e.g., the cysteines that make disulfide bridges). This site-to-site rate heterogeneity is reflected visually in the sequence logo displayed along the top of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="msw174-F1">figure 1</xref>, and is consistent with the result of the M8/M7 test described earlier. We used the method of <xref rid="msw174-B42" ref-type="bibr">Murrell et al. (2015)</xref> to test simultaneously for rate heterogeneity among sites and among branches in the tree, especially those branches following shifts from worm-hunting to mollusk-hunting, and from worm-hunting to fish-hunting. A model with all branches in the foreground estimated a very high rate of amino-acid substitution (&#x003c9;<sub>3&#x02009;</sub>=<sub>&#x02009;</sub>8.94) at 21% of branch-site combinations, and yielded a significantly higher likelihood than the null model of no positive selection (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.00001). Shifts from worm-hunting to mollusk-hunting and fish-hunting are also associated with strong signals of positive selection, on all five branches that we tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msw174-F5">fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>The three venom-insulin paralogs in <italic>C. geographus</italic> and <italic>C. tulipa</italic> also have evolved episodically.

Then following a second duplication, one paralog hardly changed (Geographus_3) while the other (Geographus_1b/Tulipa) experienced a burst of amino-acid substitution (&#x003c9;<sub>3&#x02009;</sub>=<sub>&#x02009;</sub>40 at 27% of branch-site combinations) and then slowed down in <italic>C. geographus</italic> following the speciation event giving rise to <italic>C. tulipa</italic>.

A sequence corresponding to intron 2 (partial) and exon 3 (complete) of the venom insulin Con-Ins G1 was sequenced by Genome Walker PCR. Intron/Exon boundaries were shared with other insulin genes demonstrating that this venom insulin originated from a signaling insulin precursor. This partial sequence was blasted against sequences from a <italic>C. geographus</italic> fosmid DNA library, yielding a longer exact match in which intron 2 is at least 8,282&#x000a0;bp, which is longer than the intron 2 sequences described to date for other species (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msw174/-/DC1">supplementary fig.

Significant expansion of the venom insulin gene family, high d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>S</sub> ratios, and high expression levels in the venom glands of diverse cone snail species strongly suggest that the use of insulins in prey capture (and/or defense and/or competition) is widespread in <italic>Conus</italic>. If the venom insulins principally target the insulin receptors of prey species, then they might be expected to resemble the native (signaling) insulins of those prey species. To test this prediction, we carried out principal components analyses (PCA) on a large suite of structural and chemical characteristics of the currently known venom and signaling insulins of cone snails, and the signaling insulins of potential prey species (fish, snails and worms); see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msw174/-/DC1">supplementary table S3</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msw174/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online, for a list of sequences used in these analyses. PCA transforms a large group of correlated variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables (the principal components) that are more easily interpretable and that account for most of the variability among the sequences. A similar method, factor analysis, has been used to distinguish among amino-acid sequences (<xref rid="msw174-B3" ref-type="bibr">Atchley and Fernandes 2005</xref>). The variables scored to characterize the insulins include length, charge, hydrophobicity, number and placement of cysteine residues, and other features of their chemical makeup (Materials and Methods). In analyses of the cone-snail insulins alone, the first two principal components clearly separate venom insulins from signaling insulins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msw174-F6">fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>). In addition, the venom insulins of fish-hunters are distinct from those of worm- and snail-hunters, except for two insulins previously identified in <italic>C. geographus</italic> as &#x0201c;snail-like&#x0201d; (black arrow) (<xref rid="msw174-B30" ref-type="bibr">Safavi-Hemami et al. 2015</xref>).</p><p>In analyses of venom insulins together with those of potential prey species, the venom insulins of fish-hunters group most closely with fish signaling insulins, especially on PC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msw174-F6">fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msw174/-/DC1">supplementary table S4</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msw174/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). A qualitatively similar pattern occurs for the venom insulins of mollusk-hunters; they differ significantly from the signaling insulins of mollusks, but nonetheless appear more similar to them than to the signaling insulins of worms and fish. These patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that venom insulins in these species mostly target the insulin receptors of their prey.</p><p>The venom insulins of worm-hunters do not group with worm signaling insulins, but instead with molluscan insulins (both venom and signaling). One potential explanation is that the venom insulins of worm-hunters are used mainly in defense against other mollusks rather than in predation on worms. Interestingly, worm signaling insulins appear to be more diverse than those of fish and snails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msw174-F6">fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>). Thus, the insulins of worms actually preyed on by <italic>Conus</italic> species could differ considerably from those used in this analysis, which were collected opportunistically from the public databases. Future functional studies of venom insulins isolated from worm- and snail-hunting cone snails should reveal their real targets.</p><p>Additional PCA restricted to the regions of the venom sequences subject to positive selection (A chain, B chain and C peptide) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msw174/-/DC1">supplementary fig.

First, a conventional signaling insulin is expressed in the nerve ring of all <italic>Conus</italic> species analyzed. This insulin presumably regulates energy metabolism within the snail, and its amino-acid sequence is nearly identical in fish-hunting and nonfish-hunting species. Second, in several (but not all) species, one or more derived insulins are expressed in the venom gland. Some of these venom-insulin genes are transcribed at extremely high levels, and the encoded insulins are abundant components of the snail&#x02019;s venom (as previously documented for the Con-Ins G1 insulin from <italic>C. geographus</italic>). The venom insulins differ dramatically from the signaling insulins and from each other.</p><p>In this and other respects, the venom insulins appear to function and to evolve like other components of <italic>Conus</italic> venoms. Like the well-known conotoxins that target neurotransmitter receptors, venom insulins appear to interact not with endogenous macromolecules but with molecular targets in other species (<xref rid="msw174-B10" ref-type="bibr">Duda and Palumbi 1999</xref>, <xref rid="msw174-B9" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; <xref rid="msw174-B23" ref-type="bibr">Olivera 2006</xref>; <xref rid="msw174-B26" ref-type="bibr">Puillandre et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="msw174-B36" ref-type="bibr">Sunagar and Moran 2015</xref>). In addition, they evolve extremely rapidly like conotoxins (<xref rid="msw174-B26" ref-type="bibr">Puillandre et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="msw174-B6" ref-type="bibr">Chang and Duda 2012</xref>; <xref rid="msw174-B38" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al. 2013</xref>).</p><p>The ancestral prey of cone snails were polychaete worms. Some cone-snail lineages later shifted to mollusks and fish, and diversified extensively (<xref rid="msw174-B19" ref-type="bibr">Kohn 1956</xref>, <xref rid="msw174-B20" ref-type="bibr">1966</xref>; <xref rid="msw174-B8" ref-type="bibr">Duda et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="msw174-B25" ref-type="bibr">Puillandre et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="msw174-B24" ref-type="bibr">Olivera et al. 2015</xref>). A venom insulin that efficiently targeted the insulin receptor of a fish would presumably differ from one that efficiently targeted the insulin receptor of a mollusk or a worm. Consistent with this expectation, the venom insulins of fish-hunting <italic>Conus</italic> tend to resemble the signaling insulins of fish (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="msw174-F6">fig. 6</xref>). Likewise, the venom insulins expressed in the mollusk-hunting clades tend to be relatively similar to gastropod insulins. This broad pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that at least many of these venom insulins are used in prey capture, and that as a consequence they are strongly selected to interact with the insulin receptors of prey that appear regularly in a cone&#x02019;s diet.</p><p>The venom-insulin genes are clearly homologous to signaling-insulin genes, implying that they probably arose by duplication and divergence from an ancestral signaling insulin, early in the history of <italic>Conus.</italic> And apparently, in some lineages, subsequent duplications have given rise to multiple paralogs, as in <italic>C. geographus</italic>, where there are at least three distinct venom insulins. While two of these are fish-like in various chemical properties including the cysteine framework, the third differs considerably and more closely resembles molluscan insulins. One intriguing possibility is that this venom insulin may function mainly in defensive or competitive interactions with other gastropod molluscs, rather than in prey capture.</p><p>However, not all lineages that inherit one or more venom insulins seem to retain them. Among fish-hunting lineages, the subgenus <italic>Gastridium</italic> (which includes <italic>C. geographus</italic> and <italic>C. tulipa</italic>) does express venom insulins, but two other subgenera, <italic>Pionoconus</italic> (<italic>C. striatus)</italic> and <italic>Textilia</italic> (<italic>C. bullatus</italic>) do not appear to express a venom-insulin gene. Differing prey capture strategies may explain this difference. <italic>Conus geographus</italic> appears to release venom insulins into the water to make an entire school of small fish hypoglycemic, thereby enhancing the snail&#x02019;s ability to engulf multiple fish. In contrast, fish-hunting species in the other subgenera capture fish by causing hyper-excitability of the nervous system and rapid onset of a tetanic paralysis. There may be no role for a venom insulin in this prey-capture strategy (<xref rid="msw174-B24" ref-type="bibr">Olivera et al. 2015</xref>). <italic>Conus tulipa</italic> is a close relative of <italic>C. geographus</italic> and presumably inherited the three or more paralogs found in that species, but it appears to express only one of them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msw174-F5">fig. 5</xref>). Similarly, we found both mollusk-hunting and worm-hunting lineages that express a venom insulin, but two worm-hunting lineages that apparently do not. Additionally, several worm-hunting species exhibit low levels of venom insulin expression suggesting that insulins have been inherited but may have ceased to be important in these species.</p><p>Selection should strongly favor resistance to <italic>Conus</italic> venoms. Do prey insulin receptors ever acquire amino-acid substitutions that allow them to escape their predator&#x02019;s venom insulin? And if so, do venom insulins then acquire compensating substitutions that restore binding to recently escaped receptors, and so on, in the dynamic often referred to as &#x0201c;Red Queen&#x0201d; coevolution (<xref rid="msw174-B37" ref-type="bibr">Van Valen 1973</xref>)? A prey species that modified its insulin receptor to escape a venom insulin might suffer large costs arising from interference with its own insulin signaling pathways, which would then need to be readjusted in other ways. For the resulting benefits to be large enough to offset such costs, the prey species would probably need to experience a particular <italic>Conus</italic> species as a major, persistent source of mortality. Dietary breadth varies greatly among cone-snail lineages, from highly specialized feeding to omnivory (<xref rid="msw174-B8" ref-type="bibr">Duda et al. 2001</xref>). <italic>Conus imperialis</italic> feeds exclusively on fire worms (<xref rid="msw174-B22" ref-type="bibr">Nybakken 1970</xref>) and might therefore present a good system in which to look for effects of predation on the molecular adaptation of venom targets in prey. Whether specialized <italic>Conus</italic> species loom large in the fears of their prey, and actively coevolve with those prey, are questions about which we currently know little.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Transcriptome Analysis</title><p>Assembled and annotated venom-gland transcriptomes of cone snails belonging to 13 different subgenera, including ones that prey on worms (12 species), mollusks (3 species) and fish (3 species), were mined for transcripts encoding insulin-like peptides (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="msw174-T1">table 1</xref> for species and platforms used in this analysis). Briefly, total RNA was isolated from venom glands using <italic>TRIzol Reagent</italic> (Life Technologies) or the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturers&#x02019; instructions.

Signaling insulin from the sea hare <italic>Aplysia californica</italic> was used as an outgroup (GenBank: NP_001191503). Alignment gaps were removed prior to phylogenetic analysis. A bayesian tree was estimated by MrBayes 3.2.2 (<xref rid="msw174-B16" ref-type="bibr">Huelsenbeck and Ronquist 2001</xref>) with two runs each of four Markov chains sampling every 200 generations.

Bootstrap branch support values were obtained for an equivalent ML tree estimated by PhyML (<xref rid="msw174-B14" ref-type="bibr">Guindon and Gascuel 2003</xref>) (WAG substitution model, 4 rate categories, 100 bootstraps).</p></sec><sec><title>Selection Analysis</title><p>For selection analysis, one venom insulin-coding sequence was randomly selected from each of the 15 species with the exception of <italic>C. geographus</italic> for which one sequence was randomly selected from each of the three clearly distinct paralogous loci. The purpose of this sampling scheme was to ensure that selection analysis was carried out on different loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msw174-F3">fig. 3</xref>), not on alleles. The program codeml from PAML 4.7 (<xref rid="msw174-B39" ref-type="bibr">Yang 2007</xref>) was used to estimate synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions under the F3x4 codon frequency model, over all codon positions without gaps in an alignment of the proinsulin sequences (i.e., the A and B chains plus C peptide, omitting the highly conserved signal peptide). Analyses were conducted under several different models of sequence evolution: (1) pairwise comparisons of the 17 sequences; (2) a beta distribution of d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>S</sub> ratios (0&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;&#x003c9;&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1) over sites (M7); (3) a beta distribution over some sites, with a single higher value of &#x003c9; at others (M8); (4) a single value of &#x003c9; for all branches (M0); and (5) independent estimates of &#x003c9; for all branches in the phylogeny (M1) (<xref rid="msw174-B40" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al. 2000</xref>). Similar analyses were carried out for an alignment of the five nerve-ring insulin sequences. Conventional likelihood-ratio tests were used to compare models that form nested pairs.</p><p>Using the same venom-insulin alignment, we carried out branch-site statistical tests for episodic selection in HyPhy (<xref rid="msw174-B41" ref-type="bibr">Kosakovsky Pond et al. 2005</xref>) using the BUSTED algorithm (<xref rid="msw174-B42" ref-type="bibr">Murrell et al. (2015)</xref>. BUSTED is an extension of the <xref rid="msw174-B43" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen and Yang (1998)</xref> episodic model that averages &#x003c9; values across sites within the foreground (the branches included in an <italic>a priori</italic> specified hypothesis of positive selection) and within the background (all other branches). The averaging tends to wash out the effect of localized selection pressures. In contrast, BUSTED models site-wise variable rates for each branch of the tree to more sensitively detect local episodic selection. The test accounts for stochastically variable rates across sites and across branches by estimating three categories of selection, under the alternative constraints that &#x003c9;<sub>1</sub>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;&#x003c9;<sub>2&#x02009;</sub>&#x02264;<sub>&#x02009;</sub>1&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;&#x003c9;<sub>3,</sub> for the foreground and the background. The constraints for the null hypothesis of no episodic positive selection are &#x003c9;<sub>1</sub>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;&#x003c9;<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;&#x003c9;<sub>3&#x02009;</sub>&#x02264;<sub>&#x02009;</sub>1.00. The proportions of branch-site combinations in each category of &#x003c9; are estimated.
