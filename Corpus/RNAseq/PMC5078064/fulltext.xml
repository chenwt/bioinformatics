NKp44 has three splice variants corresponding to NKp44<sup>ITIM+</sup> (NKp44-1) and NKp44<sup>ITIM&#x02212;</sup> (NKp44-2, and NKp44-3) isoforms. RNAseq data of AML patients revealed similar survival of NKp46<sup>+</sup>NKp44<sup>+</sup> and NKp46<sup>+</sup>NKp44<sup>&#x02212;</sup> patients. However, if grouped according to the NKp44 splice variant profile, NKp44-1 expression was significantly associated with poor survival of AML patients. Moreover, activation of PBMC from healthy controls showed co-dominant expression of NKp44-1 and NKp44-3, while primary NK clones show more diverse NKp44 splice variant profiles. Cultured primary NK cells resulted in NKp44-1 dominance and impaired function associated with PCNA over-expression by target cells. This impaired functional phenotype could be rescued by blocking of NKp44 receptor. Human NK cell lines revealed co-dominant expression of NKp44-1 and NKp44-3 and showed a functional phenotype that was not inhibited by PCNA over-expression. Furthermore, transfection-based overexpression of NKp44-1, but not NKp44-2/NKp44-3, reversed the endogenous resistance of NK-92 cells to PCNA-mediated inhibition, and resulted in poor formation of stable lytic immune synapses. This research contributes to the understanding of AML prognosis by shedding new light on the functional implications of differential splicing of NKp44.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>AML</kwd><kwd>NKp44</kwd><kwd>splice variants</kwd><kwd>isoforms</kwd><kwd>natural killer cells</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in American adults. AML quickly progresses and can result in death within a few months if left untreated. [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] One of the major cell populations involved in anti-AML immune responses is CD3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD56<sup>+</sup> innate lymphoid NK cells. [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] It has been previously shown that the status of NK cells in AML is critical for patients&#x02019; survival and that AML leukemic cells can induce impaired NK cell function. [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] NK cell function is regulated through a delicate balance of activation vs. inhibitory signals that is sustained by an array of cell surface receptors engaging ligands on target cells. [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] While activation receptors (e.g. NKG2D and NCRs) mostly recognize stress and viral induced ligands, inhibitory receptors (KIRs/LIRs/NKG2A) interact with class I HLA molecules and transmit an inhibitory signal via immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs). [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>NKp44 (CD336) is a cell surface glycoprotein with one IgG type V-like extracellular domain, is encoded by the NCR2 gene located on chromosome 6, and has no homolog in the mouse genome. [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] NKp44/NCR2 belongs to a family of receptors called Natural Cytotoxicity Receptors (NCRs), which also includes NKp30/NCR3 and NKp46/NCR1. However, while NKp46 and NKp30 are constitutively expressed on NK cells, NKp44 is not expressed on resting peripheral NK cells, but can be up-regulated upon NK cell activation by IL-2 or IL-15. [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Among NKp44 ligands are heparan sulfate (HS) and various viral proteins. [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Recently, two new intracellular proteins were identified as ligands for NKp44; a specific MLL5 isoform and PCNA. [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] The specific MLL5 isoform leads to NK cell activation. PCNA over-expression is abundant in cancers and is directly associated with cancer virulence. Surprisingly, PCNA expression was found to inhibit NK cell function upon engagement with NKp44, potentially promoting cancer escape from immune detection. [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] The PCNA-mediated inhibitory effect was shown to require the ITIM motif that can be transcribed on the cytoplasmic tail of the NKp44 receptor, but not the receptor-associated adaptor protein DAP12, which mediates NKp44 activation signaling. [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>Alternative splicing allows a single gene to be translated into multiple forms of the same protein (isoforms) and therefore constitutes a regulatory mechanism that leads to diverse function of proteins encoded by the same gene. [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Until now, a few receptors expressed on NK cells were found to be regulated by alternative splicing. [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] Human NKG2D can be expressed as a truncated receptor lacking the ligand-binding ecto-domain, thereby competing with the full-length receptor to disrupt its function. [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] In addition, predominant expression of a NKp30 splice variant, designated NKp30c, was shown to indicate poor prognosis of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors. [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] The effect was linked to production of the immune inhibitory cytokine, IL-10, by NKp30c-expressing NK cells. Alternative splicing of NKp44 mRNA results in three splice variants, which can be distinguished by the presence or absence of an ITIM in the cytoplasmic portion of the receptor; NKp44<sup>ITIM+</sup> (NKp44-1) and NKp44<sup>ITIM&#x02212;</sup> (NKp44-2&#x00026;3) isoforms. [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] While NKp44-1 has been associated with the inhibitory effect of PCNA, inhibition was never tested for the other two NKp44 splice variants, NKp44-2 and NKp44-3, which lack the ITIM motif. While these alternatively spliced forms of NCRs have been recognized, they have been minimally characterized.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that the expression of ITIM<sup>+</sup> alternative splice variants of the NCR2 gene, NKp44 are associated with poor survival of AML patients. Furthermore, we show that the balance between NKp44<sup>ITIM+</sup> and NKp44<sup>ITIM&#x02212;</sup> splice variants can lead to diverse function of NK cells and influence the outcome of NK cell-target cell interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Poor survival of AML patients with a NKp44-1 splice variant profile</title><p>We and others had previously shown that PCNA expression can be utilized by cancer cells to suppress NK cell activity, through interaction with the NK receptor NCR2/NKp44. [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] To further explore this finding, we performed a retrospective analysis on RNAseq data obtained from peripheral blood (PB) samples of AML patients deposited in the TCGA database. RNAseq data from 173 PB samples was filtered for the presence of NK cells using expression of the NK cell-associated receptor, NKp46 (<italic>i.e.</italic> total NKp46). The 164 of 173 cases positive for NKp46 were chosen for further analysis, and 31% of these were NKp44<sup>+</sup> (<italic>i.e.</italic> total NKp44/NCR2; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). We then tested the contribution of NKp44 expression to the survival of AML patients by comparing NKp46<sup>+</sup>NKp44<sup>+</sup> to NKp46<sup>+</sup>NKp44<sup>&#x02212;</sup> groups. From all NKp46<sup>+</sup> AML cases, only 60 cases of NKp46<sup>+</sup>NKp44<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and 36 cases of NKp46<sup>+</sup>NKp44<sup>+</sup> had the &#x0201c;days to death&#x0201d; data deposited in the TCGA. No difference, however, was seen in the percent survival between the NKp46<sup>+</sup>NKp44<sup>+</sup> and NKp46<sup>+</sup>NKp44<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cases groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). To further investigate the role of NKp44 in AML associated morbidity, we looked into the expression of NKp44 splice variants, since NCR2 mRNA can be spliced into three different splice variants: NKp44-1, NKp44-2 and NKp44-3.

We observed that individual AML patients manifested a broad spectrum of NKp44 splice variant expression profiles, ranging from expression of a single NKp44 splice variant to expression of a mix of splice variants. Two thirds of the NKp46<sup>+</sup>NKp44<sup>+</sup>cases with &#x0201c;day to death&#x0201d; data expressed only the NKp44-1 splice variant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Thus, we defined the NKp46<sup>+</sup> NKp44-1<sup>+</sup>-only samples as having a NKp44-1 profile, whereas the NKp44-2/3 profile was defined to include all other NKp46<sup>+</sup> samples expressing NKp44-2 and/or NKp44-3 (with or without expression of NKp44-1). NKp46<sup>+</sup>NKp44<sup>&#x02212;</sup> samples were defined as a NKp44<sup>&#x02212;</sup> profile. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> shows that survival of the NKp44-1 profile group was significantly lower than the NKp44<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and the NKp44-2/3 profile groups. To better characterize the association between the NKp44-1 expression levels and survival of AML patients, we further divided the NKp44-1 group by sorting in accordance with the expression levels of NKp44-1 (normalized to the expression of NCR1) by equally dividing into NKp44-1<sup>high</sup> (top half, n=12) and NKp44-1<sup>low</sup> (bottom half, n=12) subgroups. We then plotted percent survival of AML cases for NKp44-1<sup>high</sup>, NKp44-1<sup>low</sup>, NKp44-2/3 and NKp44<sup>&#x02212;</sup> profiles. The percent survival of NKp44-1<sup>low</sup>, NKp44-2/3 and NKp44<sup>&#x02212;</sup> profiles did not differ significantly. However, the patient group bearing the NKp44-1<sup>high</sup> profile manifested a lower survival rate, which differed significantly from each of the other three groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). We then checked if this lower survival rate could be a result of lower total NKp44/NCR2 expression. As expected, total NKp44/NCR2 gene expression was significantly higher in the NKp44-1<sup>high</sup> group, as compared to the NKp44-1<sup>low</sup> group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1A.i</xref>). Yet, poor survival of the NKp44-1<sup>high</sup> group could not be attributed to total NKp44 expression since the NKp44-2/3 profile group showed a significantly higher expression of total NKp44, as compared to the NKp44-1<sup>high</sup> profile, mostly due to a significant contribution of NKp44-2 and NKp44-3 splice variants. Moreover, NKp44 total mRNA expression can be subject to alterations in the number of cells, hence we focused on the NKp44 splice variants profile of each patient.</p><p>We further considered that poor survival of the NKp44-1 profile group could be a consequence of parameters other than the NKp44 splice variants profile. To examine this further, we investigated contributions of other NCRs (NKp46 and NKp30 and related splice variants, NKp30a, NKp30b, and NKp30c). mRNA expression data obtained from the TCGA database were analyzed, and the NKp44-1 profile group, NKp44-2/3 profile group and NKp44 negative profile group were compared (NKp46<sup>+</sup> cases with &#x0201c;day to death&#x0201d; data), but no significant differences were detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1A, S1B</xref>). We then expanded our analysis to known AML risk factors and AML cytogenetic risk groups [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], but no significant differences were observed to explain the significant poor survival observed for the NKp44-1 profile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Clearly, we cannot rule out other factors that may affect survival in AML. Furthermore, it must be considered that the TCGA database is comprised of newly diagnosed AML cases that subsequently experienced diverse treatment regimens, and subsequent therapies may have significantly influenced outcomes. Nonetheless, our analysis suggests that the NKp44 splice variants profile may serve as an early prognostic factor for AML.</p><p>We next plotted the patient groups according to the incidence of individual NKp44 splice variants, which demonstrated two distinct NKp44 splice variant expression profiles. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>, the NKp44-1 profile group exhibits solitary expression of NKp44-1, while the NKp44-2/3 profile group exhibits co-dominant expression of NKp44-1 and NKp44-3.</p><p>Note that the NKp44 receptor is typically expressed by NK cells, yet other cells were also reported to express NKp44, including pDC and non-NK innate lymphoid cells (ILC). [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] Therefore, we compared the correlation of NKp44 gene expression with expression of genes associated with the cells reported to express NKp44. Expression of the NK cell marker CD56 and NKp44 were significantly correlated, while expression of genes characterizing DC were not correlated with the NKp44 expression. We then checked the correlation of NKp44/NCR2 to NKp46/NCR1, but we did not show a significant correlation, which may reflect the nature of NKp44 as an inducible receptor (data not shown). However, when we tested the correlation of NKp46/NCR2 to CD56 and other DC markers, NKp46 was highly correlated to CD56 but not to known DC markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Hence, these data indicate that NKp44 mRNA expression in AML is associated with NK cells rather than DC. While we cannot rule out the possible involvement of other ILC, they are rare in peripheral blood [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title>Human pNK cells and clones exhibit diverse NKp44 splice variant profiles</title><p>Human NK cells in peripheral blood do not readily express surface NKp44 at the protein level, yet, following activation with IL-2 or IL-15, cell surface NKp44 protein is expressed. [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] Therefore, we purified PBMCs from healthy donors and cultured them in the presence of IL-2/IL-15 to induce NKp44 protein expression. As expected, fresh PBMCs were not stained with specific mAb to NKp44, while PBMCs cultured for 3 days with either IL-2/IL-15 manifested positive staining; NKp44 expression was found to be restricted to NK cells and a small fraction of NKT cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). To assess and compare the expression of the different NKp44 splice variants in the fresh and 3-days-activated PBMCs, we employed qPCR analysis to assess total NKp44 mRNA and each of the NKp44 splice variants in four healthy control subjects. Indeed, NKp44 total mRNA levels were significantly increased after IL-2/IL-15 culture for 3 days (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>); qPCR analysis of NKp44 splice variants in freshly isolated PBMCs (day 0) showed low basal mRNA expression and similar ratios of the 3 NKp44 splice variants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). When we examined expression profiles of NKp44 splice variants in PBMCs following 3 days of culture with IL-2and IL-15 (data not shown for IL-15), NKp44-1 and NKp44-3 expression was similarly up-regulated, while levels of the NKp44-2 splice variant remained relatively low (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D, 2E</xref>). These results were consistent with the PBMC samples taken from all four healthy donors.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Human primary NK cells and clones exhibit diverse NKp44 splice variant profiles</title><p><bold>A.i.</bold> Flow cytometry-based analysis of PBMC, representative histogram from a healthy donor (n=4).

Most of the clones showed dominance of NKp44-1 while only two clones predominantly expressed NKp44-3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>).</p><p>We then asked whether the up-regulation of total NKp44 can be linked to any particular ratio of NKp44 splice variants, by testing for a correlation between the total expression of NKp44 and the NKp44-3/NKp44-1 ratio. The observed wide range of ratios between NKp44-1 and NKp44-3 splice variants was not correlated (Pearson r = 0.09, p =0.6985, n=27) with the total expression of NKp44 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>). Plotting of the pooled data of splice variant expression profiles from all clones revealed higher relative NKp44-1 expression in fresh PBMC samples, as compared to IL-2 or IL-15 activated PBMCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E, 2H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2_3"><title>Dominant expression of NKp44-1 is associated with impaired functional phenotype of peripheral NK cells</title><p>Following the profiling of NKp44 splice variants in human PBMC and NK clones from healthy controls, we isolated primary NK cells from PB in order to investigate the functional properties of NK cell clones with distinct NKp44 splice variant profiles.

Indeed, NKp44 protein was not detected on the surface of resting CD3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/CD56<sup>+</sup>/CD16<sup>+</sup> and CD3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/CD56<sup>+</sup>/CD16<sup>&#x02212;</sup> pNK cells by flow cytometry, but was up-regulated upon culture with IL-15 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) or IL-2 (data not shown). qPCR analysis of total NKp44 mRNA revealed cytokine-induced up-regulation, which was consistent with the induced expression of NKp44 surface protein, and mRNA for all NKp44 splice variants was increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3A, S3B, S3C, S3D</xref>). Analysis of the profiles of NKp44 splice variants in pNK cells that had been cultured with IL-2 and IL-15 revealed that the expression of NKp44-1 and NKp44-3 mRNAs as a fraction of total NKp44 mRNA were increased, while the expression of NKp44-2 was relatively low (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). However, the NKp44-1 splice variant was predominantly expressed in the cultured NK cells, as compared with NKp44-3 (low) and NKp44-2 (dull) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). We have previously shown that IL-2-cultured pNK cells up-regulate surface expression of NKp44 protein, which leads to functional inhibition upon interaction with PCNA expressed by target cells.

The differences between the sensitivity of THP-1 AML cell line and K562 CML cell line could be due to differences in MHC class-I expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>).

This pattern of enhanced staining of dead cells, compared to live cells, was also observed following staining with a soluble form of NKp30 (NKp30-hFc), which similarly to NKp44 has intracellular ligands. In accordance, the enhanced staining of dead cells was not observed for staining with soluble NKG2D (NKG2D-hFc), which does not have intracellular ligands (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). The binding of NKp44-hFc to live and dead HeLa cells was blocked with anti-NKp44 mAb (p44-8) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>), which is consistent with the capacity of this mAb to enhance the function of NK cells with a NKp44-1-dominant splice variant profile by blocking interaction with membrane-associated PCNA (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C, 3D, 3E</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our findings indicate that the impaired functional phenotype of pNK cells that results in suppressed lysis of cancer target cells is associated with NKp44-1 dominant expression.

Both cell lines showed a similar profile, which was characterized by co-dominant expression of NKp44-1 and NKp44-3 splice variants with dull expression of NKp44-2 splice variant. This NKp44 splice variant profile of NK-92 cells could explain the resilient response toward PCNA over-expressing target cells. [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Consistent with the results of NK-92 cells, IFN&#x003b3; secretion by KHYG-1 cells was not inhibited by PCNA-overexpressing HeLa cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Similarly, PCNA over-expression by target cells did not inhibit lysis by KHYG-1 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), as compared to lysis by IL-2 cultured pNK (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). These results are in sharp contrast to IL-2-cultured pNK cells that manifest dominant expression of NKp44-1, and in accordance, exhibit reduced IFN&#x003b3; secretion when stimulated by PCNA-over-expressing HeLa cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). To further assess the effect of each single NKp44 splice variant, we transfected NK-92 cells with cDNA encoding for each of the three NKp44 splice variants. As expected, the resulting NKp44 splice variant profile of the three NK-92 transfectants, (i.e. NK92-44-1, NK92-44-2 and NK92-44-3) showed a dominant expression of the transfected splice variant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>).

NK-92 WT (parental) or, NK92-44-1/44-2/44-3 effectors were co-incubated with HeLa cells expressing CFP alone or CFP-PCNA fusion protein, and the relative accumulation of F-actin at the immune synapse was assessed in NK-92 cells over-expressing each splice variant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4Fi</xref>).

[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] The NKp44 receptor, along with the NKp46 and NKp30 receptors, belongs to the NCRs, which are predominantly expressed in innate lymphoid cells and are important activating receptors on pNK cells. [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In previous studies of NKp46 and NKp30 expression in AML patients, down-regulation of their expression was linked to impaired NK cell function and poor prognosis, while up-regulation was associated with enhanced NK cell function and better prognosis of the AML patients. [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] In contrast, although NKp44 expression was studied on NK cells from AML patients, a possible link between AML immunity and NKp44 expression by NK cells was not previously reported. [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The current study analyzed NKp44 expression and AML prognosis. Our initial results showed no correlation between NKp44 expression in PB samples and AML outcome. Thus, we could conclude that NKp44 expression in the blood of AML patients has no contribution to prognosis. However, when we deepened our studies into NKp44 splice variant profiles we realized that the story is more complex. Specifically, we showed that poor prognosis of AML patients is associated with high expression of NKp44-splice variant 1 in the patient blood. We connected these results to the presence of a cytoplasmic ITIM in the NKp44-1 isoform, as compared to NKp44-2&#x00026;3 isoforms. We further showed that the presence of NKp44-1 isoform significantly suppresses F-actin aggregation during the formation of a stable NK cell immunological synapse with PCNA-expressing target cells. [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] We then associated the NK cell functional inhibition conferred by expression of the NKp44-1 isoform to PCNA expression by target cancer cells. Lastly, we showed that blocking NKp44 with a mAb enhanced NK cell-mediated lysis of the NK-insensitive AML cell line, THP-1.</p><p>This study points to the dual nature of the NKp44 receptor, previously considered as a classical NK cell activation receptor, [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] yet few studies have recognized this paradoxical functional response through NKp44. [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] Paradoxical inhibition of human natural interferon-producing cells by the activating receptor NKp44 has been reported. [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] Furthermore, intratumoral NK cells, which were functionally impaired and associated with poor prognosis, displayed significantly higher expression levels of NKp44. [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] This dual character could be approached either from the side of the ligand expressed by target cancer cells or from the side of the NKp44 isoforms expressed by NK cells. Focusing on the level of the NKp44 isoforms expressed by the effector NK cells, we demonstrate for the first time that the &#x0201c;dual nature&#x0201d; of the NKp44 functional outcome could be explained by the expression of either NKp44<sup>ITIM+</sup>(NKp44-1) or NKp44<sup>ITIM&#x02212;</sup> (NKp44-2/NKp44-3) splice variants; i.e. on the effector side of the equation rather than the target side. Furthermore, we showed that this diverse NKp44 splice variant expression can influence the survival of AML patients. We therefore suggest that alternative splicing of NKp44 receptor mRNAs can regulate the immunosurveillance capacity and dictate the functional outcome of NK effector cell/target interactions in AML. A few recent studies have investigated the relationship between the expression of splice variants of innate immune cell receptors and outcome of cancer therapy. [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] A previous study demonstrated that the NKp30/NCR3 splice variant profile can potentially be an effective tool to aid prognosis for GIST patients. [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] Therefore, investigating the expression of genes in cancer-associated immune cells (immunome) is imperative for designing personalized therapeutic approaches and predicting prognosis of patients.</p><p>On the level of the ligand, we and others published that PCNA is an inhibitory ligand for NKp44, and in this study, we further show that PCNA inhibits through the NKp44<sup>ITIM+</sup> isoform but not the NKp44<sup>ITIM&#x02212;</sup> isoforms. [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] The innate immune inhibition mediated by PCNA through interaction with NKp44-1 isoform directly correlates with the observation that cancer virulence is associated with PCNA overexpression by the cancer cells. Importantly, it is clear that the involvement of PCNA in cell cycle and proliferation is much more influential in promoting cancer virulence than its effect on immune suppression. [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] Recently, a new activating cellular ligand of NKp44 was characterized as a specific isoform of MLL5. [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] This dichotomy between activating and inhibitory ligands of NKp44, which are expressed by target cancer cells, can lead to a diverse outcome of NK cell function. Since NKp44 also recognizes heparan sulfate proteoglycans as co-ligands, it was suggested that NKp44 could recognize cancer cell-produced damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) that can either activate (if containing MLL5) or inhibit (if containing PCNA and MHC class-I) NK cell function. [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] With regard to this theory, it is important to note that we showed the effect of NKp44-1 isoform on the NK insensitive HLA class-I<sup>high</sup> THP-1 AML target cells, but we could not show it for the NK sensitive, HLA class-I<sup>dull</sup> K562 CML target cells. Yet, the role of KIR receptors inhibiting through HLA class-I could not be excluded.</p><p>Recently, Siewiera et al. showed that IL-18 and TGF-&#x003b2; can influence NKp44 splice variant profiles and pointed to tissue specific editing of NKp44 in decidua basalis NK (dNK) cells, which are CD56<sup>bright</sup>. It is probable that tissue specific NK cells (CD56<sup>bright</sup> and CD56<sup>dim</sup>) express different profiles of NKp44 splice variants, as well as other receptors, due to tissue-specific signals. On the other hand, the RNA expression profile of NKp44 splice variants 1 and 3 for unstimulated CD56<sup>bright</sup> pNK and CD56<sup>bright</sup> dNK cells is similar [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>The use of <italic>ex-vivo</italic> expanded lymphokine-activated killer cells and NK cells for adoptive cancer immunotherapy has been studied since the 1980's. [<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] In our hands, prolonged <italic>ex-vivo</italic> exposure of NK cells to IL-2/IL-15 preferentially induced the NKp44-1 splice variant and accordingly induced functional impairment of NK cells toward PCNA-expressing target cells. Recently, several studies described the use of <italic>ex vivo</italic> expanded NK cells for adoptive therapy of AML, [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and most of these employed expansion with IL-2/IL-15. [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] In view of our results, the use of IL-2/IL-15 should be considered carefully, since these cytokines induced dominant expression of the inhibitory NKp44-1 splice variant. It should be noted, that IL-12 was reported to reduce the levels of IL-2/IL-15-induced NKp44 expression, while inducing better cytotoxicity. [<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>],[<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] Based on those results, the use of IL-12, NKp44-blocking mAb, or over-expression of NKp44-2/3 splice variants should be considered to potentially interfere with the suppressive effect attributed to the NKp44-1 variant.</p><p>To summarize, we show that a specific alternative splice variant of the NCR2 gene, namely the NKp44-1, is associated with poor survival of AML patients and that the balance between NKp44 isoforms NKp44-1 and NKp44-3 can lead to diverse function of NK cells and influence the outcome of the NK cell/target cell synapse formation. Taken together, our cumulative data indicate that an excess of NKp44-1 expression could result in functionally impaired NK cells in AML patients, and this expression profile may be an early prognostic indicator.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>TCGA samples</title><p>A total of 200 adult cases of spontaneously occurring, newly diagnosed AML from the LAML study (TCGA Data Portal; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/">https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/</ext-link>) [<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] were analyzed.
