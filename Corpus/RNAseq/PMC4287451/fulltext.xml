Despite their reputation as &#x0201c;junk&#x0201d; DNA or genomic parasites deleterious for the host, TEs have complex interactions with host genes and the potential to contribute to regulatory variation in gene expression. It has been hypothesized that TEs and genes they insert near may be transcriptionally activated in response to stress conditions. The maize genome, with many different types of TEs interspersed with genes, provides an ideal system to study the genome-wide influence of TEs on gene regulation. To analyze the magnitude of the TE effect on gene expression response to environmental changes, we profiled gene and TE transcript levels in maize seedlings exposed to a number of abiotic stresses. Many genes exhibit up- or down-regulation in response to these stress conditions. The analysis of TE families inserted within upstream regions of up-regulated genes revealed that between four and nine different TE families are associated with up-regulated gene expression in each of these stress conditions, affecting up to 20% of the genes up-regulated in response to abiotic stress, and as many as 33% of genes that are only expressed in response to stress. Expression of many of these same TE families also responds to the same stress conditions. The analysis of the stress-induced transcripts and proximity of the transposon to the gene suggests that these TEs may provide local enhancer activities that stimulate stress-responsive gene expression. Our data on allelic variation for insertions of several of these TEs show strong correlation between the presence of TE insertions and stress-responsive up-regulation of gene expression. Our findings suggest that TEs provide an important source of allelic regulatory variation in gene response to abiotic stress in maize.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Transposable elements are mobile DNA elements that are a prevalent component of many eukaryotic genomes. While transposable elements can often have deleterious effects through insertions into protein-coding genes they may also contribute to regulatory variation of gene expression. There are a handful of examples in which specific transposon insertions contribute to regulatory variation of nearby genes, particularly in response to environmental stress. We sought to understand the genome-wide influence of transposable elements on gene expression responses to abiotic stress in maize, a plant with many families of transposable elements located in between genes. Our analysis suggests that a small number of maize transposable element families may contribute to the response of nearby genes to abiotic stress by providing stress-responsive enhancer-like functions. The specific insertions of transposable elements are often polymorphic within a species. Our data demonstrate that allelic variation for insertions of the transposable elements associated with stress-responsive expression can contribute to variation in the regulation of nearby genes. Thus novel insertions of transposable elements provide a potential mechanism for genes to acquire <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory influences that could contribute to heritable variation for stress response.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The work was supported by grants NSF MRI-R2 0957312 to IM, NSF IOS-1238014 to JRI, NSF IOS&#x02013;1237931 to NMS, and MS is supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

We identified a subset of TE families over-represented in the promoters of maize genes that exhibit stress-responsive up-regulation or activation of gene expression. Based on our data, as many as 20% of genes that showed increased expression in response to stress are located near a TE from one of these families. We find that stress-responsive TEs appear to provide enhancer-like activity for nearby promoters and allelic variation for TE insertions is strongly associated with variation in expression response to stress for individual genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>We extracted and sequenced RNA from 14 day old seedlings of inbred lines B73, Mo17 and Oh43 grown using standard conditions as well as seedlings that had been subjected to cold (5&#x000b0;C for 16 hours), heat (50&#x000b0;C for 4 hours), high salt (watered with 300 mM NaCl 20 hours prior to collection) or UV stress (2 hours) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). For each stress the plants were sampled immediately following the stress treatment and there were no apparent morphological changes in these plants relative to control plants. However, when the stressed plants were allowed to recover for 24 hours under standard conditions phenotypic consequences became apparent for several of the stress treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004915-g001">Fig. 1A&#x02013;B</xref>).

For each stress by genotype combination we found that 18%&#x02013;30% of the expressed genes (7&#x02013;10% of all genes) exhibit significant changes in expression level with similar frequencies of up-and down-regulated expression changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004915.s007">S2 Table</xref>). For the salt and UV stress we identified genes that exhibit at least 2-fold change in expression and RPKM&#x0003e;1 in at least one of the conditions. The analysis of data for heat/cold stress revealed that the genes identified as differentially expressed based on a single replicate of this data had&#x0003e;90% overlap with the genes identified as significant in the analysis of multiple replicates. The clustering of gene expression responses to abiotic stress suggests that each stress has a substantial influence on the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004915-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). The majority of genes that are differentially expressed exhibit low to moderate expression in the control condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004915.s001">S1 Fig.</xref>). While all three inbred lines showed similar transcriptional responses to the stress conditions there is also evidence for genotype-specific responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004915-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). The expression for TE families was also compared in stress and control conditions by determining the reads per million (RPM) that mapped to 353 TE families that had insertions located near maize genes.

Another striking example is the <italic>joemon</italic> TE family for which 59 of 68 expressed genes containing an insertion within 1 kb are activated following cold stress (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004915-t001">Table 1</xref>). Although similar numbers of genes exhibit increased and decreased gene expression genome-wide following abiotic stress conditions, the majority of enriched TE family &#x02013; stress combinations (28/31) are associated with up-regulated gene expression. For each of the stress conditions there were 4&#x02013;9 TE families that are associated with up-regulation of gene expression. Some TE families are associated with altered expression in multiple stress treatments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004915-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004915.s009">S4 Table</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004915-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>) and two of the TE families associated with down-regulation of gene expression under high salt stress were also associated with increased gene expression under UV stress.</p><p>The TE families enriched for genes activated in response to stress include all major super-families of TEs: TIR DNA transposons, LTR <italic>gypsy</italic>-like (RLG), <italic>copia</italic>-like (RLC), or unknown (RLX) retrotransposons, and LINE elements (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004915-t001">Table 1</xref>,). These TE families vary substantially for the number of genes that they are located near: from 30 to 3052 genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004915-t001">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004915.s009">S4 Table</xref>) and are spread uniformly across the maize genome. The presence of these TEs near genes is not fully sufficient for stress-responsive expression. For each of the TE families identified, 26&#x02013;87% of genes located near a TE insertion show stress responsive expression depending on the stress and the TE family. The expression levels for the TEs themselves was assessed for each of the treatments and in the majority of TE family &#x02013; stress combinations (14 of 21 with expression data) the TEs showed at least 2-fold increase in transcript levels in the stress treatment compared to control conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004915-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004915.s009">S4 Table</xref>). There are several examples of TE families that exhibit increased levels of expression in a particular stress but the nearby genes are not enriched for stress-responsive expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004915.s008">S3 Table</xref>), suggesting that not all TEs that are influenced by a particular stress influence nearby genes.</p><p>To understand what proportion of the transcriptome response to a specific abiotic stress may be explained by influences of specific TEs inserted near genes, up-regulated genes were classified according to whether they were located near a member of one of the stress-associated TE families (1 kb 5&#x02032; from TSS) and whether they are up-regulated (expressed under control and stress conditions) or activated in response to stress (only expressed following stress treatment). We found that a substantial portion of the transcriptome response to the abiotic stress could be associated with genes located near the set of 4&#x02013;9 TE families that were identified as enriched for up-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004915-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). In total, 5&#x02013;20% of the genome-wide transcriptome response to the abiotic stress and as many as 33% of activated genes could be attributed to the genes located near one of these TE families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004915-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004915.s010">S5</xref> Table-6).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Some TE families act as local enhancers of stress-responsive expression</title><p>One possible mechanism by which these families of TEs could contribute to stress-responsive expression for nearby genes is that the TE may provide an outward-reading promoter that is stress-responsive. This model predicts that the orientation of the TE relative to the gene is important and that novel transcripts containing TE sequences fused to gene sequences would be present for up-regulated genes under stress conditions. In order to assess the importance of the orientation of the TE insertion relative to the gene, we compared the proportion of genes located on the same strand as a TE for genes up-regulated in response to stress and genes non-differentially expressed in response to stress for all TE families enriched for up-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004915.s012">S7 Table</xref>). While most families showed no significant difference in the proportion of genes on the same strand as the TE between the up-regulated and non-differentially expressed genes, a minority of families (4/20) showed significant enrichment. For example, 97% of the stress-responsive genes located near <italic>etug</italic> elements are on the same strand as the TE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004915.s012">S7 Table</xref>).</p><p>The potential for TEs to provide novel promoters in stress conditions was also assessed by creating de novo transcript assemblies for each of the treatment conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004915.s013">S8 Table</xref>). These transcript assemblies were mapped to the reference genome to determine the transcriptional start sites in control and stress treatments. In particular, we focused on the 630 genes that had TE insertions at least 100 bp 5&#x02032; of the annotated transcription start site that had de novo transcript assemblies in both control and stress conditions. The location of the start site for the transcript assembly in control and stress conditions was compared to the location of the annotated start site and the location of the TE. There were a number of instances in which the transcript start site was located 5&#x02032; of the annotated site in both control and stress conditions and these likely reflect examples of incomplete annotation. There are 16 genes (out of 630 with data) that have a novel start site in the stress-treatment and not in the control that was located within or near the TE. There was not a significant enrichment for specific TE families among these 16 examples and these examples may simply reflect examples of inaccurate start site annotation without enough read depth in the control condition to identify the specific start site. These examples show that we could detect novel start sites but they suggest that it is rare for TEs to provide novel promoters in stress conditions.</p><p>Alternative models include the possibility that the TE may contain <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences that can act as binding sites for stress-induced transcription factors, or that the TE could influence the local chromatin environment in such a way that the region is more accessible under stress conditions. The analysis of TE distance from transcription start sites of stress-responsive genes suggests that in many cases the effect of TE on stress-responsive gene activation quickly diminishes as the distance increases beyond 500 bp &#x02013; 1 kb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004915.s003">S3A Fig.</xref>). The DREB/CBF transcription factors are often involved in transcriptional responses to abiotic stress in plants <xref rid="pgen.1004915-Agarwal1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. The consensus sequence for DREB/CBF binding (A/GCCGACNT <xref rid="pgen.1004915-Maruyama1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>) was found in most of the TEs that were associated with stress-responsive expression for nearby genes, with the exception of elements that only exhibit UV stress response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004915.s003">S3B Fig.</xref>). While we did not have evidence to distinguish between the possibilities that TEs provide either a sequence-specific binding site that might act as a stress-specific enhancer or influence the chromatin state in a non-sequence specific manner, our data are consistent with the TE insertions acting predominantly as local enhancers of expression rather than as novel promoters.</p><p>Because individual TE copies are subject to frequent rearrangements and internal deletions, we investigated whether the presence of specific regions in each TE family were over-represented in insertions that confer stress-responsive expression. For six of the 20 TE families, this comparison revealed specific portions of the TE sequences enriched among insertions that convey stress-responsive expression. For example, <italic>naiba</italic> and <italic>etug</italic> insertions located near up-regulated genes are approximately four times as likely to contain a particular portion of the TE long terminal repeat (LTR; p-value &#x0003c;0.001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004915.s004">S4 Fig.</xref>), and this same sequence is found in a subset of insertions of the related family, <italic>gyma,</italic> that are associated with up-regulated genes. While we did not have evidence to rule out the possibility that TEs influence the chromatin state in a non-sequence specific manner, these data indicate that the presence of particular regions of TE elements likely provide enhancer functions associated with gene expression responses to stress and help explain the variable effect of different insertions of the same family on stress-responsive expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Characterization of genes with TE-influenced stress responsive expression</title><p>We assessed a number of properties of the TE-influenced stress-responsive genes in comparison with stress-responsive genes that are not associated with one of these TE families (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004915-t002">Table 2</xref>). Stress-responsive genes located near the TE families tend to be substantially shorter in length with fewer introns. Analysis of developmental expression patterns for these genes using the B73 expression atlas <xref rid="pgen.1004915-Sekhon1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> reveals that only 7% of the TE influenced genes are expressed in at least 5 tissues, compared to 41% of the non-TE influenced genes. The TE influenced genes are also less likely to be in the filtered gene set (FGS), and the proportion of the TE influenced genes with syntenic homologs in other grass species is much lower than the proportion of non-TE influenced genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004915-t002">Table 2</xref>). Each of these features was assessed separately for each of the TE families (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004915.s012">S7 Table</xref>) and there is some variation for these properties among different families. These observations are compatible with the notion that TE insertions may in some cases function as enhancers that can drive expression of cryptic promoters in non-coding regions of the genome. This will result in stress-responsive production of transcripts that may be annotated as genes but may not produce functional proteins. However, 37% of TE influenced genes are included in the FGS that has been curated to remove transposon-derived sequences and a substantial proportion of the TE influenced genes are syntenic with genes from other species, have GO annotations, and could contribute to functional responses to stress (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004915-t002">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004915.s012">S7</xref>).

Of the 10 genes with detectable expression in our RNAseq experiments, 7 showed stress-responsive up-regulation/activation associated with the TE-containing alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004915-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). This analysis was expanded to additional genotypes by using PCR to detect the presence/absence of the TE insertion in a diverse set of 29 maize inbred lines that were selected to represent diverse North American germplasm from the stiff stalk, non-stiff stalk, iodent, tropical, sweet corn and popcorn population groups. The relative expression of the gene in stress compared to control treatment was also determined in each inbred using quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004915.s015">S10 Table</xref>). For each of these genes we found that the alleles that lack the transposon insertion did not exhibit stress-responsive expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004915-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), with the exception of one genotype for gene GRMZM2G108057. In contrast, the majority of the alleles that contain the TE (60&#x02013;88%) exhibit stress-responsive up-regulation. Although for a single insertion we cannot rule out the possibility that differential expression is due to a different polymorphism on the same haplotype as the TE, the fact that we see TE-associated expression change in multiple genes for each of the TE families (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004915.s015">Table. S10</xref>) argues strongly against such an explanation in general. These data thus provide evidence that insertion polymorphisms for the TE families identified here can generate novel expression responses for nearby genes.</p><fig id="pgen-1004915-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1004915.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Stress-induced up-regulation of gene expression correlates with the variation in TE presence.</title><p>(A) Proportion of genes up-regulated in B73 that are also up-regulated in Mo17 and Oh43 is shown for all TE families under the stress condition with highest enrichment for the TE family.

TEs are usually considered as a deleterious or neutral component of these genomes. However, the interplay between TEs and genes may have important functional contributions to plant traits.

<xref rid="pgen.1004915-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In these cases, a transposon insertion within a distant cis-regulatory sequence influences the regulation of adjacent genes. There are also examples of functionally relevant TE insertions in tomato, melons and citrus <xref rid="pgen.1004915-Butelli1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004915-Xiao1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> that can influence gene expression, potentially through chromatin influences that generate obligate epialleles.</p><p>Previous research in several plant species has suggested that at least some families of transposable elements may become transcriptionally activated following environmental stress. Tissue culture has been shown to result in activation of transposons and retrotransposons in a number of plant species <xref rid="pgen.1004915-Hirochika1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004915-Kaeppler1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. There are also examples of transcriptional activation of TEs in response to specific abiotic stresses in tobacco <xref rid="pgen.1004915-Grandbastien1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, rice <xref rid="pgen.1004915-Naito1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004915-Yasuda1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and Arabidopsis <xref rid="pgen.1004915-Ito1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004915-Pecinka1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004915-Cavrak1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. It is expected that the stress responsive expression of these TEs involves local enhancers that result in up-regulation of the TE promoter in response to stress. These local enhancers could also act upon other nearby promoters. There are a handful of examples in which transposon insertions have been linked to stress-responsive expression of nearby genes including the mPING insertions associated with cold-responsive expression in rice <xref rid="pgen.1004915-Naito1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004915-Yasuda1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and ONSEN insertions associated with heat-stress responsive expression in Arabidopsis <xref rid="pgen.1004915-Ito1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. If this is a common occurrence then we might expect it to be even more prevalent in a genome such as maize where many genes are closely surrounded by TEs.</p><p>Our analysis suggests that a small number of TE families are associated with stress-responsive expression for nearby genes. While some TE families were associated with multiple stresses, we found a different subset of TE families for each abiotic stress that was evaluated. In most cases, these same TEs themselves were up-regulated in response to the stress treatment. However, we also noted that there were some TE families that themselves exhibit strong up-regulation but did not have apparent influences on a significant portion of nearby genes. Even though the majority of stress responsive regulation of gene expression is not associated with TEs, based on our data, up to 20% of genes up-regulated in response to stress and as many as 33% of genes activated in response to stress could be attributed to regulation by TEs. One of the alternative explanations would argue that only a small number of genes localized close to a TE are truly influenced by this TE insertion for their expression, while other up-regulated genes are secondary targets and are regulated by the TE influenced genes. Although some of the TE influenced genes we identified could be secondary targets, secondary target genes would not preferentially co-localize with TEs from specific families.</p><p>The analysis of the nearby genes that were influenced by TEs suggests that many of them may not actually be protein coding genes. In one sense, this is an expected result. If an enhancer sequence is mobilized within the genome it will have the potential to influence expression from both gene promoter as well as cryptic promoters that may not be associated with coding sequences. The gene annotation efforts in maize have relied upon EST and RNA-seq expression data from a variety of conditions. In many cases the genes that were found to exhibit stress-responsive expression associated with TEs were only annotated as genes based upon evidence of their expression. We would expect that insertions of the TEs that provide stress-responsive enhancer activity would influence cryptic promoters not associated with genes in many cases, but would also affect the expression of nearby protein coding genes. The frequency of each appeared to vary among TE families, with some, like <italic>nihep</italic>, showing little difference between TE-influenced and non-TE-influenced up-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004915.s012">S7 Table</xref>). Overall, while TE influenced stress-responsive genes are enriched for short sequences with limited homology to sequences in other species, a significant proportion are longer, have several exons, are conserved in other species, and have GO annotations.</p><p>A particularly interesting aspect of these results is the potential mechanism for creating novel <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation. Our understanding of how particular genes might acquire novel regulatory mechanisms is limited. In many cases SNPs within promoters or regulatory sequences have limited functional significance. Therefore, it is difficult to envision how a novel response to a particular environmental or developmental cue would arise. Variation in TE insertions has the potential to create novel regulatory alleles by providing binding sites for transcription factors or influencing chromatin. We provide evidence that allelic variation for stress-responsive expression can be created by the insertion of certain TEs. Variation in TE insertions would generate allelic diversity that could influence an organism's response to environmental conditions and would provide phenotypic variation that could be acted upon by selection. As with other types of variation, most examples of novel stress-responsive expression are likely to be neutral or deleterious and would not be expected to rise in allele frequency. However, a subset of novel stress-responsive expression patterns could be beneficial and become targets of natural or artificial selection contributing to gene regulation networks of environmental stress response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant growth and stress conditions</title><p>B73, Mo17, and Oh43 maize seedlings were grown at 24&#x000b0;C in 1&#x02236;1 mix of autoclaved field soil and MetroMix under natural light conditions in July 2013.
