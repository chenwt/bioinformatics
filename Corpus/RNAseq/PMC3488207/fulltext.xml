In fact, none of the bacterial RNA isolation methods, including the commercial kits, are effective in recovering all species of intracellular RNAs (76&#x02013;5700&#x02009;nt) with equal efficiency, which can lead to biased results in genome-wide studies involving microarray or RNAseq analysis.

<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells that can be used directly for northern analysis without any further purification. Based on a comparative analysis of specific transcripts ranging in size from 76 to 5700&#x02009;nt, the RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; method provided the most accurate measure of the relative amounts of the various intracellular RNAs. Furthermore, the RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; RNA was successfully used in enzymatic reactions such as RNA ligation, reverse transcription, primer extension and reverse transcriptase&#x02013;polymerase chain reaction, following sodium acetate/ethanol precipitation. The RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; method can be used to isolate RNA from a wide range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria as well as yeast.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Historically working with bacterial RNA has been technically difficult because of its highly labile nature and the complicated procedures used for its isolation. Early RNA extractions employed guanidium isothiocyanate to lyse cells and denature proteins, while the RNA was isolated using a cesium chloride cushion and ultracentrifugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks680-B1">1</xref>). Subsequently, a hot phenol isolation method replaced cesium chloride gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks680-B2">2</xref>). However, RNA extractions using hot phenol had significant problems due to both the toxicity of the phenol and because the RNA obtained was not consistently of high quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks680-B3">3</xref>). Subsequently, a protocol was developed that combined guanidium isothiocyanate and phenol that yielded much more reproducible results compared to earlier methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks680-B4">4</xref>).</p><p>As the interest in RNA metabolism in bacteria grew, many companies developed kits making it easier for any laboratory to isolate total RNA. These kits, which are relatively expensive, can be very useful for isolating RNA enriched for specific sizes, since the kits vary greatly in the chemistry and/or mechanics used to lyse cells, denature and remove proteins and to actually isolate the RNA. The use of detergents to promote cell lysis led to the discovery of a cationic detergent (Catrimox-14&#x000ae;, Iowa Biotechnology Corp., Coralville, IA, USA) that both aided cell lysis and captured RNA and DNA by precipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks680-B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks680-B6">6</xref>). This method had the major advantage of not using phenol and provided good yields of high-quality RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks680-B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks680-B8">8</xref>). However, shortly after Qiagen acquired the patent rights to Catrimox-14&#x000ae; the detergent was withdrawn from the market. Subsequently, a variant of the Catrimox-14&#x000ae; isolation procedure was developed using a slightly different surfactant trimethyl(tetradecyl)ammonium bromide (called Catrimide), which is a very effective and inexpensive substitute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks680-B9">9</xref>).</p><p>As we initiated a detailed study of rRNA processing in <italic>Escherichia</italic>
<italic>coli</italic>, we wanted to use an RNA isolation procedure that could give us a rapid and accurate assessment of all RNA species within the cell. However, all current RNA isolation procedures contain multiple transfer steps, leading to reduced sample recovery. Furthermore, although each manufacturer provides specifications for the yield and RNA quality resulting from their procedure, there is no published side-by-side comparison of the various methods in terms of total RNA yield, RNA quality, size distribution of the isolated RNA molecules, time to carry out the procedure and cost per sample. In fact, upon examination of the various RNA samples we obtained using various kits and our own in-house experience with the Catrimide/LiCl method, it was apparent that none of the current RNA isolation methods provide an accurate representation of the intracellular RNA pools, since each method appears to selectively enrich for either large or small RNAs relative to the levels of medium sized species. Thus, depending on the isolation method used certain size classes of RNA were either enriched or depleted relative to the total RNA population.</p><p>We describe here a new RNA isolation procedure (called RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122;, for <bold>S</bold>imple <bold>N</bold>ucleic <bold>A</bold>cid <bold>P</bold>urification) that quantitatively recovers &#x0003e;99% of all RNA species in one step. The isolation method is remarkably simple, rapid, reproducible and inexpensive. With Gram-negative bacteria, it yields high-quality RNA in &#x0003c;15&#x02009;min that can be used directly for both polyacrylamide and agarose northern analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains</title><p><italic>Escherichia</italic>

The sample was then placed into a dry-ice ethanol slurry for 90&#x02009;s, and followed by 90&#x02009;s of incubation in a 37&#x000b0;C water bath. This freeze&#x02013;thaw cycle was repeated four times in total.

This approach helped to determine if loading errors could account for differences in signals between the two replicates, as the percentage difference should be the same for each of those RNA species probed in the same lanes, unless the RNA extraction method used caused non-quantitative recovery of a particular RNA species. It was also possible that a technical error during the transfer of RNA from the gel to the nitrocellulose membrane accounted for a difference between replicates, but this type of error is extraordinarily rare with polyacrylamide northerns in our hands, and occurs infrequently with agarose northerns.</p></sec><sec><title>Sodium acetate/ethanol precipitation method</title><p>The RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; RNA sample was first diluted with four volumes of water followed by addition of 1/10 volume of 3&#x02009;M sodium acetate, pH 5.2 and the sample was mixed by pipetting.

These variations are directly related to the particular isolation method employed due to the inherent properties of the matrices used in each procedure, which are biased towards either large (rRNA or other large mRNAs) or small (tRNAs and sRNAs) RNA species (see below). In order to help address the problems of both representative and quantitative recovery, we sought to develop a one-step RNA extraction procedure that could be carried out in a single tube in which total RNA was quantitatively recovered in the supernatant and the bulk of the DNA and proteins were left in the pellet. We hypothesized that such an approach would both greatly simplify RNA isolation and would provide a more accurate overview of the actual intracellular distribution of all RNA species, since any losses associated with multiple handling steps, such as phenol/chloroform extraction, would be eliminated.</p><p>During the development of the RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; method, we took advantage of the fact that <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were easily lysed in a boiling solution, such as used in colony PCR methods. In addition, it is standard practice to denature RNA in a formamide-based loading solution prior to its separation on either polyacrylamide or agarose gels. We combined aspects of these two techniques to develop the formamide-based RNA extraction solution described here (see &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section). We observed that exponentially growing <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were rapidly lysed when suspended in this solution and heated at 95&#x000b0;C for 7&#x02009;min. Following centrifugation for 5&#x02009;min at 16&#x02009;000<italic>g</italic>, the RNA was in the supernatant and the gelatinous pellet contained protein, cell debris and the majority of the DNA. The RNA was quantified based on A<sub>260</sub> by first blanking a spectrophotometer with the RNA extraction solution. It was important that the RNA extraction solution was made fresh and was also used as the blank, since the A<sub>260</sub> of the extraction solution itself changed over time after the addition of 2-mercaptoethanol. A one ml sample of an early exponential culture of <italic>E. coli</italic> (10<sup>8</sup> cells) yielded 60&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3&#x02009;&#x000b5;g of total RNA with the entire procedure taking &#x0003c;15&#x02009;min (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gks680-T1">Table 1</xref>).

The genomic DNA contamination in the RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; sample was comparable to that obtained with the other isolation methods (data not shown). However, although minor genomic DNA contamination does not interfere with northern blot analysis and some enzymatic reactions, it can interfere during experiments involving reverse transcription and RNAseq analysis.

Accordingly, we scaled up the isolation to 10&#x02009;ml of culture (10<sup>9</sup> cells), but again carried out the protocol in a single tube. Following removal of the supernatant containing the RNA, the pellet was gently washed once with the extraction solution at room temperature. After a subsequent centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in water and extracted using acidic phenol/chloroform (See &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section). The aqueous phase was precipitated with sodium acetate/ethanol and resuspended in water. In each of two replicates, &#x0223c;2.5&#x02009;&#x000b5;g of high-quality RNA was recovered from the re-extracted pellet, while &#x0003e;700&#x02009;&#x000b5;g of RNA were found in the original supernatant, indicating that the efficiency of RNA recovery from <italic>E. coli</italic> using the RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; method was &#x0003e;99% (data not shown). An amount of 250&#x02009;ng of RNA from both the re-extracted pellet and the original supernatant were run on an agarose gel to confirm the presence, quality and quantity of the RNA. Interestingly, the profile of the various abundant RNA species (tRNAs, 5S rRNA, sRNAs, 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA) was identical between the two RNA samples upon visual inspection of the agarose gel (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; isolated RNA</title><p>In an attempt to determine the size distribution of the transcripts present in the RNA isolated by the RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; method, we compared the RNA samples obtained using our previously optimized Catrimide/LiCl method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks680-B9">9</xref>) and three of the most widely used commercially available RNA isolation kits [TRIzol&#x000ae; Max&#x02122; Bacteria (Invitrogen), RNeasy&#x000ae; Protect Bacteria (Qiagen) and RiboPure&#x02122; Bacteria (Ambion)]. Each extraction method was tested using at least two independent biological replicates and two or more technical replicates per biological replicate. The quality of each RNA sample was assessed using three main criteria: purity as determined by a spectrophotometer (A<sub>260/280</sub> ratio); the 23S rRNA/16S rRNA ratio as determined by Bioanalyzer analysis (Agilent Technologies); and an RNA integrity number (RIN) derived from the Bioanalyzer analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gks680-T2">Table 2</xref>). The RIN number (standardization of RNA quality control) was developed using total eukaryotic RNA, based on a numbering system of 1&#x02013;10, with 1 being the most degraded RNA and 10 being the most intact (Agilent Technologies). It has been demonstrated that with bacterial RNAs a RIN value &#x0003c;7 led to significant variations in data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks680-B12">12</xref>).</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks680-F1">Figure 1</xref>, the quality of the RNA derived using the RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; method was as good or better than RNA obtained by the other methods tested based on both bioanalyzer analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks680-F1">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="table" rid="gks680-T2">Table 2</xref>) and agarose gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks680-F1">Figure 1</xref>B). The ratio of <italic>E. coli</italic> 23S to 16S rRNA in the samples isolated by the RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; method was 1.8, which came closer to the theoretical ratio of 1.88 (2904&#x02009;nt/1541&#x02009;nt) than any other method tested (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gks680-T2">Table 2</xref>). The A<sub>260/280</sub> ratio of &#x0223c;2.0 for all the RNA preparations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gks680-T2">Table 2</xref>) indicated that all of the samples were relatively pure with the possible exception of the RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; sample. Normally, an A<sub>260/280</sub> ratio of 1.8&#x02013;2 is indicative of highly purified RNA when resuspended in a buffered solution like Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0. However, this ratio is highly dependent on the pH and the ionic strength of the solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks680-B13">13</xref>). The pH of the RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; RNA sample was &#x0223c;9.4. As predicted, resuspension of the RNA in RNase-free water after a sodium acetate/ethanol precipitation significantly improved the ratio (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gks680-T2">Table 2</xref>). Additionally, diluting the RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; RNA sample 4-fold with RNase-free water improved the A<sub>260/280</sub> ratio to 1.9 (data not shown), which was comparable to the other methods shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="gks680-T2">Table 2</xref>. Thus, the low 260/280 ratio seen with the RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; RNA sample most likely resulted from the presence of formamide.

In addition, the RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; procedure was easily and quantitatively scaled up to handle 10&#x02009;ml of culture (10<sup>9</sup> cells) for situations where larger amounts of RNA were needed. Furthermore, the RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; RNA could be used directly in both polyacrylamide/urea and agarose gels without further purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks680-F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Although all the data shown here involved <italic>E. coli</italic> RNA, we have used the RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; method to successfully isolate high-quality RNA from a number of other Gram-negative bacteria including: <italic>Alcalingenes faecalis</italic> (ATCC 8750); <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> (ATCC 14756); <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> (ATCC 9199); <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC 27853); <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> (ATCC 29629); <italic>Ruegeria pomeroyi</italic> (ATCC 700808); and <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> DK1622.

It should be noted that for all applications involving enzymatic reactions, the RNA from the RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; method was further purified using a sodium acetate/ethanol precipitation step (see &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section). Specifically, we compared RNA samples isolated using either the RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; or the Trizol&#x000ae; Max&#x02122; RNA isolation procedures in an RT&#x02013;PCR experiment that amplified the <italic>E. coli lpp</italic> mRNA.

The PCR amplification reached a plateau after 10 cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks680-F3">Figure 3</xref>). In addition, RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; isolated RNA was used in determining the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-ends of the <italic>pheU</italic> and <italic>pheV</italic> tRNA transcripts (Bowden,K., Mohanty,B.

RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; isolated RNA has also been used successfully in various primer extension experiments.

As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="gks680-T1">Table 1</xref>, not only did the RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; method provide the highest total RNA yield of all five isolation procedures (1.7&#x02009;- to 4-fold higher), but it was also the fastest and least expensive.</p><p>Furthermore, the method ensures the isolation of the widest range of RNA species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gks680-T1">Table 1</xref>). Using eight transcripts ranging in size between 76 and 5700&#x02009;nt, we have demonstrated that the RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; isolation procedure is an unbiased method that likely preserves the <italic>in vivo</italic> distribution of all RNA species, thus providing the most accurate representation of intracellular RNA pools compared to any of the other isolation methods tested. Furthermore, it works equally well with exponential and stationary phase cultures.</p><p>For downstream applications such as primer extension analysis, RNA ligation and RT&#x02013;PCR, further purification of RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; isolated RNA using sodium acetate/ethanol precipitation was very straightforward. A faster but significantly more expensive option was the RNeasy&#x000ae; kit (or similar silica-column-based extraction kit) or RiboPure&#x02122; kit, which can be used to recover the RNA from the formamide-based RNA extraction solution. Using either column-based method following the RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; extraction yielded extremely high-quality RNA suitable for any type of highly-sensitive RNA analysis (data not shown). However, the drawback to using a column, as demonstrated in this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gks680-T3">Table 3</xref>, RNeasy&#x000ae; Protect Bacteria and RiboPure&#x02122; Bacteria), was the non-quantitative recovery of RNA species depending on their size and possible secondary/tertiary structure of the RNA molecule.</p><p>With the advent of qRT&#x02013;PCR, microarrays and next generation sequencing, genome-wide expression profiling has become an indispensible tool to decipher biological systems. However, at the heart of the most robust and sophisticated gene-expression analysis lays the quality and reproducibility of the extracted RNA pool. For example, if a research group were to use a column-based RNA extraction methodology, such as those tested in this study, to examine maturation of small RNAs &#x0003c;200&#x02009;nt, the results of the study would be flawed due to non-quantitative recovery of RNA molecules &#x0003c;200&#x02009;nt using the RNA extraction methods (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gks680-T3">Table 3</xref>). Alternatively, if a group were to examine the relative abundance of a 1000&#x02009;nt transcript compared with a 5000&#x02009;nt transcript, the ratio between the two abundances would vary considerably based on the RNA extraction methodology employed. More importantly, it is clear that no RNA isolation methodology (with the exception of the RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; method) is suitable for the study of all types and sizes of RNA molecules in the same experiment. Overall, the quality and representative recovery offered by RNA<italic>snap</italic>&#x02122; method is unmatched by the other methods tested in this study and is uniquely suited for highthroughput gene-expression analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Funding for open access charge: <funding-source>The National Institutes of General Medical Sciences</funding-source> [<award-id>GM81554</award-id> to S.R.K.]. </p><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
