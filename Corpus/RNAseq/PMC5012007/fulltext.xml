Evidences suggested that this resistance mechanism is part of a more complex cellular adaptation process. Using an integrative strategy, we found this mechanism to invoke extensive transcriptomic, (phospho-) proteomic and phenotypic alterations that accompany a cellular transition to a de-differentiated, mesenchymal and invasive state. Even short-term BRAF-inhibitor exposure leads to an early adaptive, differentiation state change&#x02014;characterized by a slow-cycling, persistent state. The early persistent state is distinct from the late proliferative, resistant state. However, both differentiation states share common signaling alterations including JUN upregulation. Motivated by the similarities, we found that co-targeting of BRAF and JUN is synergistic in killing fully resistant cells; and when used up-front, co-targeting substantially impairs the formation of the persistent subpopulation. We confirmed that JUN upregulation is a common response to BRAF inhibitor treatment in clinically treated patient tumors. Our findings demonstrate that events shared between early- and late-adaptation states provide candidate up-front co-treatment targets.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Drug resistance</kwd><kwd>BRAF inhibition</kwd><kwd>EMT</kwd><kwd>melanoma</kwd><kwd>phospho-proteomics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Advanced metastatic melanoma is a cancer with traditionally poor treatment options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>]. However, in 2002, BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> was discovered as a common melanoma oncogene that is detected in approximately 50% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>]. This led to the development and eventual FDA approval of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib/PLX4032 and dabrafenib/GSK2118436 for patients with advanced melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7">4&#x02013;7</xref>]. These BRAF inhibitors induce an objective response rate beyond 50% but are limited by a median duration of response of 6&#x02013;7 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>]. As with other cancer therapies, intrinsic, adaptive and acquired resistance pose major challenges toward further clinical benefits of BRAF inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>].</p><p>The various reported BRAF inhibitor resistance mechanisms help to explain the continuum of evolutionary processes underlying intrinsic, adaptive and acquired resistance. These include genetic alterations that reactivate MAPK signaling such as NRAS mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>], MEK mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>] or mutant BRAF amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>], which clearly account for acquired or late clinical resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>]. Other resistance mechanisms that involve upregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and a potential rebalancing of signaling toward the PI3K/AKT axis likely account for early resistance associated with intrinsic or adaptive processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>]. These RTK alterations include IGF1R activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>], overexpression of PDGFR-beta (PDGFRB), EGFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>] and potentially other RTKs (RTK-associated resistance mechanism; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14 bib15 bib16">14&#x02013;16</xref>]). In addition, melanoma cells can show an early adaptive response to vemurafenib treatment with subpopulations undergoing cell death induction or growth arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>], preceding proliferative resistance. This persistent survival state capable of later proliferation may function as a reservoir for late, acquired resistance formation driven by genetic selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>].</p><p>For other cancer types, systems-wide resistance programs have been identified, which reflect complex signaling and phenotypic alterations accounting for intrinsic or adaptive drug resistance. Most prominently, the transition from an epithelial to a mesenchymal differentiation state (EMT) has been reported for various cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19 bib20 bib21">19&#x02013;21</xref>]. Although mainly thought to provide cancer cells with a more invasive phenotype, EMT has been also directly linked to cancer drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22 bib23 bib24 bib25 bib26 bib27">22&#x02013;27</xref>]. An EMT-like transition has been reported to contribute to melanoma metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>] and, in general, melanoma cells show a high level of differentiation state plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29 bib30 bib31 bib32">29&#x02013;32</xref>]. Initial reports on the RTK-resistance mechanism implicated upregulation of RTKs such as PDGFRB, IGF1R and MET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>]. However, a more complex cellular adaptation to vemurafenib treatment was indicated both by these initial studies and by subsequent reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>]. For instance, other RTKs such as EGFR and AXL are also upregulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>], upregulation of RTKs shows temporal dynamics, and pharmacological inhibition of single RTKs, such as PDGFRB, is not fully effective in impeding resistance. Moreover, the resistant cells show morphological alterations such as a flatter and fibroblast-like appearance. These spindled and proliferative resistant melanoma cells are often found to be derived from short-term adapted, persisted cells that survived the stress of BRAF inhibition.</p><p>Here using (phospho-) proteomic profiling, we further characterize the extent to which the observed temporal dynamic of RTK upregulation, morphologic switches and cell cycle adaptations are components of a complex and large-scale adaptation program and investigate the evolution of these resistant cells using an integrative proteomic and genomic approach. In systems-level comparisons, we find the early- and late-adaptive states to be distinct, but to share common signaling alterations. Motivated by the similarities, we demonstrate that targeting an event shared between the adaptation states, JUN upregulation, can provide an effective up-front co-treatment strategy against the adaptive response.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>RTK-associated resistance displays extensive proteomic alterations in cell attachment and cytoskeleton signaling that are associated with a more mesenchymal state</title><p>To gain further insights into a previously reported BRAF inhibitor resistance mechanism that involves upregulation of RTKs including PDGFRB (RTK-associated resistance mechanism; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>]), we compared the signaling network states of two melanoma cell subline pairs of parental (P) and derived resistant (R) cells (M229P/R and M238P/R). We used previously established and validated, quantitative, mass-spectrometry-based phospho-profiling procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38 bib39 bib40 bib41">38&#x02013;41</xref>]. First, we focused on phospho-tyrosine signaling using a pan-specific anti-phospho-tyrosine enrichment procedure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob2">Supplementary Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob17">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). We only identified a limited number of significantly altered tyrosine-phosphorylation sites, which included upregulated phosphorylation of focal adhesion components (paxillin (PXN)) and caveolin (CAV1) in the resistant cells. The lack of a more global increase in phospho-Tyr signaling was initially unexpected for an RTK-associated resistance mechanism, but confirmed by western blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob3">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>), and further motivated a more global analysis of this resistance mechanism. For this, we used a complementary phospho-profiling procedure, in which titania material enriches for peptides phosphorylated on serine, threonine or tyrosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob2">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob18">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Importantly, both cell line pairs showed high correspondence between the observed signaling alterations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob4">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Upregulated signaling events in the resistant cells included phosphorylation of JUN (pS63; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>]), and phosphorylation of the RAS-family member RRAS2 (pS192). Signaling events upregulated in resistant cells were significantly enriched for cytoskeletal components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob18">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Visualization of a functional interaction network for the observed signaling alterations highlights several perturbed signaling processes, most prominent of which included signaling perturbations in cytoskeleton and cell attachment processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><p>To investigate whether the observed global alterations in cell attachment processes are accompanied by alterations in the extracellular context of these cells, we compared the extracellular matrix (ECM) secreted by the two parental/resistant cell line pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob22">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). The ECM of the resistant cells showed a striking increase in collagen alpha-1 chain type I (COL1A1), fibronectin (FN1), thrombospondin 1 (THBS1), perlecan (HSPG2) and matrilin 2 (MATN2). Interestingly, all five proteins have been previously associated with a mesenchymal differentiation state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43 bib44 bib45">43&#x02013;45</xref>]. Moreover, PDGFRB expression itself, the initial hallmark of the analyzed resistance mechanism, is a marker for mesenchymal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>].</p><p>These findings, together with the previously noted morphological changes of the resistant cells (flatter, larger and more fibroblast-like; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>]), motivated us to further test whether the RTK-resistance mechanism is associated with a differentiation state change to a more mesenchymal state. To this end, we evaluated more systematically the expression pattern of mesenchymal marker genes in the resistant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>]). Both RTK-resistance mechanism cell lines (M229R and M238R), but not an NRAS-resistance (MAPK reactivation) mechanism cell line (M249R), demonstrate a significant upregulation of mesenchymal marker genes including <italic>collagen alpha-1 chain type I</italic> (<italic>COL1A1</italic>), <italic>fibronectin</italic> (<italic>FN1</italic>) and <italic>alpha smooth muscle actin</italic> (<italic>ACTA2</italic>). This is further corroborated by the significant enrichment of &#x02018;mesenchymal&#x02019; gene sets from the CCancer database in the RTK-mechanism gene expression signature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob24">Supplementary Table S4</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>]). Furthermore, we directly compared the RTK-resistance mechanism gene expression signature with a mesenchymal expression signature from a published global map of human gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>]). Again, a highly significant overlap of the genes upregulated in the RTK-mechanism signature and the mesenchymal signature genes supports that the resistant melanoma cells are in a state that strongly resembles mesenchymal cells. Finally, to further validate the differentiation state change of the RTK-resistant cells toward a more mesenchymal state, we confirmed the expression of select marker genes (PDGFRB, FN1 and ACTA2) at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>RTK-resistance mechanism resembles the invasive phenotype associated with a common de-differentiation state in melanoma</title><p>Having established that the RTK-resistance mechanism cells have undergone a transition to a more mesenchymal state, which is reminiscent of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition in other cancer types, we investigated the relation of this process with known melanoma biology. On the basis of overlapping marker genes and proteins (for example, FN1 upregulation and MITF downregulation), we identified a biological similarity to a reported phenotypic switch in (BRAF inhibitor-naive) melanoma, as reported in a series of publications by Hoek, Dummer and colleagues. Here, melanoma cells transition between a &#x02018;proliferative&#x02019; and an &#x02018;invasive&#x02019; state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29 bib30 bib31 bib32">29&#x02013;32</xref>]. Notably, the gene expression signature of the RTK-resistance mechanism highly overlaps with the &#x02018;invasive phenotype&#x02019; signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>]). This was further confirmed by a more extensive pairwise rank-based correlation analysis of RTK-mechanism, phenotypic switch and negative control signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). This similarity is also apparent on the level of individual marker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Note that upregulation of RTKs (EGFR and PDGFRB) is a component of the &#x02018;invasive&#x02019; phenotype signature. Thus, these two transition processes&#x02014;resistance formation upon exposure to BRAF inhibitors and the more stochastic melanoma phenotypic switch&#x02014;highly overlap.</p><p>These gene expression similarities predict similarities in the resulting phenotypes. Phenotypes reported for the &#x02018;invasive&#x02019; state include increased invasion and formation of tubuli-like structures on Matrigel and other alterations in cell attachment and migration processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>]. We tested these phenotypes for the two cell line pairs and found similar phenotypic alterations for the RTK-resistance mechanism cells: increased tubuli-like structure formation on Matrigel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), increased cellular clustering/sphere formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>), increased invasion through Matrigel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>) and stronger attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). In contrast, the NRAS-mechanism M249 parental/resistant cell line pair does not show a corresponding increase in mesenchymal markers including FN1, ACTA2 and PDGFRB nor an induction of tubuli-like structure formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob24">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Hence, the RTK-associated resistance mechanism involves an extensive differentiation state switch to a more mesenchymal and &#x02018;invasive&#x02019; state.</p></sec><sec><title>BRAF inhibition-induced early adaption persistent cells demonstrate a distinct de-differentiation state compared with long-term adaptation</title><p>Having documented that long-term adaptation to vemurafenib treatment (that is, full resistance formation) engages a complex differentiation program, we asked how this long-term adaptive state compares with the short-term adaptive state of vemurafenib-treated melanoma cells. We and others have observed that melanoma cell lines treated with vemurafenib show only limited cell death concomitant with persistence of a slow-cycling subpopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob6">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>]). This persistent cell subpopulation is thought to constitute a reservoir for the development of subsequent proliferative resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>].</p><p>Whole-proteome profiling and clustering demonstrated that the persisting cells are themselves in a distinct cellular state compared with both the parental, drug-naive cells and the chronically drug-exposed, proliferative resistant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob7">Supplementary Figures S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob8">S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob25">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). Not surprisingly, the persistent state was clearly marked by the growth arrest-coherent downregulation of several translation-, metabolism- and cell cycle-related proteins. In addition, the persistent state was characterized by elevated expression of several melanoma de-differentiation marker proteins such as NGFR/CD271, ALCAM/CD166 and S100B: NGFR has been identified as a presumptive marker for melanoma-initiating/tumor stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>], a neural-crest cell marker for desmoplastic and neurotropic melanomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>] and a marker for immunotherapy-resistant, de-differentiated melanoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>]; ALCAM was identified as a melanocytic stem cell marker, which shows higher expression for melanomas than banal nevi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>]; and S100B has been associated with disease stage, reduced survival, metastases and treatment response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>]. Validation experiments for cell surface expression of NGFR/CD271 by flow cytometry demonstrated high upregulation in persisting cells, but even downregulation for one of the resistant cell lines (M238R; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c and d</xref>). In reverse, markers for the resistant state (PDGFRB and FN1) were not or were only slightly elevated in the persistent state (see below). In summary, although both long-term and short-term adaptation involve a differentiation state change, these states are distinct.</p><p>To gain insights into the signaling alterations occurring upon short-term BRAF inhibitor exposure and resulting in the persistent population&#x02014;and to subsequently compare these with the fully resistant state&#x02014;we conducted an additional global phospho-profiling experiment on three parental vs early drug-persistent pairs (from the aforementioned M229 and M238 parental lines as well as another BRAF inhibitor sensitive line M249; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob26">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob26">Supplementary Table S6</xref>). Persistence formation resulted in a distinct signaling state&#x02014;with a higher consistency for the M229P and the M238P pairs than for the M249P pair (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob9">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). Again, many downregulated phosphorylation sites, total proteins and the predicted downregulation of CDK1/2 signaling logically reflected the growth-downregulated state of the persistent cells, for example, downregulation of phosphorylated translation factors, metabolic enzymes and cell cycle proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob27">Supplementary Table S6</xref>). Several phosphorylation sites were consistently upregulated in the persistent cells, including PKC-alpha (PRKCA), NOTCH2, SP3 and Catenin Alpha-1 (CTNNA1).</p></sec><sec><title>Although overall distinct, the early persisting subpopulation shares particular signaling alterations with the proliferative resistant state</title><p>The short-term adaptation persistent cells are in an overall distinct cellular state with a different set of signaling alterations. However, we questioned whether long- and short-term adaptation to vemurafenib treatment share any signaling alterations that could potentially guide the identification of (co-) treatment approaches that prevent and/or target adaptive responses. To this end, we ranked the signaling alterations by a combined perturbation score incorporating the measured changes in the two fully resistant and two persistent cell line pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob28">Supplementary Table S7</xref>). The shared upregulated signaling events include PKC-alpha (PRKCA, pT497), JUN (pS63), progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1, pS57 and pS54), and tumor suppressor p53-binding protein 1 (TP53BP1, pS500 and pS380). Note that phospho-JUN upregulation was initially only detected in the resistant pairs, but clear evidence of its upregulation in the persistent cells was also obtained through a targeted analysis of the mass-spectrometry data set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob10">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>) and by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>)&#x02014;for both the S63 and the S73 site of JUN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob11">Supplementary Figure S10B</xref>). For both PKC-alpha and the transcription factor JUN, our data and analysis provided multiple lines of evidence implicating their role in the BRAF inhibitor adaptive states. In addition to its increase in net phosphorylation levels, JUN is transcriptionally upregulated in the resistant and the &#x02018;invasive phenotype&#x02019; melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Moreover, a transcription factor binding site enrichment analysis of the RTK-resistance mechanism gene expression data predicted higher JUN activity for the resistant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob29">Supplementary Table S8</xref>). In the case of PKC-alpha, the kinase enrichment analysis of our phosphorylation data set implicated a higher PKC kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).</p><p>We further confirmed the Jun and PKC signaling alterations by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Upregulation of JUN and phospho-JUN is observed in an expanded panel of three resistant sublines with RTK-associated resistance but not in an alternate subline with mutant NRAS-driven resistance (M249R). Similarly, we observed alteration in the pattern of PKC isoform phosphorylation and upregulation of a single PKC isoform associated only with the RTK-resistance mechanism using the same set of cell line pairs. We confirmed that the resistance mechanism results specifically in upregulation of the PKC-alpha isoform using a knockdown strategy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob11">Supplementary Figure S10A</xref>). We classified this phenomenon as a PKC isoform switch, as from three detectable isoforms only phosphorylation of PKC-alpha is strongly induced. Both the JUN and PKC signaling alterations are also detected in the early persistent cellular subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob11">Supplementary Figure S10B</xref>).</p><p>Next, we tested whether the cell cycle downregulation, as well as JUN and PKC signaling responses to short-term BRAF inhibitor treatment are common. We treated three additional BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-positive melanoma cell lines with vemurafenib and found that each and every persistent cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>) displayed consistent upregulation of JUN and phospho-JUN upon short-term BRAF inhibitor exposure. In contrast, the PKC isoform switch was observed in half of the lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). To validate that these responses are on-target effects of vemurafenib, we repeated these experiments with dabrafenib, an alternative FDA-approved BRAF inhibitor ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>). Both BRAF inhibitors show the same effects on both JUN upregulation and the PKC isoform switch. In addition, we find that the observed response is present for BRAF-mutated, but not NRAS-mutated melanoma cells, supporting these responses as on-target effects of the BRAF inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Co-targeting mutant BRAF signaling and JUN function results in synergistic death and diminishes the persistent cell reservoir</title><p>With JUN upregulation and the PKC isoform switch as shared signaling alterations between the early persistent, survival and later, proliferative drug-resistant states, we next asked whether these alterations are optimal co-treatment targets. As initial experimentation showed that JUN knockdown, but not PKC-alpha knockdown, was effective in a vemurafenib co-treatment experiment, we focused our further efforts in this study on JUN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob12">Supplementary Figure S11</xref>). Of note, in future studies, it will be pertinent to combine isoform-specific activity and substrate measurements to reveal the functional role of the PKC isoform switch.</p><p>JUN knockdown by itself only minimally affected untreated parental melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In strong contrast, JUN knockdown induced substantial and significant death in our panel of both resistant cell lines and short-term vemurafenib-treated (that is, persistent) cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a&#x02013;d</xref>). Of note, the kinetics of JUN upregulation impacts the optimal sensitivity window for JUN knockdown: M229P cells show slower JUN upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>) and accordingly are most effectively co-targeted after longer vemurafenib pre-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Consistent with the death assays, in co-treated resistant and persistent cultures, we observe synergistic induction of apoptosis markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e&#x02013;l</xref>). Note that we had selected the different timings for these experiments to accommodate for the different biological response times of the phenotypic effects on cell viability and apoptosis induction, as well as the response kinetics of the JUN knockdown procedure. Although there was a degree of expected cell line heterogeneity, overall, JUN siRNA knockdown had a significant effect on cell viability both for the panel of resistant (<italic>P</italic>-value=4E&#x02212;6) and persisting cells (<italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c;2E&#x02212;16) and significantly induced apoptosis in the resistant/persisting cell line panel (<italic>P</italic>-value=1E&#x02212;8), but not in the parental cell line panel. Finally, we corroborated the specificity for JUN in these responses with individual siRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob13">Supplementary Figure S12</xref>) and independent retroviral-based shRNA constructs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob14">Supplementary Figure S13</xref>). With this, JUN upregulation represents a signaling alteration shared between the early adaptation (persistent population) and late adaptation (proliferative resistance) and that can be effectively up-front co-targeted to result in synergistic cell death and diminish the persistent cell reservoir.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vivo</italic> upregulation of JUN in short-term treated patients and disease progression melanoma biopsies</title><p>Finally, we evaluated JUN upregulation in patient samples. For this, we queried our patient-biopsy mRNA expression database containing on-treatment biopsies from four patients and 27 disease progression biopsies. On-treatment biopsies were obtained 6&#x02013;22 days after treatment onset and the disease progression biopsies were obtained from patients on the progression of disease after the initial progression-free response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob30">Supplementary Table S9</xref>). When compared with baseline JUN expression, two out of four on-treatment biopsies (two of four patients) and 6 out of 27 disease progression biopsies (5 of 11 patients) demonstrated significant upregulation of JUN mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). There was a slight enrichment of JUN upregulation in disease progression samples that do not harbor an identified MAPK-pathway reactivation resistance mechanism. JUN protein-based immunohistochemistry staining of tumor sections confirmed the mRNA results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b and c</xref>). With this, JUN upregulation is a common response to BRAF inhibitor treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>BRAF inhibitors including vemurafenib and dabrafenib, have provided unprecedented benefits for the treatment of metastatic melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>]. However, resistance development severely limits the rate and duration of clinical response to the BRAF inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>]. Although only a minority of patients carry tumors with pre-existing resistance and do not clinically respond to BRAF inhibitor treatment (intrinsic resistance), most patients show an initial response followed by progression with a median time of 6&#x02013;7 months (acquired resistance). This is because BRAF inhibitor treatment can leave behind a persistent cell population that does not show full resistance (for example, shows a low proliferation rate) but serves as a cellular reservoir for the development of full-blown proliferative resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>].</p><p>Several BRAF inhibitor resistance mechanisms have been identified. These are commonly classified into mechanisms that either reactivate the MAP-kinase pathway or mechanisms that activate alternative pathways such as the PI3K&#x02013;AKT pathway. Among the former is the acquisition of secondary NRAS/KRAS mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>] and the expression of a truncated BRAF variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref>]; among the latter is the overexpression of PDGFRB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>] or IGF1R ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>]; RTK-associated resistance mechanisms). In addition, proteins that contribute to early persistence have been identified, including FOXD3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>]. These previous studies have engendered clinical strategies such as BRAFi+MEKi or BRAFi+AKTi already being tested (and showing promise) in patients.</p><p>Here, we undertook an integrative proteomics/transcriptomic approach to understand the context and global alterations associated with resistance formation to devise novel BRAFi-based combinatorial strategies to suppress resistance. To this end, we have generated several quantitative protein, phospho-protein and ECM-protein expression data sets for different cellular states (parental, resistant, persistent). A challenge for the direct integration of the data sets (as seen for JUN phosphorylation, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob10">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>) was the often limited overlap of the detected proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob15">Supplementary Figure S14</xref>). Pairwise comparisons demonstrate that although expected similarities exist, these data sets are consistent and largely complementary (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob15">Supplementary Figure S14</xref>). This is reflected in our integration approach presented here: rather than a one-shot data generation/integration step, each data set was generated by considering the previous insights and conceptually integrating them in a step-by-step manner to reveal the important factors in the mechanism of resistance.</p><p>At the onset of our study, the available data suggested that the RTK-resistance mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>] takes place in a broader context of adaptive alterations. For example, pharmacological inhibition of PDGFRB by itself is not fully effective, and RTK-associated resistant cells show striking cellular morphological alterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>]. In addition, in the current study, we did not find evidence for overall increased phospho-Tyr signaling in these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob12">Supplementary Figures S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob3">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob17">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Rather, consistent with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>], we found that RTK-associated resistant cells express a mesenchymal gene signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), show extensive alterations in cytoskeleton and cell attachment-related signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and secrete ECM components that are associated with a mesenchymal state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43 bib44 bib45">43&#x02013;45</xref>]. With this, the de-differentiation response of the resistant cells is reminiscent of EMT observed in other cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>]. EMT has been associated with metastasis formation, which is consistent with the observed cytoskeletal and invasive phenotype alterations. Moreover, EMT has been reported as a mechanism of resistance to kinase inhibitor therapies for several cancer types including lung, colorectal and breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref>]. In these cases as well, the mesenchymal resistance phenotype is thought to involve a multitude of signaling alterations (for example, upregulation of several RTKs) rather than a single gene alteration or mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref>]. Importantly, PDGFRB upregulation is also a common component of these mesenchymal transition programs and its role in migration and resistance has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref>]. Taken together, PDGFRB and RTK family upregulation, the hallmark alteration of the analyzed resistance mechanism, is part of a more extensive EMT-like de-differentiation program that involves a multitude of signaling changes.</p><p>Differentiation state plasticity has also been reported before the BRAF inhibitor era&#x02014;initially and most extensively in a series of reports by Hoek and Dummer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29 bib30 bib31 bib32">29&#x02013;32</xref>]. In these reports, untreated (BRAF inhibitor-naive) melanoma cells were found to transition between a &#x02018;proliferative&#x02019; and an &#x02018;invasive&#x02019; state. In a direct gene signature comparison, we found a striking overlap between the resistant/de-differentiation state and the Hoek&#x02013;Dummer &#x02018;invasive&#x02019; state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The key feature of &#x02018;invasive&#x02019; melanoma cells is their altered cell attachment and migration phenotype, phenotypes that we found to be also exhibited by BRAF inhibitor-resistant cells. In addition, published reports have demonstrated that MAPK-pathway inhibition in &#x02018;proliferative&#x02019; melanoma cells can at least partially induce phenotypic features of the &#x02018;invasive&#x02019; state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>]. Other examples for differentiation state plasticity in melanoma&#x02014;with close ties to the resistant/invasive/mesenchymal state&#x02014;include vasculogenic mimicry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref>] and acquisition of stem-like properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">68</xref>]. Importantly, independent reports support the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of this mesenchymal de-differentiation state in BRAF inhibitor-naive melanoma. Bittner <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">69</xref>] identified a related invasive phenotype cluster using short-term melanoma cultures. In addition, Lewis <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">70</xref>] analyzed melanoma patient samples directly by RT-PCR and identified a cluster of samples that demonstrates features of the invasive/mesenchymal phenotype (for example, increased WNT5a, JUN, EGFR expression). Finally, in recent publications, we and others reported on the relevance of a closely related MITF<sup>low</sup>/AXL<sup>high</sup> cellular state in melanoma resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>]. With this, the observed differentiation state and phenotypic alteration of the BRAF inhibitor-resistant cells complements previous studies and clearly reflects the common cellular plasticity program of melanoma cells and tumors. Of note, the link established here between the de-differentiation and BRAF inhibitor resistance has also implications for other undesired outcomes such as the induction of an enhanced metastasis potential&#x02014;for example, a recent retrospective analysis showed an increase in metastasis formation for patients that failed BRAF inhibitor treatment compared with dacarbazine treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">71</xref>].</p><p>We and others have observed that vemurafenib treatment induces a slow-cycling, persistent cell population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>], which serves as a likely reservoir for the emergence of fully resistant proliferative cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>]. On exploring the relationship between the early persistent and the fully resistant state using molecular profiling, we found the persistent state to be distinct from the fully resistant state and from the parental state. Specifically, clustering analysis separated the states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob8">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>); markers for the resistant state (PDGFRB and FN1) were not or were only slightly elevated in the persistent state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>); and the persistent state showed distinct marker expression such as NGFR/CD271 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). On the basis of its molecular program, the de-differentiation persistent state is potentially related to the NGFR/CD271<sup>hi</sup> state reported by Landsberg <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>] as a resistance mechanism to adaptive T-cell therapy, and to the NGFR/CD271<sup>hi</sup> state of melanoma stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">72</xref>], which, however, is still debated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">73</xref>].</p><p>Despite clear differences in the complex changes associated with the slow-cycling/persistent and resistant states, we asked whether these short-term and long-term adaptation programs share any potentially targetable signaling alterations. Among the identified shared signaling alterations between these states were JUN upregulation and a PKC isoform switch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In BRAF inhibitor-naive melanoma, JUN has been reported as a regulator of tumor progression and as a potential therapeutic target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74 bib75 bib76 bib77">74&#x02013;77</xref>]. JUN upregulation has been associated with melanoma treatment resistance to classical chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">78</xref>]. In BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma cells, JUN was characterized as a mediator of upregulated PD-L1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">79</xref>]. Forced expression of the JUN binding partner FOS can confer resistance to RAF and MEK inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">80</xref>]. In our study, JUN knockdown was synergistic with BRAF inhibition in co-treatment experiments, whereas JUN knockdown in parental cells had only a minimal effect, it prevented vemurafenib persistence and significantly decreased viability of resistant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In addition, we found that JUN upregulation is a common treatment response in melanoma patient samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). From this, we conclude that early and late vemurafenib non-responsive states share signaling alterations that can be effectively targeted <italic>in vitro,</italic> and we provide initial evidence that these alterations are observed <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Recently, in support of our finding, Fallahi-Sichani <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">81</xref>] and Ramsdale <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">82</xref>] have independently identified the relevance of JNK/c-JUN signaling in the adaptive response of melanoma cells to vemurafenib treatment. In our experiments, only JUN knockdown but not pharmacological JNK inhibition was effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob16">Supplementary Figure S15</xref>). A similar observation has been made previously by Spangler <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">74</xref>]. In the study by Fallahi-Sichani <italic>et al.,</italic> a recently developed and improved JNK inhibitor JNK-IN-8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">83</xref>] was effective, whereas the JNK inhibitor SP600125 that was used in our study had a much more limited effect. Considering the strong inhibitory effect of SP600125 on JUN phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob16">Supplementary Figure S15</xref>) and the previously reported complexity of pharmacological JNK inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">85</xref>], the implementation of JNK inhibition strategies in the clinic warrants a more detailed understanding of these differences in cellular response.</p><p>Despite the breakthrough that BRAF inhibitors brought to malignant melanoma therapy, major challenges lie ahead toward more effective and longer lasting treatments. The complexity of the adaptive response of melanoma cells&#x02014;early in the form of persistence and later in the form of full resistance&#x02014;poses a major challenge. Our results highlight the role of differentiation plasticity in the adaptive responses of melanoma cells. BRAF inhibitor-treated cells undergo changes far beyond single gene mutations and these differentiation changes are accompanied by altered dependencies and treatment sensitivity profiles. Notably, we identified shared signaling alterations between the early- and late-adaptive states and found that up-front co-targeting of BRAF and JUN results in synergistic killing and thus a marked reduction in the resistance-enabling persistent state. This result supports the therapeutic concept that up-front co-treatment regiments are necessary to overcome kinase inhibitor resistance and provide the next advance in genetically informed therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">87</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>An extended description of the methods is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob1">Supplementary Information</xref>.</p><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Melanoma cells were cultured in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Briefly, 24-well Transwell inserts (8-&#x003bc;m pore size, polycarbonate, Corning, Corning, NY) were coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences). The cells were plated in serum-free media into the inserts, and media with 10% FBS were used as a chemoattractant. After 24&#x02009;h, the cells were fixed with PFA and stained with crystal violet.</p></sec><sec><title>Induction of persistent state by BRAF inhibition</title><p>Parental (BRAF inhibition sensitive) melanoma cells were plated at a density of 10&#x02009;500 cells&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> in media without BRAF inhibitor. The next day, the media were exchanged and 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> vemurafenib (or the indicated concentration of dabrafenib) was added.

The siRNAs were reverse transfected with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). Lentiviral shRNAs for JUN were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA) (TRCN0000010366, TRCN0000039590) and lentiviral particles were produced with a standard protocol (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/rnai/public/resources/protocols">http://www.broadinstitute.org/rnai/public/resources/protocols</ext-link>). Trypan-blue staining and a ViCell counter was used for viable cell counting (Beckman Coulter). For MTS-based cell viability experiments, the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay was used (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Apoptosis induction was measured by a PARP cleavage western Blot and by an ApoTox-Glo assay for Caspase-3/7 activation (Promega).</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of patient samples</title><p>The mRNA expression of samples originating from patients (Pt) #1, 13 and 14 were analyzed using the Affymetrix exon-based microarray HuGene ST (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The samples from patient #1 (three technical replicates per sample) were analyzed using HuGene ST version 1.0, whereas the samples from patients #13 and 14 (two technical replicates per sample) were analyzed using version 2.1. The fold changes of genes were computed based on log2 RMA-normalized expression values of the on-treatment samples or disease progression samples against their respective baseline (pre-treatment) samples. FDR-adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value of differential expression are computed using the limma R package. The mRNA expression of all the other patients were analyzed by RNAseq. Each sample was run on two separate lanes in the Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) to generate two (technical) replicates per sample. The fold change of RNAseq samples were computed on the basis of the ratio of averaged RPKM values of the samples and their respective baselines. The FDR-adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value of the RPKM change are computed using the GFOLD program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">93</xref>]. Immunohistochemistry was performed using c-Jun antibody #9165 from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA) at a 1:400 dilution, MACH 2 Rabbit AP Polymer secondary antibodies (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA, USA, catalog #MALP525) and a red chromogen (Vulcan Fast Red&#x02014;Biocare Medical, catalog #FR805H) with hematoxylin counterstaining.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was funded by NIH grants P01 CA168585 and R21 CA169993, the Melanoma Research Alliance, the Ressler Family Fund, the Louise Belley and Richard Schnarr Fund, the Wesley Coyle Memorial Fund, the UCLA Jonsson Cancer Center Foundation, the UCLA Eli &#x00026; Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at UCLA, the Caltech-UCLA Joint Center for Translational Medicine and NIH/National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) UCLA CTSI Grant UL1TR000124 (to TGG, RSL and AR).
