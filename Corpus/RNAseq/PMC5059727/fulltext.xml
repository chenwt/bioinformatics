The mechanistic link between obesity and breast cancer progression remains unclear, and there has been no development of specific treatments to improve the outcome of obese cancer patients. Here we show that obesity-associated NLRC4 inflammasome activation/ interleukin (IL)-1 signalling promotes breast cancer progression. The tumour microenvironment in the context of obesity induces an increase in tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells with an activated NLRC4 inflammasome that in turn activates IL-1&#x003b2;, which drives disease progression through adipocyte-mediated vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression and angiogenesis. Further studies show that treatment of mice with metformin inhibits obesity-associated tumour progression associated with a marked decrease in angiogenesis. This report provides a causal mechanism by which obesity promotes breast cancer progression and lays out a foundation to block NLRC4 inflammasome activation or IL-1&#x003b2; signalling transduction that may be useful for the treatment of obese cancer patients.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

Many factors have been proposed for obesity-driven breast-cancer progression (ODBP), including oestrogen, insulin resistance, the balance between adipokines, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor-&#x003b1;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. However, the direct evidence for the requirement of these factors in ODBP is largely missing. Of particular interest in obesity is its association with chronic inflammation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.

Whether obesity has an impact on these diseases through enhancement of inflammation or via a direct mechanism is largely unclear; however, obese adipose tissue is a reservoir for macrophages with activated inflammasomes that contribute to insulin resistance and diabetes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Inflammasomes are a group of multiprotein complexes comprising NOD-like receptors (NLRP1, NLRP3 and NLRC4) and Pyrin member AIM2, the adaptor protein ASC and caspase 1 (CASP1), the latter being the common effector enzyme that cleaves pro-IL-1&#x003b2; and pro-IL-18 to their active secreted forms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.

We found that obesity is associated with an increase in several inflammatory pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>), including significant upregulation of the IL-1 pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). To further look at a potential role of the IL-1 pathway in ODBP, we also compared the transcriptomes between tumours formed from normal or obese MMTV-<italic>TGF&#x003b1;</italic> mice, a model for ER<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> breast cancer in which obesity promotes disease progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.

Py8119 cells are derived from an <italic>MMTV-PyMT</italic> mouse on the C57BL/6 background and are reported to be ER-negative<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. We found that Py8119 tumours have greater than 40&#x00025; Ki-67-positive staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). E0771 cells are derived from a spontaneous breast adenocarcinoma in C57BL/6 mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, and are characterized as luminal breast cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. We found that &#x0223c;50&#x00025; of tumour cells are Ki-67-positive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>), indicative of luminal B type. Six-week-old C57BL/6 female mice were fed with high-fat diet (HFD), nutrient-controlled normal diet (Cont ND, containing the same macronutrients as the HFD except the fat content) or regular normal diet (ND) provided by our vivarium for 10 weeks <italic>ad libitum</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). HFD-fed mice had increased body weight compared with both ND groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c,d</xref>). Both Py8119 and E0771 tumour growth was significantly higher in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2e,g</xref>). As we found no significant difference between two ND groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>), we chose to use the regular ND. Linear regression analysis of tumour volume versus body weight indicated a strong correlation between body weight and tumour burden (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2h</xref>). While in patients, obesity is associated with a worse clinical outcome and increased incidence of more aggressive triple-negative breast cancer regardless of menopausal status, these effects of obesity are exacerbated in postmenopausal women<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. We used ovariectomized (OVX) mice to mimic postmenopausal conditions and found that DIO&#x02013;OVX mice had significantly increased body weight (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2i</xref>) and tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2j</xref>) relative to DIO mice without OVX.

We verified the efficacy of anti-IL-1R1 <italic>in vivo</italic> by measuring the relative expression of IL-1-responsive genes and saw a significant reduction in the expression of <italic>Il6</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic> and <italic>Ptgs2</italic> in tumours from anti-IL-1R1-treated mice relative to IgG-treated mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2k</xref>). Anti-IL-1R1-treated DIO mice had significantly reduced tumour growth compared with control IgG-treated DIO mice or non-treated DIO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Interestingly, the tumour growth of anti-IL-1R1-treated DIO mice was similar to that of non-treated ND mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), while there was no difference in tumour growth in ND mice treated with anti-IL-1R1 or control IgG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2l</xref>). We also treated tumour-bearing DIO mice with anakinra, a recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist approved by FDA to treat other human diseases, and found a similar result as with anti-IL-1R1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Blocking IL-1R1 had the same effect on E0771 tumour growth in DIO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>).

These data suggest that similar to the IL-1 blockade, only the obesity-associated tumour growth depends on CASP1. To examine whether CASP1 modulates ODBP in NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent manner, we obtained <italic>Nlrp3</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and found that, while the mice lacking NLRP3 had less weight gain with HFD than WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), NLRP3 deficiency had no significant impact on tumour growth in DIO or normal-weight mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>).

Here we identified a causal link between obesity and breast cancer progression. Obese tumour microenvironment recruits macrophages (likely via CCL2 chemotaxis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>) with an activated NLRC4 inflammasome that leads to IL-1&#x003b2; activation. IL-1&#x003b2; then promotes disease progression at least in part by acting on adipocytes directly, or induces secreted factors from macrophages indirectly to promote adipocyte-originated VEGFA production and angiogenesis. Furthermore, we show that treatment of obese mice with metformin inhibits obesity-associated tumour growth via modification of the tumour microenvironment through the reduction in obesity-associated angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). The inhibition of obesity-induced tumour growth and angiogenesis by metformin precisely phenocopied the blockade of IL-1 signalling, suggesting that metformin may act within this pathway, possibly by blocking IL-1&#x003b2;-mediated upregulation of <italic>Vegfa</italic> in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6f</xref>). This is supported by other studies that have shown that metformin can inhibit expression of IL-1&#x003b2;- and IL-1-dependent genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. However, at this time the <italic>Nlrc4</italic>-activating signal remains unclear as the only previously identified activators of NLRC4 are bacterial flagellin and components of bacterial secretion systems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. HFD and genetic loss of <italic>NLRC4</italic> can alter the gut microbiota, and HFD can lead to increased endotoxaemia, all of which contributes to obesity-associated inflammation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that these changes in the gut microbiota and endotoxaemia promote NLRC4 inflammasome activation. Even though we mixed dirty beddings from each cage and added to clean cages to minimize the potential microbiota change, the strict co-housing experiments were prohibited by feeding different cages with ND or HFD. Future studies will be needed to determine whether NLRC4 is activated because of changes in the gut microbiota, endotoxaemia or some tumour-associated protein that act as a homologue to these NLRC4-activating bacterial components. Our findings provide a rationale to develop therapeutics specifically for treating obese cancer patients. While anti-VEGF therapy Avastin is not effective in breast cancer and the use of metformin in breast cancer is still undergoing in several clinical trials focused on obese patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>, these drugs still hold promise to be used in selective obese patient populations. Most importantly, drugs targeting IL-1&#x003b2; signalling such as anakinra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>) or canakinumab (anti-IL-1&#x003b2;) are approved for treating other diseases and can be adapted to obese cancer patients. Other inhibitors, including long-lasting CASP1 inhibitors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref> and other angiogenesis inhibitors, may also be beneficial for treating obese cancer patients with a high basal level of neoangiogenesis as has been recently indicated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>, along with current standard therapies.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell lines and cell culture</title><p>Py8119 cells were derived from a primary <italic>MMTV-PyMT</italic> tumour in the C57BL/6 background as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.
