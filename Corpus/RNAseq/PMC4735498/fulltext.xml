Yet, the frequency of these transfers has never been assessed in viral populations. Here we used ultra-deep DNA sequencing of 21 baculovirus populations extracted from two moth species to show that a large diversity of moth DNA sequences (n = 86) can integrate into viral genomes during the course of a viral infection. The majority of the 86 different moth DNA sequences are transposable elements (TEs, n = 69) belonging to 10 superfamilies of DNA transposons and three superfamilies of retrotransposons. The remaining 17 sequences are moth sequences of unknown nature. In addition to <italic>bona fide</italic> DNA transposition, we uncover microhomology-mediated recombination as a mechanism explaining integration of moth sequences into viral genomes. Many sequences integrated multiple times at multiple positions along the viral genome. We detected a total of 27,504 insertions of moth sequences in the 21 viral populations and we calculate that on average, 4.8% of viruses harbor at least one moth sequence in these populations. Despite this substantial proportion, no insertion of moth DNA was maintained in any viral population after 10 successive infection cycles. Hence, there is a constant turnover of host DNA inserted into viral genomes each time the virus infects a moth. Finally, we found that at least 21 of the moth TEs integrated into viral genomes underwent repeated horizontal transfers between various insect species, including some lepidopterans susceptible to baculoviruses. Our results identify host DNA influx as a potent source of genetic diversity in viral populations. They also support a role for baculoviruses as vectors of DNA HT between insects, and call for an evaluation of possible gene or TE spread when using viruses as biopesticides or gene delivery vectors.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>While gene exchange is known to occur between viruses and their hosts, this phenomenon has never been studied at the level of the viral population. Here we report that each time a virus from the <italic>Baculoviridae</italic> family infects a moth, a large number (dozens to hundreds) and high diversity of moth DNA sequences (86 different sequences) can integrate into replicating viral genomes. These findings show that viral populations carry a measurable load of host DNA sequences, further supporting the role of viruses as vectors of horizontal transfer of DNA between insect species. The potential uncontrolled gene spread associated with the use of viruses produced in insect cells as gene delivery vectors and/or biopesticides should therefore be evaluated.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by European Research Council Starting grants to EAH (205206 GENOVIR) and to RC (260729 EndoSexDet) and by a grant from Agence Nationale de la Recherche to CG (ANR-15-CE32-0011-01 TransVir).

For example, at least 10% of giant virus genes and up to 30% of herpesvirus genes likely originated from eukaryote or prokaryote genomes [<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Some of these genes have been shown to act as key factors in the etiology of viral diseases [<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Because cellular gene content can be quite different between closely related viruses and/or quite similar between distantly related viruses [<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], viral co-option of host genes appears to be rather frequent during virus evolution. The cellular genes that have so far been identified in viral genomes result from relatively ancient host-to-virus HT events. From a population genetics perspective, these viral-borne host genes must have been inherited at low to intermediate frequencies over multiple rounds of viral replication until they finally reached fixation in the viral species, likely because they provided a fitness gain to the virus. In agreement with this hypothesis, many of these genes are thought to play a role in thwarting host anti-viral defenses, thus facilitating viral replication [<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A corollary of this scenario is that many viral-borne host genes resulting from host-to-virus HT should be found at varying frequencies in viral populations. However, host-to-virus HT has never been investigated at the micro-evolutionary scale of the viral population. Therefore, the frequency of host-to-virus HT as well as the evolutionary and molecular processes underlying the capture and domestication of eukaryotic genes by viruses remain poorly understood.</p><p>Another outstanding question arising from host-to-virus HT is whether viral-borne host genes acquired from a given host individual can be transferred to the genome of another infected individual through virus-to-host HT. In other words, can viruses act as vectors of HT between their hosts? Hundreds of HT cases have been characterized in eukaryotes [<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Many of these transfers have generated evolutionary novelties and allowed receiving organisms to adapt to new environments [<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Horizontal transfer of DNA is therefore increasingly appreciated as an important evolutionary force shaping eukaryote genomes. However, the mechanisms and the potential vectors involved in HT of DNA between eukaryotes remain poorly known, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Viruses have been proposed as candidate vectors facilitating HT between eukaryotes because they are transmitted horizontally (and in some cases vertically) and they replicate inside host cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In metazoans, the vast majority of HTs characterized so far are transfers of transposable elements (TEs), which constitute pieces of DNA that are capable of moving from one genomic locus to another, often duplicating themselves in the process [<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Several studies have uncovered host TEs packaged in viral capsids or even integrated into viral genomes, suggesting that TEs can jump from host to virus during the course of a viral infection [<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We discovered two such TEs from the cabbage looper moth (<italic>Trichoplusia ni</italic>) integrated at low frequency in genome populations of the baculovirus <italic>Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus</italic> (AcMNPV) following infection of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>ni</italic> caterpillars [<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Importantly, these two TEs show signs of HT between several sympatric moth species that can be infected by baculoviruses in the wild. The search for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>ni</italic> sequences integrated into populations of AcMNPV was however restricted to the dozen of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>ni</italic> genes and transposable elements that were known at the time. Therefore, the number and diversity of moth TEs and non-TEs that become integrated into AcMNPV genomes during the course of an infection remains poorly characterized.</p><p>Here we report a comprehensive search for host sequences integrated in 21 genome populations of the baculovirus AcMNPV (<italic>Baculoviridae</italic>) following infection of caterpillars from two moth species. The <italic>Baculoviridae</italic> comprise large, circular dsDNA viruses infecting mainly Lepidoptera but also Hymenoptera and Diptera [<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Most baculoviruses are transmitted as occlusion bodies (OBs), i.e. the virions are protected in a protein matrix allowing the virus to remain infectious in the environment for extended periods of time [<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. AcMNPV is a multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus, meaning that each OB typically contains dozens of virions, each enclosing multiple genomes individually packaged within nucleocapsids. This morphology allows the virus to initiate infection as a highly polymorphic population [<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and can foster the maintenance of deleterious genotypes [<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Rather untypical for a baculovirus, AcMNPV is a generalist virus, able to infect moth species belonging to nine lepidopteran families [<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The two moth species we used are <italic>Trichoplusia ni</italic> (Plusiinae) and the beat armyworm <italic>Spodoptera exigua</italic> (Noctuinae), which belong to the Noctuidae family and are known to be highly susceptible to AcMNPV. These agricultural pests are found in many regions of the world, and can occur in sympatry [<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We performed <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental infections of both <italic>T</italic>. <italic>ni</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>exigua</italic> caterpillars to generate AcMNPV populations for deep sequencing.

mechanism of insertion of host DNA into viral genomes. Alternatively, junctions between host TEs and viral DNA could result from technical artifact leading to chimeric reads composed of viral and contaminating host sequences. Though we verified that the amount of contaminating host DNA was very low (if at all present) in all our samples (see ref [<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005838.s017">S1 Text</xref>), we cannot totally exclude the presence of such contamination. If our samples were contaminated, and given that TEs make up the single largest fraction of eukaryote genomes [<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], technical chimeras involving mainly host TEs might not be unexpected. However, the 27,504 chimeric reads correspond to 7,049 different junctions, as defined by their location in the viral genome and in host contigs. Indeed, 1,412 of these 7,049 unique junctions are covered by more than one read (two to 1,256 reads; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005838.s007">S2 Fig</xref>). This strongly suggests the junctions we observe do not result from any kind of technical artifact. As duplicates generated by PCR during library construction were removed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005838.s017">S1 Text</xref>), it seems very unlikely that a technical error would generate multiple chimeras involving exactly the same virus and host DNA sequences at the same positions. Only amplification of junctions through <italic>in vivo</italic> viral replication provides a plausible explanation for these observations, ruling out the possibility that these junctions result from technical chimeras. To further assess the biological origin of host-virus DNA junctions, we sought to characterize the molecular mechanisms involved in the integration of host sequences in AcMNPV genomes.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Mechanisms underlying integration of moth sequences into AcMNPV genomes</title><p>For each host contig integrated into several distinct viral sites, we located the target insertion sites both in the viral genome and in the host sequence, and examined sequence patterns in their vicinity. We found that most inserted sequences were DNA transposons, for which the junctions with the virus genome clustered immediately before the 5&#x02019; terminal inverted repeat (TIR) or immediately after the 3&#x02019; TIR, as expected in the case of transposition events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005838.g001">Fig 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005838.s008">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005838.s012">S7</xref> Figs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005838.s016">S3 Dataset</xref>). In addition, the integration sites in the viral genome were generally characterized by short (1&#x02013;5 bp) highly conserved sequence motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005838.g001">Fig 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005838.s009">S4 Fig</xref>) corresponding to known TE preferred insertion sites (e.g., TTAA for the Piggybac family, TAA for harbinger, CGNCG for transib).

Overall, we identified 19,899 host-virus junctions resulting from transposition. Counting only once all host-virus junctions covered by more than one read yields a minimum of 6,579 junctions resulting from independent transposition events, out of 7,049.

Contrary to the host-virus junctions resulting from transposition, which were all located at the extremities of the 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019; TIRs, these junctions were scattered within the host sequences. A short sequence motif of 1 to 20 bp, identical between the insertion site and the host sequence, characterized 298 of these junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005838.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The length of these microhomology motifs is significantly longer than expected by chance (Khi<sup>2</sup> = 4,523; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;15</sup>, 20 d.f.) and argues against technical artifact as the main cause of these junctions (as technical error favoring microhomology are highly unlikely). We also note that 15 of the 434 junctions are covered by more than one read (two to 27 reads), indicating that some of these junctions were amplified through viral replication. The 158 remaining non-transposition junctions lacking microhomology could either have resulted from the ligation of blunt-ended sequences (n = 87), or were characterized by the presence of 1 to 2 nucleotides that apparently did not originate from either the host or viral genomes (n = 71, corresponding to negative microhomology lengths in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005838.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The distribution of microhomology lengths suggests that in addition to transposition, host DNA can be integrated into viral genomes via a variety of recombination events, some of which (but not all) rely on microhomology motifs between virus and host DNA sequences. Whether such recombination events are mediated by viral factors (e.g. LEF-3, AN, PCNA [<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]), or by host-encoded DNA repair mechanisms [<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] known to enhance baculovirus amplification [<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], would be worth addressing at the functional level in the future. Most of the non-transposition junctions lie within DNA transposon sequences, which may appear intriguing. We speculate that on principle, any region of the host genome could be joined to viral DNA through microhomology-mediated recombination (including genes that may turn to be beneficial to the virus), provided that it contains a double stranded break. Yet, since DNA transposons have the capacity to excise themselves from the host genome, they may be among the most numerous extra chromosomal DNA fragments containing double stranded breaks ready to recombine with broken viral DNA.</p><fig id="pgen.1005838.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1005838.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Length distribution of microhomology motifs found at 434 junctions between moth and AcMNPV baculovirus sequences.</title><p>The observed distribution is shown in red and the distribution expected by chance is shown in grey.

Two other causes may explain this correlation: (1) varying degrees of tolerance to insertions along the viral genome and (2) varying rates of transposition along the viral genome. Cause (1) implies that insertions are more likely to be replicated through viral replication in some regions than others because their impact on viral fitness would be lower. In this case, the correlation between local densities of insertions along the viral genome should be maintained or even higher when considering all insertions that possibly result from viral replication. However, the correlation almost disappears (0.1% of variance explained, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005838.s003">S3 Table</xref>) when all insertions (including potentially replicated ones) were considered. Hence, although the fitness impact of insertions may well vary along the viral genome, these variations cannot explain the strong correlation we initially observed. This leaves cause (2) as the only explanation for the correlation of insertion frequencies from TEs of the two species. In other words, TEs from the two moths, in spite of being different (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005838.t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005838.s001">S1 Table</xref>), tend to transpose preferentially into the same regions of the AcMNPV genome irrespective of the density of target sites. This suggests that the pattern of integration may be shaped by structural properties of the viral genome. We propose that, as observed in eukaryotic genomes [<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], the distribution of transposition-mediated integrations along the AcMNPV genome may be influenced by accessibility of the viral genome to host TEs, which itself likely depends on the structure of AcMNPV chromatin, known to be dynamically remodeled during viral replication [<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><fig id="pgen.1005838.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1005838.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Patterns of moth DNA sequence integration along the circular AcMNPV baculovirus genome.</title><p>A.

Though the number of host-to-virus HT events that generated these frequencies is likely to be high, we cannot infer it precisely because we cannot tell how many of the host-junctions covered by more than one read were amplified through viral replication. Indeed, the same TE may insert several times at any suitable viral site. Furthermore, it is possible that a number of host-virus junctions, which cannot be evaluated here, were generated through subsequent transposition of viral-borne TEs (not coming from the host genome) into multiple copies of the virus genome.</p><p>The relatively high frequencies of AcMNPV genomes carrying host DNA fragments at any given time raise the question of whether such host sequences are inherited over viral infection cycles. We thus tested the residual presence of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>ni</italic> sequences (inserted at G0 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005838.s006">S1 Fig</xref>) in viral populations, that had subsequently been passaged 10 times in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>exigua</italic> (G10 datasets in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005838.s006">S1 Fig</xref>).

None of these insertions were identical (in terms of position in the virus genome and host contig) to any found in the G0 virus population. The persistence of a given host DNA fragment in virus populations thus appears to be low, likely because of the deleterious effects large insertions have on the viral genome carrier. Although many new host sequences become integrated into AcMNPV genomes at each viral infection cycle, they are thus purified out of the viral population after only few infection cycles. Hence there is a high turnover of host sequences inserted into the viral genome each time the virus replicates in a host. Under natural settings, continuous host-to-virus flow of genetic material generates a significant proportion of recombinant viruses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005838.t001">Table 1</xref>). At the viral population scale, this represents a gene reservoir that could fuel host-virus coevolutionary arms race through co-option of a host sequence favoring the virus in a given environment. Our findings thus shed light on the first evolutionary steps underlying viral co-option of cellular genes.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Virus-mediated horizontal transfer of moth transposable elements</title><p>Under the hypothesis that viruses can act as vectors of HT of TEs, once inserted in a viral genome, viral-borne TEs should then be able to jump from the viral genome to the genome of a new host organism. To evaluate the possibility that AcMNPV can shuttle TEs between insects, we first checked whether some TEs found integrated in our AcMNPV genome datasets have retained the structural features necessary for transposition. Among the 41 contigs inserted in at least 10 different viral sites, 11 correspond to TEs for which we recovered both TIRs and that encode a putative full-length intact transposase gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005838.g001">Fig 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005838.s008">S3 Fig</xref>). Provided that these TEs can be transcribed in a new host, they should thus be able to jump from the viral genome into the genome of this new host. However, it is important to note that the transfer would only be effective if the host survived viral infection in the first place. This is more likely to happen if the host shows resistance to the virus or if the virus harbors deleterious mutations.</p><p>We then reasoned that if AcMNPV is able to act as vector of HT of TEs between its insect hosts, the TEs we found integrated in the AcMNPV genome populations might have been horizontally transferred relatively recently between insects of various susceptibility to AcMNPV.

We used the 69 TE sequences as queries to perform Blastn searches against the 144 non-Noctuidae insect genomes available in GenBank as of March 2015. For 21 of these TEs (14 <italic>S</italic>. <italic>exigua</italic> and seven <italic>T</italic>. <italic>ni</italic> TEs), we found highly similar copies (&#x0003e;85% nucleotide identity) in the genome of one or more other insects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005838.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The 21 TEs show a combination of features that are typically indicative of HT [<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. They have a patchy distribution in the insect phylogeny and, importantly, the between-species nucleotide identity calculated for each of these TEs is much higher (91% identity on average) than synonymous nucleotide identities calculated for 11 conserved genes between the same species (37% identity on average, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005838.g004">Fig 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005838.s004">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005838.s005">S5</xref> Tables).

Many TEs and other host sequences can also integrate into AcMNPV genomes through microhomology-mediated recombination events. Our work also demonstrates that the density of transposition events is not homogenous along the AcMNPV genome and that, while the influx of host sequences integrated into AcMNPV is continuous, each newly integrated host sequence is rapidly purged out of AcMNPV populations. Together, these observations are reminiscent of the well-known gene exchanges that take place between bacteria and bacteriophages [<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and indicate that such exchanges may also occur on a regular basis between eukaryotes and eukaryotic viruses. Our results also raise a number of questions worth addressing in future experiments. In particular, it would be interesting to monitor the evolution of the frequency of viral replicates carrying any given host sequence across successive infection cycles, as the host DNA sequence retention time affects the likelihood of such sequence being horizontally transferred between hosts. Furthermore, since the rate of host-to-virus HT is measurable at the population level, it would be worth investigating whether this phenomenon influences the within-host replication dynamics of AcMNPV. Another exciting question is whether this phenomenon is limited to moth-AcMNPV interactions or whether it also takes place in other host-virus systems. Finally, it is noteworthy that AcMNPV and other baculoviruses are used as biopesticides and developed as vectors for several biomedical applications such as gene or vaccine delivery [<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].

Blastn searches of the contigs against the AcMNPV genome revealed that the contig ends that differed were similar to parts of the viral genome. We assumed that mostly similar contigs resulted from a genetic element inserted at different sites of the AcMNPV genome, and that these viral sites had been partly included into contig ends during the assembly process. We thus trimmed contigs from these viral regions, and reassembled them using the assembly feature included in Geneious 4.5 [<xref rid="pgen.1005838.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], allowing a maximum mismatch of 10% in overlapping regions.

Furthermore, at least 95 nucleotides of the read had to align with virus and host sequences (130 bp for 151-bp reads). The overlap between these alignments was set to involve at most 20 bp and at least -2 bp. These filters excluded reads from virus regions having similarities with host contigs, in which case the region aligning to a host contig would be included in that aligning to the virus genome.</p><p>To detect junctions that occurred between two paired reads (mates), we selected read pairs meeting the following conditions: (i) one mate must have a similarity with the virus genome of at least 95 bp (130 bp for 151-bp reads) and present no similarity with any host contig, and (ii) the other mate must have a similarity to a host contig of at least 95 bp (130 bp for 151-bp reads), and present no similarity with the virus genome.</p><p>We found that the sensitivity of our approach to detect junctions between host and virus DNA was highly dependent on the quality of the assembly of the host sequences that were used as reference.

To ensure that a contig we assembled represented moth DNA, it had to be partly similar to a transcript of the corresponding host species, as determined by Blastn searches of contigs against host transcripts, or to align with at least one read of a pair that also aligned with a known host transcript, as determined by the Blastn search of reads against the contig and transcript databases.</p><p>Because the contigs we assembled are, as expected, partly similar to some host transcripts, a chimeric read may have similarities to a contig and to a transcript (after selecting the best alignment in each category, as explained above). In other words, contigs and transcripts can be candidates for the same insertions. To minimize redundancy between contigs and transcripts, any transcript sharing at least one chimeric read with a contig was discarded. We therefore retained transcripts that did not share any junction with any assembled contig. Finally, we discarded host contigs or transcripts having similarities with less than three chimeric reads (i.e., potentially inserted in the AcMNPV genome less than three times) or having a cumulative alignment length of less than 75 bp with chimeric reads.</p><p>For junction counts shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005838.s001">S1 Table</xref>, we removed duplicates that may have resulted from PCR amplification of the same junction during library preparation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005838.s017">S1 Text</xref>).
