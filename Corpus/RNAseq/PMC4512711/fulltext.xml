However, once the tear film and the epithelial integrity of the ocular surface are breached, pathogens may invade the corneal tissues, leading to microbial infections commonly termed infectious keratitis. These can result in permanent loss of vision if not rapidly and adequately treated [<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Following corneal infection and disruption of the ocular surface, wound healing requires a complex interplay between humoral factors: cytokines, growth factors and neuropeptides, and cells such as nerve cells, stem cells, keratocytes, myofibroblasts, and dendritic cells [<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Topical anti-infective drugs are normally used for the treatment of ocular infection but the increasing emergence of bacterial resistance can impact significantly the effectiveness of pharmacological therapy [<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For this reason, new anti-infective therapeutic strategies are needed that can be efficacious in the short-term regardless of infection type. Cold plasmas obtained at atmospheric pressure are increasingly used in tissue disinfection and a new field of research called plasma medicine has developed [<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Disinfection with cold plasmas might reduce the use of long-acting antibiotics in the control of superficial infections such as those of human skin, eye, and mucosal tissues exposed to the external environment.</p><p>The antibacterial effects of low temperature plasmas have been well demonstrated and depend on all products generated by plasmas, mainly by the activity of reactive oxygen species or ROS [<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Antibacterial effects are also influenced by other parameters such as the gap between the plasma source and the samples, the time of exposure, the gas mixture and the plasma power applied. We previously used cold plasma (APCP) generated by helium/air ionization in a prototype device to treat different microorganisms, type of cells and tissues [<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] at different times of exposure and different distances from the samples. We found that a 2-minute (min) flow of atmospheric pressure generates an intracellular ROS level that peaks at a 1.5 mm distance from the plasma source and exerts substantial antimicrobial effects without significant damage to cells and tissues. Moreover, the number of apoptotic nuclei in the treated corneal tissues was similar to that in control tissues.</p><p>In our device, the plasma is formed between two grids acting as electrodes. Tissues are exposed to the so-called afterglow, the chemical-enriched helium flow. Compared to other cold plasma devices proposed for biomedical applications [<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the charged species generated in our device do not reach the biological sample since they recombine very quickly, as demonstrated by the absence of light emission outside the external grid. We previously demonstrated that the UV radiation component of this APCP did not induce thymine dimers in cells and tissues treated up to 5 min; however, exposure to APCP caused a transient formation of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), accompanied by a temporary expression of OGG1 glycosylase, an enzyme involved in the repair of the pro-mutagenic oxidation product 8-OHdG [<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The new histochemical and molecular data presented in this study aim to clarify whether the exposure of <italic>ex vivo</italic> human corneas to 2-min of APCP causes molecular changes to cells and tissues. We analysed whole transcriptome changes at 6 h after the exposure of corneas for 2 min to APCP in the absence or presence of the antioxidant, N-acetyl L-cysteine (NAC). Selected genes that emerged as differentially expressed after exposure to APCP or relevant to corneal pathology were further investigated by immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR (qPCR).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Plasma device</title><p>Atmospheric pressure cold plasma (APCP) was produced by a device built at the Consorzio RFX in Padua, Italy. The plasma source uses a grid pair driven by a radiofrequency voltage difference of approximately 1 kV, ionizing a flow of helium gas that partially mixes with ambient air and has been described elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Briefly, the plasma source consists of two co-axial tubes closed at the end by two parallel grids positioned at a distance of 1 mm. The outer grid is grounded, as is the whole external structure of the source, so that no electric field is present outside of the space enclosed by the two grids, where the plasma is formed. Despite the high voltage value, the current flowing in the plasma is so low that the dissipated power is below 1 W. The chosen operational frequency is 4.8 MHz.</p><p>Analysis of radiation emitted by the plasma was performed by mini-spectrometry using a Hamamatsu C10082CA integrated with a back-thinned type linear CCD image sensor (2048 pixels). This provides measurements ranging from 200 to 830 nm in a single spectrum. A quartz optic fiber with a 1 mm diameter core, 100 cm long, matched to the spectrometer, was set in front of the plasma source at a distance of 1,5 mm. The spectrum of APCP radiation obtained with a helium flow of 1.5 liters min<sup>-1</sup> at room pressure displays the presence of the N<sub>2</sub> molecule and high concentrations of OH radicals (309 nm) at room temperature, with most of the lines concentrated in the UV region, although this APCP is not a very effective source of high-energy UV emission [<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Human corneas</title><p>Eleven human corneas (HC) from healthy donors 64&#x02013;72 years of age were purchased at the Veneto Eye Bank Foundation (Mestre, Italy).

The power level is kept low enough that only electrons are heated to high temperatures (of the order of 10,000 K), whereas the ions and the neutral gas are at or near the atmospheric pressure (hence the &#x0201c;cold&#x0201d; attribute). While ionization is easier at low pressure, cold plasmas used in biomedical applications are produced at atmospheric pressure. The effect of cold plasma on micro-organisms and eukaryotic cells depends on the type of gas and device used to produce it [<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. As previously mentioned, a two-minute application of the APCP was effective in killing ocular pathogens. However, this dose of APCP induced a transitory formation of ROS, 8-OHdG, and increased expression of OGG1 protein in ocular cells and tissues [<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Moreover, in a previous study we found that fibroblast proliferation was ROS-dependent since incubation of cells with an antioxidant agents such NAC, significantly reduced the biological effects [<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, transcriptome sequencing, qPCR and Western Blot analyses performed on human corneas at 6 h post-treatment confirmed a mild and transient increase of OGG1 transcripts and proteins, which was slightly reduced by the antioxidant NAC. Furthermore, irrespective of the addition of NAC, the levels of OGG1 mRNA and protein decreased to control levels at 24 h post-treatment. Although differences among corneal specimens may reflect individual responses to the stimulus, the experimental trends observed in this study confirm some of the previous results obtained on <italic>ex-vivo</italic> cornea specimens [<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The intensity of APCP-induced oxidative stress has been ascribed to short-lived chemical species such as hydrogen peroxide and hydroperoxy radicals [<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. If not adequately counterbalanced, propagation of oxidative reactions may impair cell physiology, whereas clusters of oxidative DNA lesions inefficiently repaired could contribute to mutations and degenerative processes [<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>The different response of prokaryotic vs. eukaryotic cells to APCP is likely due to the haploid condition and differences in cell structure and DNA repair pathways. In fact, DNA mutations are immediately evident in the phenotype of haploid cells and, when occurring in essential genes, can lead to bacterial death also because of the speed of transcription and protein synthesis.</p><p>The effects of cold plasma on eukaryotic cells and tissues are certainly dependent on gas flow, distance from the plasma source and exposure time [<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In our study we compared the effect of APCP on corneal tissue in presence or absence of NAC to evaluate how this antioxidant compound modulates the response of human corneal cells to APCP. At 6 h from exposure to APCP, we detected similar amounts of over- and under-expressed genes (the number of over-expressed genes prevailed in the presence of NAC). In corneas exposed to APCP for 2 min and sampled at 6 h post-treatment, the transcriptome analysis revealed only a slight up-regulation of a number of genes involved in sensing and repair of DNA damage. The considerable up-regulation of genes related to the response to stimuli, signal transduction and RNA processes suggested a broad-ranging cell activity, reminiscent of hormetic responses paradoxically observed at low doses of ionizing radiations or toxic chemicals [<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>In the treated corneas, defensin transcripts were the most abundant (over-expressed) regardless of NAC addition. We also found up-regulated transcripts denoting interleukin-associated proteins, interferon-related (e.g. GBP2, ISG20) and cell defense proteins such as cytochrome CYP4F11 (19.25x; 14.86x with NAC) and glutathione peroxidase (3.14x; 4.98x with NAC). These facts, suggest a reinforcement of innate protective mechanisms even in <italic>ex vivo</italic> conditions.</p><p>Cellular proteins are highly sensitive to oxidative stress and recent studies demonstrated that APCP causes protein unfolding in aqueous solution [<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and accumulation of non-functional proteins in bacteria exposed to plasma [<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. At 6 h post-treatment and irrespective of NAC addition, the plasma exerted very slight up-regulation (from 1.1 to 1.4 fold) of chaperon proteins and genes related to ubiquitination (UBA1, UBA2, UBE2D3, UBE2H, UBE2D2) in corneal tissues, indicating that a 2-min APCP does not cause relevant protein degradation. These data are consistent with other recent data pointing to a stimulatory effect of ROS on liver and intestinal fibroblast-like primary cells [<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>It has also been reported that human cells can enter apoptosis in a treatment- and time-dependent manner after exposure to cold plasma [<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The TUNEL assay previously performed on corneal cells and tissues treated with APCP for 2 min did not reveal significant apoptotic effects. Transcriptome analysis performed on treated corneas indicated up-regulation of ANXA8 (24.73x, 21.21x with NAC) and ANXA1 (2.32x, only 1.46x with NAC), but not ANXA5. Annexin A1 is involved in anti-inflammatory signaling, kinase regulation, apoptosis and differentiation. The considerable basal and APCP-induced levels of ANXA1 transcripts support its role in efficient ROS scavenging [<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. qPCR analyses confirmed an over-expression of ANXA1 at 3 and 6 h after exposure to APCP. The functional role of ANXA8 is not completely understood but is certainly associated with terminal differentiation of epithelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In addition, the anti-apoptotic protein CASP14, which has been reported in cornifying epithelia [<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], was clearly over-expressed (5.84x; 12.85x with NAC). Other genes related to keratinization, like cornifelin (CNFN), cornifin- A (SPRR1A), small proline rich protein (SPRR) 2D and SPRR2E were also found to be over-expressed. Up-regulation of SPRR1A was confirmed by qPCR analysis at different time points (6x after 3 h; 3x after 6 h). Several studies have suggested that SPRRs are also related to increased epithelial proliferation and differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, their role in pathophysiological processes requires further study.</p><p>In conclusion, a new antimicrobial therapy based on cold plasma needs to have a proven safety profile. The utilization of cold plasma in medicine is well described, in particular in dermatology where the benefit of safe skin disinfection and improved healing has been demonstrated [<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0133173.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Our previous studies proved the effectiveness of disinfection of ocular surfaces with cold plasma. In the present study, we confirm a transient and moderate oxidative damage in corneal tissues exposed to APCP for 2 min. The overall gene expression changes reveal a stimulatory or protective response rather than a weakness of cell functioning. In the presence of the antioxidant NAC, which was previously shown to reduce the burst of intracellular ROS, the number of over-expressed genes was higher, suggesting a manifold cell response to the APCP exposure. Moreover, the expression trends of one DNA repair protein (OGG1) and the over-expression of an anti-apoptotic CASP14 transcript in the presence of NAC support its protective role against potential ROS-induced damage induced by APCP treatment. Further studies will adequately assess the real influence of this molecule in APCP-treated tissues <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0133173.s001"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>All genes displaying a statistically significant p-value (Baggerly&#x02019;s test with FDR corrected p-value cutoff &#x0003c;0.01) are listed as over-expressed (A) or under-expressed (B) with gene ID, fold change, FDR corrected p value, GO biological process, gene name and detected expression values (three experimental conditions in paired comparisons).</title><p>Genes displaying also a fold change higher than 2 (see M&#x00026;M) are considered as &#x02018;DEG&#x02019; and are highlighted in grey.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0133173.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0133173.s002"><label>S2 Dataset</label><caption><title>Hyper-Geometric Test on Annotation performed on over- and under-DEGs.</title><p>ID and description of the resulting GO categories, number of grouped genes and associated p-value.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0133173.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0133173.s003"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Morphology of human corneas untreated (a) or treated ex-vivo with APCP in the absence (b) or presence (c) of NAC.</title><p>Tissue morphology at 6 h from exposure to APCP (5 &#x003bc;m sections, hematoxylin and eosin, 100x magnification).</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0133173.s003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0133173.s004"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) performed on HC1-HC6 corneal transcriptomes.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0133173.s004.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank The Veneto Eye Bank foundation (Mestre, Italy) for providing us with human corneas.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0133173.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Garreis</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gottschalt</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Paulsen</surname><given-names>FP</given-names></name> (<year>2010</year>) <article-title>Antimicrobial peptides as a major part of the innate immune defense at the ocular surface</article-title>. <source>Dev Ophthalmol</source>. <volume>45</volume>:<fpage>16</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>22</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000315016">10.1159/000315016</ext-link></comment><?supplied-pmid 20502023?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20502023</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0133173.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>PA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Geraldine</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name> (<year>2007</year>) <article-title>Infectious keratitis</article-title>. <source>Curr Opin Infect Dis</source>. <volume>20</volume>(<issue>2</issue>):<fpage>129</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>41</lpage>. <?supplied-pmid 17496570?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17496570</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0133173.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Del Monte</surname><given-names>DW</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name> (<year>2011</year>) <article-title>Anatomy and physiology of the cornea</article-title>. <source>J Cataract Refract Surg</source>. <volume>37</volume> (<issue>3</issue>): <fpage>588</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>98</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrs.2010.12.037">10.1016/j.jcrs.2010.12.037</ext-link></comment>
