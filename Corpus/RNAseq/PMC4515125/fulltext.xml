However, how p63 regulates epidermal genes during differentiation is not yet clear. Using epigenome profiling of differentiating human primary epidermal keratinocytes, we characterized a catalog of dynamically regulated genes and p63-bound regulatory elements that are relevant for epithelial development and related diseases. p63-bound regulatory elements occur as single or clustered enhancers, and remarkably, only a subset is active as defined by the co-presence of the active enhancer mark histone modification H3K27ac in epidermal keratinocytes. We show that the dynamics of gene expression correlates with the activity of p63-bound enhancers rather than with p63 binding itself. The activity of p63-bound enhancers is likely determined by other transcription factors that cooperate with p63. Our data show that inactive p63-bound enhancers in epidermal keratinocytes may be active during the development of other epithelial-related structures such as limbs and suggest that p63 bookmarks genomic loci during the commitment of the epithelial lineage and regulates genes through temporal- and spatial-specific active enhancers.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>epidermal differentiation</kwd><kwd>epigenomics</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>p63</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Orchestrated spatial and temporal gene regulation during embryonic development is essential for proper organogenesis. The transcription factor p63 is a key regulator in epithelial development including the development of epidermis, limbs, and craniofacial tissues. The role of p63 in epithelial lineage commitment has been demonstrated by many studies in human diseases and mouse models. In humans, heterozygous mutations in the <italic>TP63</italic> gene are associated with at least seven clinical conditions where epithelial-related structures are affected, characterized by combinations of ectrodactyly (split hand/foot malformations), orofacial clefting, and ectodermal dysplasia <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Several <italic>p63</italic> mouse models including knockouts and knock-ins with <italic>TP63</italic> disease mutations show similar developmental and structural defects as those in human p63-associated diseases <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. In mouse embryonic stem cells, knockdown of <italic>p63</italic> or overexpression of <italic>p63</italic> mutants associated with diseases prevented the epithelial commitment marked by <italic>KRT5/KRT14</italic> expression <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>.</p><p>The epidermis is one of the affected epithelial structures in <italic>p63</italic>-associated disorders and in <italic>p63</italic> mouse models. The human epidermis is a multilayered epithelial tissue, and the structural integrity of the epidermis is dependent on proper proliferation and differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes. The epidermal basal layer consists of highly proliferative self-renewing keratinocytes. Upon initiation of differentiation, keratinocytes migrate upwards and differentiate into cells that comprise the suprabasal spinous layer, the granular layer, and the stratum corneum that consists mainly of enucleated corneocytes <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. The differentiation process of keratinocytes is tightly controlled by gene regulation, and de-regulated gene expression leads to disturbed epidermal differentiation and skin diseases <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Many epidermal disease genes are expressed in specific layers of the epidermis and associated with distinct disease phenotypes. In general, mutations in genes that are highly expressed in the basal layers such as keratin 5 (<italic>KRT5</italic>) and keratin 14 (<italic>KRT14</italic>) are associated with blistering phenotypes <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, whereas mutations in genes that are expressed in the most outer layers of the epidermis, such as loricrin (<italic>LOR</italic>), are associated with hyperkeratosis and dry or scaly&#x000a0;skin <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. Although significant progress has been made in genetic studies with the fast-developing next-generation sequencing technology, the causes of many skin diseases are not yet explained. Furthermore, many of these conditions are heterogeneous, suggesting that the expressivity of gene mutations is modulated by genetic modifiers that play roles in epidermal differentiation. This scenario is supported by the observation that epidermal differentiation is regulated by the interplay of diverse gene networks rather than individual genes <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Therefore, comprehensive catalogs of gene networks that are controlled by key regulators such as the transcription factor p63 during epidermal differentiation will be instructive for understanding the molecular processes underlying skin disease.</p><p>It has been shown that <italic>p63</italic> is essential for the initiation of epidermal differentiation. In human epidermal keratinocytes, knockdown of <italic>p63</italic> prevents epidermal differentiation <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, whereas in single-layered lung epithelial cells, overexpression of <italic>p63</italic> results in stratification that is normally typical for epidermal keratinocytes <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. Human epidermal keratinocytes established from patients with <italic>TP63</italic> mutations show stratification defects <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. A number of studies have aimed at the identification of p63 target genes to understand the role of p63 in epidermal differentiation. Some studies took the RNAi approach to knock down <italic>p63</italic> in proliferating keratinocytes and identified several hundreds of potentially p63-regulated genes <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. However, as <italic>p63</italic>-depleted keratinocytes have differentiation defects <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, potential direct p63 target genes at later stages of epidermal differentiation might not be identified using this approach. Furthermore, ChIP-seq analysis in human epidermal keratinocytes identified tens of thousands p63 binding sites in the human genome <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. The large difference between the number of p63 binding sites <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and p63-regulated genes found using RNAi approaches <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> raises the question whether all identified p63 binding sites are functional in gene regulation in epidermal keratinocytes. Here, we present the first comprehensive catalog of p63-regulated genes and enhancers during epidermal differentiation through epigenomics and transcriptomics profiling. Only a subset of these enhancers is dynamically regulated, and the activity of these enhancers marked by the active enhancer histone modification H3K27ac correlates with gene expression during epidermal differentiation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Gene expression dynamics during epidermal differentiation</title><p>Using an <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> differentiation model of human epidermal keratinocytes <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, we generated a complete map of dynamically regulated genes during epidermal differentiation at a genomewide scale using RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) ChIP-seq that measures the occupancy of RNAPII in mainly gene-associated genomic regions, as well as RNA-seq that measures the steady-state mRNA level. With both methods, the detected expression pattern of epidermal marker genes such as <italic>KRT5</italic>, <italic>KRT1,</italic> and <italic>involucrin</italic> (<italic>IVL</italic>) (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1A</xref>), and <italic>KRT14, KRT10</italic> and <italic>loricrin</italic> (<italic>LOR</italic>) (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S1A</xref>) was consistent with our RT&#x02013;qPCR and Western blotting analyses (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">C</xref>).

<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. At the global level, our RNA-seq analysis showed a good correlation (Spearman rho &#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.8 for all comparisons) with a previous RNA-seq study that used a slightly different <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> keratinocyte differentiation method (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S2A</xref>) <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. Thus, our results show that this <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> differentiation model of epidermal keratinocytes recapitulates the epidermal stratification process. Of note, RNAPII ChIP-seq and RNA-seq profiles at the <italic>TP63</italic> locus showed that &#x00394;<italic>Np63</italic> is the main isoform expressed in keratinocytes throughout the epidermal differentiation process, and the expression of the <italic>TAp63</italic> isoform was not detected with both RNAPII ChIP-seq and RNA-seq methods (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S1D</xref>). Western blot analysis confirmed the decreased protein level of &#x00394;Np63 during differentiation and that the expression of TAp63 was undetectable (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S1B</xref>).

</p></list-item></list></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="embr0016-0863-f1"/></fig><p>To capture the gene expression dynamics during differentiation, we clustered the genes according to their expression levels quantified as reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) in both the RNAPII ChIP-seq and RNA-seq profiles. For RNAPII ChIP-seq analyses, 7,223 genes with an RPKM value (expression level) of at least 1.0 were clustered using K-means clustering into nine groups with distinct expression patterns (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1B</xref>; Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd2">S1A</xref>). To assess the function of these gene clusters and their association with human diseases, we performed functional annotation analyses using the web tools DAVID Gene Ontology (GO) <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1B</xref>; Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd2">S1B</xref>) and the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) database <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd2">S1C</xref>), respectively. For examples, genes that are expressed highly in proliferating keratinocytes (cluster 4) are associated with skin blistering and hyperkeratosis (e.g., <italic>KRT5</italic>). Genes that are highly expressed at late differentiation stages (cluster 3, e.g., <italic>LCE</italic> genes and cluster 6, e.g., <italic>TGM1</italic>) are specifically enriched for late differentiation genes and those involved in the regulation of apoptosis and cell death. These genes are associated with dry and scaly skin and non-blistering phenotypes. Cluster 1 contains genes with high expression at early differentiation stages (day 2 and day 4) and reduced expression at the late stage (day 7), for example <italic>KRT1</italic> and <italic>KRT10</italic>, and is enriched with genes involved in epidermis development, blistering, and hyperkeratosis. For the RNA-seq analyses, we identified 3,813 genes that were significantly differentially expressed between keratinocyte differentiation stages (<italic>P</italic>-value&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05, cuffdiff2 software) and with an RPKM &#x0003e;&#x000a0;10 in at least one stage. Six distinct gene clusters were defined based on the expression dynamics of these genes using K-means clustering (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S2B</xref>; Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd3">S2A</xref>). Similar to the RNAPII ChIP-seq data, the RNA-seq data also showed that genes with distinct expression patterns during epidermal differentiation are associated with distinct roles during epidermal differentiation and with different skin disease phenotypes (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S2B</xref>; Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd3">S2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd3">C</xref>).</p><p>We further investigated and compared gene expression detected by RNAPII ChIP-seq and by RNA-seq. The global analysis showed that the range of expression levels (RPKM values) is narrower in the RNAPII ChIP-seq profile than in the RNA-seq profiles (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S2C</xref>). Nevertheless, the relative expression levels of genes (gene ranks based on their RPKM) are generally similar in both RNAPII ChIP-seq and RNA-seq profiles (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S2D</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd4">S3A</xref>), as the relationship between RNAPII occupancy and steady-state mRNA level remains largely unchanged during epithelial differentiation for most genes. However, a small proportion of genes showed substantially higher RNAPII occupancy than mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S2D</xref>, the bottom cluster), and these genes are strongly enriched for non-coding RNAs (mean-rank gene set enrichment, <italic>P</italic>-value&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;10<sup>&#x02212;95</sup> at all stages) (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd4">S3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd4">D</xref>). Despite the global similarity, closer inspection reveals different dynamics of gene expression patterns between these two methods for many genes (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">C</xref>). For example, the highest expression level of <italic>KRT10</italic> was detected at differentiation day 2 in RNAPII ChIP-seq, while its expression in the RNA-seq profile only reached its highest level at day 4 (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S1A</xref>). The expression pattern detected in the RNA-seq analysis correlates with the protein levels (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S1B</xref>). Consistent with the expression of individual marker genes, expression patterns of genes in the RNAPII ChIP-seq clusters were often more dynamic than their corresponding RNA-seq expression patterns, with the expression changes in the RNAPII ChIP-seq profiles preceding those in the RNA-seq profiles (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1C</xref>). These observations are consistent with RNAPII-mediated transcription preceding mRNA buildup and highlight differences between transcription rate control and steady-state mRNA level maintenance. Interestingly, Spearman correlation analysis showed a slightly better correlation of H3K27ac levels with the RNAPII occupancy at gene bodies than with the steady-state mRNA abundance (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S2E</xref>). This may reflect the influence of post-transcriptional processes such as RNA stability and processing of mRNA by miRNAs on mRNA steady-state levels. These data suggest that RNAPII ChIP-seq is a preferred method to study the direct effect of transcription factors on gene regulation as compared to RNA-seq. Based on this rationale, we used the RNAPII occupancy at the gene body as the measure of gene expression to study the p63-regulated transcription in subsequent analyses.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play an important role in epidermal differentiation <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, and therefore we analyzed our RNA-seq and RNAPII ChIP-seq for expression of miRNAs. Examining the RNAPII occupancy at annotated miRNA genes using K-means clustering analysis showed dynamically regulated expression of 103 primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcripts during differentiation (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S3A</xref>; Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd5">S4A</xref>) <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. Some of these miRNAs have been reported to play a role in epidermal differentiation such as <italic>miR-205</italic> and <italic>miRNA-203</italic> (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S3B</xref>) <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. For most of these miRNAs, RNA-seq signals at miRNA regions are low and the correlation between RNAPII ChIP-seq and RNA-seq signals is poor (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd5">S4C</xref>). Thus, RNAPII occupancy appears to give a better readout of pri-miRNA transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>p63-bound enhancers during epidermal differentiation</title><p>Next, we assessed the role of p63 in regulating dynamic gene expression during epidermal differentiation. We performed ChIP-seq of p63 from keratinocytes at different stages of differentiation. Among a total number of 38,980 p63 binding sites detected from all stages (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd6">S5E</xref>), more than 90% were found to contain at least one p63 binding consensus motif using our previously established p63scan algorithm <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, and there is a significant enrichment of p63 binding in promoter regions and within 25&#x000a0;kb distance of genes compared to genomic distributions of all binding sites (hypergeometric test, <italic>P</italic>-value&#x000a0;&#x0003c; 1E-323 and <italic>P</italic>-value&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6.97E-174, respectively) (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S4A</xref>). Surprisingly, in contrast to the dynamic gene expression pattern observed in RNAPII ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1C</xref>), the number of p63 binding sites and the p63 binding signals only showed a minor overall decrease during differentiation (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2A</xref>; Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S4B</xref>). This is probably due to the decreasing p63 protein levels during epidermal differentiation (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S1B</xref>) <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Epigenetic signature of p63 binding sites and correlation of p63 binding with gene regulation in epidermal keratinocytes

H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, repressive histone modification marks associated with poised enhancers in embryonic stem cells and heterochromatin <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, respectively, were not detected at any of the identified p63 binding sites (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2A</xref>), even though these marks are present at promoters of inactive genes (examples in Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S5A</xref>). As ENCODE data of NHEKs were collected at only one condition and provide limited information for the transcription program during epidermal differentiation, we further investigated the H3K27ac occupancy at all four stages during epidermal differentiation to gain insight into the activity dynamics of the p63-bound regions. Our data showed that 56.9% of all identified p63 binding sites were co-occupied by H3K27ac at any of the four stages (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd7">S6B</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd7">F</xref>), consistent with the ENCODE data analysis (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2A</xref>; Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd7">S6A</xref>). The p63 binding sites with a detectable level of H3K27ac were considered as active p63 binding sites. When active p63 binding sites were mapped to adjacent genes (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd7">S6G</xref>), a strong correlation was observed between the RNAPII occupancy at most genes and H3K27ac levels at the nearby p63 binding sites across the four stages of differentiation (median Pearson's R&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.77) (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2B</xref>). In contrast, the p63 levels at these binding sites showed no tendency to correlate with nearby gene body RNAPII levels during differentiation (median Pearson's R&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.09). These results indicate that H3K27ac occupancy at p63 binding sites, rather than p63 occupancy itself, reflects the regulatory activity of p63 binding sites in the transcription of nearby genes. Additionally, H3K27ac occupancy also correlates well with gene expression in general apart from at p63 binding sites (median Pearson's R&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.72) (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2B</xref>), which is consistent with previous reports of the correlation of H3K27ac with gene transcription <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. These findings suggest that p63-regulated gene expression can be predicted by dynamic H3K27ac occupancy at p63 binding sites.</p><p>To further investigate the dynamics of H3K27ac occupancy at p63 binding sites, we clustered p63 binding sites into seven groups based on the co-localized H3K27ac signals using K-means clustering (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3A</xref>; Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd10">S9A</xref>). Subsequently, we compared genes associated with these H3K27ac clusters (H3K27ac occupancy clusters in Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3B</xref>) with those in the nine clusters based on gene body&#x000a0;RNAPII occupancy (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1B</xref>, RNAPII occupancy clusters in Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3B</xref>), to assess the correlation between the H3K27ac occupancy at the p63 binding sites and transcription of the nearest genes. We observed that RNAPII and H3K27ac clusters with similar dynamics shared more genes than expected, while those with divergent dynamics shared fewer genes than expected (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3B</xref>). For example, genes associated with H3K27ac cluster 2 with increased H3K27ac signal are enriched for genes present in RNAPII cluster 3 that show increased expression during late differentiation (e.g., <italic>KRT23</italic>) (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">C</xref>; Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd2">S1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd10">S9A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd10">B</xref>). In contrast, genes associated with H3K27ac cluster 2 are depleted for genes present in RNAPII clusters 1, 4, 5, and 7, all of which show decreased expression during differentiation (e.g., <italic>DSG3</italic>) (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">C</xref>; Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd2">S1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd10">S9A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd10">B</xref>).

The essential role of p63 for the commitment to the epithelial lineage has been well established, and it is likely that p63 binds to clustered enhancers. Therefore, we investigated whether p63 can bind to clustered enhancers for its function in epithelial lineage determination. We observed an enrichment of clusters of five or more p63 binding sites (hypergeometric test, <italic>P</italic>-value&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9.06E-13) within 100&#x000a0;kb of the transcription start site of transcribed genes (RNAPII occupancy, <italic>RPKM</italic> &#x0003e;&#x000a0;1) relative to all genes (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd11">S10</xref>). We subsequently performed analyses using an established algorithm for detecting clustered enhancers <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> on two of our datasets: on p63 ChIP-seq data to identify regions with clustered p63 binding sites with high p63 binding signals, referred to as clustered p63 binding site regions (cl-p63BS) (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd15">S14A</xref>), and on H3K27ac ChIP-seq data to identify regions with clustered H3K27ac-marked enhancers. Regions with clustered H3K27ac-marked enhancers have been reported to drive cell-type-specific gene expression <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> and&#x000a0;are therefore referred to as clustered epidermal-specific enhancers (cl-epidermal enhancers) hereafter (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd12">S11A</xref>). Our analyses identified 1,293&#x000a0;cl-epidermal enhancers (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">E</xref>) and 1,991 regions as cl-p63BS (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5E</xref>). Of all 1,293 identified cl-epidermal enhancers, 1,182 (91.4%) sites overlapped with at least one p63 binding site (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">D</xref>). In addition, p63 preferentially binds to cl-epidermal enhancers (clustered H3K27ac-marked enhancers) rather than to single active enhancers (single H3K27ac peaks) and random controls (hypergeometric test and normal distribution probability test, respectively, <italic>P</italic>-value&#x000a0;&#x0003c; 1E-323 in all cases) (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5A</xref>). Three p63 binding sites on average were identified within each cl-epidermal enhancer, whereas randomized control sets contained zero p63 binding sites on average (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5B</xref>). These observations show that p63 binding sites are enriched in cl-epidermal enhancers in epidermal keratinocytes, and underscore the importance of p63 as a key transcription factor in epithelial lineage commitment. Out of a total number of 1,991 cl-p63BS, 617 share genomic regions with 589 cl-epidermal enhancers out of a total number of 1,293 (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5E</xref>) and are hereafter considered as active epidermal cl-p63BS (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd16">S15A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd16">B</xref>). Interestingly, approximately two-thirds of the cl-p63BS do not overlap with active cl-epidermal enhancers. Next, we used K-means clustering to identify six gene clusters associated with cl-epidermal enhancers showing different patterns of H3K27ac occupancy during differentiation (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5C</xref>; Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd12">S11A</xref>). These clusters were enriched for genes with concordant RNAPII occupancy patterns during differentiation and depleted for genes with discordant RNAPII differentiation dynamics (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5C</xref>). Compared to the association of single p63-bound enhancers with gene expression (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3B</xref>), these p63 binding site-containing cl-epidermal enhancers showed higher fold enrichment of gene clusters with similar expression patterns (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5C</xref>). In summary, our data showed that p63 binds to clustered enhancers, consistent with the role of p63 in epithelial commitment, and that these clustered enhancers play roles not only in epithelial commitment but also during epidermal differentiation.</p><fig id="fig05" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>p63 binding sites (p63BS), clustered p63 binding sites (cl-p63BS), and clustered epidermal enhancers (cl-epidermal enhancers) in gene regulation

The main drawback of this approach is that loss of p63 results in epithelial differentiation defects, and genes that are expressed at a later stage of differentiation and regulated by p63 may not be identified. In this study, we took a different approach and used differentiating normal keratinocytes. To identify p63 target genes, we first associated all identified p63 binding sites (38,980) with their nearest gene (11,890) (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd13">S12A</xref>) and analyzed gene function using DAVID Gene Ontology annotation <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. This showed an enrichment of genes involved in intracellular signaling cascade, phosphorylation, vascular development, cell migration, and cell death (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd13">S12B</xref>). Altogether, 10,020 p63 binding sites were identified in the proximity of differentially regulated genes (RNAPII ChIP-seq clusters, <italic>RPKM</italic> &#x0003e;&#x000a0;1) during epidermal differentiation and 74.2% of these binding sites are co-localized with H3K27ac (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd2">S1D</xref>). These differentially regulated genes with active p63 binding sites nearby were considered potential p63 target genes (1,961 based on RNAseq and 2,760 based on RNAPII) (Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd2">S1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd3">S2D</xref>).

Taken together, our data show that p63 targets are expressed in different layers of the epidermis and associated with distinct disease phenotypes (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S2B</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, p63 binding sites were also identified in the vicinity of 80 pri-miRNAs of the 130 pri-miRNAs that are differentially regulated during keratinocyte differentiation (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S3A</xref>; Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd5">S4B</xref>).

This may be due to genes in the vicinity of cl-p63BS being more likely to be true p63 target genes compared with those near single p63 binding sites. Genes associated with nearby cl-epidermal enhancers (clustered epidermal enhancers marked by H3K27ac) (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">E</xref>) are enriched for genes with epidermal-related functions (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd12">S11C</xref>). Genes mapped to these active epidermal cl-p63BS (overlap of cl-p63BS and cl-epidermal enhancers) likely play a role in epidermal development (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd16">S15C</xref>), similar to genes mapped to cl-epidermal enhancers (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd12">S11C</xref>). Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) analysis showed that this group of genes including <italic>CLDN1</italic>, <italic>p63</italic>, and&#x000a0;<italic>KRT17</italic> are associated with skin-related abnormalities such as epidermal thickening, aplasia/hypoplasia of the nails, and hyperkeratosis (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5E</xref>; Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd16">S15D</xref>). Genes in the vicinity of cl-epidermal enhancers that do not overlap cl-p63BS were enriched with genes that play a role in epidermal development (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd17">S16C</xref>), similar to the genes that were mapped by all cl-epidermal enhancers (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd12">S11C</xref>). In contrast, the 69% of cl-p63BS that do not overlap cl-epidermal enhancers mapped to genes with broader functions including regulation of cell proliferation, tube development, vascular development, and regulation of apoptosis (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd18">S17D</xref>). HPO analysis revealed that these genes are associated with epithelial-related non-skin phenotypes such as limb and tooth defects (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5E</xref>; Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd18">S17D</xref>), suggesting that inactive enhancers regulate gene expression during the development of other epithelial-related structures.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Tightly regulated gene expression during epidermal differentiation is crucial for the establishment and maintenance of the epidermis, and therefore, it is essential to obtain a complete gene regulatory map to understand the biology of the epidermis and related diseases. Here, we report an atlas of differentially expressed genes during epidermal differentiation and regulatory regions that are bound by p63, a key regulator in epidermal differentiation. We show that the activity of p63 binding sites as defined by co-localized H3K27ac signals, rather than p63 binding itself, correlates with the expression of nearby genes. Many of these epidermal genes are associated with distinct skin disease phenotypes and likely regulated by p63. Furthermore, our data show that not all p63 binding sites are active and suggest that the p63 binding sites that are &#x0201c;inactive&#x0201d; during keratinocyte differentiation are active and regulate genes in other epithelial tissues during different stages of development, and are relevant to epithelial-related diseases.</p><p>In this study, we used an established keratinocyte differentiation model <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>.

<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. These data confirm previous reports that this differentiation model under submerged condition allows the expression of genes that are normally found in the differentiating epidermis <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>.</p><p>The genomewide unbiased RNAPII ChIP-seq and RNA-seq profiling approaches not only revealed the global expression dynamics but also provided information that is not easily obtained by specific gene approaches, such as the expression of gene isoforms and transcription of miRNAs. Our RNAPII ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data at the <italic>TP63</italic> gene locus showed that &#x00394;<italic>Np63</italic> is the main isoform during keratinocyte differentiation, whereas the expression of the <italic>TAp63</italic> isoform was not detected (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S1D</xref>). These data are consistent with results from a recent RNA-seq analysis of the developing mouse epidermis <xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> and from p63 isoform-specific knockout experiments that demonstrated the major functional role of &#x00394;Np63 in the epidermis <xref rid="b54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="b55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>. These observations do not however rule out the possibility that the TAp63 isoform is expressed at an extremely low level, and the expression might be detected with deeper sequencing. So far, studies on the biogenesis of miRNAs have mainly been focused on processing of pri-miRNAs to miRNAs <xref rid="b56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="b57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, while data on transcriptional regulation of miRNA genes are limited. We show that RNAPII ChIP-seq analysis enables the detection of pri-miRNA transcription (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S3A</xref>; Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd5">S4A</xref>) <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. Many of these miRNAs are known to have a role in epidermal differentiation such as <italic>miR-205</italic> and <italic>miRNA-203</italic> (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S3B</xref>) <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. In combination with our p63 and H3K27ac ChIP-seq analyses, some of these miRNAs are identified as potential direct p63 targets, as they have an active p63 binding site with the co-localization of H3K27ac nearby (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S3B</xref>; Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd5">S4B</xref>).</p><p>Our data showed that approximately half of all identified p63 binding sites were co-occupied by H3K27ac and are considered as active binding sites (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2A</xref>). Consistently, about one-third of cl-p63BS (stretches of p63 binding sites) share genomic regions with cl-epidermal enhancers (stretches of H3K27ac sites) (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5E</xref>) and are considered as active epidermal cl-p63BS. These data suggest that p63 binding alone is not sufficient for the regulation of gene transcription, and indeed, gene expression dynamics correlates better with the H3K27ac signal at p63 binding sites than with p63 binding itself (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2B</xref>). This suggests the involvement of other co-regulators in p63 gene regulation during differentiation. Indeed, our analyses of transcription factor motif enrichment and ChIP-qPCR experiments showed that RUNX1 potentially cooperates with p63 at active p63 binding sites in keratinocytes (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">B</xref>). In contrast, p63 binding sites that are not co-localized with the H3K27ac mark were enriched for the NR2 nuclear receptor family motif that can be bound by RXR family proteins (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4A</xref>), suggesting that these proteins may function as repressors at p63 binding sites in keratinocytes. Other co-regulators seem to play a role in cooperating with p63 to regulate dynamic gene expression during keratinocyte differentiation (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4C</xref>). Interestingly, some of these identified p63 co-regulators are known or potential p63 targets (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">C</xref>), suggesting that p63 regulates the expression of these co-regulators and that these co-regulators cooperate with p63 to regulate its target genes, which is consistent with the role of p63 as a master regulator in epithelial cells.</p><p>The absence of dynamic p63 binding during epidermal differentiation in keratinocytes is distinct from the induced binding of lineage-specific transcription factors during early embryogenesis <xref rid="b58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> and differentiation of embryonic stem cells into specific lineages <xref rid="b59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>. A plausible explanation is that epidermal keratinocytes are a type of established epithelial cells, and differentiation of this type of multipotent stem cells might require different gene regulation mechanism compared to that in pluripotent embryonic stem cells or in early embryogenesis. It should be noted that our analyses do not discriminate whether p63 acts as an activator or a repressor factor; especially for genes with &#x0201c;inactive&#x0201d; p63 binding sites (without H3K27ac signal) nearby, p63 may function as a repressor. However, it is unlikely that p63 recruits repression complexes such as polycomb proteins or induces heterochromatin formation, as p63 binding sites are co-localized with open chromatin regions marked by DHS and with enhancer marks such as H3K4me1 but are not co-localized with H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 marks (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2A</xref>). One scenario is that the binding of p63 may mark epithelial lineage-related regulatory elements as a placeholder during epithelial commitment, and the recruitment of different sets of co-regulators is required for gene regulation in an epithelial-related tissue- and stage-specific manner. This hypothesis is supported by previous reports that p63 binding sites identified in epidermal keratinocytes have been found to be associated with limb and palate development and with relevant diseases, split hand/foot malformation <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and van der Woude syndrome where cleft lip/palate is one of the major features <xref rid="b60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="b61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>. The placeholder paradigm of transcription factor-mediated regulation has been reported for a group of transcription factors such as FoxA and GATA proteins in lineage progenitor cells <xref rid="b62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>. These transcription factors are the first factors to engage in enhancers during development, and their expression is required for lineage establishment.</p><p>In summary, we provide an expression atlas of epidermal genes including non-coding RNAs during epidermal differentiation, as well as a catalog of p63-regulated genes and regulatory regions that are bound by p63, a key regulator in epidermal differentiation. We show that the activity of p63 binding sites as defined by co-localization of histone modification mark H3K27ac signals correlates with the expression of nearby genes. Many of these epidermal genes are associated with distinct skin disease phenotypes. Among these p63-regulated genes, those that are not yet associated with skin diseases can be used as candidate causative genes for genetic studies such as the prioritization of exome sequencing data. The catalog of p63-regulated enhancers and clustered epidermal enhancers may provide potential genomic regions to study causative variants or genetic modifiers in non-coding regions and to elucidate the heterogeneity of sub-phenotypes of skin diseases. Importantly, we show that not all p63 binding sites are active in gene regulation in epidermal cells. This suggests that the p63 binding sites that are &#x0201c;inactive&#x0201d; during keratinocyte differentiation are active and regulate genes in other epithelial tissues during different stages of development. These &#x0201c;inactive&#x0201d; p63 binding sites may be relevant to other p63-related diseases. We propose that the transcription factor p63 serves as a placeholder and bookmarks enhancers that can regulate gene expression at different stages and in different tissues during development. It will be of interest to investigate whether p63 occupies genomic loci in a passive manner or actively shapes chromatin accessibility during epithelial lineage commitment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All procedures regarding establishing human primary keratinocytes were approved by the ethics committee of the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre (&#x0201c;Commissie Mensgebonden Onderzoek Arnhem-Nijmegen&#x0201d;).

Genes were ranked separately according to RNAPII ChIP-seq occupancy and RNA-seq RPKM. For each gene, the difference between the RNA-seq and ChIP-seq ranks was taken, and the genes were ranked according to this difference. Subsequently, the enrichment of non-coding RNAs with high RNAPII occupancy relative to RNA-seq levels was determined using mean-rank gene set enrichment analysis <xref rid="b75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref> as implemented in the &#x0201c;limma&#x0201d; R package. Overall correlations between the RNA-seq and RNAPII levels of different samples were calculated using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, due to the fact that the genomewide gene expression profiles per sample do not follow a normal distribution.</p></sec><sec><title>Correlation between enhancer H3K27ac, p63 signal, and gene body RNAPII ChIP-seq signal</title><p>For all expressed genes mapped to nearby enhancers, the Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between the H3K27ac and p63 ChIP-seq read counts at the associated enhancers (normalized for per-sample total read count) and the gene body RNAPII RPKM score across the four differentiation stages. H3K27ac enhancer signal was defined as a 4-kb window around the identified p63 ChIP-seq peak center to accommodate its broader binding pattern.

The p63BS datasets were centered on the peak summit of the identified p63 peaks (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd6">S5</xref>) and extended 300&#x000a0;bp to both directions. A background file of 10,000 genomically matched random peaks was generated using Gimme background, of which a validation set (sequences not used for motif prediction) was generated using Gimme threshold of all known family motifs with a false discovery rate <italic>P</italic>-value of 0.01 (considering a motif score of at least 99%). Motif enrichment in active versus inactive p63 binding site and motif enrichment for the different p63 binding site clusters with H3K27ac occupancy was determined. For each set of p63BS sequences, a background set was generated, and the validation set was used as a cutoff file to determine enrichment in the family motifs of all p63BS datasets. We used 1.5-fold as a cutoff to determine enrichment of motifs present in the datasets versus matched genomic background datasets, and between the different datasets.</p></sec><sec><title>ENCODE data</title><p>H3K27ac ChIP-seq (GSM733674), H3K4me1 ChIP-seq (GSM733698), H3K27me3 ChIP-seq (GSM733701), H3K9me1 ChIP-seq (GSM733655), H3K9me3 ChIP-seq (GSM1003528), and Open chromatin by DNaseI HS (GSM816635) data from NHEK was downloaded from the ENCODE UCSC browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/">http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Accession codes</title><p>All RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus <xref rid="b78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref> (GEO GSE59827).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work is supported by NWO/ALW/MEERVOUD/836.12.010 (HZ), NGI/BioRange program of the NBIC (MO), Radboud University fellowship (HZ), and NCMLS PhD fellowship (ENK).
