Here, we used high-throughput RNA sequencing to gain insight into the characterization of the poly-A RNA fraction expressed in pig male gonads. An expression analysis comparing different mapping approaches and detection of allele specific expression is also discussed in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>By sequencing testicle mRNA of two phenotypically extreme pigs, one Iberian and one Large White, we identified hundreds of unannotated protein-coding genes (PcGs) in intergenic regions, some of them presenting orthology with closely related species. Interestingly, we also detected 2047 putative long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), including 469 with human homologues. Two methods, DEGseq and Cufflinks, were used for analyzing expression. DEGseq identified 15% less expressed genes than Cufflinks, because DEGseq utilizes only unambiguously mapped reads. Moreover, a large fraction of the transcriptome is made up of transposable elements (14500 elements encountered), as has been reported in previous studies. Gene expression results between microarray and RNA-seq technologies were relatively well correlated (r = 0.71 across individuals). Differentially expressed genes between Large White and Iberian showed a significant overrepresentation of gamete production and lipid metabolism gene ontology categories. Finally, allelic imbalance was detected in ~ 4% of heterozygous sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>RNA-seq is a powerful tool to gain insight into complex transcriptomes. In addition to uncovering many unnanotated genes, our study allowed us to determine that a considerable fraction is made up of long non-coding transcripts and transposable elements. Their biological roles remain to be determined in future studies. In terms of differences in expression between Large White and Iberian pigs, these were largest for genes involved in spermatogenesis and lipid metabolism, which is consistent with phenotypic extreme differences in prolificacy and fat deposition between these two breeds.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Understanding the mammal transcriptome architecture has proven to be a complex task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The advent of high throughput sequencing technologies, such as RNA-seq, has, yet, substantially improved our comprehension of its structure and expression patterns. By deep sequencing the poly-A RNA fraction, it is possible not only to better characterize isoforms from known genes (e.g., identifying novel exons, new transcription start sites and alternative polyadenylation sites), but also to improve the annotation by discovering novel predicted coding genes and polyadenylated processed transcripts such as long intergenic non-coding RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Although several surveys of the transcriptome from different tissues have been conducted in humans and model species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] our knowledge of livestock species remains limited. For instance, the relation between extreme phenotypic differences and their transcriptome patterns is poorly studied. The transcriptome of livestock species is, by comparison to model species, much less known despite its economic and social interest.</p><p>In this study, we used high-throughput transcriptome sequencing in two pigs from extreme breeds. Our aim was to discover and characterize novel expressed transcripts and to identify differentially expressed genes that may explain some of the phenotypic variation. We sequenced the male gonad transcriptome of a Large White and an Iberian pig, two highly divergent phenotypic breeds in terms of production traits, e.g., growth, fatness and reproductive performance. To limit the effect of enviromental influences on gene expression pattern, both pigs were housed and fed with the same conditions and were prepubescent at slaughter time. Furthermore we compared the results obtained with RNA-seq with microarray data published in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Finally, we also identified polymorphic sites and genes that potentially showed allele specific expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Mapping</title><p>We obtained about 60 M of 50 bp paired-end reads from one lane of an Illumina GAIIx machine, about 30 M was derived from each sample (Data are archived at NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under Accession SRP008516). After ambiguous mapping (allowing for multi-hits) with Tophat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] a total of 20 M reads for each sample were mapped against the reference pig genome (assembly 9), although only 10 M were classified as proper pairs. The rest (4 M) fell into either one of these categories: reads without a mapped mate pair, mate is mapped on the same strand or mates overlap. The most likely explanations of the large amount of improperly mapped reads are the poor quality of the current pig genome assembly and the stringency of the version of Tophat used here, as this version does not allow gaps for the mapping. In addition, any situation where the distance between the mates is larger than the confidence interval of the insert size distribution, could be interpreted as trans-splicing events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], structural variants or simply mapping artifacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The total number fragments mapped with unambiguous mapping (1 hit per read) were 14 M for each sample; out of these, 7 M were classified as proper pairs. A comparison between ambiguous versus unambiguous mapping results obtained with Tophat is shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Annotation of reads and transcripts assembly</title><p>To calculate the proportion of reads mapping to annotated exons, we run S-MART (see methods). Surprisingly, with a minimum overlapping of 1 nucleotide, less than half of the reads (44.1%) mapped to annotated exons; a figure that drops even further (32.9%) when considering a minimum overlapping of 50 bp (the total read length). The rest of reads mapped to annotated introns (18.7%), or either 1 kb 5'upstream or 3'downstream of the annotated gene (26.6%) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The poor quality of the annotation of the pig genome probably explains why a majority of the mapped reads (55.9%) do not overlap with any known exons.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of reads' annotation</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th align="center">Large White</th><th align="center">Iberian</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><bold>Exons</bold></td><td align="center">9238572</td><td align="center">9141162</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>Introns</bold></td><td align="center">3833320</td><td align="center">3943866</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>5' Upstream or 3'Downstream</bold></td><td align="center">5383546</td><td align="center">5708057</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Number of reads with at least one overlapping nucleotide mapping to either exons, introns or within 1 kb of gene boundaries.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Moreover, after assembling the short reads into transcripts by Cufflinks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], only 1.2% of them matched exactly with annotated exons.

To investigate which of these transcripts actually encode a protein, we used Augustus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and found 714 novel putative proteins. We identified homologous DNA sequences (see methods) in <italic>Bos taurus </italic>and <italic>Homo sapiens </italic>genomes for most (413) of these novel proteins: 362 were orthologs with both cow and human, 20 with human only and 31 with the cow genome only. This result is consistent with <italic>Bos taurus </italic>being closer to <italic>Sus scrofa </italic>than human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Interestingly, when we looked for homologous DNA regions within the <italic>Sus scrofa </italic>genome, 53 paralogous regions were detected (51 duplications and 2 present in three copies).</p><p>To find out whether the predicted proteins from the homologous regions were already annotated, we ran BLASTP against the <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, <italic>Bos taurus </italic>and <italic>Sus scrofa </italic>protein databases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html">http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html</ext-link>). Overall, we identified 38 novel computationally predicted and 344 known proteins for the human, 15 novel predicted and 378 known proteins for the cow and 653 novel predicted and 89 known proteins for the pig. The novel computationally predicted proteins found in the pig are now experimentally confirmed by RNA-seq. See Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> for the coordinates of orthologous and paralogous genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Transposable elements</title><p>As many previous studies reported high activity of transposable elements (TE) in germlines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], we ran RepeatMasker to identify repetitive elements in the pig genome and in the transcriptome of the testicles. The fraction of transposable elements expressed in male gonads (SINEs, LINEs, LTR and DNA elements), compared to the total number detected in the pig genome, is less than 3%. However, approximately 20% of the expressed transcripts units harbor at least 1 transposable element (8% of the bp sequenced). The type of TE being more active in both breeds, in terms of number of elements expressed divided by the total number present in the genome, is DNA transposons, but accounting just for the number of elements expressed is SINE family for Large White and the LINE family for Iberian. LINE1 elements also have been reported to contribute to the transcriptome in human somatic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. It is interesting to mention that 16% of protein-coding transcripts contain transposable elements in their sequence and they are transcribed in the same transcript unit. Apart from these interspersed repeats, hundreds of small RNA (tRNA, snRNA and rRNA) and thousands of simple and low complexity repeats were also identified in the transcriptome. The presence of non-polyadenylated RNA could be a remaining contamination as they are highly expressed molecules and difficult to remove completely. Another possible explanation is the presence of small functional RNAs embedded in the introns of polyadenylated molecules of pre-mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Detailed results of the repetitive elements detection with Repeatmasker are shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3b</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>LncRNA annotation</title><p>In order to define a set of putative lncRNAs in the pig transcriptome, we applied several filtering criteria. Using the procedure in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] for the definition of lncRNA in humans, we excluded all transcripts mapping within 1 kb of an annotated protein-coding gene in the pig genome. This makes it less likely to consider the 5' or the 3' UTR of a protein-coding gene as a non-coding RNA. Yet, this filtering may not be stringent enough when dealing with insufficiently annotated genomes. For that reason, we further refined our analysis by excluding all transcripts coding for a complete proteins (according to Augustus). A third filter was applied by removing all transcripts having a hit against NR (BlastX), against Pfam (RPS-Blast) or against Rfam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] (web-site batch search). The final filter was applied mapping all the resulting transcripts onto the human genome (the best annotated mammalian genome), and removing any transcript strongly overlapping with a protein-coding gene. The result is a dataset made of 2047 transcripts and referred in the rest of this text as the lncRNAs.</p><p>The main problem when dealing with ncRNAs is to distinguish between spurious transcripts resulting from promoter leakiness and biologically functional transcripts. In order to do so, we assessed the level of evolutionary conservation of each lncRNA across the 18 available mammalian genomes. As shown in previous work, this conservation cannot be directly inferred from reference multiple genome alignment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. We therefore used a standard gene discovery strategy that relies on a combination of BlastN (version 2.0 MP, Gish, unpublished) and exonerate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. BlastN allows a rough identification of the location of each transcript in the considered genome while exonerate is used to precisely delineate the corresponding gene structure. We only considered as potential homologues hits for which exonerate alignments yield more than 70% coverage with the pig transcript. The results of this extensive homology based analysis are displayed on a heatmap (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>LncRNAs mammal conservation</bold>. The heatmap recapitulates the screening result of the new discovered 2047 pig lncRNAs versus eighteen mammal genomes. The columns represent the mammal genomes while the rows indicate the query lncRNAs. The spots indicate the result of the search of each pig lncRNA versus the different genomes. Green spots represent hits having high similarity scores. Black spots indicate low similarity scores. Red spots indicate that no homolog was detected.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-12-552-1"/></fig><p>In the context of this analysis, we managed to map 986 transcripts in at least one other mammal species. A sizeable number of transcripts (391) were excluded because they contain pig repeats (red block in the pig column on Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The rest of the transcripts roughly fall in three categories. The first one is made up of genes apparently conserved across most tested mammals, including human. These make up a group of 469 genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In this group, 131 transcripts map onto human genomic regions with no annotation. The rest either overlap with protein-coding genes (316), with known lncRNAs (15) or pseudogenes (7). It is important to note that an overlap with a PcG is not incompatible with a transcript being a lncRNA. The second category is made up of a group of 322 transcripts conserved among Artiodactyla (pig and cow) but not found in human. The last group encompasses all the putative lncRNAs for which no homologue was found in other species. While these may be pig specific, further analysis would be needed to confirm their biological relevance (for instance by testing their differential expression across tissues).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Ven diagrams of the predicted homologues in human and cow</bold>. <bold>a) </bold>469 pig lncRNA presented homology with human. 15 pig lncRNA overlap with human lncRNA, 316 overlap with human PcGs annotations and 131 lncRNA presented homology with unannotated human DNA regions. <bold>b) </bold>Comparison of lncRNAs having a homolog in human and in cow.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-12-552-2"/></fig><p>It is worth mentioning that the transcripts thus identified have a gene structure significantly different from their human counterparts. 97% are single exon genes and 2.5% bi-exonic, a figure significantly different from human where a much higher portion is bi-exonic. This finding may simply reflect insufficient coverage in the RNA-seq experiment resulting in truncated cufflinks models and thus should not be taken, so far, as strong evidence of distinct lncRNA organization between species.</p><p>It is in agreement with our observation that the lncRNA we observe in pig are roughly half the size of those reported in human (456 vs 925). As a consequence, the number of independent transcripts reported here is quite likely to be an over estimation.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene expression analysis</title><p>In total, 12,816 annotated genes were expressed in gonads. Less than 1% of these genes were expressed more than 10000 FPKM; around 5% were expressed between 1000 -10000 FPKM, 50% between 10-1000 FPKM, 40% between 10-100 FPKM and 3% between 1-10 FPKM (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). The rest were expressed below 1 FPKM. The maximum expression level of an annotated gene was 61,000 and 73,000 FPKM in Large White and Iberian, respectively. The gene ontologies of the 100 most expressed genes (mainly ribosomal proteins and heat-shock proteins) in both samples were related with transcription and translation, protein folding, lipid and cholesterol metabolism (apoproteins), induction of apoptosis and response to stress. These results are consistent with those observed in other mammalian species with RNA-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>The correlation of gene expression levels between both samples (Large White vs. Iberian) was very high (r = 0.85), which suggests that a large fraction of the transcriptome is conserved across individuals. This is consistent with our previous results which showed that the largest source of variability was tissue rather than sex or breed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Gene expression was quantified using two different approaches: DEGseq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], which uses raw fragment counts per gene as a measure of expression, and Cufflinks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], that uses an estimation of fragments per kilobase of exon per million reads mapped (FPKM). DEGseq's protocol recommends working only with the uniquely mapped fragments, whereas Cufflinks can deal with multiple mappable fragments. In this study, the correlation of the log2 of the fold change between both methods was 0.96 when discarding infinite values and taking expressed genes in both methods into account (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). Nevertheless, fragments mapping to homologous genes, which constitute 15%-20% of the expressed genes, are lost when considering fragments that map only once in the transcriptome, so it is arguable how to actually compare expression levels measured with these two programs.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Measuring gene expression</bold>. a) DEGseq vs. Cufflinks estimates of log2 fold changes between Large White and Iberian expressed genes.

A total of 9,112 Ensembl ID genes could be retrieved from microarray probes data for RNA-seq comparisons. The correlation between the individual microarray signal intensity difference and the log2 of the fold change from RNAseq was quite high (r = 0.71, see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). From the microarray study, we also had a Bayesian standardized breed score (z-score) available for each gene. When comparing the microarray breed z-score and the log2 of the fold change in RNA-seq, the correlation was also moderately high (Pearson correlation r = 0.46, see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Differential expression analysis</title><p>We compared the performance of Cufflinks and DEGseq to detect differential expression between both samples (P &#x0003c; 0.001 and fold change &#x0003e; 2). Cufflinks identified 2,907 differentially expressed genes with multiple mappable fragments and DEGseq 2,330 with uniquely mapped fragments; there was a reasonable agreement between softwares, 1,830 genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, top). But, to be more conservative, and to try to get only differential expression due to breeds and not merely to stochastic reasons, we extracted differentially expressed genes from breed effects data, with absolute z score threshold &#x0003e; 1.65. Then we selected the intersection of RNA-Seq (Cufflinks) and microarrays reducing the number of differentially expressed genes to 256 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, bottom). Out of these, 147 genes were over expressed in Large White and 109 in Iberian.

Doing the same analysis but considering the GOslim of the pig described in the methods section, we obtained an enrichment of reproduction, developmental process and fatty acid metabolic process parental gene ontologies (P &#x0003c; 10<sup>-3</sup>). Interestingly, among the significant KEGG-pathways represented, we found many differentially expressed genes in the PPAR signaling pathway, which is involved in lipid metabolism and, specifically, it has been shown to have a role in mice gonads fat deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Overlapping of differentially expressed genes</bold>.

The median expression level of annotated coding genes (230.1 FPKM) was slightly lower than of the novel-coding genes (258.0 FPKM). The range of expression levels of the annotated coding genes is, however, broader than that of the novel coding. We were able to detect annotated coding genes with very low expression levels, which highlights that fact that providing the reference gene models, it is easier to detect genes even at low coverage. Simultaneously, the expression median of transcripts units with at least one TE (111.6 FPKM) and lncRNAs (107.8 FPKM) is more than 50% lower than those of coding regions. As non-coding transcripts are probably involved in gene regulation, less number of copies is needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The annotated coding genes are on average longer than the novel coding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). This may be due to several reasons, first a higher coverage is needed to fully assemble a novel gene, but, it is has been also described than novel genes tend to be shorter than annotated ones. Overall we found that the average transcript length for protein-coding gene is 1578 bp, roughly half the size of transcripts in the human transcriptome (2982 bp). Interestingly, we observed a similar ratio when comparing the average size of lncRNAs in our experiment (456 bp) with that observed in human (925 bp). This fairly constant ratio suggests a homogenous bias, most likely the result of a lack of connecting paths between exons of the same transcript unit.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Expression levels according to annotation</bold>. a) Boxplots of expression level (log10 FKPM) for annotated coding genes, novel coding genes, lincRNA and transcripts with TE.

Importantly, RNA-seq allows us to improve dramatically the annotation of the species and the discovery of new splicing events. Here, we have confirmed that a large part of the transcription effort in the cell is spent on TE sequences. A recent RNA-seq study in human and primate brain transcriptomes also found high proportion of reads mapping to repetitive elements, mainly from the Alu family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Previous works in mice also indicated high expression of TE in germlines. The number of TE is probably an over-estimation as we did an ambiguous mapping reporting only the best alignments. On the other side, Cufflinks down weights the expression level taking into account mapping uncertainty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Unfortunately, we also confirm that current porcine annotation is incomplete, as evidenced by read mapping annotation: more than 50% of the fragments do not map to annotated exons. The fact that many reads map to introns could be explained either by intron retention (new isoforms) or pre-mRNA presence. Reads mapping outside the boundaries of annotated genes could be explained either by polymerase run-on fragments or a bad annotation of the gene endings. Many intergenic reads have been mapped to putative novel coding transcripts, some of them presenting orthology with related species. The poor status of the annotation is confirmed by the presence of 104 highly conserved transcripts, that would have been annotated as lncRNAs if we had only considered the pig annotation, but whose homologues in human show a perfect overlap with protein-coding genes.</p><p>Given that we had previously analyzed the transcriptome of a wider collection of pig and tissues with Affymetrix microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], we were able to compare both technologies. The correlation within individuals was rather high (r = 0.71) and comparable to other reported studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Furthermore, the correlation of expression between Iberian and Large White obtained with microarray (employing all animals) and the individuals (obtained with RNAseq) was also moderately high (r = 0.46), suggesting that transcriptome patterns are relatively stable. Among the most differentially expressed genes, those involved in spermatogenesis and lipid metabolism are over-represented, which may be a result of targeted tissue selection. It is noteworthy that Large White and Iberian breeds are phenotypically extreme for both reproduction and fat deposition traits so these data would suggest a correlated effect on the regulation of genes involved in these traits.</p><p>In general, Cufflinks has a better performance to map fragments to genes or isoforms that are physically overlapping or very similar in sequence, as it uses a statistical model to deal with multiply mapping fragments. DEGseq works with uniquely mapped reads, thus underestimating gene expression levels of homologous genes but also discarding those reads belonging to two overlapping genes; a bias in expression level is thus introduced in these cases. The algorithm behind Cufflinks is rather na&#x000ef;ve, though. Recently, new approaches that implement improved algorithms to deal with ambiguously mapped reads data and avoid bias in downstream analysis have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>Although not the main purpose of the work, we also found a lower rate of heterozygosity in Iberian than in the Large White animal, in agreement with the fact that Iberian pigs are normally inbred. Finally, we also explored ASE, a topic that has received a renewed interest recently. In this study, ~ 4% of the segregating SNP presented allelic imbalance. From these, around 40% were located inside annotated genes, the rest were located in blocks in intergenic regions, pointing to putative functional transcripts. To be able to confirm ASE, more animals should be tested because the majority of the SNPs with ASE were not common between Large White and Iberian pigs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We provide a complete survey of the pig male gonad transcriptome and identified many novel elements. However, to further improve the annotation of the pig genome, a large effort from the community will be necessary by sequencing more tissues at different developmental stages. In order to detect novel splicing events and to reconstruct novel isoforms, RNA-seq studies with very high coverage are required. Here, we also have shed some light on the dark matter of the transcriptome; in particular, we remark the discovery of novel long non-coding transcripts and the fact that TE expression seems to take a large fraction of the transcriptome. Their precise roles need to be elucidated in future studies. We also show that correlation between microarray and RNAseq expression data are reasonably high (linear correlation r = 0.71). Finally, Large White and Iberian pigs seem to have diverged most for genes involved in spermatogenesis and lipid metabolism, not only in terms of gene expression but also phenotypically. Interestingly, it is well known that genes related to gametogenesis are subject often to a positive selection rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].

RNA integrity was assessed by Agilent Bioanalyser 2100 and RNA Nano 6000 Labchip kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, USA). Due to high variation in concentrations of the total RNA obtained in different tissues, all samples were concentrated and cleaned using the RNAeasy MiniElute Cleanup kit (Qiagen, Basel, Switzerland) obtaining final concentrations between 500 and 1000 ng/&#x003bc;l. Sequencing libraries were produced using the Illumina mRNA-Seq sample preparation kit, following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 4 &#x003bc;g of total RNA were used as input for poly-A+ selection, followed by metal-catalyzed fragmentation of the selected mRNA (peak of size distribution at approx. 240 nt). After reverse transcription to cDNA using random hexamer primers, we performed end-repair and A-tailing of the double stranded cDNA. Large White and Iberian cDNA were ligated to indexed pairs of adapters, see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>.

The children gene ontology enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses were performed with the DAVID database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/">http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/</ext-link>). Prior to GO analysis, the pig gene IDs were converted to human gene IDs with Biomart (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biomart.org/">http://www.biomart.org/</ext-link>) as the database had poor pig Ensembl annotations. The list of differentially expressed genes (intersection of Cufflinks and microarray breed effects) was compared against total expressed genes in male gonads (background).</p></sec><sec><title>SNP identification</title><p><bold>S</bold>NPs were identified from unambiguously mapped reads using Samtools (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/">http://samtools.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>). The minimum SNP quality was 10 and the minimum read depth was set to 3 &#x000d7; for fixed SNP with respect to the reference and 4 &#x000d7; for segregating SNP. As many false SNP were located at the splice sites due to the difficulties of alignments near indels (splicing sites), they were removed from the final set. Annotation of the SNP was made with custom Perl scripts using the Ensembl APIs.</p></sec><sec><title>Allele specific expression</title><p>To test for allele specific expression heterozygous SNP were selected from both samples using uniquely mapped reads (SNP quality &#x0003e; 10, minimum depth of 4x, minimum allele count of 2). Allele specific expression can be inferred when, in a heterozygous site, one allele is transcribed at significantly higher or lower rate (<italic>p</italic>) than the other allele. We used a beta - binomial model within a Bayesian framework to infer whether <italic>p </italic>was significantly different from 0.5.
