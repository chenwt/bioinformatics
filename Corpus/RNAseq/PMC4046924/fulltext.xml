The recurrent evolution of this highly complex trait involving alterations to leaf anatomy, cell biology and biochemistry allows an increase in productivity by &#x0223c;50% in tropical and subtropical areas. The extent to which separate lineages of C<sub>4</sub> plants use the same genetic networks to maintain C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis is unknown. We developed a new informatics framework to enable deep evolutionary comparison of gene expression in species lacking reference genomes. We exploited this to compare gene expression in species representing two independent C<sub>4</sub> lineages (<italic>Cleome gynandra</italic> and <italic>Zea mays</italic>) whose last common ancestor diverged &#x0223c;140 million years ago. We define a cohort of 3,335 genes that represent conserved components of leaf and photosynthetic development in these species. Furthermore, we show that genes encoding proteins of the C<sub>4</sub> cycle are recruited into networks defined by photosynthesis-related genes. Despite the wide evolutionary separation and independent origins of the C<sub>4</sub> phenotype, we report that these species use homologous transcription factors to both induce C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis and to maintain the cell specific gene expression required for the pathway to operate. We define a core molecular signature associated with leaf and photosynthetic maturation that is likely shared by angiosperm species derived from the last common ancestor of the monocotyledons and dicotyledons. We show that deep evolutionary comparisons of gene expression can reveal novel insight into the molecular convergence of highly complex phenotypes and that parallel evolution of <italic>trans</italic>-factors underpins the repeated appearance of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. Thus, exploitation of extant natural variation associated with complex traits can be used to identify regulators. Moreover, the transcription factors that are shared by independent C<sub>4</sub> lineages are key targets for engineering the C<sub>4</sub> pathway into C<sub>3</sub> crops such as rice.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis is one of the most successful and widespread examples of convergent evolution; the first C<sub>4</sub> plant evolved long after the extinction of the dinosaurs, yet C<sub>4</sub> species now account for &#x0223c;30% of primary productivity on earth. Compared with ancestral C<sub>3</sub> photosynthesis, the C<sub>4</sub> pathway allows faster rates of growth, and thus international efforts have been mustered to introduce advantageous C<sub>4</sub> traits into important C<sub>3</sub> crops to increase their yield. However, the transition from C<sub>3</sub> to C<sub>4</sub> involves complex alterations to leaf anatomy and biochemistry. Despite these multiple changes, C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis has evolved independently at least 60 times. Through DNA and RNA sequencing we are beginning define a catalog of genes associated with C<sub>3</sub> or C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. However, we know little about how these genes act co-ordinately to bring about the convergent C<sub>4</sub> phenotype. In this work we develop a new informatics framework to reveal that two independent lineages of C<sub>4</sub> plants have co-opted the same regulators of gene expression to generate the C<sub>4</sub> leaf. Our findings provide a new paradigm for investigating the genetics of convergent traits and the origin of convergent phenotypes. Moreover, they reveal significant new insight into the regulatory mechanisms governing the origins of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant PBZHP3-123289), the Isaac Newton Trust and the European Union (grants PIEF-GA-2009-253189 and 3to4).

Compared with ancestral C<sub>3</sub> photosynthesis, the C<sub>4</sub> pathway allows increased productivity in tropical and sub-tropical habitats, and C<sub>4</sub> species represent many of the world's most productive crops <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The increased productivity of C<sub>4</sub> plants is due to the fact that they concentrate CO<sub>2</sub> around Ribulose Bisphosphate Carboxylase Oxygenase (RuBisCO) <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Hatch1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In most C<sub>4</sub> species this is achieved through a spatial partitioning of the photosynthetic apparatus into two discrete cell types, mesophyll (M) and bundle sheath (BS) cells <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Hatch1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Hibberd1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, but in a small number of lineages spatial partitioning occurs within an individual cell <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Voznesenskaya1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Voznesenskaya2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>The entry point for CO<sub>2</sub> in the canonical two-cell C<sub>4</sub> pathway is <italic>via</italic> carbonic anhydrase (CA), which catalyses the conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to HCO<sub>3</sub>

<sup>&#x02212;</sup> to generate the C<sub>4</sub> acid oxaloacetate and the subsequent diffusion of organic acids from M to BS cells, followed by their decarboxylation increases CO<sub>2</sub> concentration around RuBisCO ten-fold <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Furbank1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This increase in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration effectively abolishes the oxygenation reaction of RuBisCO and thus reduces energy loss through photorespiration. At least three different C<sub>4</sub> acid decarboxylases (NAD-dependent malic enzyme, NADP-dependent malic enzyme and phospho<italic>enol</italic>pyruvate carboxykinase) have been recruited in different C<sub>4</sub> lineages to release CO<sub>2</sub> around RuBisCO in BS cells. To complete the canonical two-cell C<sub>4</sub> cycle, phospho<italic>enol</italic>pyruvate is regenerated by pyruvate,orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) in chloroplasts of M cells.</p><p>The patterns of gene expression that facilitate the compartmentalisation of photosynthesis between M and BS cells of C<sub>4</sub> species have been assessed in a limited number of lineages. In dicotyledons, gene expression associated with maintenance of a functional C<sub>4</sub> pathway has been studied in only two of the thirty-six known C<sub>4</sub> lineages <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Brautigam1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Moreover, in monocotyledons, the patterns of gene expression associated with generating a C<sub>4</sub> leaf have so far only been reported in maize <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Sawers1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004365-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. To date, several regulatory mechanisms have been demonstrated to play a role in modulating cell-type specific gene expression.

However, <italic>G2</italic> is not specific to C<sub>4</sub> species and also regulates photosynthesis gene expression in C<sub>3</sub> leaves <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Waters1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Overall, these data indicate that the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis is driven by both convergent and parallel changes in gene expression. However, it is unknown if these changes are governed by the same regulators.</p><p>Here we test the extent to which the same genetic networks regulate C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic development in independent lineages of C<sub>4</sub> derived from the dicotyledons and monocotyledons. We defined a developmental gradient of C<sub>4</sub> induction in the dicotyledon <italic>Cleome gynandra</italic> and characterised patterns of gene expression underlying this process. Currently, there are no C<sub>4</sub> dicotyledons for which genome sequence is available, however analysis of <italic>C. gynandra</italic> is greatly facilitated by its phylogenetic proximity to the C<sub>3</sub> model species <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1004365-Brautigam1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Through comparative analysis with an analogous developmental gradient in the distantly-related C<sub>4</sub> monocotyledon maize <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Pick1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> we identify conserved sets of genes that underlie leaf maturation in both species. Although leaf maturation in monocotyledons is largely linear from base to tip <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, while in dicotyledons both basipetal and lateral gradients are apparent <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004365-Koteyeva1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, we detected significant convergence in patterns of transcript abundance. We demonstrate that in both species genes important for the C<sub>4</sub> cycle are co-regulated with photosynthesis-related genes and that eighteen transcription factor homologues form a common cohort underpinning C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic development in these species. We further report the degree to which M and BS transcriptomes overlap in <italic>C. gynandra</italic> and maize. Taken together, this work indicates that C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis is associated with the parallel evolution of <italic>trans</italic>-factors.

In the tip region of 3 mm leaves cell profiles were analogous to those seen in fully expanded mature leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004365-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). There were also pronounced differences in the rates of BS and M cell expansion between the base and middle section 3 mm leaves.

Similar increases in relative protein abundance for CA, PEPC, NAD-ME and PPDK proteins were also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004365-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate a progression of accumulation of key components for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis from the base to the tip of 3 mm <italic>C. gynandra</italic> leaves. Moreover, the molecular and phenotypic signatures of the tip section appeared equivalent to mature leaves. Therefore, we exploited this framework to investigate patterns of gene expression underlying these phenotypic changes. Furthermore, we determined the extent to which these patterns of gene expression were analogous to those observed in the C<sub>4</sub> monocotyledon maize <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.

This is non-trivial due to the inherent properties and artefacts of <italic>de novo</italic> assembled transcriptomes. For example, it is to be expected that following <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies of RNAseq data, most gene loci will be represented by multiple assembled transcript variants <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004365-Robertson1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. These transcripts may differ from each other in several ways, for example through single nucleotide polymorphisms, alternative splicing of internal exons, alternative terminal exons and incomplete/chimeric assembly due to low sequence coverage or assembly errors. Homologous transcript identification is further complicated by the large phylogenetic distance between the species being compared. Increased phylogenetic distance leads to a concomitant increase in global sequence divergence between homologous genes in different species. Therefore any method which is specifically designed for assignment of homologues in <italic>de novo</italic> assembled transcriptomes should be able to identify and group multiple different transcript variants for any given gene to enable comparative analysis of gene expression.</p><p>To determine the suitability of existing assignment methods for identifying homologous transcript groups in <italic>de novo</italic> assembled transcriptomes we used RNAseq data from rice. Here we carried out <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of the short read data, and computed an abundance estimate for each <italic>de novo</italic> assembled transcript. We also computed an abundance estimate for each gene locus in the rice reference genome using the same short read data. Several different strategies for identifying homologous transcripts between the <italic>de novo</italic> assembled transcriptome and the rice reference genome were tested and the accuracy of each strategy was assessed by the global correlation of the abundance estimates that resulted from the assembled transcripts-to-reference-gene homology map. Global correlation is negatively affected both by false positive errors (incorrect homology assignment), false negative errors (missing orthology assignment) and assembly artefacts (partial and chimeric transcripts) and so it is a good measure of the utility of an orthology assignment method for quantitative transcriptome comparisons. When using simple methods such as a Reciprocal Best-BLAST (RBB) or fixed e-value cut-offs for assignment abundance estimate accuracies were low and unsuitable for comparative gene expression analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004365-g002">Figure 2A &#x00026; 2B</xref>). Using more complex methods such as OrthoMCL improved abundance estimate accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004365-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). However accuracy is still low for comparative analyses of gene expression.</p><fig id="pgen-1004365-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1004365.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Overview of the workflow and results of the conditional orthology assignment method.</title><p>Identification of homologues and quantification of gene expression after <italic>de novo</italic> assembly, for full details see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004365.s030">Text S1</xref>.

As there are no specific methods currently available which are designed to account for the properties and artefacts of <italic>de novo</italic> assembled transcriptomes as outlined above, we developed a novel orthology assignment method to facilitate accurate multispecies comparisons of gene expression from <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assemblies. The method uses machine learning to define sequence similarity parameters for gene homologues and thus compensates for the properties and artefacts of <italic>de novo</italic> assembled transcriptomes. The first step in this method is to undertake a pairwise reciprocal best-BLAST (RBB) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004365-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) using the full set of <italic>de novo</italic> assembled transcripts against a reference set derived from a reference genome. The RBB hits between these two datasets are identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004365-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) and grouped according to the length of the assembled transcript. For each length group the RBB hits are ranked and the e-value of a chosen percentile is recorded. A matrix of all e-values and query sequence lengths is then fit to a quadratic polynomial model by least-squares fitting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004365-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). While the RBBs are accepted as homologues, the function describing this curve is used to classify non-RBB transcripts of any given length, those above the curve are assigned as homologues and those below the curve are rejected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004365-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). Thus homologue assignment is conditioned on both the assembled transcript length and also the global sequence divergence between the <italic>de novo</italic> assembled and reference transcriptome. This approach significantly increased the accuracy of abundance estimates derived from <italic>de novo</italic> assembled transcripts when compared with estimates derived from the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004365-g002">Figure 2B and 2G</xref>). This accuracy is also robust to large phylogenetic distances. Even when homologous transcripts were identified using an intermediary reference genome (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>), the accuracy of mRNA abundance estimates remained high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004365-g002">Figure 2H</xref>). We conclude our assignment method, conditioned on both sequence length and global sequence divergence, is suitable for comparative analyses of gene expression after <italic>de novo</italic> transcript assembly from short read sequencing.

The higher number of genes specific to the leaf base compared with the middle and tip likely reflects the earlier stage of development of this tissue. Consistent with this, the majority of gene annotations in this subset comprise regulatory functions such as gene expression, translation and signalling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004365.s015">Table S1</xref>).

Comparative analysis of global gene expression profiles across this developmental series revealed increases in the expression of genes associated with the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis and reductions in markers of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004365-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Similar to the analysis of unique transcripts, the majority of statistically significant changes in transcript abundance (2,233 of transcripts or 14% of the total annotated) occurred between base and mid sections of the leaf, compared with only 414 transcripts (3% of total) being differentially expressed between mid and tip (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004365.s016">Table S2</xref>). During an analogous leaf development series in maize more genes were found to be unique to each stage <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.

Combined with the GO term analysis these data indicate that between the base and middle of developing leaves of <italic>C. gynandra</italic> there were considerable changes in both the number and type of genes expressed, whereas the tip of developing leaves and fully expanded leaves differ with respect to a large number of genes with similar functions.

We therefore propose that these sixteen transcription factors have been recruited from a role in leaf maturation in C<sub>3</sub> plants into regulating genes of the C<sub>4</sub> cycle in C<sub>4</sub> species.

As expected this included genes associated with the chloroplast and photosynthesis, but we also found gene categories relating to response to reactive oxygen species, plasmodesmata, the nucleus, ribosome, proteasome and DNA and RNA binding behaving in the same manner. This large overlap is indicative of a core conserved genetic network that regulates leaf development and photosynthetic induction. We discovered 216 transcription factors that exhibited analogous expression behaviours within the constraints of the ontogenetic frameworks of both maize and <italic>C. gynandra</italic> developing leaves. This result implies that there is significant conservation in the <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors in these distantly related species associated with leaf maturation and photosynthetic function.

These patterns of gene expression are also consistent with those reported in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> during leaf development <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Andriankaja1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, and so these three datasets encapsulate a conserved molecular toolkit associated with leaf maturation. It is possible these broad-scale similarities in the patterns of gene expression between maize, <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>C. gynandra</italic> is associated with convergent evolution, but the most parsimonious explanation for these distantly-related species possessing similar patterns of gene expression is that these behaviours are derived from the last common ancestor. We therefore infer that these genes encode proteins that are essential to leaf maturation in all angiosperms derived from the last common ancestor of these species that is estimated to date to around 140 million years ago <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Chaw1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>With respect to C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in particular, and compared with other C<sub>4</sub> species assessed to date <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004365-McKown1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Dengler1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <italic>C. gynandra</italic> develops C<sub>4</sub> traits over a short ontogenetic framework of just 3 mm. Similar gradients in leaf maturation have recently been reported in both <italic>C. gynandra</italic> and <italic>Cleome angustifolia</italic>, and immunolocalisation showed selective localisation of RuBisCO in chloroplasts of the BS prior to structural differentiation of M and BS cells <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Koteyeva1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. This suggests in <italic>C. gynandra</italic>, <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors which are selectively expressed in M or BS cells, and which appear early in the basal section of the leaf, may be candidates for cell specific control of synthesis of some C<sub>4</sub> enzymes <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Koteyeva1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Bowman1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Equivalent gradients in gene expression are detected along &#x0223c;10 cm of maize leaf. In addition to conservation in global patterns of gene expression associated with leaf development we were also able to show that genes important for the C<sub>4</sub> pathway show similar patterns of expression to genes annotated as photosynthesis-related. While the concept that genes encoding proteins of the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway should be regulated by existing photosynthesis networks is intuitive, this has not been demonstrated previously. Although the relative abundance of mRNAs from photosynthesis genes increased from base to tip of both species, the rate of increase and point at which steady state was reached varied. Despite this variation in accumulation rate, photosynthesis genes were tightly co-regulated in both species, occupying only eight and nine discrete clusters in maize and <italic>C. gynandra</italic> respectively. There was little evidence for a one-to-one relationship between individual clusters indicating that there is significant divergence in timing and spatial arrangement of photosynthetic and metabolic maturation between the monocotyledons and dicotyledons. As C<sub>4</sub> pathway genes were distributed among different photosynthetic clusters in <italic>C. gynandra</italic> and maize we were able to identify a small set of transcription factors that were co-ordinately expressed with C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis genes in both species. Although this list only contained eighteen transcription factors, this is significantly enriched compared to the background rate of transcription factor co-expression for sets of genes of the same size. Furthermore, we found that 16 of these 18 transcription factors exhibited analogous expression behaviour in the C<sub>3</sub> leaves of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. This finding strongly implies that this cohort of regulators plays a conserved role in leaf maturation in many angiosperms and has been co-opted to regulate C<sub>4</sub> pathway genes in both <italic>C. gynandra</italic> and maize. The fact that fourteen of these eighteen transcription factors accumulate preferentially either in M or BS cells of <italic>C. gynandra</italic>, and that nine show exactly the same distribution in maize indicates that they very likely underlie regulation of components required for the C<sub>4</sub> pathway. We propose that the five transcription factors with preferential but opposite patterns of expression in M and BS cells of maize and <italic>C. gynandra</italic> underpin differences in gene expression associated with their belonging to the distinct NAD-ME and NADP-ME biochemical subtypes. Of the eighteen transcription factors that we detected as showing the same behaviours in <italic>C. gynandra</italic> and maize, only a subset were detected by an independent microarray analysis of maize leaf maturation <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Pick1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, but of these, the majority increased in abundance as leaves matured, further supporting a role in C<sub>4</sub> maturation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004365.s028">Table S14</xref>).</p><p>In addition to similarities in the patterns of gene expression as leaves of <italic>C. gynandra</italic> and maize matured, we also found significant overlap in gene expression of M and BS cells between these two independent C<sub>4</sub> lineages. In maize 21&#x02013;25% of all genes expressed in leaves were estimated to be differentially expressed in M and BS cells <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Koteyeva1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. As these maize experiments were conducted with very different technologies there are significant differences in their estimates of gene expression, however we found 1,154 and 1,429 genes that were preferentially expressed in the M or BS respectively in both maize datasets. Furthermore, of the maize genes that were consistently differentially expressed in the M and BS, 99 and 195 were homologous to M and BS specific genes in <italic>C. gynandra</italic>. These data indicate that in the two species these cell types show more differences in gene expression than similarities. However, we did detect fourteen directly homologous transcription factors specific to each cell type in both species. These data are consistent either with these transcription factors playing fundamental conserved roles in M and BS cells of all C<sub>3</sub> as well as C<sub>4</sub> species, or that they have been recruited into regulate processes relating to C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in independent C<sub>4</sub> lineages. Previous analysis of transcript abundance in M and BS cells of C<sub>3</sub> rice <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Jiao1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> provides insight into the extent to which cell specific expression of these genes is an ancestral characteristic, or, whether this cell specialisation has occurred in parallel in both C<sub>4</sub> lineages. Whilst, fewer genes were detected in the rice microarray study <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Jiao1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, homologues to five of the <italic>trans</italic>-factors preferentially expressed in BS or M cells of both <italic>C. gynandra</italic> and maize were detected. However, none of these were preferentially expressed in the BS or M cells of rice, strongly implying parallel recruitment into specific roles in these cells in independent C<sub>4</sub> lineages.</p><p>In summary, our data indicate that a broad comparative approach of distantly related species can shed light on the molecular signatures of highly complex traits. With respect to C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in particular, we show that not only is it underpinned by the parallel evolution of <italic>cis</italic>-elements <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Brown3" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and amino acid substitutions <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Christin2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, but also that expression of homologous transcription factors follow analogous temporal and spatial patterns of expression in independent lineages of C<sub>4</sub> plants. Additional studies of C<sub>4</sub> species with structurally similar leaves but differing types of C<sub>4</sub> biochemistry may well help identify <italic>trans</italic>-factors that act to regulate structural versus biochemical development of C<sub>4</sub> function. For this to be efficient, the developmental stage at which samples are taken will need to be carefully selected <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. As key regulators generating the C<sub>4</sub> phenotype are shared between lineages, this opens up the possibility of using natural variation to identify regulators and therefore to facilitate engineering C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis into C<sub>3</sub> crops <xref rid="pgen.1004365-Hibberd2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> to increase their yield.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>
