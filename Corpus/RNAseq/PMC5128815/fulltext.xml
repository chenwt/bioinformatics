Here we investigate the concordance between sequencing-based and routine diagnostic biomarkers and to what extent tumor sequencing contributes clinically actionable information. We applied DNA- and RNA-sequencing to characterize tumors from 307 breast cancer patients with replication in up to 739 patients. We developed models to predict status of routine biomarkers (ER, HER2,Ki-67, histological grade) from sequencing data. Non-routine biomarkers, including mutations in <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>BRCA2</italic> and <italic>ERBB2</italic>(HER2), and additional clinically actionable somatic alterations were also investigated. Concordance with routine diagnostic biomarkers was high for ER status (AUC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.95;AUC(replication)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.97) and HER2 status (AUC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.97;AUC(replication)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.92). The transcriptomic grade model enabled classification of histological grade 1 and histological grade 3 tumors with high accuracy (AUC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.98;AUC(replication)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.94). Clinically actionable mutations in <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>BRCA2</italic> and <italic>ERBB2</italic>(HER2) were detected in 5.5% of patients, while 53% had genomic alterations matching ongoing or concluded breast cancer studies. Sequencing-based molecular profiling can be applied as an alternative to histopathology to determine ER and HER2 status, in addition to providing improved tumor grading and clinically actionable mutations and molecular subtypes. Our results suggest that sequencing-based breast cancer diagnostics in a near future can replace routine biomarkers.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Advances in primary management of breast cancer have resulted in marked survival improvements, mainly due to abide use of different adjuvant therapies together with early detection using mammography<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.

The subtypes originally defined by S&#x000f8;rlie <italic>et al</italic>. in 2001 and later further refined in additional studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> are commonly used for stratification of tumors: Basal-like, Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2 and Normal-like. However, molecular subtyping using gene expression signatures has not yet reached wide implementation in the clinic. In current clinical practice this molecular phenotype is based on four biomarkers that are routinely analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC): Estrogen receptor alpha (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), Human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2), and Ki-67. In addition, histopathological characterization is routinely carried out to determine tumor grade (Nottingham Histologic Grade). Additional histopathological information of importance in the planning of adjuvant treatment include tumor size.nodal status and lymphovascular invasion.

A prerequisite for clinical implementation is cost-efficiency. Therefore we designed a 1.6&#x02009;Mb pan-cancer panel to enable detection of point mutations, germ-line risk variants and pharmacogenomics SNPs. Additionally, low-pass whole-genome sequencing was performed for the identification of copy number variants. A full profile, also including RNA-sequencing, required in total only data corresponding to 1/5 lane on the Illumina Hiseq 2500, in high-output mode.</p><p>Using our full profile, we evaluate to what extent RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) data allow us to predict the status of routine breast cancer biomarkers (ER, PR, HER2 and Ki-67). We also outline how RNAseq data can be used to define transcriptomic grade, as an alternative to the histological grade. Furthermore, we detect clinically actionable somatic alterations, including those in <italic>ERBB2</italic> (HER2) and <italic>BRCA1/BRCA2</italic>, which represent information with the potential to provide direct added value from sequencing-based diagnostics.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>ClinSeq study</title><p>The study is based on samples from the Libro1 and KARMA tissue studies. Briefly, Libro1 is a retrospectively enrolled group of patients who underwent surgery between 2001 and 2008 at the Karolinska University Hospital and KARMA is a prospectively enrolled group of patients from the South General Hospital in Stockholm during 2012. For both studies, germline DNA from blood and snap-frozen tumor tissue was available. In total the ClinSeq data set contained 307 individuals with RNAseq data (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 1</xref> for consort diagram), low-pass whole-genome DNA sequencing (0.5&#x000d7; coverage) to determine genomic copy number variants (CNVs) across the genome, and panel DNA-sequencing (150&#x000d7; coverage) of 484 genes in an custom in-house designed pan-cancer gene panel for detection of point mutations, germ-line risk variants and pharmacogenomics SNPs. The panel was designed in June 2013 through extensive literature search. Additionally, the size of the panel was limited to enable 24 samples to be run simultaneously on one Illumina Hiseq 2500 lane in rapid mode. Information on ER, PR, HER2 and Ki-67 as well as histological grade was collected from medical records.

To estimate prediction performance in the case of penalized regression models, a nested cross-validation procedure was implemented allowing for unbiased estimation of prediction performance while also optimizing model parameters empirically. Optimization of the amount of penalization (<italic>lambda</italic>) in each elastic net model was optimised in the inner cross-validation, using only the training data from the outer cross-validation.

ER and PR status were for most individuals assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), classifying tumors that showed staining in 10% or more cells as positive. For a subset of the older samples the radioimmunoassay was used to assess ER and PR status, classifying tumors that had &#x0003e;0.05&#x02009;fmol/ug DNA as positive. A tumor was classified as HER2 positive if fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) showed amplification or, in the absence of FISH results, if the sample was graded 3+ by HER2 IHC. FISH was routinely carried out for tumors with &#x0003e;2+ HER2 score determined by IHC. Ki-67 was assessed by IHC and medical records report Ki-67 either as &#x0201c;high&#x0201d;/&#x0201c;low&#x0201d; or as a percent value (% positively stained cells).

Technical reproducibility was high (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 2</xref>). Results indicate that prediction of the conventional IHC-based markers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> can be achieved with high accuracy; Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) was estimated to 0.95 for ER (95% CI:0.93&#x02013;0.96), 0.93 for PR (95%CI:0.92&#x02013;0.94) and 0.97 for HER2 (95%CI:0.97&#x02013;0.98) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A&#x02013;C</xref>).

AUC estimates for ER, PR and HER2 status were replicated in the TCGA data set; clinical Ki-67 status was not available for analysis. AUC estimates in the TCGA study were similar to those in the ClinSeq study; 0.97 for ER (95%CI:0.95&#x02013;0.98), 0.92 for PR (95%CI:0.90&#x02013;0.95) and 0.92 for HER2 (95%CI:0.89&#x02013;0.96).

In this context AUC values &#x0003e;0.9 is to be considered as high and indicative of good prediction performance. In our analyses, AUC values were estimated at &#x02265;0.95 for several of the markers, indicating high prediction performance in general for these markers using RNAseq profiling.</p><p>ER and HER2 status have direct implications on the choice of adjuvant treatment. Therefore we have investigated a set of individuals with material available for re-examination and where sequencing-based ER or HER2 status differed from the clinical status (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). ER status was discordant between RNAseq-based calls and clinical ER status in 17 individuals (5.5%). 10 (out of 17) have undergone pathological re-examination where six of ten individuals (60%) were reclassified and concordant with RNAseq-based calls after re-examination (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>), indicating that these discordant cases might have been misclassified initially or had an intermediate phenotype. HER2 status was discordant between RNAseq-based calls and clinical HER2 status in eight individuals (2.6%). Out of these, six individuals have undergone pathological re-examination and two out of six individuals (33%) were reclassified compared to initial pathological examination (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Using the CNV profile (low pass whole-genome sequencing), we investigated the copy number status of <italic>ERBB2</italic> (HER2) for discordant individuals classified as negative by the RNAseq model but positive by IHC/FISH. The CNV data indicate low-grade (ratio close to two) amplifications of the <italic>ERBB2</italic> (HER2) locus on chromosome 17 for these individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Figs 3&#x02013;8</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Transcriptomic tumor grade</title><p>With the aim of improving stratification of patients by tumor grade, we applied a RNAseq-based multivariate prediction model to classify tumors into &#x02018;high&#x02019; and &#x02018;low&#x02019; transcriptomic grade (TG), corresponding to NHG 1 and 3. The model could classify grade 1 and grade 3 tumors with high accuracy (ROC-AUC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.98, 95% CI:0.97&#x02013;0.98, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>), indicating that the RNAseq based transcriptomic grade model can be utilized to correctly distinguish between histological grade 1 and grade 3 tumors. TG classification performance was replicated in the TCGA data set, confirming good classification performance (ROC-AUC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.94, 95% CI:0.91&#x02013;0.97), but lower than in the ClinSeq study (DeLong&#x02019;s-test<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, p-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.008).

We observed no significant difference in subtype distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>) between high TG (TG High) and histological grade 3 (HG 3) (Fisher&#x02019;s exact text, p-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.85), and not between low TG (TG Low) and histological grade 1 (HG 1) (Fisher&#x02019;s exact text, p-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.86). This indicate that on a molecular subtype level the HG 1 and TG Low groups are similar, and the HG 3 and TG High groups are similar, suggesting the the TG model stratify patients in a way that is consistent with histological grade. We also found that histological grade 2 tumors (HG 2) that were reclassified as low TG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>, HG2 &#x00026; TG Low) had highly similar subtype distribution as histological grade 1 (HG 1), both dominated by Luminal A subtype, indicating that these reclassified tumors resembles the group of HG 1 tumors, suggesting that these reclassified HG 2 tumors on a molecular subtype level resembles the HG 1 group. Similarly, histological grade 2 tumors (HG 2) reclassified as high TG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>, HG2 &#x00026; TG High) had a similar subtype distribution as histological grade 3 (HG 3), with a minority of Luminal A and domination of Luminal B and Her2 subtypes (we note that the HG2 &#x00026; TG High group has no presence of Basal-like subtype tumors since no Basal-like subtype tumors were initially present in the HG 2 group), again confirming that the TG model stratify patients in such a way that the distribution on the molecular subtype level is similar to histological grade. Next, we assessed the distribution of the clinical proliferation marker Ki-67 across histological grades and transcriptomic grades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D</xref>). We found that low TG and histological grade 1 displayed similar Ki-67 score distributions, albeit with a small but significant difference in mean scores (two-sided t-test, p-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.004). High TG and histological grade 3 displayed similar Ki-67 scores distribution, with no significant difference in mean scores (two-sided t-test, p-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.81). Altogether, these results suggest that the TG model has the potential to provide means for improved stratification of breast cancer patients by enabling a molecularly consistent reclassification of HG 2 patients into TG low and TG high.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Somatic mutations in ERBB2 (HER2)</title><p>Next, we evaluated to what extent somatic mutations in <italic>ERBB2</italic> were present and detectable.

We utilized panel DNA sequencing to ascertain mutations in ERBB2. In our study, five patients harbored somatic alterations in <italic>ERBB2</italic>(HER2), all at different positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>).

Out of these 162 patients, 107 (35%) harbored SNV or small indel alterations and 72 (23%) CNV alterations, indicating the relevance of profiling both somatic mutations as well as establishing a CNV profile. The most frequent actionable alteration is mutation in <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, for which three types of therapies are under clinical investigation in &#x0201c;early phase studies&#x0201d; (PI3K pathway inhibitors, PI3K alpha inhibitors and AKT inhibitors), and one in a &#x0201c;late phase study&#x0201d; (combination of everolimus, trastuzumab, chemotherapy for HER2-positive patients). Further, <italic>FGF3</italic> and <italic>FGF4</italic> amplification was detected in 42 patients with a perfect overlap. These genes both reside within 10 000 bases, next to each other on chromosome 11, explaining the co-occurrence. These patients could potentially benefit from dovitinib<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, although current evidence of efficacy is restricted to hormone-receptor positive disease. One &#x0201c;late phase&#x0201d; breast cancer study, according to Dienstmann <italic>et al</italic>., showed an increased pathological complete response in the neoadjuvant setting when treating HER2-positive patients also harboring an amplification of <italic>TOP2A</italic> with anthracyclines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. In our ClinSeq study, nine HER2-positive patients harbored amplification in <italic>TOP2A</italic>. Another &#x0201c;late phase&#x0201d; breast cancer study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, showed HER2-positive patients with a hyperactive PI3K pathway, defined by somatic mutations in <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, to benefit from the addition of everolimus to their therapy regimen. In the present study, seven HER2-positive patients had somatic mutations in <italic>PIK3CA</italic>. The great majority of patients with actionable mutations in our Clinseq study had alterations in genes matching breast cancer studies in early phase, 146 (48%), while 16 (5%) were matched with studies in late phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>). If all cancers in the Dienstmann knowledge base were considered, 96 (31%) patients had alterations in genes matching early phase studies, 120 (39%) late phase studie, and 10 (3%) were approved therapies for other cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 9</xref>). DNA sequencing enabled us to detect 162 patients (53%) harboring potentially actionable genetic alterations, indicating a broad potential for providing added value through sequencing-based diagnostics in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Sequencing-based diagnostics is currently being broadly introduced in the clinical setting as a tool to screen for potentially actionable mutations in patients with metastatic disease. It is expected that sequencing-based diagnostics also will be implemented in the diagnostic, non-metastatic setting, assuming it performs at least as good as current routine diagnostics and provides some added value, while also remaining cost efficient. Provided the continuous reduction in sequencing costs over time, sequencing-based diagnostics is expected to be cost efficient in the near future, and may even provide a more cost effective alternative than current routine diagnostics eventually. The goal with this study was to explore if a DNA- and RNA-based sequencing profile could fulfill these criteria, with a focus on ascertaining to what extent sequencing-based diagnostics can be applied as an alternative to current routine diagnostics and to what extent added value is generated.</p><p>First, we demonstrated that RNAseq-based models could predict ER, PR and HER2 status in high concordance with routine clinical markers, indicating that RNAseq-based molecular characterization of these biomarkers has the potential to be translated to the clinic in the future. The great benefit of sequence-based breast cancer diagnostics is, however, in providing an improved transcriptomic grade model that stratify patients into two distinct groups, and in providing information on additional targetable somatic alterations and information on somatic alterations affecting drug metabolism, which may be of importance for dosing the patient correctly or avoiding certain compounds. Together these are substantial advantages compared with standard histological management. The main benefits and potential of sequencing-based diagnostics are dependent upon implementing and utilizing a wider range of molecular phenotypes (e.g. subtypes, transcriptomic grade, somatic mutations) in the clinical setting, while we see little benefit in implementing sequencing-based molecular profiling to merely determine the status of current generation routine markers (e.g. ER, PR, HER2), which are currently assayed cost effectively using e.g. immunohistochemistry.</p><p>The sequencing-based diagnostic approach also provides multiple other advantages in that it is quantitative, highly reproducible, objective and amenable to automation. In contrast, routine histopathology is semi-quantitative and dependent on subjective human interpretation. Classification of ER, PR and HER2 status based on gene expression (qRT-PCR) has previously been assessed with estimated ROC-AUC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> in similar range to that observed here, suggesting that irrespective of technology platform (qRT-PCR or RNAseq), classification of receptor status from gene expression profiling provides highly concordant results compared with routine biomarkers.</p><p>Histopathological re-examination of a subset of tumors that were discordant in ER or HER2 status between routine biomarkers and sequencing-based diagnostics revealed that a majority (6/10) of discordant ER individuals were reclassified so that ER status became concordant after reclassification. In the case of HER2 discordant individuals, two out of six of discordant and re-examined cases were reclassified during reexamination. The CNV profile for HER2 discordant individuals revealed that those classified as HER2 negative by RNAseq, while positive by IHC/FISH, all had low-grade amplifications of chromosome 17 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Figs 3&#x02013;8</xref>), as determined by low-pass whole genome DNA sequencing. The efficacy of trastuzumab in breast cancer with low-grade amplification of <italic>ERBB2</italic> is currently being evaluated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. In one of the HER2 discordant individuals, the laterality of the profiled tumor could not be uniquely matched with the clinical information, which might explain discordance in this patient. Furthermore, the re-examination was not fully blinded and the number of re-examined tumors was limited, therefore these results should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>Histological grade is routinely used for patient stratification, particularly to inform treatment decisions regarding adjuvant chemotherapy. We utilized RNAseq data and multivariate modeling to stratify patients into low and high transcriptomic grade, and demonstrated a high concordance for classification of histological grade 1 and grade 3 individuals. The similarities in subtype and Ki-67 distributions indicate that the TG model stratified patients into two groups with highly similar characteristics compared to histological grade 1 and 3. Histological grade 2 is considered an intermediary group, which does not provide clinically actionable information<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. We were able to re-classify histological grade 2 tumors into low and high transcriptomic grade, illustrating how transcriptomic grade can add clinically useful information for the group of patients classified as histological grade 2. A similar approach has also been proposed previously based on gene-expression data from microarrays<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>.</p><p>DNA sequencing was applied to detect somatic mutations and copy number alterations in key genes, including <italic>ERBB2</italic>(HER2) and <italic>BRCA1/2,</italic> and to assess the proportion of patients in the present study that harbored somatic alterations that may be clinically actionable in the future, as defined by ongoing or concluded clinical breast cancer trials. DNA sequencing allowed detection of somatic mutations in <italic>ERBB2</italic>(HER2) that may warrant targeted treatment. <italic>ERBB2</italic> activating mutations may result in constitutive activation rather than increased expression levels. Therefore, the molecular subtype calls may not identify tumors that are driven by <italic>ERBB2</italic>(HER2) signaling. We also investigated <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutation status. Knowledge of <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> germline status could impact the choice of primary surgery. If a patient is a carrier then more radical surgery, and perhaps preventive surgery of the unaffected breast, are potential options. Furthermore, patients with mutations in the BRCA genes are candidates to be included in studies evaluating PARP-inhibitors in the adjuvant setting. BRCA-screening provides additional benefits in providing opportunity to refer carriers to genetic counseling.</p><p>In this study 25 patients (8.1%) were reclassified in respect to ER and HER2 status by RNA-sequencing-based diagnostics. These patients might have benefited from an alternative treatment. Lacking a suitable &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; reference it is not possible to determine if sequencing-based classification provides more accurate results in this case. However, it has previously been reported that gene expression-based diagnostics is more prognostic than routine biomarkers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Sequencing-based molecular profiling also provides a richer source of molecular data, and therefore has the potential resolve some ambiguous cases emerging in the current routine pathology setting, for example by allowing HER2 status to be determined by both RNA-sequencing and CNV profiling, and by utilizing multivariate biomarker panels for determining molecular subtypes (e.g. 50 genes in the PAM50 panel) rather then depending single markers (e.g. ER, PR, HER2) as is the case in traditional routine diagnostics. In this study 17 patients (5.5%) had somatic <italic>ERBB2</italic>(HER2) activating mutations, BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations detected by panel DNA sequencing, which could impact on treatment. Further 162 patients (53%) had mutations or copy number alterations detected by DNA sequencing, which were specified in ongoing or concluded breast cancer clinical trials, indicating potential future benefit of sequencing-based diagnostics in a large proportion of patients. In addition to actionable somatic alterations, molecular subtyping and improvement in tumor grading systems has the potential to provide benefits for even larger groups of patients in the future.</p><p>The present study has some limitations; Firstly, the study is based on retrospective biobanked material and results have only been replicated in a single external study, consequently the results should be validated in a prospective setting prior to clinical implementation. Secondly, the study is not fully representative for the smallest sized tumors, as few small tumors were available for biobanking. However, we do not expect this to impact the interpretation of our results since the focus was on assessing concordance between routine diagnostic biomarkers and sequencing-based diagnostics. In this study a 10% cutoff for positive ER status was applied, in contrast to the 1% cutoff recommended in current ASCO-CAP guidelines, as there is currently lack of prospective randomized studies demonstrating benefits of a 1% cutoff. However, it has been reported that very few ER positive patients have &#x0003c;10% of cells staining positive<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, suggesting that the actual impact of a different cutoff &#x0003c;10% is expected to be minor. Among the main benefits of sequencing-based diagnostics is the ability to detect germline alterations affecting drug metabolism, for example in the Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase gene (<italic>DPYD</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. In future clinical implementations it would be highly relevant to ensure inclusion of additional relevant <italic>DPYD</italic> variants as well as other clinically relevant pharmacogenomics loci. The present study was based on fresh frozen (FF) tumor tissue, while formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) material is standard in the routine clinical setting. Although there are quality differences FFPE and FF material, multiple publications demonstrate preserved gene expression profiles between FFPE and FF tissues, either by sequencing or other orthogonal technologies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. In practice, another alternative is to use preservatives, such as RNAlater to enable high quality RNA profiles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>.</p><p>Our results revealed that breast cancer classification by sequencing-based molecular profiling is highly concordant with current routine diagnostic biomarkers and therefore has the potential to replace current generation routine biomarker assays in the clinic in the near future for a majority of patients. Sequencing-based molecular characterization also provides additional molecular information with implication on the choice of therapy such as molecular subtype and detection of somatic mutations in key genes including <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>ERBB2</italic> (HER2). Furthermore RNA sequencing enabled us to dichotomize patients into high and low tumor grade, which has also previously been proposed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, but is not yet in clinical routine management. It is our intention to validate the results from this study through analysis of further 500 patients in a prospective study.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Rantalainen, M. <italic>et al</italic>.
