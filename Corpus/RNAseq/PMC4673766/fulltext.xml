However, it is susceptible to early-season cold stress (12&#x02013;15&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) which limits stand-establishment and seedling growth. To gain further insights on the molecular mechanism of cold tolerance in sorghum we performed transcriptome profiling between known cold sensitive and tolerant sorghum lines using RNA sequencing technology under control and cold stress treatments.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here we report on the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between contrasting sorghum genotypes, HongkeZi (cold tolerant) and BTx623 (cold sensitive) under cool and control temperatures using RNAseq approach to elucidate the molecular basis of sorghum response to cold stress. Furthermore, we validated bi-allelic variants in the form of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) between the cold susceptible and tolerant lines of sorghum. An analysis of transcriptome profile showed that in response to cold, a total of 1910 DEGs were detected under cold and control temperatures in both genotypes. We identified a subset of genes under cold stress for downstream analysis, including transcription factors that exhibit differential abundance between the sensitive and tolerant genotypes. We identified transcription factors including Dehydration-responsive element-binding factors, C-repeat binding factors, and Ethylene responsive transcription factors as significantly upregulated during cold stress in cold tolerant HKZ. Additionally, specific genes such as plant cytochromes, glutathione s-transferases, and heat shock proteins were found differentially regulated under cold stress between cold tolerant and susceptible genotype of sorghum. A total of 41,603 SNP were identified between the cold sensitive and tolerant genotypes with minimum read of four. Approximately 89&#x000a0;% of the 114 SNP sites selected for evaluation were validated using endpoint genotyping technology.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A new strategy which involved an integrated analysis of differential gene expression and identification of bi-allelic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was conducted to determine and analyze differentially expressed genes and variation involved in cold stress response of sorghum. The results gathered provide an insight into the complex mechanisms associated with cold response in sorghum, which involve an array of transcription factors and genes which were previously related to abiotic stress response. This study also offers resource for gene based SNP that can be applied towards targeted genomic studies of cold tolerance in sorghum and other cereal crops.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12864-015-2268-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cold stress</kwd><kwd>Sorghum</kwd><kwd>Transcriptome profiling</kwd><kwd>RNAseq</kwd><kwd>Single nucleotide polymorphism</kwd><kwd>Gene based variants</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>US Sorghum Checkoff Program</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>US Sorghum Checkoff Program</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p><italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic> (L.) Moench is a warm season species known for its drought tolerance and adaptation to high temperature but is susceptible to adverse effects of low temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Sorghum originated in the semi-arid tropics and is generally sensitive to low-temperature stress and suffers cold injury when subjected to nonfreezing temperatures below 12&#x02013;15&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Low-temperature-induced inhibition of germination and emergence in the field followed by stunted growth is a manifestation of cold susceptibility problem in sorghum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The inability to germinate prevents seedling emergence, resulting in poor stands, and subsequent growth of seedlings is hampered by cool air temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Field evaluations for cold tolerance require multi-environment or multi-year testing as presence of genotype x environment interactions complicates the interpretations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Growth chamber assays for germination or vigor testing have been used to discriminate weak lines before planting and have been useful in quantifying cold tolerance in sorghum lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], but needs to be verified under field conditions as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Genetic variability for cold tolerance have been reported and identified within sorghum germplasm pools. Sources of cold tolerance are landraces that have evolved in the temperate regions of China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and have exhibited higher seedling emergence and improved seedling vigor under cool conditions compared to select US hybrids and elite inbreds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Dissecting the cold tolerance traits in these landraces would be highly beneficial to efforts of transferring tolerance traits into the elite germplasms by backcrossing. To identify the genome loci associated with cold tolerance, QTL studies for cold germinability and seedling vigor have been carried out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Molecular markers such as SSRs have been utilized for identification of QTLs for cold tolerance. However, there is still scant information that will provide an understanding of cold response and tolerance in sorghum as compared to other warm season crops like rice.</p><p>As early-season cold tolerance is a complex trait, it is important to explore the overall dynamics of gene expression and transcriptome during cold stress to facilitate an understanding of response to cold stress. The effects of low temperature stress at the molecular level through genome-wide gene expression analysis were reported in other warm season cereal crops such as rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], but have not been applied to sorghum. The use of advance genomic sequencing approach to examine tolerance mechanisms to cold stress in sorghum could facilitate better understanding of the molecular genetic basis and be an effective complement to enhance overall sorghum stress tolerance.</p><p>Recently, the use of next generation sequencing approaches such as RNAseq technology was proven highly valuable in expanding molecular genetic studies as it could be applied simultaneously to generate the bi-allelic variant information. The large amounts of sequence information from next generation sequencing technologies can be annotated to examine the role of specific transcripts under abiotic stress. Transcriptome profiling using sequencing technologies have been performed in sorghum under nitrogen stress, and osmotic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and combined heat and drought stresses. These studies provided information on specific genes involved in defense mechanism against specific abiotic challenges. However, there is scarce information on transcriptome profiling for sorghum cold stress analysis and the identification of SNPs and variants that could regulate complex traits such as cold tolerance. The SNPs obtained from these studies could be further utilized in performing the QTL studies, facilitating to target the genic marker controlling the trait.</p><p>There is critical need to learn more about cold tolerance mechanism as new areas for sorghum cultivation in cooler northern latitudes are expanding. Generating gene-specific SNPs between the cold tolerant and susceptible sorghum genotypes would help in targeting loci which influences the traits directly and will aid in expediting breeding for cold tolerance. The objectives of this study were (a) to determine variation/changes in gene expression between cold tolerant and sensitive sorghums, (b) to identify and validate genic SNPs between cold tolerant and sensitive and (c) to generate a new genetic resource of genic SNPs that can be used as markers for cold stress QTL studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Variation for cold tolerance response of sorghum genotypes and transcriptome profiling approach</title><p>Sorghum germplasm BTx623 and HKZ were previously selected based on the 72&#x000a0;h cold germ test, field emergence and seedling vigor (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). HKZ genotype exhibited higher germination and greater than 60&#x000a0;% field stand under field conditions during cool early season sowing compared to BTx623.

To compare differential expression patterns among four libraries (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), we normalized the tag distribution for gene expression level in each library to come up with an effective library size and subsequently extracted the differentially expressed transcripts using the criterion <italic>p</italic> value &#x02264;0.05 and log2 fold-change &#x02265;2 using edgeR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] according to the user manual. This provided an empirical approach and eliminated the bias introduced by RNA composition. For the four libraries developed, our comparative analysis showed that a range of 625&#x02013;1033 transcripts displayed significant change in expression based on abundance. Specifically, the differential expression patterns among libraries revealed that about 625 transcripts showed significant changes for BTx623 between 14 and 28&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.

Notably, a transcription factor previously reported to be associated with cold-stress, Ethylene responsive transcription factor (ERF) also exhibited high abundance in the tolerant genotype under cold stress.

Transcription factors represent ideal targets for traditional or genetic engineering-assisted breeding of plants with specific traits related to stress tolerance. In particular, ERF transcripts are among the most interesting TFs because they have been selected through evolution to regulate a series of stress-response pathways.</p><p>We also observed that <italic>Sb06g001030</italic> (P450 CYP99A1), <italic>Sb02g040500</italic> (P450 CYP709C1), annotated as plant cytochrome like transcripts were relatively abundant in the tolerant lines under cold stress indicating possible involvement in defense mechanism (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Plant cytochromes P450s catalyze oxidation of a wide range of chemical reactions by activating dioxygen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and were reported to play an important role in response to stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. P450s (CYPs) are ubiquitously distributed and are involved in the biosynthesis of plant hormones and secondary metabolites, and CYPs accumulate in response to cold stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>We also observed that <italic>Sb03g027330</italic> gene was highly abundant in both genotypes under stress and <italic>Sb03g028470,</italic> another heat shock transcription factor transcript was relatively abundant in the susceptible genotype only under stress (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This relative abundance of HSFs and HSPs under cold stress could suggest a mid-point involvement in cold stress response between multiple stress pathways similar to observations made by Swindell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and indicate that HSFs could have other functional features apart from heat shock responses. A number of studies indicated that heat shock proteins (HSPs) and transcription factors (HSFs) are involved in cellular response to various forms of stress besides heat. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and other plant species, various Hsps have been induced by low temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], osmotic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and salinity stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>Notably, the transcript encoding Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) were also abundant in BTx623 under cold stress (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) have functions in detoxification of various xenobiotic compounds and oxygen radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Their roles in these biochemical pathways make them useful markers in the detection of stress in plant metabolism. An increased production of reactive oxygen species is a common consequence in plants under abiotic stresses, which usually damage cellular membranes and other cellular components resulting in oxidative stress and eventually cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. It is likely that a high abundance of GSTs may protect sorghum cells from oxidative stress that is prominent in cold sensitive genotypes.</p><p>The whole genome identification of SNPs for a number of sorghum genotypes was performed previously using whole genome re-sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] or RADSeq technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Here we report that sequencing of transcriptome was useful in identification of a large number of genic SNPs. Genic SNPs and variations in structural genes are important as they have been documented as underlying genetic basis for many important agronomic traits. As an example,variation underlying an actual QTL controlling cold tolerance in the form low temperature germinability in rice was identified to be due to variation in a transcript that cause tissue weakening that allows protrusion of coleoptile during germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The number of SNPs that distinguished the two contrasting sorghum genotypes studied here suggests the strong potential of genic-SNPs for use as genetic markers for QTL or genome wide association studies. We suggest that the use of genic SNPs could be advantageous over conventional markers SSRs, RFLPs and RAPDs for targeting the loci controlling the complex traits such as cold, drought or salt stress by directly pointing to specific genes. From sequencing cDNA libraries of two contrasting parents we could identify ~41,000 SNPs that can aid in generating a new genetic resource for the sorghum community. The SNPs selected for validation indicated that the approach of sequencing cDNA would be beneficial for generating new set of DNA markers in sorghum. The SNP markers developed between the two contrasting genotypes for cold tolerance could be beneficial for identifying QTLs in early-season cold tolerance of sorghum.</p><p>The complex inheritance of abiotic-stress traits limits the genetic modification of plants based on a single gene to achieve satisfactory level of tolerance. Therefore an understanding of the molecular mechanisms of plant responses to different stresses is critical for manipulation of associated pathways that can enhance abiotic stress tolerance. Here we showed that the information from transcriptome profiling can useful as basis for characterization of germplasm exhibiting cold tolerance traits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Identification of common DEG transcripts between sorghum genotypes with contrasting stress tolerance would facilitate a better understanding of the genetic bases of cold tolerance. Here, Illumina RNAseq analysis demonstrated that gene transcripts involved in abiotic stress response, and defense mechanism were regulated in both tolerant and sensitive lines. Transcripts with higher expression could be useful as a biomarker for selection of tolerant/sensitive genotypes under cold stress conditions. The DEGs from tolerant genotypes would be the potential candidates to study further for improving cold tolerance of sorghum and related cereals. Finally, this study took advantage of the bi-allelic variation observed between the genotypes which were translated and validated into easy to use and accessible gene-based SNP markers for downstream genetic analysis of cold stress tolerance in sorghum.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Plant materials and cold treatment</title><p>Two sorghum germplasm, (BTx623 and HongKeZi), with contrasting response to cold stress under controlled and field conditions were used in the study.

The number of reads in genes was counted and then, the edgeR package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] with TMM normalization method was used to align expression values to a common scale. The fragments per kilo base per million (FPKM) values were also calculated for all the genes and considered as the expression level. The resulting expression values were log2-transformed.

The cutoff of log2-fold value &#x02265;2 (4-fold absolute value) and adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c;0.001 (FDR) were used for determining significant DEG transcripts. Pair-wise comparisons among the four libraries were conducted by comparing the sequenced samples to find common DEG transcripts across all genotypes.
