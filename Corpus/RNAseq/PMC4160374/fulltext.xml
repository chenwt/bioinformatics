Here we used standardized RNA samples with built-in controls to examine sources of error in large-scale RNA-seq studies and their impact on the detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Analysis of variations in guanine-cytosine content, gene coverage, sequencing error rate and insert size allowed identification of methods that produce more false positives or are less reproducible across sites. Moreover, commonly used methods fornormalization (cqn, EDASeq, RUV2, sva, PEER) varied in their ability to remove these systematic biases, depending on sample complexity and initial data quality. Normalization methods that combine data from genes across sites are strongly recommended to identify and remove site-specific effects, and can substantially improve RNA-seq studies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">The deep sampling capabilities and single-base resolution of RNA-seq have led to its adoption for a variety of studies of the transcriptome, which include many inter-site and large-scale studies such as the ENCODE Project, GEUVADIS, GTEx, the Epigenomics Roadmap, the human Brainspan Project and the Nonhuman Primate Reference Transcriptome Resource. However, it is notable that RNA-seq, just like microarrays, has taken many years to emerge as a trusted and established method, as experiments can suffer from lack of principled experimental design, poor sample quality, inconsistent library preparation or platform-specific measurement biases<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Indeed, when microarrays started being used to identify biomarkers for drug toxicity and disease, the FDA recognized that an effort was needed to assure data quality and inter-site and inter-platform reproducibility, and to this end established the MicroArray Quality Consortium (MAQC)<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Through the MAQC, experimental standards and control RNA samples were developed, along with quality assurance guidelines and standardized microarray procedures<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Standards were also developed for data repositories (the Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment, MIAME)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, along with robust methods for analyzing microarray experiments from multiple sources<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. These and other efforts have enabled the exploitation of the large publicly available microarray datasets and the subsequent deduction of important biological and clinical insights<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">The success of MAQC motivated the development of similar guidelines and standards for high-throughput sequencing<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, in particular for RNA-seq<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, which led to the creation of the FDA Sequencing Quality Control (SEQC) Consortium and the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities (ABRF) studies on Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). Previous large-scale RNA-seq studies have focused on the variation between lanes and flowcells<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, and considerable progress has been made on reducing batch effects by normalizing GC content bias, fragment bias and the biases of isolation procedures<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. So far, several RNA-seq data quality metrics have been developed<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, and surrogate variable analysis (sva)<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> has been applied to RNA-seq and microarray data from individual laboratories to improve expression measures<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Recently, a thorough, cross-site examination of Illumina RNA-seq data<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> demonstrated that &#x0201c;laboratory effects&#x0201d; strongly affect GC content and insert size of prepared RNA-Seq libraries, and a method proposed to correct for them, Probabilistic Estimation of Expression Residuals (PEER)<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, was able to reduce artifacts without adversely impacting the detection of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs).</p><p id="P4">Yet, to date, there has been no systematic examination of the impact of site-specific bias in detecting differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which is often the primary goal of an RNA-seq experiment. Moreover, there are various proposed means by which to correct for such biases, but the performance of several competing methods has not been systematically characterized. Here we used the controlled experimental design of the standardized SEQC/ABRF samples to test intra- and inter-site reproducibility, sensitivity and specificity of RNA-seq for pairwise comparisons of samples with varying complexity, representative of different experimental scenarios. We benchmarked two different sequencing platforms (Life Technologies Personal Genome Machine (PGM) and Illumina HiSeq2000) across twenty laboratory sites, and assessed a variety of methods for data normalization and bias removal (cqn<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, EDASeq<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, RUV2<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, sva<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and PEER<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>). To our knowledge, our work represents the first cross-platform evaluation of methods for assessing RNA-seq quality and removing variance from data for multi-site, multi-platform reproducibility, which is a prerequisite for reliable conclusions and the integration of measurements and experiments from different laboratories. Finally, this work shows that, although bias-correlation methods can be successful at improving data quality, there is a wide range of impact on the detection of DEGs, for which correction methods often make a tradeoff between accuracy and reproducibility.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="S1"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Experimental data comparing intra- and inter-site variation</title><p id="P5">The experimental design of the main SEQC and ABRF studies are described in detail elsewhere<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Briefly, four RNA samples were provided by the FDA SEQC consortium, A (cancer cell lines), B (brain) and two titrated mixtures of A:B (C and D). Samples C and D represent mixtures of samples A and B at the defined ratios of 3:1 and 1:3, respectively, and thus hold &#x0201c;built-in truths&#x0201d; of sample mixing ratios. These were sequenced and analyzed by over twenty laboratories and a total of six sequencing platforms. Here we use two RNA-seq platforms from the SEQC/ABRF studies where we had library preparation replicates of each sample at every site: Illumina's HiSeq2000 and Life Technologies PGM. For Illumina, each sample was distributed from a single source to six different primary test sites (ILM1&#x02013;6) and prepared in quadruplicate at those sites. A fifth library for each sample, prepared at an independent seventh site, was also distributed and sequenced at three test sites (ILM2,3,5). Samples were barcoded and pooled together prior to sequencing in order to assess lane and batch effects<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, and were then paired-end sequenced (2 &#x000d7; 100) on two flowcells using Illumina's HiSeq2000 platform. For the PGM platform, samples were prepared in duplicate at three sites and sequenced on three 318 chips at each site. We first focus on the results from the Illumina platform.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Identical inter-site replicates show high rates of false positives</title><p id="P6">Ideally, expression values generated from identical samples at different sites should show little (and random) variation across sites. Thus, we can compare each sample to itself across the six test sites by pairwise calling of all differentially expressed genes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) to generate an empirical measure of the false positive rate for all four samples (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>)&#x02014;that is, all DEG calls represent false positives. However, we observed many differentially expressed genes at varied fold-change (FC, 1.5&#x02013;2.0) and false-discovery rate thresholds (FDR, 0.05&#x02013;0.001) using the limma-voom package. At the most lenient FC (1.5) and FDR (0.05), the number of false positive DEGs detected was as high as 9,602 (mean = 2,823, S.D. = 3,527, including both changes up and down), or &#x0223c;20% of all genes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). As the stringency of the FC and FDR thresholds increased, the number of false positive DEGs decreased; although even at fairly stringent thresholds (FC &#x0003e;2.0 and FDR &#x0003c;0.001), the number of DEGs detected was still as high as 3,135 (mean = 739, S.D. = 1,089), representing up to 8% of all genes. When we examined the inter-site DEG false positive rates for several other analysis pipelines (WHAM<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>, Mapsplice<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>, Novoalign<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>, Cufflinks<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> and HTSeq<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>) we found similarly high false positive rates, regardless of the analysis pipeline or read alignment methods used (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To remove these false positives, we tested several established methods for normalization of RNA-seq data (cqn<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, EDASeq<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, RUV2<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, sva<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and PEER<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>) and we observed highly variable results. Some methods (specifically sva and PEER) that leveraged all data across all sites were quite successful at ameliorating the high rate of false positives (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), removing 85.1% to 87.7% of the original total false positive DEGs. The application of RUV2 with ERCC spike-ins (RUV2-ERCC), which tries to remove confounding factors based on a control set of synthetic RNAs assessed across sites, on average removes just 20% of false positives on average, but is more effective for sites that already have relatively low false positive rates (ILM4, ILM5). Notably, neither applying GC bias correction tools (cqn<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and EDASeq<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>) to individual sites nor changing read counts to only use 3&#x02032;-UTRs was effective at decreasing the number of inter-site false positive DEGs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>); in most cases, these methods actually increased the number of false positives.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Inter-site DEG reproducibility varies by site and sample</title><p id="P8">However, any method for improving the false positive rate for DEG detection (A vs. A) needs to also be examined in the context of the true positives (validated DEGs), and we sought to determine the pre-normalization relationship between false positive DEGs, true positives and sites with high false positives (e.g. ILM3). We examined the repeatability and reproducibility of gene expression measures between the different samples with varying levels of complexity (A vs. B, and their 3:1 and 1:3 titrations of C and D). We used several analyses to establish the inter-site accuracy of DEG detection: the correlation of measured gene expression profiles, DEG detection within and across sites, and DEG detection vis-&#x000e0;-vis independent Taqman data from 779 genes querying the exact same RNA samples.</p><p id="P9">First, the intra-site and inter-site Pearson correlation coefficients (R<sup>2</sup>) were all above 0.95 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>), and Q-Q plots of the&#x000a0;gene expression values from different sites indicated that all sites had similar distributions that clustered together (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs. 5&#x02013;8</xref>). Thus, simply calculating R<sup>2</sup> values of genes' expression measures and showing that samples cluster together merely shows the tendency of expression values to track each other; these high correlation coefficients mask the 8&#x02013;20% false positive rate described above<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">Second, we examined, at each site, the differentially expressed genes for every possible pairwise comparison of samples. All six sites found similar numbers of DEGs (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>), and the Spearman rank correlation of <italic>p</italic>-values showed that the inter-site rank agreement was very high for the common DEGs shared by all 6 sites, with a median correlation greater than 0.96 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 10a&#x02013;c</xref>). However, when we examined the complete list of DEGs found at each site (instead of just those DEGs common across sites), we found much lower correlations, ranging from 0.55&#x02013;0.95 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). As expected, one site (ILM3) always showed the lowest Spearman correlation of <italic>p</italic>-values (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig/ 2a</xref>), co-incident with an increase in site-specific DEGs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Finally, to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of DEG detection from RNA-seq data at each test site, we calculated the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>, with the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) based on the Taqman data set (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). Scatter plots for pairwise comparisons across all sites and samples revealed good overall correlation between RNA-seq data and TaqMan data at the gene level (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 12a</xref>, with mean R<sup>2</sup> = 0.729). However, the similarity of the TaqMan and RNA-seq data was improved for all comparisons when using the exact TaqMan primer's coordinates on the transcriptome to quantify RNA-seq expression rather than the combined read count across the entire gene (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 12b</xref>, mean R<sup>2</sup> increase of 0.14). Nonetheless, in all cases, the site detected as an outlier by our analysis of false positives (ILM3) showed the lowest R<sup>2</sup> and MCC with the TaqMan data (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). The DEGs detected from TaqMan were then compared to the DEGs obtained from RNA-seq using the limma-voom method. Each of the six cross-sample comparisons had very similar MCC, TPR and FPR (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>), and these measures also indicated lower agreement as the samples became more similar, as expected, with the biggest differences expected by design in comparisons of samples A and D, whereas conversely the mixture samples C and D were similar by design. Indeed, when applying a variety of information theoretic metrics (such as mutual information<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>), we observed a similar loss of reproducibility as samples become more similar.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Cross-site data normalization improves RNA-seq quality</title><p id="P12">Because false positives and true positives were both affected by site-specific noise, we next compared DEG detection performance across sites (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>) using five methods for RNA-seq normalization (EDAseq, cqn, RUV2, sva and PEER). We observed that EDASeq and PEER were the two top methods with the highest adjusted Spearman rank correlation of p-values between inter-site and intra-site DEG analysis (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). All methods yielded reduced inter-site reproducibility as samples become more similar, as expected. Using the common intra-site DEGs to validate inter-site DEGs showed that PEER consistently performed better, especially for the site with the largest bias (ILM3), where PEER successfully identified and compensated this bias, for every comparison (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 15</xref>). This was also true when measured by MCC (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 16a</xref>.</p><p id="P13">We then further measured the impact of these normalization methods on the intra-site and inter-site quantification of differential gene expression. We compared the RNA-seq intra-site DEGs with the independent TaqMan data, using MCC as the evaluation measure. Although most methods did not improve the accuracy of intra-site DEGs detection, we found that EDAseq gave the highest similarity to Taqman expression measures (with mean MCC = 0.939 and S.D. = 0.019, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 16b</xref>). This improvement was consistent across all pairwise comparisons and all test sites.Quality control metrics flag sources of error and poor data</p><p id="P14">These results indicated a need to further investigate the underlying sources of variance that lead to so many false positives or irreproducible DEGs. Sample QC metrics (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figs. 17,18</xref>) indicated that data from a single site was distinct compared to the others. First, a non-random nucleotide composition bias was seen at the beginning of the sequencing reads, concomitant with a distinct, narrow bell curve of GC-content for the IML3 site (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). Also, site ILM3 had an overall higher sequencing error rate compared to the other sites (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). We saw that both sample B (as a type) and ILM3 (as a site) had more reads near the 3&#x02032; end than the 5&#x02032; end of genes, indicating a shift in the coverage of the genes (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 18c</xref>). Coverage across the gene body was assessed using the coefficient of variation of the coverage across the length of the genes, and we saw that overall the ILM3 site had higher coefficients of variation (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 18c</xref>), thus demonstrating the value of a &#x02018;nucleotide composition metric&#x02019; (described below) for QC in RNA-seq for identifying unusual and potentially problematic measurements.</p><p id="P15">To test whether these sources of bias were site-dependent, we examined the fifth library of each sample (replicate 5, for samples A,B,C and D), which was prepared at an independent seventh site and then sequenced at three of the test sites. With this experimental design we can separate out sources of variation as either arising from the library preparation (including RNA isolation) or as arising from the sequencing itself. In the case of GC distribution, the fifth library from each sample did not exhibit an aberrant spike at 50% GC-content like replicates 1&#x02013;4 sequenced at the ILM3 site; it is likely that the aberrant spike is a result arising purely from sample preparation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a,b</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 18a</xref>), which confirms the primary source of variation put forward by both the GEUVADIS and SEQC Consortium comparisons of RNA-seq measurements.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup><xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarizes major sources of variation observed in our quality metrics as determined sequencing the fifth replicate libraries at sites ILM2, 3 and 5.</p><p id="P16">This control library was also able to reveal other features inherent to the sample preparation and sequencing. The fifth library replicate of each sample was always consistent in error rate with the other samples it was sequenced with, indicating that the sequencing error rate is indeed primarily a function of sequencing, and not affected by library preparation (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 18b</xref>). Plots of the uniformity of coverage across gene bodies showed that sample B, regardless of where it was prepared or sequenced, had more read coverage near the 3&#x02032; end than the 5&#x02032; end with respect to annotated gene models (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 18c</xref>), indicating that the stock of sample B prior to its distribution to each site may have been contaminated with something which would have caused it to have depleted 5&#x02032; ends before poly(A)+ selection (for example, RNase or cations). The remaining fifth libraries (A, C, D) had relatively uniform coverage when sequenced at ILM3, whereas the corresponding samples prepared at ILM3 did not, notably demonstrating that library preparation can exacerbate poor genebody coverage uniformity (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d,e</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 18c</xref>). Lastly, because the nucleotide composition metric (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 17</xref>) showed that the fifth library replicate had equal base composition regardless of sequencing site (#5, dashed lines), these data demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, that the nucleotide composition bias of RNA-seq data likely arises from library preparation alone.</p><p id="P17">Finally, we observed that the latent experimental factors determined by PEER and sva are highly correlated with QC metrics and properties, and that these factors were responsible for the majority of false positives in inter-site DEG analysis.

These additional metrics can, and should, be used for tracking samples that may suffer from high false positives and inherent sample noise.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="methods"><title>Cross-platform applicability of normalization methods</title><p id="P18">Finally, we sought to gauge the utility of these inter-site normalization methods across multiple platforms. We used PGM RNA-sequencing data from the ABRF-NGS consortium data (see methods), which used the same standardized RNA samples (A and B) as the SEQC consortium, and were prepared using the Life Technologies RNA Sequencing kit at three independent sites (PGM1&#x02013;3) with duplicate library preparations and sequenced using three Ion 318 chips. Sequencing reads were again aligned using the STAR<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> aligner and annotated using GenomicRanges<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> with Aceview<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> genes.</p><p id="P19">We first examined the GC content of the mapped reads from PGM data, and found that some replicates showed abnormal GC content distributions (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 20</xref>). Two libraries in particular had a much higher maximum spike in their GC-content (%GC) for their reads (&#x0003e;5.8%) in comparison to the rest of the libraries (mean 4.9%, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 21</xref>). The average base error rate (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 21b</xref>) was higher in PGM1 and PGM3 than in PGM2. We also observed for sample A, that replicate 4 from PGM1, replicate 2 from PGM2, and replicate 1 from PGM3, all had the lowest genebody coverage variation compared to other PGM data (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 21c</xref>). After the Trimmmed Mean of M-values (TMM)<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> and limma-voom normalization, we found that samples A and B were well distinguished by multidimensional scaling (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 21d</xref>), and that the two replicates with abnormal GC content distributions (PGM1.A.4 and PGM2.A.2) were separated from the other replicates of sample A at dimension 2.</p><p id="P20">We then examined the inter-site false positive DEGs for the PGM data, each with two replicates for sample A and B. With the lowest stringency thresholds (FDR: 0.05; FC: 1.5), there were on average 114 false positive DEGs (0.32%) using the original limma DEGs analysis (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 22a</xref>). Notably, applying PEER successfully removed almost all the false positive DEGs (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 22c</xref>). The responsible hidden variable identified by PEER was significantly correlated with GC content (<italic>p</italic> = 0.03). Using the common intra-site DEGs to validate the called inter-site DEGs, the MCC<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> showed that PEER also yields a higher accuracy than the original limmavoom method (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 22d,e</xref>), indicating that global data normalization analysis methods such as PEER can also be used to improve RNA-seq data across both Illumina and the PGM platforms.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S7"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P21">Utilizing the new benchmark data sets created by the SEQC Consortium and the ABRF-NGS Study on RNA-seq<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, we determined the relationship between the quality of a dataset indicated by a wide range of quality metrics and the results of differential gene expression (DEG) analysis of samples both within a site and across sites. We then rigorously tested a variety of commonly used statistical tools for RNA-seq data normalization (sva, RUV2, cqn, EDASeq, PEER) using multiple samples and metrics. Overall, the reproducibility of intra- and inter-site DEGs across all sites showed a higher correlation for comparisons between more biologically different samples (A versus B), and a lower reproducibility for more similar samples (A versus C, B versus D, C versus D), reflecting the expected greater challenge of reliably identifying smaller differences. Indeed, the unique study design allowed a <italic>reductio ad absurdum</italic> experiment, comparing replicates of the exact same sample across sites, where we notably still observed thousands of DEGs that were deemed statistically significant but clearly reflected technical differences between sites and not differences between the compared RNA-samples. The application of GC content bias correction packages including cqn<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and EDASeq<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> could not remove these false positives, likely because GC content bias is not the only source that contributes to bias in gene expression data. Similarly, RUV factor analysis based on the ERCC control gene set was not sufficient.</p><p id="P22">However, the majority of RNA-seq false positives (&#x0003e;85%) could successfully be removed by subtracting the effects of latent variables identified by either sva<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> or PEER<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, which could be achieved by jointly analyzing the set of measurements of all genes across multiple sites, without a decrease in the sensitivity or specificity of DEG detection at each site or across sites. These latent variables were shown to be significantly associated with GC-content, genebody coverage uniformity, average base error rate and insert size. This confirms the impact of two already recognized RNA-seq latent variables, GC-content and insert size<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, and it also identifies two more relevant contributions to technical variation, gene coverage variation and error rate. Furthermore, our use of the cross-site, internal control library (#5) has demonstrated that GC-content is preparation-specific, not laboratory specific, and we have introduced the coefficient of variation for genebody coverage as an important quality measure in RNA-seq (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which quantifies this 5&#x02032;-3&#x02032; bias across both platforms.</p><p id="P23">Our results also indicate that a tradeoff is sometimes made between different goals of normalization. For example, although EDASeq could not effectively remove inter-site false positives (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), it did, however, consistently improve the detection of DEGs as compared to the TaqMan reference set (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Conversely, although PEER sometimes ranked lower on comparability to the Taqman reference set, it had the greatest impact on removing site-specific bias. Moreover, it worked best in making data from the HiSeq and PGM platforms comparable for cross-platform analyses. Notably, genes tested by TaqMan were (on average) more highly expressed, and this may affect normalization method performance for this reference set. Regardless, we have shown that RNA-seq quality metrics and bias removal can successfully be utilized on multiple platforms. Because many aspects of library preparation and normalization are universal aspects of working with RNA, including isolation, purification, priming, amplification, reagent batch and kit version, the recommendations and most of our observations presented here will likely be applicable to any sequencing platform used for RNA-seq<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P24">In general, given advanced data processing, even substantial bias could be corrected and value extracted from experiments combined from multiple laboratories, highlighting the need to archive and share the original sequencing reads from RNA-seq experiments. These best practices for quality control and analysis of RNA-seq data from different experiments or laboratories can readily be implemented, and they are of immediate relevance not just for large-scale RNA-seq studies, but also the analysis of smaller experiments in the context of other data, such as in-house data or those from public repositories. With the globalization of research collaborations and the emergence of an increasing number of large RNA-seq cohorts, obtaining sequencing data across different institutes and platforms is inevitable. The ENCODE project and GEUVADIS Consortium have provided extremely valuable guidelines and best practices for RNA-seq experiments and this work validates and extends their conclusions to other efforts such as GTEx, the Epigenomics Roadmap, the human Brainspan Project and the Nonhuman Primate Reference Transcriptome Resource (NHPRTR). These metrics and internal controls complement those currently in use and create additional resolution insights into the quality of an RNA-seq dataset, further establishing RNA-seq as a reliable, universal tool for differential expression profiling.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Online Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Sample definitions</title><p id="P25">Sample A was Universal Human Reference RNA (catalog no. 740000) and Sample B was Human Brain Reference RNA (catalog no. 6050) from Stratagene and Ambion, respectively.

(<bold>a</bold>) GC content distribution (sample A). X-axis is GC content (%) and y-axis is percentage of reads with the corresponding GC content. Point shapes distinguish replicates (1: unfilled circle; 5: unfilled triangle). (<bold>b</bold>) The greatest percentage of reads contributing to some GC content bin (0% to 100%). A sample with more reads contributing to a particular GC content bin (%) indicates an abundance of reads with that particular GC content. (<bold>c</bold>) Average base error rate across all sequencing bases (y-axis) across all sites (x-axis). (<bold>d</bold>) Coefficient of variation of the percentage of genebody coverage (y-axis), which is a measure of the evenness of coverage across all gene bodies for each site (x-axis). (<bold>e</bold>) The percentage of reads that covers each nucleotide position of all of genes scaled to 100 bins, from 5&#x02032; UTR to 3&#x02032; UTR for sample A:1-5. Replicate 1 displayed site-dependent variation in genebody coverage for ILM3 (3&#x02032; bias), whereas replicate 5 showed similar genebody coverage regardless of where it was sequenced, suggesting that genebody coverage is influenced by library preparation. (<bold>f</bold>) Nucleotide frequency versus position for aligned reads. The percentage of each base was plotted as a function of the read length for each base (A, G, C, T) for two replicates (1, 5) for all sites. Replicate 1 displayed site-dependent base composition frequencies, whereas replicate 5 showed similar base composition frequencies regardless of where it was sequenced, suggesting that base composition frequency is largely a result of library preparation.

Vertical facets stand for sample A-D. Site information for ILM1-6 is color-coded. Replicates 1-4 were prepared and sequenced independently at each site, whereas replicate 5 was prepared at a single site and then sequenced at a subset of all sites.
