In the following study we compared the effects of such diets on redox regulation pathways during development of Atlantic cod (<italic>Gadus morhua</italic>) larvae. Cod larvae were fed a control diet of copepods or the typical rotifer/<italic>Artemia</italic> diet commonly used in commercial marine fish hatcheries, from first feeding until after metamorphosis. The oxidised and reduced glutathione levels, the redox potential, and the mRNA expression of 100 genes in redox system pathways were then compared between treatments during larval development. We found that rotifer/<italic>Artemia</italic>-fed cod larvae had lower levels of oxidised glutathione, a more reduced redox potential, and altered expression of approximately half of the redox system genes when compared to copepod-fed larvae. This rotifer/<italic>Artemia</italic> diet-induced differential regulation of the redox system was greatest during periods of suboptimal growth. Upregulation of the oxidative stress response transcription factor, <italic>nrf2</italic>, and NRF2 target genes in rotifer/<italic>Artemia</italic> fed larvae suggest this diet induced an NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response. Overall, the data demonstrate that nutritional intake plays a role in regulating the redox system in developing fish larvae.

This difference appears to be linked to differences in nutritional composition between the two zooplankton types, with rotifers having low levels of several nutrients, such as zinc, taurine and/or protein, compared to copepods <xref rid="bib3 bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8 bib9" ref-type="bibr">[3,5&#x02013;9]</xref>. The lower levels of certain nutrients in rotifers are probably deficient to sustain the high growth rates and successful metamorphosis of larval fish evolutionary adapted to the elevated levels of nutrients typical of copepods in their natural habitat <xref rid="bib10 bib11" ref-type="bibr">[10,11]</xref>. However, the underlying molecular reasons why the nutrient composition of copepods results in faster growth rates and improved development of fish larvae than that of rotifers remains unclear.</p><p>Growth and other developmental processes are a balance between cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis at both temporal and spatial levels <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. For instance during larval fish ontogeny, cells undergo differentiation during organogenesis, proliferation during growth, and apoptosis when larval type tissue is replaced by adult type tissue <xref rid="bib13 bib14 bib15" ref-type="bibr">[13&#x02013;15]</xref>. These shifts in cell fate are associated with changes in the cellular redox environment, which is generally less reductive (more oxidised) in apoptotic vs differentiating vs proliferating cells <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The cellular redox environment affects cell fate since gene expression, protein function and molecular pathways are often sensitive to the reduction potential <xref rid="bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr">[17,18]</xref>. For example, a more oxidised cellular environment favors the release of the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) transcription factor from a complex with another protein, KEAP1. Once released, NRF2 induces the transcription of at least 50 mammalian genes; many of which code for antioxidants, thiol oxidoreductases and glutathione synthesis/recycling genes; that are involved in maintaining the cellular redox balance and/or are involved in redox signalling (reviewed by <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>).</p><p>Cellular redox homeostasis is maintained by redox couples that act as electron buffers due to their ability to readily cycle between oxidised and reduced forms. The major cellular redox couples are reduced/oxidised glutathione (2GSH/GSSG), cysteine (2Cys/CySS) and thioredoxin (Trx(SH)<sub>2</sub>/TrxSS) <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The ratios and levels of 2GSH/GSSG is the most important cellular redox couple, and a common measure used to assess the cellular redox environment <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The state of the redox environment is important for proper development in mammals <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In line with this, many genes coding for proteins that maintain the cellular redox system are dynamically regulated during fish embryonic and larval development <xref rid="bib21 bib22 bib23" ref-type="bibr">[21&#x02013;23]</xref>. Therefore we hypothesise that the nutritional composition of rotifers may differentially regulate the redox system in rotifer fed-fish larvae and subsequently contribute to their suboptimal growth and development in comparison to fish larvae fed copepods.</p><p>In the following study, Atlantic cod (<italic>Gadus morhua</italic>) larvae were fed either a standard commercial diet of rotifers or a natural zooplankton diet that consisted primarily of copepods <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> from first feeding. We measured the reduced/oxidised glutathione levels and the mRNA expression of 100 genes involved in redox regulation in whole fish during development. Atlantic cod was utilised as the model as it is an ecologically important apex predator and a key economic species in the fisheries of the North Atlantic region <xref rid="bib25 bib26" ref-type="bibr">[25,26]</xref>. The redox system was focused on due to its importance to overall health. The 100 redox system genes investigated were chosen based on their importance within the redox system and/or because of their membership to gene families that are important within the redox system <xref rid="bib12 bib16 bib19 bib21 bib22 bib23" ref-type="bibr">[12,16,19,21&#x02013;23]</xref>. We found that rotifer-fed larvae had a more reduced cellular environment during development, and had elevated levels of mRNA coding for proteins in glutathione synthesis/recycling, methionine reductase and redox system transcription factor pathways compared to larvae fed copepods. In total, 46% of the genes analysed were differentially regulated in rotifer-fed larvae, and we suggest these changes reflect a rotifer induced NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response in cod larvae. Overall, the data demonstrate that nutrient intake plays a role in regulating the redox system in fish larvae, and suggests that nutrient induced changes in the redox system may contribute to the observed differences in larval fish growth and development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s0010"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><title>Cod larvae husbandry</title><p>The fish were maintained in accordance with the Norwegian Animal Welfare Act of 20th&#x000a0;December 1974, No. 73, Sections&#x000a0;20&#x02013;22, amended 19th&#x000a0;June 2009.

The size fractions of zooplankton fed to cod larvae increased with age, starting with copepod nauplii and including more copepodid stages in older larvae. The live feed diets were fed to cod larvae three times per day (09:45, 15:15 and 19:00).</p><p>Following the live feed period, larvae from both treatments were weaned onto a formulated diet (AgloNorse&#x000ae;, Troms&#x000f8; Fiskeindustri AS, Troms&#x000f8;, Norway).

Much of the diet induced differential regulation of the antioxidant coding genes occurred in the early development stages (i.e. stage 1, <italic>sepp1</italic>; stage 2, <italic>cat</italic>, <italic>gpx4b</italic>, <italic>7</italic>, <italic>prdx2</italic> and <italic>3</italic>, <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>).

Diets induced differential regulation of heat shock protein genes only within the stages with large growth differences between treatments, with four, seven and four genes differentially regulated due to diet at stages 2, 3 and 4, respectively (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;7</xref>). The heat shock protein also contained members that had the largest fold change within the redox system genes.

Thus, in the current study we hypothesise that the redox regulation in copepod-fed larvae during development is an optimal state, and that differential regulation from this optimum induced by the rotifer diet represents dysregulation of this system. Overall, we found that the expression of 46% of the analysed redox system related genes, the GSSG concentrations and the redox potential were differentially, and thus may be dys-regulated in rotifer-fed cod larvae. This demonstrates that nutritional intake plays a major role in regulating the redox system in developing fish larvae.</p><sec id="s0075"><title>A rotifer diet disrupts glutathione homeostasis and redox potentials in cod larvae</title><p>The differential regulation of the glutathione homeostasis pathways, and subsequently the redox potential in rotifer-fed larvae was a prominent finding in this study. Glutathione is the main cellular redox buffer because of its high cellular concentrations (1&#x02013;10&#x000a0;mM) and reactive thiol group. Among others, enzyme mediated processes oxidise two GSH to GSSG to supply reducing equivalents to maintain many cellular components in a reduced state (reviewed by <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>). Rotifer-fed larvae had increased mRNA expression of glutathione reductase (<italic>gsr</italic>) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (<italic>g6pd</italic>), lower levels of GSSG and a more reduced redox potential, but similar levels of GSH, as larvae fed copepods. The GSR enzyme regenerates GSH by reducing GSSG, using NADPH as the electron source. In turn G6PD is the rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway for NADPH regeneration (reviewed by <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>), linking this enzyme to the GSH recycling pathway. As in the current study, GSSG levels remained constant and the redox potential became more reduced during the early developmental stages (from 7 to 14&#x000a0;dph) in rotifer-fed larvae in our previous study <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Thus the upregulation of the glutathione recycling pathway appears to be a common event associated with the differential regulation of the cellular redox environment in cod larvae fed rotifers.</p><p>The implications of this differential regulation are unclear, as the more reduced cellular environment found from developmental stages 2&#x02013;4 in rotifer-fed larvae (from 7 to 15&#x000a0;mm in length) is thought to favor cellular proliferation, and hence growth <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, opposite to this, the more reduced cellular environment found in rotifer-fed larvae occurred at the same developmental stage that growth rates failed to accelerate in line with copepod-fed larvae <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The expression of many redox system genes, including those for proteins from antioxidant, heat shock protein and thiol oxidoreductase families, mirrored changes in GSSG levels in copepod-fed larvae. For example, the GSSG spike at stage two in copepod-fed larvae was accompanied by spikes (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) in <italic>prdx2</italic>, <italic>prdx3</italic>, <italic>gpx1a</italic>, <italic>gpx7</italic> (antioxidant), <italic>txnl1</italic> (thiol oxidoreductase), <italic>hsp70</italic>, <italic>hsp90b1a</italic>, <italic>hsp90b1b</italic>, and <italic>serpinh1b</italic> (heat shock protein) expression. Whether the GSSG spike precedes, occurs simultaneously, or occurs after the changes in expression of some or all of the responsive redox system genes is unclear. The GSSG spike is likely to be a product of the total balance of enzymatic reactions that are involved in catalysing the production and removal of GSSG <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, and thus may highlight underlying deficiencies in the enzymes that produce GSSG, such as GPX, in rotifer-fed larvae. Perhaps this spike is important for the regulatory role GSSG plays as a substrate for protein glutathionylation, a post-translational modification of exposed cysteine residues that affects protein function <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>As we assayed whole fish, it is unknown to what degree rotifer-induced differences in gene expression, GSSG or redox potential represent changes occurring over the whole body, or in specific cell types.

After stage 4, the redox potential decreased (became more reduced) in copepod-fed larvae to similar levels as in rotifer-fed larvae by stage 5. This could be a normal developmental process, at least in aquaculture, associated with the shift to a formulated diet that occurred after the sampling at developmental stage 4 in both treatments.

However, of greater importance may be imbalances in cellular ROS levels as a result of imbalances in enzyme activities within related pathways.

The more reduced cellular redox environment caused by the rotifer diet could also contribute to redox system enzyme mismatches.
