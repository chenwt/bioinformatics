Understanding how they react and the way pathogens adapt to such combinational stresses is poorly documented. Here, we developed an experimental system mimicking field intermittent drought on rice followed by inoculation by the pathogenic fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>. This experimental system triggers an enhancement of susceptibility that could be correlated with the dampening of several aspects of plant immunity, namely the oxidative burst and the transcription of several pathogenesis-related genes. Quite strikingly, the analysis of fungal transcription by RNASeq analysis under drought reveals that the fungus is greatly modifying its virulence program: genes coding for small secreted proteins were massively repressed in droughted plants compared to unstressed ones whereas genes coding for enzymes involved in degradation of cell-wall were induced. We also show that drought can lead to the partial breakdown of several major resistance genes by affecting <italic>R</italic> plant gene and/or pathogen effector expression. We propose a model where a yet unknown plant signal can trigger a change in the virulence program of the pathogen to adapt to a plant host that was affected by drought prior to infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>stress combination</kwd><kwd>drought</kwd><kwd>fungus</kwd><kwd>immunity</kwd><kwd>effectors</kwd><kwd>rice</kwd><kwd><italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Agence Nationale de la Recherche<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001665</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">ANR-10-LABX-0001-01</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Agropolis Fondation<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100007599</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">1201-001</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="59"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants are often facing several simultaneous stresses, including biotic and abiotic (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki et al., 2014</xref>). The plant&#x02019;s response and adaptation to such complex interactions remain largely unknown. While pathogens have constantly been a threat to plants, in particular fungi (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Dean et al., 2012</xref>), drought is becoming an increasing constraint, for instance for rice cultivation (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Pandey and Shukla, 2015</xref>). Drought can have positive effect and reduce disease levels but in many cases drought is increasing disease susceptibility (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kissoudis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Prasch and Sonnewald, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Ramegowda and Senthil-Kumar, 2015</xref>). For instance, it is well-known that rainfed rice suffering for repeated and intermittent drought heavily suffers from blast disease caused by the fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bonman, 1992</xref>).</p><p>Each drought and pathogen stress are well-studied individually and many components regulating them are known. On the one hand, the plant&#x02019;s response to drought has been extensively studied in model plants like <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> or crops like rice. The production of abscisic acid (ABA) hormone and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are among the most conserved molecular responses, together with the production of osmoprotectants and antioxidant activities (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Shanker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Pandey and Shukla, 2015</xref>). All these changes are also associated with an intensive transcriptional re-programming (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Nakashima et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, plant immunity is usually understood as a two-layer process (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Dangl, 2006</xref>). First, transmembrane receptors recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns and trigger basal immunity that operates as a general, non-specific immunity that reduces but does not suppress pathogen growth. Pathogens have evolved effector molecules that counteract this basal immunity and thus enhance their capacity to grow in plant tissues. These effectors are often small secreted proteins that, altogether with other enzymes like cell-wall degrading enzymes (CAZY), represent major components of the pathogen&#x02019;s virulence program (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">King et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Asai and Shirasu, 2015</xref>). Second, plants have developed intracellular receptors that activate the so-called effector-triggered immunity upon detection of effector(s). This mechanism, activated when a matching effector is detected by its cognate receptor, leads to complete resistance often associated with cell death localized at the site of infection. It is also known as the gene-for-gene resistance in which the receptor and the effector are, respectively, called Resistance (R) and avirulence (avr) proteins. Basal and effector-triggered immunity are often associated with the production of ROS called the oxidative burst and with the increased transcription of defense-related genes like pathogenesis-related (<italic>PR</italic>) genes (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Dangl, 2006</xref>). While several reports (see below) indicate that basal immunity pathway is connected to the drought tolerance pathway, to our knowledge there is yet no report that drought can impact effector-triggered immunity.</p><p>The relationships between drought and disease tolerance/resistance pathways can be estimated by the analysis of transgenic or mutant plants. Quite strikingly, the analysis of the majority of transgenic plants showed that drought tolerance and disease resistance pathways are often antagonist (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Delteil et al., 2010</xref>). For instance, the over-expression of the major regulator of disease resistance OsNPR1 increased disease resistance but reduced drought tolerance in rice (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Quilis et al., 2008</xref>). Conversely, silencing of OsMPK5 enhanced drought tolerance but reduced disease resistance (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Xiong and Yang, 2003</xref>). Most of these antagonistic effects have been attributed to the activation of the ABA pathway under drought stress which is thought to be detrimental to the setting of disease resistance pathways (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">De Vleesschauwer et al., 2014</xref>). For all these reasons, one hypothesis to be tested is that basal immunity is repressed by drought signaling.</p><p>Indeed, the way plant immunity is deployed after drought is not well characterized and only very few studies have been published. In a pioneer study, it was shown that most of the plant reaction to a combined biotic and abiotic stress could not be predicted from the knowledge of the individual stress (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Rasmussen et al., 2013</xref>) but this work did not involve drought nor an entire pathogen. Soon after this work, two categories of experiments were conducted: drought followed by infection or infection and then drought. In their study, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Atkinson et al. (2013)</xref> first inoculated <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> with the nematode <italic>Heterodera schachtii</italic> and then imposed continuous drought. Overall, the drought-response pathway was dominating as evidenced by the fact that most of transcriptional changes were related to this stress and less to disease-related stress. Similarly, the analysis of viral infection by TuMV followed by drought showed that drought abolished most of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes known to respond to this virus (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Prasch and Sonnewald, 2013</xref>). On the other hand, when the bacteria <italic>Xylella fastidiosa</italic> was inoculated to grape <italic>after</italic> drought, it was observed that the increased symptoms to the pathogen associated with an enhanced drought response, with no indication that the activation of the plant&#x02019;s immune system was strongly affected (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al., 2013</xref>). In the case of the inoculation by the virulent bacteria <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants grown under continuous drought, it was found that reduced susceptibility could be correlated to an increased expression of basal immunity genes (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Gupta et al., 2016</xref>). Similar results were obtained by inoculating <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tabaci</italic> and the necrotrophic fungus <italic>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</italic> on tobacco plants acclimated to drought stress (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Ramegowda et al., 2013</xref>). The impact of an abiotic stress on molecular components of pathogen virulence has also been scarcely studied. For instance, pathogen adaptation to abiotic stress involves molecules with pleiotropic effect that are considered to be virulence factors like siderophores (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Hof et al., 2007</xref>) and temperature altered the expression of several bacterial effectors [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al. (2013)</xref> and references therein]. Thus there are only very few examples documenting the molecular impacts of drought on disease.</p><p>In this study, we used the model interaction between rice and the devastating blast fungus <italic>M.</italic> oryzae to address several questions relative to the impact of drought on plant/fungal interactions. After developing a protocol where an intermittent mild drought stress severely increased blast susceptibility, we looked how basal immunity was impacted by drought in the early times of infection. Using RNASeq analysis, we also tested if the fungal pathogenicity program was affected by drought applied prior to infection. This led us to show that drought can also affect effector-triggered immunity. We propose a model where an unknown plant signal indicative of the plant physiological status is likely sensed by the pathogen that adapts its invasion strategy accordingly.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Growth and Drought Stress Protocol</title><p>Indicated rice genotypes (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) were sown on Thursdays (day 1) in Neuhaus S soil mixed with poudzolane (2L/70L).

At day 23 (Friday; 14:00 h), drought stress was imposed by removing water. Three days later (Monday; day 26; 11:00 h), drought stressed plants were put back on the tables allowing rehydration for 2 h followed by spray inoculation. Field capacity was measured by DW/WW &#x000d7; 100 where WW and DW is wet and dry soil weights, respectively. The 3 and 4 days drought corresponded to 50 and 38% field capacity, respectively, while control plants were maintained at 100%.

Control plants were sprayed with 0.5% solution of gelatin (mock treatment). Volumes were adjusted proportionally to the number of pots sprayed. Inoculated plants were placed for 16 h in a climatic chamber set at 25&#x000b0;C with the humidifiers working in 15 min cycles to saturate the air with water.

Four replicates were used if not stated differently. Briefly, we used LC480 SYBR Green I Master Mix (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Amplification on LightCycler 480 thermocycler (Roche) was as follows: 95&#x000b0;C for 10 min; 40 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 15 s, 60&#x000b0;C for 20 s, and 72&#x000b0;C for 30 s; then 95&#x000b0;C for 5 min and 40&#x000b0;C for 30 s. RNA for high throughput sequencing was additionally purified using chloroform. RNA integrity of the samples was assessed with Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent) and only samples with RIN at least 7.5 were used. High throughput RNA sequencing was performed by BGI Tech (Shenzhen, China).</p></sec><sec><title>RNAseq Data Analysis</title><p>Initial data cleaning and reads mapping was performed by BGI Tech (Shenzhen, China). The libraries were sequenced as 50-bp single-end reads using Illumina Hiseq2000 according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.

We chose 4 dpi for RNASeq analysis as in our experience, fungal RNA is too diluted in earlier time points for appropriate detection and statistical analysis (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Kawahara et al., 2012</xref>). For one repetition and on average, 528 k reads were found with a unique perfect match on <italic>M. oryzae</italic> Mg8. The enrichment in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> was corrected by normalization procedures in order to detect differentially expressed genes between the two conditions (drought-stressed and unstressed). A total of 9388 genes were kept for DEG analysis because they were considered as expressed at 4 dpi, i.e., when the sum of read counts for the three repetitions of one of the condition was &#x0003e;5. For rice, on average 40 million reads with perfect match were mapped on the genome. Twenty-nine thousand five hundred and seventy-five genes with at least 40% coverage were kept for the differential gene expression (DEG) analysis. The DEG analysis was performed on DEB website (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Yao and Yu, 2011</xref>). For DEG analysis of <italic>M. oryzae</italic> genes, we used two different statistical analysis methods, namely DESeq and EdgeR with a minimum FDR of 5%. We considered as differentially expressed all genes that were significant in at least one of the statistical test. Enrichment analyses of the different functions were tested against the whole genome annotation with a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test corrected by Bonferroni. For DEG analysis of rice genes, we considered as differentially expressed genes, one that were significant (FDR of 5%) in at least one of the conditions.

To better understand this phenomenon and to be able to characterize it at the molecular level, we decided to establish a controlled-drought experiment followed by inoculation of the plants (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold>). We tested two conditions of imposed drought length after which plants were re-watered. Three and four days of progressive dehydration resulted, respectively, in mild to strong leaf rolling and pots lost 40 and 60% of their initial weigh due to water evaporation (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1A</xref></bold>).

The RNA sequencing depth (see Materials and Methods) allowed a good coverage of <italic>M. oryzae</italic> genes (in average 38% gene coverage). A total of 336 fungal genes were found as differentially expressed in at least one of the statistical analysis (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6">S2</xref></bold>). Based on our annotation analysis in this gene set, 52 genes are putative small secreted protein and 35 are cell-wall degrading, CAZY enzymes (respectively, 15.5 and 11.3% of DEG genes). In the 12827 genes that, we annotated in our database, only 800 have been identified as putative small secreted protein (<italic>i.e.</italic>, 6%) and 482 as CAZY enzyme (<italic>i.e.</italic>, 3.8%). Thus the DEG set is significantly enriched in both protein categories (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref></bold>) that are major players in fungal virulence. When, we then looked at the expression values, a clear picture was visible: genes coding for putative effectors were repressed while those for CAZY enzymes were induced in drought-stressed plants compared to unstressed ones (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref></bold>). We further extended this observation by measuring with RT-qPCR fungal gene expression in two different <italic>M. oryzae</italic> strains at different time points along the infection process. These analyses showed that the expression of most tested fungal effectors (<italic>Avr-Pita, BAS1, BAS4, SLP1, SLP2</italic>; <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3</xref></bold>) was reduced in drought-stressed plants compared to unstressed ones. For Guy11, a lesser reduction of expression was also accompanied with a delay in expression. Moreover, out of the 112 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> genes repressed, 38 are putative effectors (34%) while only 6% would have been expected from genomic data (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6">S2</xref></bold>).

Plant DEGs specific to infection were the most numerous (6625) compared to those specific to drought (119), suggesting that plants are responding to infection rather than to drought at this time point. This is also likely to relate to the fact that at the time of our analysis, drought has been stopped for more than 4 days. General stress-related plant genes had an expression enhanced by the combination of stresses (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S4C</xref></bold>) and the expression pattern of 503 genes could not be predicted from single stress situations (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S4D</xref></bold>). Interestingly 114 plant genes are part of a gene set with an expression antagonistically modified by drought and infection. This gene set is enriched in defense-related genes.

Altogether, these RNASeq data indicate that plant immunity at late time points after inoculation is lower in drought-stressed than in non-stressed plants.</p></sec><sec><title>Drought Provokes the Partial Breakdown of Several Major Resistance Genes</title><p>Effectors like Avr-Pita can be recognized by their cognate resistance protein in the plant. This recognition triggers cell death and complete plant resistance. Based on the observation that many effectors were down-regulated (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold>) and that plant immunity was overall depressed in drought-stressed plants (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>), we asked whether major resistance genes were still operating under such conditions. We tested three major resistance genes (<italic>Pi-ta, Pi-i</italic>, and <italic>Pi-a</italic>) by using Guy11 transgenic strains expressing the corresponding effectors expressed under their own promoter. The FR13 strain could not be used as it already contains several AVR genes.

For instance, the blast infection efficiencies of plants that were subjected to severe water deficit was more than four times those of unstressed controls (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Gill and Bonman, 1988</xref>). We set out an experimental system displaying a mild and intermittent drought-stress before inoculation (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>) to identify the transcriptional and cellular mechanisms underlying such enhanced susceptibility in plants and pathogen. Moderate drought (3 days) preceding inoculation only slightly induced plant&#x02019;s response to drought but greatly increased disease severity (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref></bold>; up to 6.5-fold) and we propose to call this phenomenon drought-induced susceptibility (DIS). The enhanced susceptibility observed in our experiments is unlikely due to an indirect effect of altered plant growth since in the 3 days stress, we could not measure any impact of drought on development (<bold>Supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1B,C</xref></bold>). Our DIS protocol (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold>) is likely mimicking natural situations, in particular rainfed environments with intermittent drought stress where blast disease is severe (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Gill and Bonman, 1988</xref>). In such environment, rain is ending a period of drought, temporarily increasing humidity that is favorable to <italic>M. oryzae</italic> germination. Evaluating rice panels characterized for drought tolerance [<italic>e.g.</italic>, (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Luo, 2010</xref>)] is now amenable to see how drought-regulation and DIS are genetically linked. Similarly, it will be interesting to evaluate if our experimental system enhances disease to other rice pathogens.</p><p>Our analysis indicates that the induction of basal immunity is dampened in plants that were pre-exposed to drought (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>; <bold>Supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1D</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">4E</xref></bold>). Although this was largely expected given the well-known negative cross-talks between the pathway controlling drought response and pathogen response (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">De Vleesschauwer et al., 2014</xref>), this is to our knowledge the first report documenting at the transcriptional levels the impact of drought on plant&#x02019;s response to fungal attack. In their study combining continuous drought followed by bacterial infection, an enhancement of basal immunity was observed, consistent with reduced susceptibility (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Gupta et al., 2016</xref>), while in our study, we observe an increase of susceptibility. The difference in the way drought way applied [intermittent here and continuous in <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Gupta et al. (2016)</xref>] could explain such opposite consequences. The effects of drought on rice have been reviewed (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Pandey and Shukla, 2015</xref>) and include an increase of ABA and several antioxidant enzymatic activities. Intermittent drought stress also caused an increase in the ABA level that rapidly returned to normal upon re-watering (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Muthurajan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). ABA often increases pre-penetration defenses, in particular stomatal closure, that reduce pathogen penetration (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Ramegowda and Senthil-Kumar, 2015</xref>). This is unlikely operating in the case of rice blast fungus since this pathogen does not require stomata for penetration. By contrast, an inhibition of plant defense by the activation of the ABA pathway in response to drought (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">De Vleesschauwer et al., 2014</xref>) could explain our observation that plant immunity is down-regulated in our experimental system. Moreover, an increase of antioxidant activities during drought recovery may lead to a reduction of the pathogen-induced oxidative burst during this phase (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,B</xref></bold>). Inhibition of plant&#x02019;s basal immunity is likely compensating the down-regulation of pathogen effectors&#x02019; expression (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold>; see below). Our experimental system now opens the possibility to scrutinize in more detail basal immunity to identify where and when drought is negatively impacting its onset.</p><p>It is well known that <italic>R</italic> gene function can be inhibited by heat stress (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Gijzen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Hua, 2013</xref>). By contrast, we have shown that the function of several rice <italic>R</italic> genes was not broken down upon another abiotic-related stress, nitrogen fertilization (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Ballini et al., 2013</xref>). The observation that many fungal effectors were down regulated in plants after drought (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold>) prompted us to test the possibility of an inhibition of effector-triggered immunity by drought. Our finding that drought can affect some, but not all tested plant <italic>R</italic> genes extends the vulnerability of <italic>R</italic> genes to this abiotic stress (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>). In the case of heat stress, it was shown that R protein re-localization is responsible for the loss of activity of these proteins (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2010</xref>). Whether drought also affects R protein localization requires further analysis and several scenarios could explain the partial breakdown of resistance in our experiments: low expression of the effector gene and normal expression of the cognate <italic>R</italic> gene (e.g., Avr-Pita/Pi-ta) or down-regulation of the <italic>R</italic> gene (e.g., <italic>Pi-i</italic>). Our dataset did not allow following the global expression of <italic>R</italic> gene analogs during drought because, we measured the expression 4 days after the start of drought recovery. We used the RiceDB database (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Narsai et al., 2013</xref>) to retrieve rice <italic>R</italic> gene analogs differentially expressed in drought experiments and found out that 26 are repressed and 11 are induced. Thus some <italic>R</italic> gene analogs are regulated and often repressed by drought. ABA could also be responsible for part of the observed partial breakdown of resistance as it was shown to inhibit effector-triggered immunity (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">McDonald and Cahill, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Kim, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our results suggest that the observed differences in blast susceptibility between plants under different watering treatments were not due to the differences in the pre-penetration activity of <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, consistent with previous findings (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Kim, 1984</xref>). We thus looked for transcriptional changes in the fungus after penetration to look how the fungus&#x02019; biology was modified by plant differential treatments. For the first time a differential expression analysis was conducted on <italic>Magnaporthe</italic> by RNAseq <italic>in planta</italic>. This analysis revealed that several functions of the pathogen are strongly impacted by the abiotic stress applied to plants before infection. Indeed, we could observe that many fungal genes coding for biotrophic effectors and cell-wall degrading enzymes are expressed to lower and higher levels, respectively, in droughted plants. This is reminiscent of the observation that bacterial effectors are expressed to low levels at high temperature, a condition also known to reduce effector-triggered immunity (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>). Thus pathogens may adapt their virulence strategy depending on the physiological status of the plant. The content in several molecular signals like amino acids, sugars and hormones known to be modified in leaves after drought (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Shanker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Pandey and Shukla, 2015</xref>) could be perceived by the fungus. For instance, ABA and cytokinins are known to increase in leaves after drought and <italic>M. oryzae</italic> is known to react to these plant hormones (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Spence and Bais, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chanclud et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, <italic>M. oryzae</italic> can sense ROS and osmotic changes (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>) or amino acids and sugars (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>). We propose a model for the enhancement of susceptibility after an intermittent drought where immunity is low after inoculation and where pathogenicity functions are differentially expressed in drought-stressed plants compared to normally watered ones (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref></bold>). In this model, we propose that the pathogen adapts its virulence strategy depending on one or several plant-derived signals. This strategy also favors effector-immunity breakdown by reducing the expression of effectors and/or by down-regulating <italic>R</italic> gene expression. The signals behind this adaptation remain to be identified and our experimental system opens the door to its identification.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>FIGURE 5</label><caption><p><bold>Hypothetical model for drought-induced susceptibility.</bold> Under non-stressed conditions, an unknown plant signal informs the fungus on the level of plant&#x02019;s immunity (blue arrow).

Once immunity inhibited and biotrophy established, a nectrotrophy program (NP) is activated that produces cell wall degrading enzyme and other toxin activities, leading to plant cell death (gray cell) and pathogen facilitated growth. After the response to drought, some plant signals like ABA and the production of antioxidant activities might inhibit the production of the immune response. The unknown plant signal indicative of high immunity is weaker or no longer present (dashed arrow).
