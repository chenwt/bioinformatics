Large-scale transcriptomics should complement these results to identify core molecular pathways underlying autism. Here we report results from a large-scale RNA sequencing effort, utilizing region-matched autism and control brains to identify neuronal and microglial genes robustly dysregulated in autism cortical brain. Remarkably, we note that a gene expression module corresponding to M2-activation states in microglia is negatively correlated with a differentially expressed neuronal module, implicating dysregulated microglial responses in concert with altered neuronal activity-dependent genes in autism brains. These observations provide pathways and candidate genes that highlight the interplay between innate immunity and neuronal activity in the aetiology of autism.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="i1" xlink:href="ncomms6748-i1.jpg"/>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common, highly heritable neurodevelopmental condition characterized by marked genetic heterogeneity.

In the vast majority of cases, the cause of disease is not known. Despite a strong genetic component with heritability estimates between 50 and 90% (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>), the identification of genes important in disease susceptibility has progressed slowly, resulting in a limited understanding of the molecular basis of autism. Environmental factors underlying disease risk are likewise unclear. This slow progress can be attributed, in part, to both the extreme phenotypic heterogeneity and involvement of hundreds of loci in the disorder<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p><p>Recent studies to elucidate the molecular basis of autism have largely focused on genetic approaches, including both genome-wide association studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> and whole-exome sequencing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, to identify both inherited and <italic>de novo</italic> variation contributing to autism. A major mode of action for genetic variation is through altered gene expression, so direct analysis of gene expression in a disease-relevant tissue is a complementary approach to genetic studies. Despite the extreme genetic heterogeneity observed in autism, it is possible that common downstream mechanisms may be altered<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Thus, there has been an effort to use transcriptomics to identify and dissect molecular pathways that may be altered in autism spectrum disorder (ASD).</p><p>Given low tissue sample availability in autism research, efforts have focused on assessing gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines or whole blood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. However, given the core neurodevelopment phenotypes associated with autism, there is little doubt that direct assessment of gene expression in brains may be critical. Indeed, Voineagu <italic>et al</italic>. recently utilized co-expressed gene networks from RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) carried out in 19 autism brains and 17 controls to identify a set of co-expressed neuronal genes enriched for known autism susceptibility genes as well as a set of co-expressed genes enriched for both immune genes and glial markers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p><p>In the current study, we present results from the largest RNA sequencing of autism brains effort to date that allows for new insights into the aetiology of autism. We find clear differences in the transcriptome between control and ASD cortical brains. Using co-expression network analysis, we demonstrate that autism brains are specifically enriched for &#x02018;activated&#x02019; M2 microglial and &#x02018;immune response&#x02019; genes. Remarkably, the M2 microglial module is strongly negatively correlated with one of two differentially expressed neuronal modules, highlighting the interplay between innate immunity and neuronal activity in the aetiology of ASD.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Transcriptomes from 104 human brain cortical tissue samples were resolved using next-generation RNA sequencing technology at single-gene resolution and through co-expressing gene clusters or modules. Multiple cortical tissues corresponding to Brodmann Area 19 (BA19), Brodmann Area 10 (BA10) and Brodmann Area 44 (BA44) were sequenced in 62, 14 and 28 samples, respectively, resulting in a total of 57 (40 unique individuals) control and 47 (32 unique individuals) autism samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1 and 2</xref>, and see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Differential gene expression was estimated between the 57 controls and the 47 cases, with sample collection site, age, sex, brain region and independent surrogate variables (ISVs) as fixed effects in a linear mixed regression model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 3a</xref>). In total, 13,262 genes with at least three reads per sample across 90% of the samples were tested, and two transcriptome-wide significant differentially expressed genes associated with autism were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p><p>The most significant differentially expressed gene was <italic>Myelin And Lymphocyte Protein</italic> (<italic>MAL</italic>; <italic>P</italic>=2.16 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a&#x02013;c</xref>). <italic>MAL</italic>, along with other myelination genes, has previously been reported to show altered expression in patients with psychiatric disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. The second differentially expressed gene was <italic>C11orf30</italic> (<italic>EMSY</italic>; <italic>P</italic>=3.29 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1d&#x02013;f</xref>). This gene has been implicated in chromatin modification, DNA repair and transcriptional regulation, and previous genome-wide association studies have linked <italic>C11orf30</italic> to inflammatory and malignant diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. We also performed analyses at the exon level, testing 21,310 exons for differential exon expression; however, no differences could be identified in autism cases and controls after correction for multiple testing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 5</xref>).</p><p>Next we asked whether the top differentially expressed genes from the single-gene analysis shared common pathways or functional categories. We tested for the enrichment of biological processes using Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and MSigDB curated gene sets. No gene-set enrichment with family-wise error rate (FWER) &#x02264;0.05 was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 6a&#x02013;d</xref>).</p><p>For common genetic variation, altered gene expression is a major mode of action<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. We therefore tested whether genes previously associated with autism through genetic analyses are enriched for altered gene expression. To identify genes underlying susceptibility to autism, we utilized a list of expertly curated genes developed by the Simons Foundation for Autism Research (SFARI)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. In addition to the SFARI list of genes, we also integrated genes associated with rare <italic>de novo</italic> variation (RDNV) and genes involved in intellectual disability (ID) compiled from four published whole-exome sequencing studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> and review articles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 7</xref>). Overall, we find comparable expression of these genes in autism and control brain tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 8a,b</xref>). Although these gene lists are not comprehensive and only reflect the current understanding of the genetic basis of autism, the lack of enrichment for genes known to harbour genetic signal for autism in altered gene expression suggests the potential for non-overlapping mechanisms between genetic and transcriptomic determinants of autism. However, we do find modest enrichment for a broader set of genes containing &#x02018;brain-critical exons&#x02019;, which have high gene expression in brain and low rare burden of rare mutations, and have been proposed to represent autism candidate genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 8a</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the single-gene analyses, we applied weighted gene correlation network analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> (WGCNA) to identify discrete gene modules based on co-expression between genes. Considerable overlap was observed in the modules constructed separately from cases and controls, indicating that overall organization of transcript co-expression is conserved between autism and control brains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 9</xref>). Therefore, we applied WGCNA to construct networks derived from the entire data set of 104 samples, adjusted for sequencing artefacts, age, sex, collection site and brain region, identifying 12 co-expressed modules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). We tested the association of each module, represented by its corresponding first principal component or module eigengene (ME), with case&#x02013;control status using a linear mixed regression framework (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Three of the twelve modules were differentially co-expressed (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.005), with mod5 (<italic>P</italic>=9.64 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>) exceeding the multitest correction threshold (<italic>P</italic><sub>permutated</sub>&#x0003c;0.002, <italic>P</italic><sub>Bonferroni</sub>&#x0003c;0.004; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). Mod5 comprised 759 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>) with enrichment for M2-microglial cell states (<italic>P</italic><sub>hypergeometric</sub>=1.22 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;39</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 12</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>) and the GO term &#x02018;Type I Interferon pathway&#x02019; (<italic>P</italic><sub>hypergeometric</sub>=1.19 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;20</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 13e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Type I Interferon responses in the brain are classically attributed to viral infections that can produce M1 activation states in microglia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Accordingly, mod5 also shows enrichment for GO terms &#x02018;defense response to virus&#x02019; (<italic>P</italic><sub>hypergeometric</sub>=6.83 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;17</sup>) and &#x02018;cytokine-mediated signalling pathway&#x02019; (<italic>P</italic><sub>hypergeometric</sub>=6.31 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 13e</xref>). In opposition to M1-activated microglia, M2 responses are responsible for mediating anti-inflammatory remediation responses to damage caused by viral infections. M2 microglial cells also secrete brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), increase the production of neural progenitor cells and promote myelination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. These data provide support for a mechanistic connection for viral-infection hypotheses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> for autism with neural over-growth hypotheses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> through the novel identification of exaggerated M2 activation states in autism brain tissue.</p><p>Voineagu <italic>et al</italic>. previously reported a co-expression module dysregulated in autism brains, termed asdM16, enriched in astrocytes and microglia-expressed genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. To better understand the functional implications of asdM16 in autism, we looked for asdM16 signal enrichment among the modules generated utilizing our substantially larger data set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 12</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Two modules&#x02014;mod5 (<italic>P</italic><sub>hypergeometric</sub>=9.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;59</sup>, described above) and mod7 (<italic>P</italic><sub>hypergeometric</sub>=1.45 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;89</sup>)&#x02014;were enriched for asdM16 signal. However, mod7 is not differentially expressed with respect to autism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>) and accounts for the astrocyte markers (<italic>P</italic><sub>hypergeometric</sub>=1.65 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;75</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 12</xref>), whereas mod5 is differentially expressed (<italic>P</italic>=9.64 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>). By substantially increasing the sample size and number of genes evaluated, we are able to accurately pinpoint the relevant signal from the previously reported asdM16 module as coming from M2-state microglial cells and immunogenic responses (type I interferon responses; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 13e and Fig. 3d</xref>), and not from astrocytes. To our knowledge, M2 activation state responses have not previously been attributed to the pathogenesis of autism.</p><p>We also identified three distinct modules (mod1, mod2 and mod6; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b&#x02013;d</xref>) enriched for neuronal markers that contain genes with the shared GO term, &#x02018;synaptic transmission&#x02019;, all of which showed enrichment for an additional co-expression module reported to be dysregulated in autism, asdM12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 12 and 13a,b,f</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Two of the three modules&#x02014;mod1, downregulated in autism, and mod6, upregulated in autism&#x02014;were nominally differentially co-expressed between the autism and control brain samples (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.005; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Mod1 contains synaptic transmission genes enriched in GABA-related ion channel activity, whereas mod6 contains genes enriched in peptide and hormone signalling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have identified an enrichment of genetic association signals in genes selectively expressed in neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Here we find that mod2 was enriched for both common (<italic>P</italic><sub>hypergeometric</sub>=2.49 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>) and rare classes of autism genetic variants (<italic>P</italic><sub>hypergeometric</sub>=4.29 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>) but comparably expressed between cases and controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 11 and 12,</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). That neuronal genes genetically associated with autism do not appear to have altered expression (mod2), coupled with the observation that neuronal genes without genetic signal do appear to be differentially expressed (mod1 and mod6), suggests that autism-associated differentially expressed genes are separable from genetic determinants of autism. Corroborating this idea, a recent study of gene networks in coronary artery disease has shown that genes at the centre of the networks, referred to as &#x02018;key drivers&#x02019;, were largely not genome-wide association study signal genes, suggesting that key regulatory genes may not harbour common inherited variation because of natural selection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.</p><p>Direct evidence for the role of Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) in autism has been provided by Darnell <italic>et al</italic>. These authors reported that many of the protein-interacting partners of FMRP harbour ASD-associated common variants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Similarly, Iossifov and colleagues reported an enrichment of ASD RDNVs in FMRP targets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. We therefore investigated whether FMRP targets were enriched in any of the co-expression modules detected in autism brain tissue. We report a 20% enrichment of FMRP targets in one of the differentially co-expressed neuronal modules, mod1 (<italic>P</italic><sub>hypergeometric</sub>=1.80 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup>), and the non-differentially co-expressed neuronal module, mod2, which showed a substantially stronger enrichment of 39% of FMRP targets (<italic>P</italic><sub>hypergeometric</sub>=7.38 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;110</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 12 and Fig. 2e</xref>).</p><p>Recently, Steinberg <italic>et al</italic>. organized the FMRP target genes into distinct temporally expressed subpopulations affected by different classes of genetic variation associated with ASD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Based on this classification, we found that mod1 was enriched for FMRP targets expressed in the synapse during adolescence and adulthood (<italic>P</italic><sub>hypergeometric</sub>=4.66 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>), whereas mod2 was enriched for the FMRP targets in the modules that were expressed during fetal development (<italic>P</italic><sub>hypergeometric</sub>=3.32 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 12</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Thus, we again find evidence that the genetic signal is stronger in the non-differentially expressed module (mod2), with a twofold enrichment for FMRP targets compared with the differentially expressed mod6, whereas no enrichment was observed for mod1. Incorporating the temporal data leads to a hypothesis that one important mechanism of action at the neuronal level is that primary mutations may occur in genes important in fetal development (captured by mod2), and altered expression of those genes would not be captured in the current study, where the youngest individual was 2 years of age. These mutations may lead to developmental changes reflected in adolescent and adult expressed genes showing differential expression between cases and controls (mod1 and mod6).</p><p>In this study, we provide transcriptomic evidence for type I interferon and M2-activation state abnormalities in autism that may lead to a variety of pathologic and phenotypic consequences. We further note that there is a strong negative correlation between two differentially co-expressed modules, mod5 (activated M2-state microglia genes) and mod1 (synaptic transmission genes; <italic>r</italic>=&#x02212;0.92, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 14</xref>). Recently, microglia have been identified as cells capable of restoring neural function in the ASD-model <italic>MECP2</italic> knockout mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. We observe, for the first time, that M2-activation state microglia genes, in particular, are altered in autism, potentially driven by type I interferon responses. This process may drive changes in neural progenitor cell proliferation and connectivity with resultant altered activity-dependent neural expression profiles in post-natal development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. The linkage of this pathway to autism may lead to more accurate and predictive models of idiopathic disease that might contribute to the identification of effective therapeutic approaches.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Brain tissue samples</title><p><italic>Brain tissue</italic>.
