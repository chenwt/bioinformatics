of Kielder Forest and their natural parasites dates back to the 1930s. These early studies
were primarily concerned with understanding how parasites shape the characteristic cyclic
population dynamics of their hosts. However, since the early 2000s, research on the
Kielder field voles has expanded considerably and the system has now been utilized for the
study of host&#x02013;parasite biology across many levels, including genetics, evolutionary
ecology, immunology and epidemiology. The Kielder field voles therefore represent one of
the most intensely and broadly studied natural host&#x02013;parasite systems, bridging theoretical
and empirical approaches to better understand the biology of infectious disease in the
real world. This article synthesizes the body of work published on this system and
summarizes some important insights and general messages provided by the integrated and
multidisciplinary study of host&#x02013;parasite interactions in the natural environment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>field vole</kwd><kwd><italic>Microtus agrestis</italic></kwd><kwd>Kielder</kwd><kwd>host</kwd><kwd>parasite</kwd><kwd>infectious disease</kwd><kwd>dynamics</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="2"/><ref-count count="133"/><page-count count="21"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Almost 90 years ago, Charles Elton drew attention to the potential importance of parasites
in the dynamics of natural populations (Elton, <xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">1924</xref>; Elton <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">1931</xref>). Nonetheless, for many decades in the 20th
century, both this and the dynamics of the parasites themselves were Cinderella subjects in
ecology, neglected in comparison with their sister interactions, predation and competition.
The tide was turning, though, in the 1970s and early 80s, and may be said to have done so
decisively with the publication of seminal papers by Anderson and May at that time (Anderson
and May, <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>; May and Anderson, <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>). However, these papers and many that followed were
theory-oriented, and field data with which to confront these theories were then &#x02013; and remain
still &#x02013; in relatively short supply.</p><p>In Liverpool in the 1990s, separate lines of research were being pursued on host&#x02013;parasite
dynamics in laboratory populations of moths (Begon <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>) and the distribution of a zoonotic pathogen,
cowpox virus, in natural populations of rodents (Crouch <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). There were obvious attractions in moving
from the laboratory to the field, in looking more deeply into the ecology of cowpox virus,
and in re-visiting host&#x02013;parasite dynamics in rodents, the favoured hosts of Charles Elton
(himself a Liverpudlian). Work was initially on bank voles (<italic>Myodes
glareolus</italic>) and wood mice (<italic>Apodemus sylvaticus</italic>) in woodland
habitats on the Wirral peninsula, near Liverpool, where both species exhibited clear annual
(autumn) peaks in abundance, but no demonstrable multi-annual patterns and indeed only
moderate variation in abundance from year to year (Hazel <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref69" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Then, from the early 2000s, the focus began
to shift to populations of field voles (<italic>Microtus agrestis</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>) in Kielder Forest on the England&#x02013;Scotland
border, living in grassland habitats and exhibiting multi-annual cycles in their abundance
(Lambin <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref78" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). These latter are the focus of this review.
However, where related work on bank voles and wood mice sheds light on the Kielder Forest
field vole system, this too is described. <fig id="fig01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>The field vole, <italic>Microtus agrestis</italic>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="S0031182014000171_fig1"/></fig></p><p>Studying hosts with cyclic dynamics offers two particular advantages in the context of
host&#x02013;parasite dynamics in natural populations. First, where the aim is to investigate the
role of parasites in driving host dynamics, it is necessary to know what is &#x02018;signal&#x02019; in
those dynamics (and hence liable to explanation) and what is simply noise. In cyclic systems
there is a clear dominance of signal over noise. Second, many key aspects of the dynamics of
the parasites themselves, including those concerned with transmission and host condition,
are dependent on host density. In order to have the statistical power to study these effects
in a natural population, a system must provide observations across a whole spectrum of
densities. Systems with cyclic dynamics are likely to do this and to do so in a predictable
way that allows scientific investigation to be planned, as highlighted by the extensive
research performed on another cyclic system, the Soay sheep of St Kilda (Clutton-Brock and
Pemberton, <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>BACKGROUND TO THE SYSTEM</title><p>The Kielder Forest area has a long history of being affected by irruptions of field voles,
sometimes of plague proportions (Elton <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">1935</xref>; Elton, <xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">1942</xref>). Indeed, some of the first steps in studying the population ecology of disease
by researchers in Charles Elton's Bureau of Animal Populations were made on field voles in
or near Kielder Forest (Chitty, <xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">1954</xref>, <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). The Liverpool group's move from studying local
bank voles and wood mice populations to work on the field voles of Kielder was greatly
facilitated by the initiation of a collaboration with Xavier Lambin's group at the
University of Aberdeen. Prior to the collaboration, the Aberdeen group had been
investigating the processes behind temporal and spatial dynamics of field voles (e.g.
Mackinnon <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref81" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), including the role of predators in shaping
spatial dynamics (Petty <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref97" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Sherratt, <xref rid="ref110" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), and had been utilizing both monitoring and field-experimental approaches
(Ergon <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">2001<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>b</italic>
</xref>; Graham and Lambin, <xref rid="ref68" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). In addition, a
study of raptor dynamics has entailed monitoring field vole abundance since 1983 (Petty,
<xref rid="ref96" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>) and thus the spatiotemporal dynamics of
field voles in Kielder have been exceptionally well characterized. Data reveal a pattern of
multi-annual fluctuation with peak vole densities occurring at a 3&#x02013;4 year interval, followed
by steep population collapses usually taking place in summer during the vole breeding
season, and followed by up to a year with little noticeable population growth (Lambin
<italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref78" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). The &#x02018;Chitty effect&#x02019; (Chitty, <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">1952</xref>; Boonstra and Krebs, <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>), whereby adults in the high-density phase of the population cycle
exhibit larger average body mass than during the low phase, is apparent in the Kielder field
voles, seemingly through prolonged growth periods rather than increased growth rates (Burthe
<italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Within a single grass patch, maximum
densities span 5&#x02013;770&#x000a0;voles&#x000a0;ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (Burthe <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), but at a landscape scale the span is
50&#x02013;220&#x000a0;voles&#x000a0;ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (Lambin <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>, <xref rid="ref78" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Mackinnon <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref81" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Critically, there is no evidence that voles
ever go extinct at any spatial scale in the system. This has implications for the dynamics
of species linked to voles, as neither predators nor pathogens are expected to experience
extinction&#x02013;recolonization dynamics in the system.</p><p>The population cycles are generally asynchronous among populations across Kielder, although
populations situated close together often fluctuate in a synchronous manner (Lambin
<italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Indeed, vole spatial dynamics in Kielder
Forest were, at least for a time, spatially organized in travelling waves (Lambin <italic>et
al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Bierman <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). These spatial dynamics, in addition to their
intrinsic interest, provide scope for substituting space for time in sampling host
populations at a range of densities.</p><p>The field voles have &#x02018;fast&#x02019; life histories typical of microtine rodents, with high
fecundity (an average litter size of five), a low age at maturation for some seasonal
cohorts (as little as 28 days old for spring- and early summer-born females), and birth
intervals by members of overlapping cohorts as short as 21 days during a breeding season.
The field vole breeding season, for the most part, coincides with the plant growing season.
However, for individuals born in the second half of the breeding season, reproduction is
typically delayed until the next spring. There is therefore a strong seasonality to
reproduction and the production of cohorts of susceptible individuals. Juveniles and
subadults, but also females breeding in the year of birth, have non-defended home ranges,
though overwintered females do tend to defend territories (Pusenius and Viitala, <xref rid="ref99" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). Dispersal is primarily by subadults. Thus there
is also a distinct seasonal pattern to the spatial range and the number of individuals with
whom individuals make potentially infectious contacts.</p><p>Kielder Forest is intensely managed for timber production. Hence, grassland areas are
restricted to roads, unplanted river margins and restock sites where dense grass cover
establishes 2&#x02013;3 years after rotational timber harvesting and persists for 10&#x02013;12 years after
planting. Restock sites are typically 5&#x02013;25&#x000a0;ha in size and are embedded in a matrix of dense
spruce plantation with no grass cover. The field vole is a grass-eating species that
therefore relies more than bank voles on well-vegetated areas. The bank vole, common shrew
(<italic>Sorex araneus</italic>) and pygmy shrew (<italic>Sorex minutus</italic>) share
many arthropod disease vectors and some pathogens with field voles and also mostly occupy
grassy areas, whereas wood mice use both the forested landscape matrix and the semi-isolated
grassland patches.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>THE DATASETS</title><p>Many of the Kielder studies used all or part of two datasets, and so the nature and
derivation of these are described first in outline. The one used most often was a
longitudinal, time series dataset (for full details see, for example, Burthe <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Field voles were trapped in four
similar-sized clear-cuts, in two areas of the forest approximately 12&#x000a0;km apart, between May
2001 and March 2007 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). Two sites in the
Kielder catchment, Kielder Site (KCS) and Plashett's Jetty (PLJ) are situated 4&#x000a0;km apart.
Two further sites in the adjacent Redesdale Forest catchment, Black Blake Hope (BHP) and
Rob's Wood (ROB), are 3&#x000b7;5&#x000a0;km apart. These four populations are far enough apart, with
sufficient forest between them, to be considered as effectively independent replicates.
Populations were trapped in &#x02018;primary&#x02019; sessions every &#x0223c;28 days from March to November, and
every &#x0223c;56 days from November to March. Each site had a permanent 0&#x000b7;3&#x000a0;ha live-trapping grid
consisting of 100 Ugglan Special Mousetraps (Grahnab, Marieholm, Sweden), in optimal habitat
dominated by <italic>Deschampsia caespitosa, Agrostis tenuis</italic> and <italic>Juncus
effusus</italic> grasses. Traps were set at 5&#x000a0;m intervals and baited with oats/wheat and
carrots. Traps were pre-baited 3 days before each trapping session, set at approximately
18:00 on the first day and checked five times (&#x02018;secondary sessions&#x02019;) at roughly 12&#x000a0;h
intervals, starting and ending at dawn and dusk, respectively. Mass, sex, body condition and
reproductive status (assigned according to the external appearance of reproductive organs)
was recorded at the time of first capture in each primary session. Individual animals were
identified using subcutaneous microchip transponders (AVID plc, East Sussex, UK) injected
into the skin at the back of the neck. Total population size was estimated by
capture&#x02013;recapture methods assuming a closed population, from data within a primary session.
<fig id="fig02" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Map of longitudinal (white, labelled) and cross-sectional (all) sites within Kielder
Forest and surrounding area.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="S0031182014000171_fig2"/></fig></p><p>A 20&#x02013;30&#x000a0;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L blood sample was taken from the tail tip of each individual
each primary session, usually in the first secondary session in which it was caught. These
provided the material for pathogen diagnoses and haematological measurements (see later
sections). The presence and (in some cases) the number and identity of ectoparasites were
also noted. In addition, the presence of external skin lesions characteristic of late-stage
vole tuberculosis (caused by the bacterium <italic>Mycobacterium microti</italic>, see
below) was noted in the field. Hence, in those cases where individuals were recaptured in
one or more primary sessions, the time course of infections in individuals and transitions
in individual status could be monitored, as well as the profiles of whole populations being
followed over time.</p><p>The second, cross-sectional dataset was derived from traps set bi-annually in March
(spring) and September (autumn) in 27 grass-dominated clear-cut sites (5&#x02013;12&#x000a0;ha) within the
three adjacent catchments of Kielder Forest (for full details see, for example, Telfer
<italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref122" ref-type="bibr">2007<italic>a</italic></xref>). This design used
&#x02018;destructive&#x02019; sampling methods, in which captured voles were euthanized. There were 12 sites
located in the Kielder catchment, 10 within the Kershope catchment and 5 sites within the
Redesdale catchment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). The minimum and
maximum inter-site distances were 0&#x000b7;4 and 36&#x000b7;9&#x000a0;km respectively. Within each clear-cut, small
mammals were sampled using the small quadrant design (Myllymaki <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref89" ref-type="bibr">1971</xref>): a 15&#x000d7;15&#x000a0;m trapping square was established in
good quality field vole habitat and three Ugglan traps were set at each corner. Other
procedures were as described for the longitudinal study.</p><p>An inherent disadvantage of cross-sectional destructive sampling is that it provides only a
snapshot of each host within the dynamics of a host&#x02013;parasite system; one cannot distinguish
causation from mere association, because all measurements are coincident. Nonetheless, a
major advantage of such methods is that additional data can be obtained from euthanized
individuals (e.g. larger blood volume, organ samples, confirmed reproductive status, etc.).</p><p>The dataset used for the immunological work, and also providing data for genetic studies
(see later sections), was separate from these (Jackson <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref74" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). It came from repeated trapping at two
spatially separate sites from February 2008 to March 2009 and a further two from April 2009
to March 2010, and had both longitudinal and cross-sectional components. Each site contained
a live-trapping grid (&#x0223c;0&#x000b7;375&#x000a0;ha) of 150 (10&#x000d7;15) regularly spaced traps (3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;m intervals)
placed in optimal habitat for the longitudinal study. There were also satellite transects on
each (with traps spaced at &#x02a7e;5&#x000a0;m intervals) from which 10 animals per month per site were
sampled destructively (to allow a wider range of immunological measurements) for the
cross-sectional component of the study. At each site, there were monthly trapping sessions
from February/April to November, during which capture&#x02013;recapture and destructive samples were
taken. Then, in November and again in the following March, larger numbers of animals were
destructively sampled both from the transects and from the grid habitats. Other procedures
were as described previously.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>EPIDEMIOLOGY OF INDIVIDUAL PATHOGENS</title><p>The Kielder field voles are subject to infection by a number of endemic micro- and
macroparasite species, of which the microparasite community has been the most extensively
studied (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab01">Table 1</xref>). Many of these species are
zoonotic or related to pathogens of medical or veterinary importance and include directly
transmitted and vector-borne pathogens, and the ectoparasitic vectors themselves. Here, we

populations (Baxby and Bennett, <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Despite its
name, cowpox virus rarely infects cattle and is actually most often diagnosed in domestic
cats (Cavanagh <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). The virus is also a zoonosis, although
human cases are rare (Baxby <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). Field voles, bank voles and wood mice
appear to be the primary reservoir hosts in the UK (Chantrey <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>), with Kielder field voles exhibiting a
prevalence of 28&#x02013;100%, peaking in mid to late summer (Burthe <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). A summer peak in seropositivity was also
observed in the Liverpool populations of bank voles and wood mice, though at lower
prevalences (Hazel <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref69" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Animals infected with the virus develop an
antibody response after around 2 weeks and remain infected for approximately 4 weeks
(Chantrey <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>).</p><p>Further analysis showed that both the number infected with cowpox virus and the
prevalence of infection increased with total population size (Begon <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">2009<italic>a</italic></xref>). However, whereas
previous work in bank voles had suggested a threshold abundance, below which infection was
not found (Begon <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), evidence for such a threshold in field
voles was at best equivocal, in spite of the wide range of abundances sampled (Begon
<italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">2009<italic>a</italic></xref>).</p><p>Field vole abundance was most strongly correlated with contemporary values of numbers
infected and prevalence. However, in the case of the numbers of susceptible hosts, the
strongest correlations were with values 1&#x02013;2 months preceding the values for numbers
infected and prevalence. Thus, in transfer function analyses (a statistical technique
aimed at identifying drivers of an output &#x02013; in this case, new infections &#x02013; in terms of
potential inputs), as epidemiological theory would predict, the number of &#x02018;susceptibles&#x02019;
(which &#x02018;drive&#x02019; new infections) were much more effective than those of total vole abundance
(of which susceptibles are only a component) in predicting future numbers infected.
Nonetheless, while monitoring the number of susceptible individuals has most to offer, the
results suggest that monitoring overall abundance, which is much more common and more
easily achieved, may nonetheless provide valuable insights into the dynamics of infection
(Begon <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">2009<italic>a</italic></xref>).</p><p>The seasonality of cowpox virus dynamics was examined further by Begon <italic>et
al.</italic> (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">2009<italic>b</italic></xref>). The timing
of seasonal peaks in new infection within the year was related to the multi-annual
patterns of abundance displayed by the voles, which in turn was associated with both the
number and the rate of recruitment of susceptible hosts. A plentiful and sustained supply
of susceptible hosts throughout the summer (March&#x02013;September), such as occurs in the
increase phase in the abundance cycle, gave rise to a steady increase in infected hosts
and a peak late in the year &#x02013; often October or November. However, a meagre supply of
susceptible hosts more limited in time, such as occurs in a crash year, was often
insufficient to sustain an increase in infected hosts, leading to an early peak, around
June, followed by a decline. This was in contrast to more predictable seasonal peaks seen
in some human infections (Stone <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref118" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), the lesson being that to understand
seasonal disease dynamics in wildlife populations, the dynamics of the hosts themselves
must be fully taken into account.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-2"><title>Vole tuberculosis</title><p>Vole tuberculosis (vole TB) is a chronic, endemic infection of field voles caused by

(Cavanagh <italic>et al.</italic>

<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Burthe <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">2008<italic>b</italic></xref>). Post-mortem examination
and culture of infected tissue samples from cross-sectional surveys indicated prevalence
over twice that based solely on external signs, with up to 50% of voles infected in some

<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Burthe <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">2008<italic>b</italic></xref>). Prevalence of infection
increased with vole mass (a proxy for age) and hence prevalence was highest in spring when
the population was mainly comprised of individuals over 6 months of age (Burthe <italic>et

in sheep and other livestock (Foggie, <xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">1949</xref>;
Hudson, <xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr">1950</xref>). In the 1990s, the zoonotic

<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>, <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Infection prevalence in Kielder field voles may reach 12% in late summer

<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>Of the two most commonly found ticks in Kielder (see <italic>Ticks</italic>, below),
transmission in small mammals appears to be at least predominantly via <italic>Ixodes

<italic>I. ricinus</italic> had no significant effect on infection prevalence in field
voles (Bown <italic>et al.</italic>

(Randolph, <xref rid="ref101" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). The great host-specificity of

<italic>I. ricinus</italic> is sympatric with <italic>I. trianguliceps</italic> in many

<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Telfer <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref124" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Interestingly, laboratory studies on

transmission to ticks to occur is restricted to a window of only 1&#x02013;4 days post infection
(Randolph, <xref rid="ref102" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). Infection prevalence may reach

during a blood meal, it develops in the flea hindgut before being shed in the feces.
Infection of a new vole host can then occur via fecal contamination of the skin, or
through accidental ingestion of fleas or their feces (Albright and Albright, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). However, a study in which flea prevalence was

widely held theoretical assumptions using empirical data, began on the Liverpool time
series. We initially performed a rather unsophisticated analysis of numbers of infected and
susceptible hosts to examine the transmission dynamics of cowpox virus (Begon <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>, <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). We examined dynamics within both wood mice and bank voles to ask, first,
whether the density-dependent mode of transmission conventionally assumed &#x02013; especially in
modelling studies &#x02013; for directly but not sexually transmitted infections, was in fact
appropriate (as opposed, for example, to frequency-dependence, where the contact rate
between hosts is assumed to remain constant irrespective of density). We also compared
transmission rates within and between species. This is important for two reasons: first, for
the insights it provides on whether coexisting wildlife hosts should be considered joint or
independent reservoirs of infection, and hence whether interspecific dilution or
amplification effects are possible (Begon, <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).
Second, it allows an assessment to be made from field data of the strength of &#x02018;apparent
competition&#x02019; in a host&#x02013;host&#x02013;pathogen system, whereas previously this has largely been the
subject of theoretical analysis (e.g. Begon and Bowers, <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). Aspects of the same questions were also examined by the analysis of
spatiotemporal cowpox data to assess, first within species, the spatial and temporal scales
over which an infectious individual poses a risk of infection to a susceptible one (Carslake
<italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). The same technique was then applied between
species (Carslake <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), in both cases asking, in essence, &#x02018;who
acquires infection from whom?&#x02019;.</p><p>The results called into serious question the assumption that susceptible and infectious
hosts mix at random and hence that transmission of cowpox virus is &#x02018;density-dependent&#x02019;. Our
time series analysis, for each species in isolation, indicated that frequency-dependent
transmission (conventionally assumed to apply to sexually transmitted diseases) was superior
to density-dependent transmission as a descriptor of the dynamics (Begon <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). A <italic>K</italic>-function analysis
confirmed that an infectious individual posed a measurable risk of infection for a period
roughly equal to the infectious period itself, about 4 weeks. It also indicated that this
risk was detectable only at spatial scales within the species&#x02019; known home ranges (Carslake
<italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). These results therefore suggest a rather
general conclusion, namely that random mixing may have been too readily assumed, and that
many diseases that are not sexually transmitted may nonetheless be socially transmitted,
with essentially the same transmission dynamics.</p><p>Moreover, the time series analysis of the two species together indicated that
between-species transmission was rare, in spite of the species occupying not only the same
general habitat but often even sharing burrows (Begon <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). The <italic>K</italic>-function analysis
confirmed this (Carslake <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Thus, for cowpox virus at least, bank voles
and wood mice act as effectively independent reservoirs. Similarly, while the potential for
apparent competition between bank voles and wood mice mediated by cowpox virus undoubtedly
exists, since the virus depresses the birth rate and possibly the survival of both host
species (see <italic>Fitness effects</italic> section), it is likely to be insignificant in
practice because the pathogen is so rarely transmitted from one species to the other.</p><p>A further study connected to these was carried out by Telfer <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="ref120" ref-type="bibr">2005<italic>a</italic></xref>) examining the interaction
between bank voles and wood mice and two of their shared pathogens, <italic>Bartonella
birtlesii</italic> and <italic>Bartonella taylorii</italic>, in Ireland. The prevalence of
both, which occur only in wood mice in Ireland, declined significantly with bank vole
density. Results were therefore consistent with there being a dilution effect (Norman
<italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref91" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>), a phenomenon which despite its high profile
and the recent controversy it has attracted (e.g. Randolph and Dobson, <xref rid="ref103" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) is still short of good case studies (see <italic>Fleas</italic>
section for an example of another possible dilution effect in Kielder).</p><p>Although the Kielder time series could not further our understanding of between-species
dynamics, focusing as it did on a single species, it was possible to use the field vole data
to examine much more thoroughly the question of the nature of the transmission function
itself (Smith <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref114" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Rather than simply comparing density- and
frequency-dependent transmission, the analysis asked where on the spectrum between density-
and frequency-dependence the true function might be, and also whether that functional form,
or indeed the strength of transmission itself, might vary seasonally. In fact, results
showed that, overall, transmission of cowpox virus amongst field voles was neither
frequency- nor density-dependent. On a scale encompassing 0 (density-dependence) and 1
(frequency-dependence), the observed value of the scaling exponent relating contact rate to
density was 0&#x000b7;62. This was significantly different from both 0 and 1 (credibility interval
0&#x000b7;49&#x02013;0&#x000b7;74), appropriate for a transmission function that increases linearly with host
density at lower densities (density-dependence) but tends to saturate as density increases
further (approaching frequency-dependence).</p><p>Furthermore, when models were examined that allowed parameters to vary seasonally, it
appeared, first, that transmission was more readily achieved in winter, perhaps because
susceptibility to infection is greatest then. Secondly, the overall picture of transmission
lying between density- and frequency-dependence seemed to be hiding a pattern in which
transmission was closer to density-dependence in the winter and closer to
frequency-dependence in the summer. This is plausible insofar as field voles defend
territories much more actively in the breeding season (summer), such that contact will be
with neighbours and hence relatively independent of overall density. In winter, mixing is
not so constrained, hence contact rates can indeed be expected to increase with density.
Repeatedly, therefore, these transmission studies, whether within or between species, have
emphasized that once data are collected from natural populations, conventional, widely held
assumptions may be found wanting.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>FITNESS EFFECTS OF INFECTION</title><p>The impact of endemic infections on the fitness of hosts in the wild is poorly understood,
with studies tending to be cross-sectional or to focus on epidemic or emerging infections.
Changes in host population dynamics may arise through impacts on host survival and/or
fecundity rates. Longitudinal, experimental and modelling work investigating the prevalence
of a suite of pathogens in field voles at Kielder has greatly advanced our understanding of
the impacts of endemic infections, indicating that negative fitness costs can be
biologically significant.</p><p>Evidence from Kielder suggests that endemic infections negatively impact field vole
survival. Individuals infected with cowpox virus had a 22% lower probability of survival
than uninfected individuals and, at the population level, survival rates were negatively
correlated with cowpox prevalence (Burthe <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">2008<italic>a</italic></xref>). There is also some
suggestion that TB has a negative impact on survival (Burthe <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">2008<italic>b</italic></xref>). While not statistically
significant, survival of voles following the appearance of an external lesion characteristic
of advanced vole tuberculosis tended to be lower than for voles without lesions. As
discussed earlier, diagnosis of disease based on lesions underestimates the prevalence of
infection and hence the negative impact of late-stage TB would be underestimated due to
individuals dying before presenting overt late-stage disease symptoms. A significant decline
in body condition of individuals at the time of appearance of the first external lesion
further suggests that TB may potentially impact individual fitness. Further effects of
infection on host condition are discussed in the next section.</p><p>Impacts on host reproduction by pathogens have proven difficult to evaluate due to
difficulties in assigning juveniles to parents and measuring reproductive success. However,
prevalence of trypanosomes was found to be highest in heavier (older) animals at first
capture compared with heavier recaptured animals suggesting that infected animals may be
less likely to become territory holders and therefore less likely to breed (Smith <italic>et
al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref111" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).</p><p>In related work on bank voles and wood mice in the Liverpool populations, cowpox virus
infection was both positively and negatively associated with survival, depending on the
season; survival rates increased with cowpox prevalence in the summer but decreased during
the winter (Telfer <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref119" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). This may be related to subtle interactions
with effects of cowpox virus on reproduction in these species. Female bank voles and wood
mice infected with cowpox virus have been shown to delay maturation, and therefore
reproduction, often until the following year (Telfer <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref121" ref-type="bibr">2005<italic>b</italic></xref>), a response also observed
in the laboratory (Feore <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref66" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). This delay in reproduction, and the
associated energetic costs saved, may be the reason for the increased survival rates for
cowpox-infected compared with non-infected individuals in summer.</p><p>Modelling work suggests that, theoretically, reduced or delayed fecundity following
recovery from infection can influence host population dynamics and induce multi-year cycles
if, due to infection, individuals miss the time-window for sexual maturation in their birth
year and are thus first able to reproduce the following spring (Smith <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref113" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). However, empirical investigation of
parameters such as variation in the onset of maturity in infected hosts relative to
uninfected hosts would be necessary to support this theoretical prediction.</p><p>As discussed in more detail below (see <italic>Co-infection</italic>), the field vole data
indicate clearly that infection with one pathogen may frequently imply co-infection with
others. The fitness consequences of infection with, say, cowpox virus, may therefore, in
practice, be the fitness consequences of infection with cowpox virus and all the other
parasites that are consequently more likely to be found in the same host. This sets limits
on the relevance of controlled experiments in the animal house on the effects of parasites
on host fitness. It also emphasizes that there may often be no clear link between the
clinical effects of an individual parasite species and the effects it has on host fitness in
statistical analyses carried out at the population level.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>HAEMATOLOGY AND MEASURES OF HOST CONDITION</title><p>Variation among individuals and populations in health status and immunocompetence (a host's
general ability to resist or tolerate infection) may influence parasite dynamics, as a
result of variable susceptibility to infection (see <italic>Immunology</italic> and
<italic>Genetics</italic> sections for studies on the immunological and genetic basis of
this variation). In human and veterinary medicine the health status of individuals is
routinely monitored by measuring selected physiological indices, and haematological
parameters are among the indices most extensively used. Nonetheless, the wealth of
information they can provide has not always been fully exploited in wildlife populations.</p><p>The cellular component of the blood consists of various cell types, each of which has a
different function and responds distinctively to infection, stress, nutritional deficit,
etc. Although the interpretation of these parameters requires caution, in general, red blood
cells (erythrocytes, RBCs) and lymphocytes are important indicators of general health and
condition, while the other white blood cells (WBCs) are components of different types of
immune responses (Tizard, <xref rid="ref126" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Low
concentrations of RBCs, caused by blood loss, haemolysis or decreased erythrocyte
production, result mainly from deficient nourishment and infection or parasitism (Stockham
and Scott, <xref rid="ref117" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Lymphocytes, the effectors of
acquired immunity, proliferate in response to antigenic stimuli and have a long lifespan in
blood, while their numbers decrease (lymphocytopenia) during immunosuppression by
glucocorticoids or immunosuppressive infections (Feldman <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Stockham and Scott, <xref rid="ref117" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Therefore, circulating levels of lymphocytes may be useful
indicators of current immunological investment. Of the remaining WBCs, blood concentrations
of neutrophils increase rapidly as a response to cytokines released during tissue injury and
bacterial infection (Tizard, <xref rid="ref126" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). They are
useful proxies for acute inflammatory responses as their levels return to normal soon after
antigenic stimulation ceases. Monocytes are found in high concentrations in subacute and
chronic inflammatory response caused by bacterial or protozoan infections (Feldman
<italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Tizard, <xref rid="ref126" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>).</p><p>By evaluating indices of health in wild populations, our knowledge of the dynamics of
health and infection may be understood more clearly. Beldomenico <italic>et al.</italic>
(<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">2008<italic>b</italic></xref>) investigated
haematological dynamics within the Kielder field voles, to determine environmental and host
factors associated with indicators of inflammatory response (counts of monocytes and
neutrophils) and of condition (lymphocyte and red blood cell counts). Individuals from three
field vole populations were sampled monthly for 2 years. Comparisons with individuals kept
under controlled conditions facilitated interpretation of field data (Beldomenico <italic>et
al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">2008<italic>b</italic></xref>).</p><p>In comparison with humans and domestic animals, which maintain their haematological
parameters within constant &#x02018;normal&#x02019; ranges while in health, these parameters appeared to be
highly variable in wild field voles. This may imply a more widespread distinction between
the range of environments experienced by individuals typically found in natural vertebrate
populations and those experienced under controlled or cosseted conditions. There was a
strong seasonal variation that persisted even after environmental and host factors usually
associated with blood cell count variation were considered in the analysis. There were three
well-characterized &#x02018;physiological&#x02019; seasons. The immunological investment appeared lowest in
winter (lowest lymphocyte counts), but red blood cells were at their highest levels and
indices of inflammatory response at their lowest, indicating a low infection risk during
this period. Spring, when acquisition of breeding territories is expected to lead to acute
competition for space and increased aggressive behaviour, was characterized by dramatic
changes, with a steep fall in red blood cell counts and peaks in indicators of inflammatory
response. During the course of summer&#x02013;autumn, the parameters gradually returned to their
previous levels; red blood cell counts recovered and the indicators of inflammatory response
decreased, while the immunological investment increased.</p><p>All the haematological parameters were lower in individuals in poor body condition and when
preceding population densities were higher. Moreover, the first pregnant females of the year
were those with higher values of the haematological metrics, emphasizing the important role
of energetics in population dynamics. Indeed, even when RBC counts were &#x02018;high&#x02019; in the field,
they were lower than in the near-optimal conditions of the animal house (abundant food and
low parasitism/infection), suggesting that voles in the natural populations were generally
resource and/or energy-limited, and they could therefore only increase their investment in,
for instance, neutrophils by a compensatory decrease in their investment in other functions
(e.g. the production of RBCs) (Beldomenico <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">2008<italic>b</italic></xref>).</p><p>Azurocytes (AZ) are lymphocytes specific to microtine rodents which closely resemble
natural killer (NK) cells. They are particularly common in late pregnancy and inducible by
progestins both in males and females (Mihok <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref87" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>; Mihok and Schwartz, <xref rid="ref86" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). Beldomenico <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">2008<italic>c</italic></xref>) found that the counts of AZ were indeed much
higher in pregnant females, and that these counts were positively correlated with past vole
density. Males had low prevalences and counts, both for breeding and non-breeding
individuals, but they showed a seasonality that varied with age, body condition, and current
and past vole density. Also, the occurrence of AZ in males was more likely after they had
had low levels of indicators of condition (see following section), suggesting that in males
these cells predominantly result from a response to infection.</p><p>The strong seasonal variation in health dynamics pinpoints the spring as a period of
increased vulnerability, both to infection and other causes of mortality. When population
densities have previously been low and body condition is good, female field voles begin
reproducing early (Ergon <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Preceding high densities are followed by a
negative impact on all blood cell types, except for AZ in females. Host condition in spring
may therefore not only reflect but also determine, in part, whether a year will be in an
increase or a decrease phase of the abundance cycle.</p></sec><sec id="sec8"><title>VICIOUS CIRCLES: SYNERGY BETWEEN CONDITION AND INFECTION</title><p>The previous section discussed effects of infection on host fitness and condition. Equally,
a host's condition may affect its propensity to become and to remain infected. Contact
between susceptible hosts and either infectious hosts, vectors or environmental reservoirs
is crucial in determining infection risk. However, following exposure to a pathogen, a
continuum of outcomes might be seen within a host, ranging from failure of the infection to
progress to overwhelmingly high infection intensity. The outcome may depend on
characteristics of the pathogen (e.g. strain, infective dose) or of the host (e.g. genotype,
condition).</p><p>As discussed earlier, the Kielder field voles exhibit characteristic periodic peaks
followed by declines, and these dynamics are associated with food shortage and poor
condition (Huitu <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref71" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). To test the hypothesis that poor host
condition increases infection risk, Beldomenico <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">2008<italic>a</italic></xref>) used longitudinal data from
replicated wild field vole populations to evaluate whether individuals with reduced
indicators of condition were more likely to become infected. Because the community of
obligate and facultative parasites to which field voles are exposed is highly diverse,
exhaustively testing for all infections is impossible. To overcome this problem, initially
generic indices that capture the physiological response to infection were used. Elevated
neutrophil counts (neutrophilia) are an indication of acute inflammatory response associated
with bacterial infection, and high monocyte counts (monocytosis) are expected in subacute
and chronic inflammatory response caused by infections with bacteria or protozoans (Feldman
<italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). In addition, low peripheral lymphocyte
counts (lymphocytopenia, an indication of immunosuppression or poor immunological
investment) or low red blood cell (RBC) counts (anaemia, an indication of poor aerobic
capacity) were used as haematological indicators of condition (see
<italic>Haematology</italic>). The results showed that poor condition increases the
probability of infection: individuals with anaemia and lymphocytopenia had increased
probabilities of developing monocytosis and higher increments in neutrophils when re-sampled
4 weeks later (Beldomenico <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">2008<italic>a</italic></xref>).</p><p>The results above provide evidence supporting Lochmiller's hypothesis (Lochmiller, <xref rid="ref79" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>), which states that opportunistic pathogens take
advantage of altered host immunocompetence (see <italic>Immunology</italic> section for
further discussion on the concept of immunocompetence) during stress periods, consequently
regulating wild animal populations. To test this hypothesis in the Kielder system,
Beldomenico <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">2009<italic>a</italic></xref>) carried out a nested case-control study that assessed
whether susceptible individuals (those who had never had cowpox) with poorer body condition
(low degree of fat and muscle cover) had higher probabilities of contracting cowpox over a
4-week period. The results were particularly striking for males. For males caught at the
same time, a susceptible individual with poor body condition was twice as likely to contract
cowpox as a susceptible male with good body condition; if this individual was also anaemic,
the chances were almost quadrupled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). This
result supported Lochmiller's hypothesis, and further demonstrated that it holds not only
for opportunistic pathogens, but here for an endemic virus. <fig id="fig03" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Predicted probability of seroconverting for male field voles from Kielder. Variation

host, it will not only result in greater propensity to becoming infected of those that are
in poorer condition; it may also cause infections of higher intensity, thus resulting in
individuals that suffer a more severe disease and are a more significant source of
infection. Beldomenico <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">2009<italic>b</italic></xref>) assessed this hypothesis by investigating the temporal
relationship between host condition and intensity of infection by the protozoan
<italic>Trypanosoma</italic> (<italic>Herpestoma</italic>) <italic>microti</italic> in
wild field vole populations. The individuals that developed high levels of parasitaemia were
those that had very low lymphocyte counts one month previously.</p><p>As noted above, not only can poor host condition predispose individuals to infection;
infection itself can have a detrimental effect on condition. Besides their specific
pathogenic effects, parasites extract host resources and induce a nutritionally demanding
immune response (Sheldon and Verhulst, <xref rid="ref108" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>;
Lochmiller and Deerenberg, <xref rid="ref80" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). There is a clear
potential for synergy: poor condition predisposes individuals to infections, which further
reduces the condition of the host, which further predisposes the host to infection, and so
on. Thus, as previously noted, at the individual level, low haematological indicators of
condition precede elevated levels of haematological indicators of infection in wild field
voles. However, those individuals with high indicators of infection subsequently experience
a decline in their indicators of condition (Beldomenico <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">2008<italic>a</italic></xref>). Furthermore, because
individuals in poorer condition are expected to have infections of greater intensity, the
resulting deterioration in condition is likely to be even more marked for infections in
individuals with a preceding impoverished condition. This was supported by our study on
trypanosome dynamics: field voles with decreased indicators of immunological investment
developed high intensities of <italic>T. microti</italic> parasitaemia, and subsequently,
further declines of these indicators were observed (Beldomenico <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">2009<italic>b</italic></xref>).</p><p>The above suggests that small initial differences in host condition caused by resource
shortage, competition etc. can become exaggerated and populations might become &#x02018;polarized&#x02019;
into the weak and the strong (Beldomenico and Begon, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Vicious circles emerge, whereby an individual with an impoverished condition
is more prone to developing infections, which are also more likely to be severe; in turn,
this results in further deterioration in condition that can eventually and substantially
affect its performance and survival. At the population level, a high proportion of
individuals in poor condition may cause both a large number of infections and more severe
infections, resulting in pathogen exposure dose being greater, with a consequential greater
impact on host dynamics (Beldomenico and Begon, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Similar results have been reported in other systems including an
observational study on fish (Blanchet <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and a field-experimental study on mice
(Pedersen and Greives, <xref rid="ref95" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>These reciprocal effects between host condition and infection might indeed be the mechanism
by which parasites exert a control on their host populations, as hosts tend to be more
stressed and in poorer condition (thus becoming more vulnerable to their parasites) when
their densities are high (Huitu <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref71" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Beldomenico <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">2008<italic>b</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec9"><title>CO-INFECTION</title><p>While most of the studies at Kielder have focused, as they have in other systems, on a
single species of pathogen (and of host), there is no doubt that most hosts, most of the
time, are infected by a multiplicity of parasites and pathogens. Questions naturally arise,
therefore, regarding the effects of one infection on another. Indeed, some such effects may
also occur when infections are consecutive rather than simultaneous. The probability,
intensity and length of one infection may be altered by the presence of, or repercussions
from, another, as may any effects on host fitness. The idea of &#x02018;vicious circles&#x02019; (above)
carries within it the implicit acknowledgement that individual infections cannot be
considered in isolation.</p><p>Experiments in laboratory model systems have demonstrated effects of co-infection on host
susceptibility, infection length, and intensity and clinical signs. Studies in wildlife
populations and humans, while establishing firmly that positive and negative associations
can occur between parasites, have tended to be cross-sectional, with each host providing
infection data at one time point only. The time of initial infection is unknown in such
studies. There is, therefore, limited scope for determining whether patterns reflect
inherent differences between hosts in either susceptibility or exposure to infection, rather
than interactions (Telfer <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref124" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), or for exploring the impact of infection
sequence (Jackson <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref72" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Consequently, in natural populations, the
relative importance of interspecific interactions, compared with other factors, in
determining the dynamics and structure of parasite communities is only poorly understood.</p><p>Telfer <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="ref125" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) used the
field vole dataset to examine individual infection risks for a community of microparasites
consisting of cowpox virus, <italic>Babesia microti</italic>, the
<italic>Bartonella</italic> species taken as a group and <italic>A.
phagocytophilum</italic>. Infection risk will depend on both the probability of encountering
an infectious dose and the probability of infection given exposure (host susceptibility).
The aim was to determine whether susceptibility to infection by one microparasite species
was influenced by others. Therefore, for each microparasite, the study investigated whether
the other microparasites influenced the probability that a susceptible animal
<italic>became</italic> infected at a given time point (<italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>). It
did so by adding infection status for these other pathogens as explanatory variables to
baseline statistical models that accounted for environmental and individual variables (sex,
season etc.). This method minimizes the risk of detecting spurious associations, which, in
reality, reflect correlated exposure risk (e.g. a positive association simply because both
parasites are most prevalent in late summer).</p><p>It was apparent that this community of parasites represents an interconnected web of
interactions: effects of other infections on infection risk were both strong and widespread,
and connectance within the parasite community was exceptionally high, with evidence detected
for all possible pair-wise interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>).
Both positive and negative associations were detected, and their magnitude was frequently
considerable: up to 5&#x000b7;5-fold increases in risk and reductions in the odds of becoming
infected of the order of 15% compared with uninfected individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>). Indeed, perhaps most strikingly, in all cases except for
cowpox, infection with other parasite species explained more variation in infection risk
than factors related to exposure risk and host condition, such as age and season. Moreover,
the sizes of the effects of other parasites on infection risk were also similar to, and
frequently greater than, other factors. For example, of all the non-infection variables,
season generally had the largest effect on infection risk, with seasonal increases in
infection probability ranging from approximately 3-fold (<italic>A.
phagocytophilum</italic>) to 15-fold (<italic>B. microti</italic>); but these were broadly
matched by the magnitude of infection effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig.
4</xref>). These results are not explicable by simple co-occurrence of infections in hosts
in poor condition since, for a subset of the data, individual variation in indices of host
body and haematological condition at the time of infection were explicitly accounted for,
and there was no evidence of any reduction in the strength of between-parasite interactions.

parasites are capable of exerting immunomodulatory effects on wild rodents, and release from
effective control by the immune system is perhaps therefore the most likely explanation,
especially when supported by experimental studies. For example, laboratory studies have
indicated the importance of immunomodulation for host exploitation by pox viruses (Seet

<xref rid="ref107" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), which may explain the positive effect of
cowpox virus on susceptibility to other parasites. The same immune-mediated mechanisms might
also account for an earlier demonstration that cowpox virus increases the length of
<italic>Bar. taylorii</italic> infections (Telfer <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref124" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Thus, mechanisms responsible for increasing
susceptibility may also prolong infections in those that do succumb.</p><p>Strong reductions in susceptibility caused by other infections were also observed. The
largest effect overall was reduced susceptibility to <italic>Bartonella</italic> spp. in
individuals infected with <italic>Bab. microti</italic>, and was especially apparent in
chronically infected animals, where the odds of infection were 15% of those of uninfected
animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>). Resource depletion may play a role
here, as both species target erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab01">Table
1</xref>). Alternatively, negative effects may reflect up-regulation of mediators of a
cross-effective Th1 response and therefore could represent an example of immunologically
driven ecological interference (see <italic>Immunology</italic> and
<italic>Genetics</italic> sections, below).</p><p>The study by Telfer <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrates, therefore, that communities of
microparasites are structured by strong interactions between species, providing the first
evidence from natural populations that such interactions can be driven by effects on
susceptibility and have as much impact on infection risk as more commonly considered factors
such as host age and season. As field voles are also infected by macroparasites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab02">Table 2</xref>), as well as other microparasites, it is
likely that the identified relationships represent just one part of an even larger web of
interactions. These results also emphasize that the standard practice of classifying
individuals in natural populations as infected or uninfected by one parasite alone fails to
recognize that much more may be implied by the categorization &#x02018;infected&#x02019;. For example, as we
note above, cowpox virus infection has been associated with major reductions in survival and
fecundity. However, in the co-infection study, 39% of those infected with cowpox virus were
also infected with <italic>B. microti</italic>, 65% of the remainder had
<italic>Bartonella</italic> spp. infections, and overall, 79% were co-infected with at least
one of the three microparasites considered. Clearly, even when significant associations
between a given infection and host fitness are detected in a wildlife host, attributing the
effect to that parasite alone may be unjustified.</p><p>A subsequent study applied more sophisticated and novel statistical techniques to the
dataset from March 2005&#x02013;March 2007 and dealt separately with three
<italic>Bartonella</italic> species, <italic>Bartonella doshiae, B. grahamii</italic> and
<italic>B. taylorii</italic> (Sherlock <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref109" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). While broadly confirming previous findings,
this new analysis highlighted some possible discrepancies with previous analyses. Once
again, <italic>Bab. microti</italic> increased the likelihood of contracting all three
<italic>Bartonella</italic> species, whether the <italic>B. microti</italic> infection was
acute or chronic. This time, moreover, <italic>B. microti</italic> was also seen to decrease
the chances of recovery from all three <italic>Bartonella</italic> infections: that is,
<italic>Bartonella</italic> infections were longer when <italic>B. microti</italic> was
also present. This had previously also been suggested in the case of <italic>Bar.
taylorii</italic> (Telfer <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref124" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). It is important to recognize that the
consequences of one infection extending the length of another &#x02013; in terms of the period of
time host fitness may be affected and the parasite transmitted &#x02013; may easily be as profound
as those of simply increasing susceptibility. In this subsequent study, however, there was
no evidence of the reverse interaction: <italic>Bartonella</italic> increasing
susceptibility to <italic>B. microti</italic>. This runs counter to the Telfer <italic>et
al.</italic> (<xref rid="ref125" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) study and suggests that the
effect of <italic>Bartonella</italic> on <italic>B. microti</italic> noted by the authors
may be a statistical artefact arising from the extremely strong effects of <italic>B.
microti</italic> on <italic>Bartonella</italic> (Sherlock <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref109" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>This study also allowed interactions among different, co-infecting
<italic>Bartonella</italic> species to be examined for the first time. Notably, voles that
had previously been infected with <italic>B. taylorii</italic> were less likely to contract
infections of either <italic>B. grahamii</italic> or <italic>B. doshiae</italic>. The
suggestion that this positive interaction between the species may be the result of
cross-immunity is supported by evidence from the analysis of an effective immune response to
<italic>Bartonella</italic> infections more generally: voles previously infected with
either <italic>B. grahamii</italic> or <italic>B. taylorii</italic> were less likely to
re-contract the same infection. This in turn makes the more general point that patterns of
co-infection, particularly in longitudinal data, can suggest or even support particular
processes giving rise to them, but understanding co-infection is likely, ultimately, to
require those processes to be examined directly. One important class of processes, those
acting through the immune system, is examined next.</p></sec><sec id="sec10"><title>IMMUNOLOGY</title><p>Traditionally, research into wildlife immunology has concentrated on broad definitions and
single measurements of &#x02018;immunocompetence&#x02019; (such as phytohaemagglutinin-induced swelling).
However, as we have discussed in previous sections, host&#x02013;pathogen interactions are dynamic
and context dependent; &#x02018;resistance&#x02019; is therefore unlikely to be accurately represented by a
single, simplified immunological measure (Demas <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Post-genomic technologies now allow us to
define immune variability much more precisely in naturally occurring non-model organisms and
move beyond this simplified view of immunocompetence. Wild rodents, in particular, represent
an exciting model for this expanded &#x02018;wild immunology&#x02019; as researchers can capitalize on the
immunological and genetic resources developed for laboratory rodents. Thus, measurements of
the expression of genes or gene products underpinning immunological traits may be linked to
environmental causes and to life history consequences for the individual. In the Kielder
field voles, where responses to infection have been the central interest, we have focused on
variability in the immune system as the possible key to individual variation in the response
to infection.</p><p>Our approach to measurement has made a break from traditional ecological immunology
(Bradley and Jackson, <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) by considering immune
function explicitly from a perspective derived from studies of the laboratory mouse. Thus,
the immune system is considered as a multi-faceted defensive apparatus with different arms
that drive different types of immune responses. For example, this includes the different
T-helper (Th) cell phenotypes: Th1 cells drive responses against intracellular microbes, Th2
cells those against macroparasites, Th17 cells drive responses against extracellular
bacteria, and regulatory Th cells exert immunosuppressive responses (Reiner, <xref rid="ref104" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). These different arms of the immune system may
trade-off with each other and with other life history components for resources and there may
also be complex functional cross-talk (cross-regulation) within the immune system itself and
between immune responses and other traits.</p><p>The broad aim of the Kielder immunology studies has been to analytically decompose immune
system function through measurements of different effector arms and to link these
measurements to environmental causes and life history responses. Developing appropriate
measurement strategies is a central difficulty, though, in analysing the immune system in
naturally occurring non-model organisms. In our initial studies we were hampered by the lack
of species-specific antibody reagents and by a deficit of genomic information for <italic>M.
agrestis</italic>. However, by <italic>de novo</italic> sequencing using traditional PCR
methods, we were able to design real-time PCR expression assays for a panel of immunological
genes reflecting different immunological pathways (Jackson <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref74" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). These measurements were used both on
<italic>in vivo</italic> (peripheral blood) samples from repeat-sampled animals and in
cultured splenocytes from destructively sampled animals. Culturing of splenocytes allowed
stimulation of the cells with defined stimulants (e.g. mitogen, Toll-like receptor (TLR)
agonists), in order to selectively stimulate immunological pathways and cell populations and
measure latent (un-deployed) responsiveness (Jackson <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref74" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>We combined these measurement approaches with interwoven longitudinal and cross-sectional
sampling protocols in replicated habitats (see <italic>Datasets</italic>), for which
detailed infection and biometric variables were recorded, in addition to immunological
measurements. This hybrid study design exploited the respective strengths of the different
types of sampling: on the one hand, destructive cross-sectional sampling allows a wider
range of more precise immunological, biometric and infection measurements; on the other,
longitudinal sampling allows stronger inference of cause and effect (cause typically
preceding effect in time series data).</p><p>A preliminary proof-of-concept study based on a single season of cross-sectional data
(2008&#x02013;2009) from two field sites discovered significant non-periodic temporal trends in
immune gene expression (Jackson <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref74" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Expression of interferon regulatory factor 5
(<italic>Irf5</italic>), which is important in anti-viral and pro-inflammatory
anti-microbial responses (Paun <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref93" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), declined across the study period. Some other
genes, including transforming growth factor beta 1 (<italic>Tgfb1</italic>; a regulatory
cytokine) and interleukin 2 (<italic>Il2</italic>), interferon gamma (<italic>Ifng</italic>)
and T-box 21 (<italic>Tbx21</italic>/<italic>Tbet</italic>) (each involved in Th1 responses)
showed expression that was higher in the winter of 2009 than the preceding winter. Both of
these observations suggest systematic differences in environmental pressures on the immune
system from year to year. Other variation (for example, expression of interleukin-1&#x003b2;
[<italic>Il1b</italic>], involved in innate inflammatory responses) followed a pattern not
inconsistent with a predictable annual/seasonal oscillation, although this would require
corroboration in a longer time series. At the level of individuals we have found negative
associations between the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators (<italic>Ifng,
Il1b</italic>) and some individual condition indices (haematocrit and organ weight residuals
on body length). This might, in part, reflect a cost of resistance mediated by inflammation
or the adverse effect of immunogenic infections themselves. We also found significant
variation between life history stages (especially between immature and mature males and
between pregnant and other females).</p><p>In the first instance, this early analysis (which did not consider infection variables) has
shown that the measurement approaches we adopted can identify systematic variation in the
immune expression patterns of populations and individuals. It will be the aim of our future
work to use longer observational time series (a full 2 years of cross-sectional and
longitudinal immune expression, biometric and infection data are currently available) and
experimental field manipulations to link this variation to its environmental drivers and to
its consequences for co-infection patterns and life history traits in individuals. In doing
so we will begin to better understand the immune system as a complex trait within an
ecological context, but may also be able to use immune expression responses as biomarkers to
track important ecological processes. Indeed, as our analyses have progressed to consider
our full 2-year &#x02018;immunodynamics&#x02019; dataset in the light of infection variables, a key finding
has related to the immunological basis of disease tolerance to some infection types in wild
field voles (Jackson <italic>et al.</italic> submitted). Disease tolerance is a defence
mechanism whereby the host endures infection whilst minimizing the damage caused by the
pathogen itself or by the host's own immune response (Ayres and Schneider, <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Medzhitov <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref85" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). This is distinct from disease resistance,
where the host actively detects and eliminates pathogens, in that tolerance has no obvious
effect on pathogen burden. Although the mechanisms of resistance are well understood, there
is still relatively little known about the natural ability of animals to tolerate infection.
Studies of natural populations are thus likely to provide a great many insights into this
somewhat neglected defence mechanism (Turner and Paterson, <xref rid="ref127" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>The results briefly described in this section have begun to identify important processes in
host&#x02013;parasite relationships that result from variation in immune function and were not
immediately apparent from a simpler focus on just the parasites and the hosts themselves. In
the future, continuing development of immunological methods for <italic>M. agrestis</italic>
and the possibility to monitor the expression of many more genes using RNAseq, very high
throughput Q-PCR and bioplexing are likely to further extend our understanding of the
strategic role of the immune system within life history variation.</p></sec><sec id="sec11"><title>GENETICS, SELECTION AND DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY</title><p>It is now well established that genetic diversity underlies a substantial component of the
variation in susceptibility to infectious disease observed in natural populations. Just as
they have for immunological studies, laboratory rodents have proved an invaluable resource
in the discovery and functional annotation of genes involved in immunity to infection.
However, although these animals are well-established functional genetic models, they differ
from natural populations &#x02013; including those of humans &#x02013; in several important ways. First,
laboratory rodents are generally inbred and therefore lack the genetic diversity of natural
populations; second, genetic variation between laboratory strains is driven by selective
breeding and deliberate mutations of the genome, rather than natural selection and genetic
drift in the wild; third, laboratories provide homogeneous, comfortable and largely sterile
environments with none of the pressures of the natural environment (for example, suboptimal
nutrition, fluctuating climate, predation, competition etc.); and finally, laboratory
infection experiments have tended to concentrate on single infections, whereas individuals
in the natural environment are likely to experience multiple simultaneous or sequential
infections by a taxonomically diverse set of parasites. Because of this lack of ecological
validity, functional laboratory studies &#x02013; while providing numerous mechanistic insights &#x02013;
offer few insights into the causes and consequences of natural genetic diversity, or the
role of natural selection in the maintenance of variation in immune function and disease
resistance. Wild rodents, in contrast, are related to laboratory rodents already
well-established as genetic models and yet provide a much more realistic ecological model of
human and other natural populations. They have therefore been put forward as a novel model
to utilize and build on the genetic resources gained from their laboratory cousins, thus
providing biomedically relevant yet ecologically valid insights into the genetic
determinants of immunity and infectious disease susceptibility (Turner and Paterson, <xref rid="ref127" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>In an attempt to broaden the immunogenetic research traditionally conducted on laboratory
rodents to natural populations, Turner <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="ref128" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) used the longitudinal and cross-sectional system of Jackson
<italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="ref74" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) (see
<italic>Immunology</italic> and <italic>Datasets</italic>) to examine the genetic
diversity within a number of Kielder field vole immune genes.</p><p>Turner <italic>et al.</italic> concentrated primarily on cytokines, signalling molecules
that facilitate communication between immune cells and which are crucial in the induction
and polarization of immune responses. Despite the breadth of genetic research into cytokines
in human and laboratory studies, there have thus far been relatively few studies on
wildlife, where the overwhelming majority of immunogenetic studies have concentrated on the
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (Acevedo-Whitehouse and Cunningham, <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).</p><p>The little previous research on the impact of cytokine genetic variation on parasite
resistance in natural populations had concentrated on non-coding regions of a single gene,
<italic>Interferon gamma</italic> (Coltman <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Ezenwa <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In their study, Turner <italic>et
al.</italic> (<xref rid="ref128" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) examined genetic polymorphism
within protein-coding regions of a number of immune loci, and its association with
individual variation in both immune responses and susceptibility to endemic pathogens. The
authors utilized multiple regression methods to first control for confounding non-genetic
factors, many of which were identified in the immunodynamics study of Jackson <italic>et
al.</italic> (<xref rid="ref74" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Turner <italic>et al.</italic>
demonstrated strong associations between genetic polymorphism within three cytokines
(<italic>Interleukin 1 beta</italic> [<italic>Il1b</italic>], <italic>Il2</italic> and
<italic>Il12b</italic>) and individual variation in immune responses, as measured through
expression levels of multiple immune genes. Following this, the authors hypothesized that if
genetic variation at cytokine loci affects immune responses, it would likely also impact
upon susceptibility to pathogens. To test this, Turner <italic>et al.</italic> again first
controlled for possible confounding factors, and subsequently found that the same three
genes associated with variation in immune responses &#x02013; <italic>Il1b, Il2</italic> and
<italic>Il12b</italic> &#x02013; were also strongly associated with variation in susceptibility to
a number of endemic micro- and macroparasites. The magnitude of the genetic effects on both
immune responses and pathogen resistance were of comparable size to non-genetic factors that
are commonly acknowledged as important in natural studies of infection, such as age and sex.
Importantly, given the importance of simultaneous infections in the Kielder voles (see
<italic>Co-infection</italic>), all genetic effects remained after addition of
co-infecting parasites to the models as explanatory variables. Moreover, the fact that these
genes were associated with resistance to a taxonomically diverse range of natural pathogens
(bacteria, protozoa, helminths and arthropod ectoparasites) demonstrates the value of
examining such genetic relationships in the wild, in contrast to laboratory studies that
typically focus on single experimental infections (Turner <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref128" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). For example, pleiotropic and apparently
antagonistic effects of genetic variation were noted, with genetic variants simultaneously
associated with an increased likelihood of infection with one parasite and a decreased
chance of infection by another, a trade-off which has also been noted among different
laboratory mouse genotypes (Pedersen and Babayan, <xref rid="ref94" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). This suggests that the advantage conferred on the host by a &#x02018;protective&#x02019;
genotype against one pathogen depends greatly on the context of the local pathogen
community.</p><p>Understanding how the considerable heterogeneity among individuals in immune function and
disease susceptibility is generated and maintained is a central question in evolutionary
biology. In a complementary study to that above, Turner <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="ref129" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) therefore examined the role of natural selection
in shaping diversity within field vole immune genes. Using a range of population genetic
techniques they discovered signatures of natural selection acting on several cytokine and
TLR genes. Of particular note was that high levels of genetic diversity observed within
<italic>Il1b</italic> and <italic>Il2</italic> genes, both of which were strongly
associated with variation in immune function and pathogen susceptibility, appear to have
been maintained via balancing selection (a term encompassing any type of natural selection
which acts to maintain genetic variation). There are several forms of balancing selection
(including overdominance and frequency-dependent selection) and disentangling which
mechanism(s) are the most important is challenging (Spurgin and Richardson, <xref rid="ref116" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). However, as pathogen abundances vary
spatiotemporally in Kielder Forest (see for example Cavanagh <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Telfer <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref122" ref-type="bibr">2007<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref rid="ref123" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>b</italic>
</xref>), there are likely to be multiple pathogen-specific &#x02013; and often competing &#x02013;
selection pressures acting concurrently. As such, fluctuating selection for different
alleles at different points in space and/or time is the most likely mechanism driving the
maintenance of polymorphism at these loci, particularly given the antagonistic and
pleiotropic effects of genetic variation observed (Turner <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref128" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, <xref rid="ref129" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Integration of the findings of the two studies by Turner <italic>et
al.</italic> therefore provides robust, corroborative evidence that genetic diversity at
cytokine loci has a discernible effect on susceptibility to a number of infectious diseases,
via cytokine-mediated modulation of host immune phenotypes. In turn, as has been commonly
reported for genes within the MHC (Piertney and Oliver, <xref rid="ref98" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Spurgin and Richardson, <xref rid="ref116" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>),
cytokine genetic diversity is then maintained through the action of pathogen-mediated
balancing selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>). <fig id="fig05" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 5.</label><caption><p>Causes and consequences of immunogenetic variation in Kielder voles. Polymorphism

perhaps two major motivations (Begon, <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). First,
a fundamental desire to understand the ecological importance of the interactions between
hosts and their parasites and, second, a more applied goal of understanding the dynamics of
rodent reservoirs and their pathogens in order to practice disease control. In the first
case, the work at Kielder, and indeed the work on bank voles and wood mice that spawned it,
has made important connections between theoretical and conceptual ideals and the realities
of the living world. Traditional dogmas and real data have been brought into contact with
one another with regard, for example, to transmission functions, cross-species transmission,
apparent competition, co-infection and the place of parasites in the web of a host's
interactions more generally. In the second case, while many of the focal parasites have been
zoonotic in principle, their public health importance in the UK has been limited.
Nonetheless, techniques and approaches developed at Kielder have proved their value, and
their transferability, when applied elsewhere, most notably perhaps to the plague&#x02013;gerbil
system in Central Asia (e.g. Davis <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>, <xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>With the advent of genomic technologies and the continued rise of ecological (&#x02018;wild&#x02019;)
immunology (Sheldon and Verhulst, <xref rid="ref108" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>;
Schulenburg <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref106" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Martin <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref82" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Pedersen and Babayan, <xref rid="ref94" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), a further motivation has now emerged: to expand traditional
genetic and immunological research beyond laboratory models and into the natural world.
There is an increasing recognition that fields that developed in relative isolation, such as
molecular biology, ecology, immunology, epidemiology and evolutionary biology are not as
distinct as they once appeared (Schmid-Hempel, <xref rid="ref105" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Adopting an integrative approach to research, utilizing knowledge and
resources from several fields, presents an excellent opportunity to bridge the gap between
laboratory studies and the natural world and to better understand the nature of
host&#x02013;parasite interactions on many levels. We hope that the long-term, multidisciplinary
research on the Kielder field voles and other natural systems will continue to provide fresh
insights relevant not only to evolutionary biology and ecology, but also to conservation
biology and biomedical science.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We are pleased to acknowledge the contributions of all those who have been involved in the
