Yet, unlike the blood vasculature, the tools available to interrogate the molecular basis of lymphatic dysfunction/disease have been lacking. More recently, investigators have reported that dysregulation of the PI3K pathway is involved in syndromic human diseases that involve abnormal lymphatic vasculatures, but there have been few compelling results that show the direct association of this molecular pathway with lymphatic dysfunction in humans. Using near-infrared fluorescence lymphatic imaging (NIRFLI) to phenotype and next generation sequencing (NGS) for unbiased genetic discovery in a family with non-syndromic lymphatic disease, we discovered a rare, novel mutation in <italic>INPPL1</italic> that encodes the protein SHIP2, which is a negative regulator of the PI3K pathway, to be associated with lymphatic dysfunction in the family. <italic>In vitro</italic> interrogation shows that SHIP2 is directly associated with impairment of normal lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) behavior and that SHIP2 associates with receptors that are associated in lymphedema, implicating its direct involvement in the lymphatic vasculature.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in parts by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants R01 HL092923, R01 CA128919, U54 CA136404 and The Texas Star Award (EMS-M) and R01 HL096498 (PDK).

Indeed, many prevalent diseases and conditions (including cancer metastasis, diabetes, asthma, obesity, and autoimmune disorders) are thought to be impacted by aberrant lymphangiogenesis or lymphatic dysfunction <xref rid="pone.0112548-Karpanen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112548-Mortimer1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Genetic studies of rare congenital lymphatic disorders provide an opportunity to identify key molecular mechanisms that may be contributory to more common conditions and disorders. From candidate gene studies, causal genes including <italic>FOXC2, FLT4, SOX18, CCBE1, GJC2, GATA2, KIF11, RASA1</italic>, and <italic>VEGFC</italic> have thus far been associated with lymphatic malformations and congenital lymphedema that generally presents with variable penetrance and expressivity, often late in life <xref rid="pone.0112548-Fang1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112548-Gordon1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Yet the majority of patients diagnosed with lymphatic abnormalities do not possess mutations in these genes.</p><p>One confounding limitation to the study of human lymphatic disorders arises from the lack of diagnostic methods to image the lymphatic vasculature. As a result, diagnoses of rare, lymphatic disorders are not generally made on the basis of abnormal lymphatic architecture or dysfunction, but rather on the late-stage sequelae of fluid imbalances, such as irresolvable edema, chylothorax, or chylous ascites. Edematous symptoms typically appear at birth (termed congenital lymphedema), at puberty (termed <italic>praecox</italic> lymphedema), or late in life, usually following a minor challenge to the immune system (termed <italic>en tarda</italic> lymphedema). As a consequence of the variable expressivity, the inaccuracy of phenotyping based upon overt symptoms can limit the association with a found genotype and therefore impede discovery of gene variants involved in lymphatic (dys)function.</p><p>Herein, in an effort to discover novel genetic mutations that contribute to lymphatic disease, we used next generation sequencing (NGS) for unbiased gene search and near-infrared fluorescence lymphatic imaging (NIRFLI) to phenotype family members and discovered that a mutation in the inositol polyphosphate phosphatase-like 1 (<italic>INPPL1</italic>) gene that encodes SH2-domain containing 5&#x02032;-inositol phosphatase-2 (SHIP2) may be associated with lymphatic abnormalities in a nucleus family of varied expressivity of lymphedema. When the identified SHIP2 mutation was combined with a damaging mutation in hepatic growth factor (HGF), the ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) cMET, family members suffered more severe forms of lymphedema than those who possessed the SHIP2 mutation alone, while no lymphatic abnormalities were associated with the HGF mutation alone. WES analyses of additional family members reveal the same SHIP2 mutation in members with various diagnoses of lymphedema.</p><p>SHIP2 is a phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) triphosphate (PIP3) 5&#x02032;-phosphatase that negatively controls PIP3 levels in cells, thereby inhibiting the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway. Recently mutations within the PI3K/AKT pathway have been implicated in various lymphatic malformations and syndromic conditions that have a lymphatic involvement. CLOVES syndrome (OMIM: 612918) and Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome (KTWS, OMIM: 149000) are caused by gain-of-function mutations in <italic>PI3KCA</italic>, which encodes p110&#x003b1;, a catalytic subunit of PI3K, while <italic>AKT1</italic> mutations have been identified in Proteus syndrome (OMIM: 176920) <xref rid="pone.0112548-Kurek1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112548-Brouillard1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In addition, in mice, targeted mutations of <italic>Pik3r1</italic>, <italic>Pi3kca</italic> and <italic>Akt1</italic> genes result in lymphatic abnormalities including lymphangiectasia, defective lymphatic sprouting and maturation, lymphatic vessel hypoplasia, and chylous ascites <xref rid="pone.0112548-MoutaBellum1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112548-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. SHIP2 is known to interact physically with RTKs, focal adhesion proteins, scaffold proteins, protein phosphatases, and cytoskeletal proteins to regulate cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, survival, and receptor internalization <xref rid="pone.0112548-Suwa1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112548-Deneubourg1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Therefore, given the evidence that PI3K/AKT pathway plays a role in lymphatic malformations, one may hypothesize that SHIP2, a negative regulator of this pathway, could be involved in lymphatic disorders. Through <italic>in vitro</italic> siRNA studies, we show that SHIP2 is required for the proliferation, adhesion, migration, tubulogenesis, and survival of human lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC). When the mutant form of SHIP2 discovered in our human studies was overexpressed in immortalized LEC, the cellular phenotypes were found to differ as compared to those overexpressing wild type (WT) SHIP2. The combined results suggest that SHIP2 is a potential modulator of lymphatic function and that SHIP2 mutations can contribute to varied expressivity and penetrance of lymphatic disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Human Lymphatic Imaging</title><p>The lymphatic phenotype of each subject was determined using near-infrared fluorescence lymphatic imaging (NIRFLI).

All clinical investigations were conducted according to Declaration of Helsinki principles. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to NIRFL imaging.</p><p>Each subject received a total of 12 intradermal injections of 25 &#x000b5;g of ICG in 0.1 mL saline, with a total dose of 300 &#x000b5;g, for uptake into the peripheral lymphatics. Injection sites were consistent between subjects and each limb received two injections on the dorsum of the foot, one injection on the medial ankle, one injection each on the lateral and medial calf, and one injection on the anterior thigh (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112548-g001"><bold>Fig 1A</bold></xref>). Immediately following ICG administration and as described previously 25 each leg was illuminated by the diffuse output of a 785 nm laser diode, and images of the resultant fluorescent signal emanating from the peripheral lymphatics were optically filtered and acquired using a custom intensified charge coupled device (ICCD) camera. Exposure times of 200 ms permitted the acquisition of movies of lymphatic contractile function. Vital signs were measured for two hours following injection, and a follow-up phone call was made at 24 hours. Blood was obtained from each subject. No adverse events were reported. Images were analyzed to assess lymphatic uptake at the injection site and the presence of abnormal lymphatic architecture such as dense networks of lymphatic capillaries with extravascular fluorescence frequently known as dermal backflow, lymphatic capillaries radiating from the intradermal injection sites, as well as tortuous and/or dilated lymphatics. The brightness and contrast levels of the NIRFLI images presented herein were adjusted to increase the overall dynamic range observable in the image (i.e. to enable the visualization of both the dim and the bright signals within the lymphatics).

At the time of study, the 59 year old mother (Subject #4) had not been diagnosed but presented with edema of both ankles, self-reported to initially occur following a minor sprain on her left ankle at 54 years old thus swelling on her right ankle was spontaneous. Upon NIRF imaging and medical examination, her clinical diagnosis was classified as acquired (secondary) lymphedema on the right leg and <italic>en tarda</italic> lymphedema on the left leg.

In their gene candidate studies, Finegold and coworkers <xref rid="pone.0112548-Finegold2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> found <italic>HGF</italic> and <italic>cMET</italic> mutations in single subjects with primary lymphedema, lymphangiectasia, and breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) subjects that were not polymorphic in control populations. They concluded that <italic>HGF</italic> and <italic>cMET</italic> mutations were likely causal for primary lymphedema and/or susceptibility genes for acquired lymphedema, an affliction that impacts an estimated 15% of all cancer survivors <xref rid="pone.0112548-Cormier1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. HGF and cMET are both important for lymphatic vessel formation <xref rid="pone.0112548-Kajiya1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Additionally, because Saito <italic>et al.</italic><xref rid="pone.0112548-Saito1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> showed that HGF gene therapy reduced lymphedema volume in the rat tail lymphedema model created by lymphatic vessel disruption, we expected the mother to harbor the <italic>HGF</italic> gene mutation, making her susceptible to her diagnosed acquired or <italic>en tarda</italic> form of lymphedema. However, she lacked the <italic>HGF</italic> gene variant, and possessed an abnormal NIRFLI phenotype. Surprisingly, the asymptomatic father who did not possess an abnormal NIRFLI phenotype had passed the <italic>HGF</italic> gene variant to his daughters.</p><p>As no other lymphedema-related genes were identified in this family, we conducted WES bioinformatics analyses to identify rare SNPs which could be likely causative or could increase susceptibility to lymphedema. Given that HGF could not explain lymphatic disease in the mother (Subject #4), and the varied penetrance of lymphedema in this family, we conducted pathway analysis with the goal of identifying potential HGF-modifier genes that could have been inherited from the mother that contribute to the probands' disease. We identified a rare, heterozygous missense mutation in <italic>INPPL1</italic>, which encodes SHIP2, in the probands (Subjects #1 and #2) and in their mother (Subject #4), but not in their father (Subject #3). This <italic>SHIP2</italic> mutation results in the conversion of threonine 180, located carboxyl to the SH2 domain, to alanine (p.T180A) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112548.s001">Fig S1A</xref></bold>). The T180A <italic>INPPL1</italic> mutation was validated by Sanger sequencing (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112548.s001">Fig S1B</xref></bold>). We did not confirm that mRNAs encoding T180A SHIP2 protein was produced in affected individuals nor RNAseq since the tissue biopsy required for RNAseq is well-known to be associated with an increased risk for infection in lymphedema subjects. While an <italic>INPPL1</italic> SNP at 71940154 (C&#x0003e;G; Hg19) resulting in T180S has been previously reported (rs376749049), our identified SNP at 71940153 (A&#x0003e;G; Hg19) resulting in T180A, has not been reported in SNP databases. The genomic region that harbors the <italic>INPPL1</italic> gene is unique, in particular the area surrounding the T180A mutation. To verify this mutation was not in an intronic region, we performed a blast analysis &#x000b1; 100 bp on each flanking region, and there was a single hit on <italic>INPPL1</italic>. NM_001567 is the single transcript for <italic>INPPL1</italic> and there are no alternative splice versions, in addition RNAseq experiments have been used to identify the correct exons described in the gene model. The mutation that we describe in Hg19 chr11:71940153 corresponds to the codon 180 of exon 5 of SHIP2. This particular region is evolutionary conserved, free of repeat elements and with no common SNPs reported, consequently we consider <italic>INPPL1</italic> an evolutionary conserved gene with low tolerance for mutations.</p><p>Given the knowledge that there were other extended family members with lymphedema, we further conducted NIRFLI and/or WES studies on 11 additional maternal family members. Out of the 11 extended family subjects, excluding the nucleus family, 5 subjects (Subjects #5, 6, 7, 11, and 13) were previously diagnosed with lymphedema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112548-g002"><bold>Fig 2A</bold></xref>). Seven subjects (including nucleus family) were phenotyped with NIRFLI and genotyped with WES, of which 5 subjects harbored the T180A SHIP2 mutation, which was validated by Sanger sequencing. Of those 5, 4 subjects (Subjects #1,2,4 and 6) were diagnosed lymphedema and 1 subject (Subject #12) was unaffected but her NIRFLI phenotype revealed vessel tortuosity, fluorescent lymphatic capillaries radiating from injection sites, and dilated vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112548-g002"><bold>Fig 2D</bold></xref>). Her 30 yr old daughter (Subject #13) was diagnosed with bilateral lower extremity <italic>praecox</italic> lymphedema at 13 yrs and also harbored T180A SHIP2. No clinical information was available for Subject #13&#x02032;s father. Subject #6 had swollen ankles and arms with venous insufficiency, and NIRF imaging revealed dermal backflow in her medial left ankle with diffuse dye uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112548-g002"><bold>Fig 2B</bold></xref>), fluorescent lymphatic capillaries radiating from injection sites on thighs and limited lymphatic propulsion. The lymphatics of Subject #9 (unaffected) were mostly well defined but we observed slight tortuosity with fluorescent lymphatic capillaries radiating from injection site on medial ankle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112548-g002"><bold>Fig 2C</bold></xref>). All 15 subjects were genotyped with WES, and no other lymphedema-related genes were identified, however a mutation of a gene encoding a protein within the MAPK/ERK pathway (<italic>MAP3K7</italic>) was identified in Subjects# 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 12 and 13. Out of these 7 subjects with <italic>MAP3K7</italic> mutation (Hg19 chr6:91229032; T&#x0003e; C) 5 of them were diagnosed with lymphedema (except Subjects #9 and 12) and also harbored the T180A SHIP2 mutation. The rare <italic>MAP3K7</italic> SNP, which results in p.N463S, has been reported in SNP databases (rs375179983), but has not yet been associated with any human disease. The frequency of the <italic>MAP3K7</italic> mutation within 6500 exomes is very low (0.01%) and the resultant protein change is predicted to the functionally damaging by PolyPhen-2 software. Of the total 15 subjects, 8 subjects were not imaged by NIRFLI and thus are considered incomplete phenotypes even though they were sequenced. Out of these 8 subjects, 4 were diagnosed with lymphedema, of which 3 have T180A SHIP2. In Subjects #5 and #11, SHIP2 has no contributory role to their lymphedema but both subjects had later onset of symptoms (27 yrs and 47 yrs respectively) and additional lymphatic insults which either exacerbated (breast cancer surgery in Subject #5) or triggered edema (self-reported&#x0003e;14 hour long flight in Subject #11). Two subjects (Subjects #8 and #14) were unaffected by symptoms, yet harbor the T180A SHIP2 mutation, however, it remains unknown whether these have any NIRFLI lymphatic phenotype or will encounter symptoms upon an injury, as did Subject #4. All subjects with lymphedema had lower extremity disease, except Subject #6 who had both upper and lower extremity lymphedema. There were no other lymphatic abnormalities such as chylous ascites or chylothorax reported in this family.

However, as determined in PLA assays, the T180A mutation did not largely affect the ability of SHIP2 to bind cMET or VEGFR3 after stimulation of cells with their respective growth factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112548-g006"><bold>Figure 6E</bold></xref>; <italic>p</italic> value&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.56 and 0.394, respectively).</p><fig id="pone-0112548-g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0112548.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>SHIP2 interacts with cMET and with VEGFR3.</title><p>Proximity ligation assay (PLA) depicting interaction of (<bold>A</bold>) SHIP2-FLAG and cMET and (<bold>B</bold>) SHIP2-FLAG and VEGFR3 in Vector- and FLAG-tagged WT SHIP2-transfected TIME cells following (<bold>A</bold>) HGF stimulation and (<bold>B</bold>) VEGFC stimulation and respective quantification of PLA fluorescence signal (<bold>C</bold> and <bold>D</bold>) in 100 cells/experiment (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3) quantified by ImageJ.

Importantly, AKT and ERK activation in T180A transfected cells was not greater than that observed in control (vector) cells in response to either growth factor.

While computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lymphangiography can assess lymphatic abnormalities in symptomatic patients in rare cases, the radiographic procedure is contraindicated in asymptomatic subjects owing to procedural risks. Lymphoscintigraphy is commonly used to assess deficiency in lymph transport, but entails the use of a radioisotope to produce images that have limited temporal and spatial resolution, and can fail to identify architectural and functional abnormalities <xref rid="pone.0112548-Mihara1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112548-SevickMuraca2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Recently, we used NIRFLI in investigational studies to (i) characterize normal lymphatic architecture and function in normal control subjects; (ii) characterize abnormal lymphatic architecture and function in subjects with lymphatic disorders including reduced lymphatic contractile function and lymphatic reflux presumably from valve defects; (iii) detect early lymphatic abnormalities in a breast cancer survivor asymptomatic for cancer-acquired lymphedema <xref rid="pone.0112548-Rasmussen2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>; and (iv) identify abnormal lymphatic architecture and function in a patient with capillary-malformation arterial venous malformations (CM-AVM) (OMIM: 608354) and Parkes Weber Syndrome (OMIM: 608355) associated with an inactivating <italic>RASA1</italic> mutation which was similar to that in an inducible <italic>Rasa1</italic> knockout mouse model <xref rid="pone.0112548-Burrows1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112548-Lapinski1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In this latter study, we confirmed that loss of the RASA1 protein, a negative regulator of the MAPK/ERK pathway, was directly responsible for aberrant, dysregulated lymphangiogenesis. Given the past ability of NIRF to discern subtle, subclinical lymphatic phenotypes <xref rid="pone.0112548-Rasmussen2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112548-Mihara2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, and in seemingly unaffected subjects herein (for example Subjects #9 and 12) who have lymphatic abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112548-g002"><bold>Fig 2C, 2D</bold></xref> respectively); our current study further highlights the utility of NIRFLI technique as a potential diagnostic tool.</p><p>We report here a nucleus family with inherited non-syndromic lymphedema with a distinct heterozygous non-synonymous rare mutation in the <italic>INPPL1</italic> gene that encodes the SHIP2 phosphatase. In addition, a heterozygous damaging mutation in the <italic>HGF</italic> gene that encodes HGF was identified in this family. Mutations in <italic>HGF</italic> and its receptor <italic>cMET</italic> have been associated with lymphedema beforehand <xref rid="pone.0112548-Finegold2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Interestingly, individuals in this family that harbored mutations in both <italic>INPPL1</italic> and <italic>HGF</italic> showed more severe lymphedema symptoms. Further WES analyses of their extended family identify this T180A SHIP2 mutation in 6 other subjects, 3 of whom have various diagnoses of lymphedema. This SHIP2 mutation also overlaps with a mutation of a gene within the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, <italic>MAP3K7</italic>, in 5 individuals with lymphedema. However, while computationally predicted to be damaging, it remains to be biologically validated whether MAP3K7 specifically has a cellular functional role in LEC. Nonetheless, our findings indicate that SHIP2 is a regulator of lymphatic function in humans and that inherited mutations in the <italic>INPPL1</italic> gene may act in concert with <italic>HGF</italic>, and likely <italic>MAP3K7</italic>, mutations to exacerbate lymphatic phenotypes.</p><p>High penetrance genes associated with lymphedema, such as <italic>VEGFR3</italic>, exhibit the standard, rare Mendelian inheritance pattern in patients with an extreme phenotype. However, since lymphatic abnormalities most likely arise from the interplay between several genes and environmental factors as in the case of many other disorders, lymphedema likely cannot be attributed to only single, high penetrance genes. For the majority of the more common disorders such as stroke, hypertension, obesity, autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, etc. a large number of genes are involved with each one contributing to the disorder. This situation may be expected in non-syndromic lymphedema, since only <italic>VEGFC/VEGFR3</italic> axis genes that have been identified as the sole source of the disorder, yet 64% of patients with familial history and 92% of patients with sporadic non-syndromic lymphedema do not harbor these mutations <xref rid="pone.0112548-Brouillard1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112548-Mendola1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Inherited heterozygous mutations in <italic>SHIP2</italic> together with germline heterozygous mutations in other lymphatic-regulating genes may be sufficient for the development of lymphedema. Ideally, as evidenced by the variable phenotypes in our subjects, screening of families with syndromic lymphatic dysfunction for <italic>INPPL1</italic> mutations could be informative and substantiate the variable penetrance that is normally observed in lymphatic disorders. However, as suggested by NIRFLI phenotyping of aberrant lymphatic architecture and function in asymptomatic subjects, variations in normal physiologic challenges such as puberty, pregnancy, immune insults, or mechanical injury could provide physiologic and/or environmental second-hits that could account for the differences in disease expressivity and age of onset in subjects.</p><p>SHIP2 dephosphorylates PI(3,4,5)P3 at the 5&#x02032;position of the inositol ring and thereby is a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. To verify this important role for SHIP2 in lymphatics, we performed SHIP2 knockdown studies in LEC. These studies confirmed that SHIP2 acts as a negative regulator of HGF- and VEGFC-induced PI3K/AKT signaling in LEC and further showed an important role for SHIP2 as a negative regulator of Ras-MAPK/ERK signaling in this cell type. SHIP2 has the potential to negatively regulate Ras-MAPK/ERK signaling through either catalytic or non-catalytic mechanisms. Non-catalytic mechanisms by which SHIP2 may inhibit MAPK activation are suggested by functional studies of SHIP1, which is homologous to SHIP2. For example in B cells, SHIP1 negatively regulates MAPK through inhibition of the binding of a Grb2/SOS Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor complex to the Shc adapter protein, which is an event that is necessary for Ras activation <xref rid="pone.0112548-Tridandapani1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. In addition, through physical interaction with the p62dok adapter protein, SHIP1 is thought to promote recruitment of the Ras GTPase-activating protein to membranes that inactivates Ras <xref rid="pone.0112548-Tamir1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Additionally, over-expression of WT SHIP2 in the CHO cell line resulted in increased insulin-induced SHIP2/Shc association, reduced Shc/Grb2 association and, consequently, reduced MAPK activation, suggesting that SHIP2, like SHIP1, competes with Grb2 for Shc <xref rid="pone.0112548-Kagawa1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. However, our preliminary studies show that these observations do not extend to SHIP2 in LEC as SHIP2 does not seem to interfere with the Grb2/Shc complex in LEC (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112548.s006">Fig S6</xref></bold>). With regards the catalytic regulation of MAPK by SHIP2, PIP3 could potentially lead to membrane recruitment of pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing proteins, other than AKT, that subsequently amplify growth factor induced activation of Ras, as reported previously for antigen receptor signaling in lymphocytes <xref rid="pone.0112548-Readinger1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. To this end, our preliminary results indicate that exogenous PIP3 is capable of activating MAPK in LEC (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112548.s007">Fig S7A</xref></bold>). To determine the extent to which PI3K and PIP3 are required for HGF- and VEGFC-induced MAPK activation in LEC, we further examined the effect of PI3K inhibition in these two pathways. PI3K inhibition substantially reduced but did not completely block HGF- and VEGFC-induced activation of MAPK (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112548.s007">Fig S7B</xref></bold>). Neither U0126 nor LY294002 affected expression of SHIP2 (not shown), which is expected since SHIP2 is upstream of PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK. While the exact mechanism of SHIP2 inhibition of MAPK/ERK signaling needs to be further clarified in future studies, our initial finding is consistent with the possibility that SHIP2 uses a PIP3-dependent catalytic mechanism, either directly or as a consequence of altered PI3K activity, to negatively regulate MAPK in LEC.</p><p>SHIP2 knockdown studies in LEC also showed that this phosphatase is necessary for optimal HGF- and VEGFC-induced proliferation, adhesion, migration, and tubulogenesis, which are all key processes in lymphangiogenesis. Surprisingly, we also found that knockdown of SHIP2 in LEC results in increased apoptosis, despite that PI3K/AKT signaling is recognized to promote cell survival. While the exact mechanisms responsible for this increased apoptosis remain to be studied, it is of note that sustained MAPK signaling, itself a mitogenic pathway, has paradoxically been shown to trigger cell death <xref rid="pone.0112548-Cagnol1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. In this regard, the increase in MAPK signaling in SHIP2 knockdown LEC was substantially greater than the increase in PI3K/AKT signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112548-g003"><bold>Fig 3</bold></xref><bold> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112548.s003">Fig S3</xref></bold>). Therefore, any increased survival resulting from augmented PI3K/AKT signaling may be counterbalanced and exceeded by increased apoptosis as a consequence of increased MAPK signaling. Mechanisms of ERK-mediated cell death include both intrinsic apoptosis activation characterized by mitochondrial release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> and activation of caspase-9 and extrinsic apoptosis <italic>via</italic> activation of caspase-8 <xref rid="pone.0112548-Cagnol1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Potentially, increased apoptosis in SHIP2 knockdown cells could account for the impairment in the other LEC functional parameters that were examined. On the other hand, in other cell types, increased MAPK activation has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and migration directly <xref rid="pone.0112548-Moro1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112548-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Accordingly, we are investigating whether these mechanisms are at play in the LEC context.</p><p>T180A mutation is located carboxy terminal to the SH2 domain of the SHIP2 protein. Molecular modeling predictions could not be made for the T180A mutation since the entire three-dimensional structure of SHIP2 has not yet been elucidated. Nonetheless, T180A SHIP2 showed increased PIP3 cellular levels, and reduced, but not significant, levels of PIP3 phosphatase activity as WT SHIP2 <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, in transfected LEC, this mutation resulted in loss of an ability of SHIP2 to function as a negative regulator of AKT and MAPK. In contrast to WT SHIP2, T180A SHIP2 was completely unable to inhibit HGF- and VEGFC-induced activation of AKT and MAPK. Thus, at least with regards AKT and MAPK activation, T180A represents a complete loss-of-function SHIP2 mutation. How the T180A mutation affects the inhibitory function of SHIP2 specifically <italic>in vivo</italic> is unclear at present but the mutation does not appear to relate to any impaired ability of SHIP2 to interact physically with cMET or VEGFR3. Further insight into how T180A mutation impairs SHIP2 activity is likely to come from determination of the crystal structure of the full length SHIP2 protein. Additionally, while we cannot rule out what impact that endogenous SHIP2 has in the WT- and T180A overexpressing cells, we used vector-transfectants as a control to account for any experimental differences given that a stable SHIP2-null lymphatic cell line is not currently available.</p><p>Recently both homozygous and heterozygous mutations in SHIP2 have been reported in a rare skeletal disorder, opsismodysplasia (OMIM: 258480) in both unrelated and consanguineous family members <xref rid="pone.0112548-Huber1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112548-Below1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Furthermore, while SHIP2 has been implicated in obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance in rodents <xref rid="pone.0112548-Clement1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112548-Sleeman1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> and in humans <xref rid="pone.0112548-Kagawa1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112548-Ishida1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112548-Kaisaki1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>; and has been suggested to have a proto-oncogenic role in human breast cancer <xref rid="pone.0112548-Prasad2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, SHIP2 has not been associated with vascular disorders. However, PTEN, which similarly to SHIP2, is a negative regulator of PI3K/AKT signaling, has been implicated in lymphatic malformations specifically Proteus-like syndrome, exhibiting medium penetrance and loss-of-function phenotype <xref rid="pone.0112548-Zhou2" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Thus, it may be expected, but remains to be tested in genetic mouse models, whether SHIP2 plays a primary role in lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic vessel maintenance. To our knowledge, the only previous evidence suggesting a role of SHIP2 in lymphatic biology is a recent transcriptomic microarray study using paired punch biopsy samples of human lymphedematous tissue versus normal samples. In that study, among &#x0223c;8400 differentially expressed genes, <italic>INPPL1</italic> was found to have reduced expression in lymphedematous tissue samples suggesting a role for this protein in lymphatic function <xref rid="pone.0112548-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>.</p><p>Previous studies performed in epithelial cells have shown that SHIP2 binds HGF-activated cMET at Y1356 in the cMET cytoplasmic tail to effect cell scattering and spreading <xref rid="pone.0112548-Koch1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Here we show that SHIP2 also interacts with cMET in LEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112548-g006"><bold>Fig 6A</bold></xref>). In addition, we show for the first time that SHIP2 interacts with VEGFR3 in LEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112548-g006"><bold>Fig 6B</bold></xref>). cMET is known to couple to the PI3K signaling pathway through direct physical interaction with PI3K <xref rid="pone.0112548-Ponzetto1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. Similarly, VEGFR3 has recently been shown to trigger the PI3K pathway through physical interaction with PI3K <xref rid="pone.0112548-Coso1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Altogether, these studies reveal strong similarities in the mechanisms by which cMET and VEGFR3 activate and regulate the PI3K/AKT pathway. The finding that SHIP2 physically interacts with cMET (and VEGFR3) in LEC further substantiates the notion that this SHIP2 mutation contributes to the lymphatic abnormalities in this studied family. While we found that SHIP2 did not affect the expression of cMET or VEGFR3 upon growth factor stimulation (not shown), a role for SHIP2 in cMET and VEGFR3 signaling pathways could provide an explanation for the occurrence of more serious disease in individuals with mutations in SHIP2 together with mutations in one or the other of these RTKs. Much like mutations in <italic>HGF</italic> and <italic>cMET</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0112548-Finegold2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, it is still unclear why the SHIP2 mutation reported herein results in a lymphatic phenotype, given the ubiquitous expression of SHIP2. One possible explanation could be the rapid physiologic lymphatic responses to external triggers during developmental and adult lymphangiogenesis <xref rid="pone.0112548-SevickMuraca1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Compared to the blood vasculature, the lymphatic structure may better facilitate remodeling of capillaries, which in lymphatics are thin-walled, lack tight junctions, and either lack or have incomplete basement membranes <xref rid="pone.0112548-Karpanen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Another explanation may be the compounding effect of mutations in SHIP2, RTKs or their ligands, or in other components of PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways, leading to abnormal LEC signal transduction and subsequently to lymphatic dysfunction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0112548.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>WES analysis and validation by Sanger sequencing.</bold> (<bold>A</bold>) List of mutations identified in the nucleus family by whole exome sequencing (WES) and validated by Sanger sequencing showing chromosomal location, nucleotide change, zygocity and amino acid change.
