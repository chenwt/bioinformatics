As such, the bacterium undoubtedly employs complex modes of regulating its lifecycle, metabolism and pathogenesis. Small RNAs (sRNAs) have been shown to play important regulatory roles in controlling metabolism and virulence in several pathogenic bacteria. We hypothesize that sRNAs are involved in regulating growth and development of <italic>C. burnetii</italic> and its infection of host cells. To address the hypothesis and identify potential sRNAs, we subjected total RNA isolated from <italic>Coxiella</italic> cultured axenically and in Vero host cells to deep-sequencing. Using this approach, we identified fifteen novel <italic>C. burnetii</italic> sRNAs (CbSRs). Fourteen CbSRs were validated by Northern blotting. Most CbSRs showed differential expression, with increased levels in LCVs. Eight CbSRs were upregulated (&#x02265;2-fold) during intracellular growth as compared to growth in axenic medium. Along with the fifteen sRNAs, we also identified three sRNAs that have been previously described from other bacteria, including RNase P RNA, tmRNA and 6S RNA. The 6S regulatory sRNA of <italic>C. burnetii</italic> was found to accumulate over log phase-growth with a maximum level attained in the SCV stage. The 6S RNA-encoding gene (<italic>ssrS</italic>) was mapped to the 5&#x02032; UTR of <italic>ygfA</italic>; a highly conserved linkage in eubacteria. The predicted secondary structure of the 6S RNA possesses three highly conserved domains found in 6S RNAs of other eubacteria. We also demonstrate that <italic>Coxiella&#x02019;s</italic> 6S RNA interacts with RNA polymerase (RNAP) in a specific manner. Finally, transcript levels of 6S RNA were found to be at much higher levels when <italic>Coxiella</italic> was grown in host cells relative to axenic culture, indicating a potential role in regulating the bacterium&#x02019;s intracellular stress response by interacting with RNAP during transcription.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (R15 AI103511) to J.M.B, from Portland State University and Collins Medical Trust to R.R.

This kind of regulation must be rapid, metabolically inexpensive and efficient. There is growing evidence that post-transcriptional control mediated by small RNAs (sRNAs) plays a significant role in bacterial regulation <xref rid="pone.0100147-Papenfort1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100147-Waters1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In pathogenic bacteria, sRNAs are known to coordinate virulence gene expression and also stress responses that are important for survival in the host <xref rid="pone.0100147-Mandin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100147-Romby1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Bacterial sRNAs are typically 100&#x02013;400 bases in length and are categorized as <italic>cis</italic>-encoded sRNAs and <italic>trans</italic>-encoded sRNAs. Most <italic>cis</italic>-encoded sRNAs are located within 5&#x02032; untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs and are transcribed in the antisense orientation to the corresponding mRNA. <italic>Cis</italic>-encoded sRNAs can expose or block a ribosome-binding site (RBS) by adopting different conformations in response to various environmental cues, thereby regulating translation. On the other hand, <italic>trans</italic>-encoded sRNAs are located in intergenic regions (IGRs). They share only limited complementarity with their target RNAs and are thought to regulate translation and/or stability of these RNAs <xref rid="pone.0100147-Waters1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. sRNAs can interact with mRNA or protein in order to bring about regulation, but a majority of them function by binding to mRNA targets. An example of a widely distributed and well-studied sRNA is 6S RNA. 6S RNA binds to RNA polymerase (RNAP)-&#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> complex and regulates transcription by altering RNAP&#x02019;s promoter specificity during stationary phase <xref rid="pone.0100147-Faucher1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100147-Wassarman1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p><italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic>, the causative agent of Q fever, is classified as a Gram-negative obligate intracellular &#x003b3;-proteobacterium. Human Q fever is generally a zoonosis acquired by inhalation of contaminated aerosols and can present either as an acute or chronic disease. An acute case of Q fever typically ranges from an asymptomatic infection to an influenza-like illness accompanied by high fever, malaise, atypical pneumonia, myalgia and hepatitis. In approximately 2&#x02013;5% of cases, chronic Q fever occurs and manifests as endocarditis, especially in patients with predisposing valvular defects <xref rid="pone.0100147-Maurin1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The pathogen&#x02019;s biphasic developmental cycle consists of two cellular forms. An infectious, dormant small cell variant (SCV) is spore-like and can endure adverse environmental conditions such as heat, pressure, UV light and desiccation. Following inhalation, <italic>Coxiella</italic> enters alveolar macrophages by endocytosis and generates a phagolysosome-like vacuole termed a parasitophorus vacuole (PV). The PV interacts with autophagosomes for bacterial nutrition <xref rid="pone.0100147-Romano1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. At approximately 8 h post-infection, SCVs metamorphose to form metabolically active LCVs in the PV, with a doubling time of approximately 11 hours <xref rid="pone.0100147-Coleman1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100147-McCaul1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Following 6&#x02013;8 days of intracellular growth, the PV reaches maturity and occupies almost the entire volume of the cell, and it is filled with a mixture of LCVs and SCVs. By approximately 12 days, the entire bacterial population has transformed into SCVs that are eventually released upon lysis of the host cell <xref rid="pone.0100147-McCaul1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p><italic>C. burnetii</italic> encounters various and sudden changes in environmental conditions during its life cycle, including a rapid upshift in temperature upon transmission from contaminated aerosols to the human lung, and a downshift in pH and an increase in reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) in the PV. All of these events are relevant to rapid, sRNA-mediated regulation <xref rid="pone.0100147-Waters1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Recent reports have identified sRNAs in a variety of pathogenic bacteria, including <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic><xref rid="pone.0100147-Weissenmayer1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0100147-Tesorero1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Reports have also shown the involvement of sRNAs in the pathogenesis of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Salmonella spp., Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> and <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>

Here, we describe a set of 15 novel <italic>Coxiella</italic> sRNAs identified by high-throughput sequencing of RNA (RNA-seq) isolated from distinct life stages and culture conditions.

Comparison of the MEVs of LCVs and SCVs indicates that most CbSRs are present at higher levels in LCVs regardless of culture conditions. CbSRs could be classified into three groups based on the relative location of their coding sequence on the genome. Specifically, group I includes sRNAs encoded entirely within an IGR; group II consists of sRNAs situated antisense to identified ORFs (antisense sRNA), and group III includes sRNAs that are ORF-derived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100147-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). A majority (eight of fifteen) of the identified sRNAs were antisense sRNAs. Sizes of the CbSRs ranged from 99&#x02013;309 nt with a minimum MEV of &#x0223c;104 and a maximum MEV of &#x0223c;434,178 in at least one growth condition.

However, four out of fourteen CbSRs showed multiple bands on blots (e.g., CbSR 3, CbSR 8, CbSR 12 and CbSR 13). First, in the case of CbSR 3, a longer transcript (&#x0223c;300 nt) was observed, which could represent a primary transcript that is cleaved to give a mature sRNA of &#x0223c;200 nt, as obtained by RNA-seq. A similar processing has been previously described for sRNAs of other bacteria <xref rid="pone.0100147-Argaman1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100147-Vogel1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Second, CbSR 8, CbSR 12 and CbSR 13 Northern blots revealed two bands in which the larger bands corresponded to sizes obtained by RNA-seq, suggesting that the upper band is the actual sRNA. In CbSR 12, the molar ratios of the two different-sized bands observed varied between the LCV and SCV stages, possibly indicating different RNA processing, similar to what occurs with the SroF sRNA of <italic>E. coli</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0100147-Vogel1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. When transcript levels of the fifteen CbSRs were compared on blots, most had increased expression during the metabolically-active LCV phase with exceptions like CbSR 9 which was present in seemingly equal amounts in both morphotypes.</p><p>Northern blot signal intensity of most CbSRs corresponded to the MEVs obtained by RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0100147-t001">Table 1</xref>), with a few anomalies like CbSR 11, CbSR 12 and CbSR 13. Although the larger band (&#x0223c;300 nt) of CbSR 3 doesn&#x02019;t correspond well with RNA-seq MEV ratios, the lower (&#x0223c;200 nt) band does. Furthermore, signal intensities of CbSR 11 and CbSR 12 bands on Northern blots, as a function of morphotype, were consistently reversed relative to their deep sequencing MEVs with increased transcript level in SCVs rather than LCVs. Further investigation is required to determine the basis of these discrepancies.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>sRNAs Up-regulated during Intracellular Growth</title><p>To search for sRNA regulators that are significantly up-regulated during a host cell infection, we compared expression levels of CbSRs from <italic>C. burnetii</italic> cultured in Vero host cells to those cultured axenically in ACCM2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0100147-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Results clearly showed that 6S RNA was present exclusively in IP samples where RNAP was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100147-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>). This confirms a physical association between 6S RNA and RNAP.

Eight positively-charged amino acids have been shown to create a surface that is required for binding of 6S RNA to the 4.2 region of <italic>E. coli&#x02019;s</italic> RpoD (&#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>) <xref rid="pone.0100147-Klocko1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Analysis of <italic>Coxiella&#x02019;s</italic> RpoS and RpoH 4.2 regions indicates that they each possess only five positively-charged amino acid residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100147-g010">Figure 10</xref>). This suggests that <italic>Coxiella&#x02019;s</italic> 6S RNA interactions with RNAP-RpoS and RNAP-RpoH would be minimal or absent. In contrast, the 4.2 region of <italic>Coxiella&#x02019;s</italic> RpoD (&#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>) shares 100% identity with 30 amino acid residues of the <italic>E. coli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> 4.2 region with all eight positively-charged amino acids present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100147-g010">Figure 10</xref>). Taken together, these analyses suggest that <italic>Coxiella&#x02019;s</italic> 6S RNA would mainly interact with RNAP-&#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>. Nevertheless, the dominant role of RpoS in the log-phase growth of <italic>C. burnetii</italic> suggests the potential for an atypical mechanism of 6S RNA-mediated gene regulation that warrants additional research.</p><fig id="pone-0100147-g010" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0100147.g010</object-id><label>Figure 10</label><caption><title>The 4.2 region of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> RpoD and comparison to predicted, homologous regions of <italic>C. burnetii</italic> sigma factors.</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> (<italic>Ec</italic>) and <italic>C. burnetii</italic> (<italic>Cb</italic>) 4.2 regions of sigma factors RpoD, RpoS and RpoH are shown.

Various computational and experimental approaches have been employed in order to identify these targets <xref rid="pone.0100147-Vogel2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. With the aim of predicting potential roles for the identified CbSRs, we used TargetRNA2 software <xref rid="pone.0100147-Tjaden1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> to predict mRNA targets that could base pair with the sRNAs. However, none showed significant binding to a specific and prominent mRNA target. We can speculate on the roles of some of the sRNAs based on the location of their coding sequence relative to neighboring genes. In the case of antisense sRNAs, the RNA that they regulate could be the corresponding mRNAs. Further, most of the antisense and ORF-derived sRNAs are less abundant than intergenic sRNAs indicating that they preferably base-pair with mRNAs encoded nearby. Unfortunately, since most of these genes are pseudogenes or encode hypothetical proteins, their regulatory function is difficult to predict based on location alone. Interestingly, CbSR 14 is transcribed antisense to the 5&#x02032; UTR of <italic>trmE</italic>, a bacterial tRNA modification GTPase that has been implicated in ribosome assembly and other cellular processes including stress response, sporulation and pathogenesis <xref rid="pone.0100147-Verstraeten1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Since these functions would likely be advantageous to <italic>C. burnetii</italic>, CbSR 14 possibly regulates <italic>trmE</italic>, however, this hypothesis must be experimentally validated. Another probable method of target identification is monitoring the phenotypic changes resulting from experimental manipulation of sRNA transcript levels, and these types of experiments are currently underway.</p><p>In conclusion, this study is the first step towards elucidating sRNA-mediated regulation of <italic>C. burnetii&#x02019;s</italic> physiology and pathogenesis. Further investigations are required to determine the exact role played by each CbSR to help <italic>C. burnetii</italic> transition between the two different cell morphotypes and adapt to the intracellular niche.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0100147.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p><bold>Sequencing statistics.</bold></p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0100147.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0100147.s002"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p><bold>PCR primers used to make probes.</bold></p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0100147.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0100147.s003"><label>Table S3</label><caption><p><bold>qPCR and qRT-PCR primers.</bold></p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0100147.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0100147.s004"><label>Table S4</label><caption><p><bold>Probes used in Northern blots and RPAs.</bold></p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0100147.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Drs.
