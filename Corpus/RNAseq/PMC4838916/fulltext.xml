The genetic basis and regulatory mechanism of <italic>E. coli</italic> F18 resistance in Chinese domestic weaned piglets remain unclear. Meishan piglets were used as model animals to test their susceptibility to <italic>E. coli</italic> F18. By performing a comparative transcriptome study on duodenum tissues of sensitive and resistant pigs, we identified 198 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; 125 upregulated and 73 downregulated) in the resistant pigs. DEGs were predominately involved in immune system pathways, including the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. qPCR and western blot showed <italic>CD14</italic>, <italic>IFN-&#x003b1;</italic>, <italic>TLR4</italic> and <italic>IL-1&#x003b2;</italic>, etc. in the TLR signaling pathway had significantly higher expression levels in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced small intestinal epithelial cell lines (IPEC-J2) than those in normal IPEC-J2 cells. Immunohistochemical analysis showed the increased expression of <italic>CD14</italic> gene in the <italic>E. coli</italic> F18-resistant individuals. After <italic>CD14</italic> knockdown, the levels of cytokines IL-6 and IL-12 were significantly reduced in IPEC-J2 cell supernatants. The adhesion ability of F18ab strain with IPEC-J2 cells was significantly increased (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). This study revealed the TLR signaling pathway, and especially <italic>CD14</italic>, probably plays an important role in resistance to <italic>E. coli</italic> F18 infection in Chinese domestic piglets.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Enterotoxigenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ETEC) strain F18 is the main pathogenic bacterium responsible for post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) and edema disease (ED) in piglets (<italic>Sus scrofa</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Via its fimbriae, ETEC F18 pathogen adheres to the surface of epithelial cells of the small intestines of piglets and binds to specific receptors in the brush border membrane, leading to colonization, replication, and production of enterotoxin and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Therefore, their pathogenicity depends upon the existence of ETEC F18 receptors in the brush border membranes of small intestinal mucosal epithelial cells in piglets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. In previous studies on <italic>E. coli</italic> F18 receptors, a G/A mutation was reported at position M307 of the &#x003b1;-(1,2) fucosyltransferase 1 (<italic>FUT1</italic>) gene, which is thought to control the expression of the <italic>E. coli</italic> F18 receptor. <italic>FUT1</italic> was proposed as a candidate gene for the selective breeding of <italic>E. coli</italic> F18 adhesion-resistant pigs. At the mutation site in <italic>FUT1</italic>, G is dominant to A; i.e., pigs with the <italic>AA</italic> genotype show resistance to <italic>E. coli</italic> F18, whereas pigs with the <italic>GG</italic> or <italic>AG</italic> genotypes are sensitive to <italic>E. coli</italic> F18<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Recently, the <italic>AA</italic> genotype at M307 has been detected in Western commercial pig breeds, including Duroc, Pietrain, Yorkshire and Landrace; however, animals with this genotype have not been found in native Chinese pigs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, which makes breeding of resistant native Chinese pig breeds difficult. Previously, we established Sutai pig (a new hybrid between the Duroc and Meishan breeds) populations that are resistant and sensitive to <italic>E. coli</italic> F18. Using Agilent two-color microarray-based gene expression profile, we analyzed the differential gene expression and important pathways in Sutai pigs resistant and sensitive to <italic>E. coli</italic> F18 (data submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus, Accession number GSE26854)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. This analysis identified the glycosphingolipid biosynthesis-globo series pathway, including <italic>FUT1, FUT2, ST3GAL1, HEXA, HEXB, B3GALNT1</italic> and <italic>NAGA</italic> genes. Nevertheless, Sutai pig with foreign Duroc DNA cannot completely reveal the regulatory mechanism of <italic>E. coli</italic> F18 resistance in native Chinese pig breeds. In addition, Zhou <italic>et al.</italic> analyzed the differential gene expression profile in intestinal epithelial cell with ETEC infection; however, they only analyzed the mechanism of bacterial infection at a cellular level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. The lack of verification of symptom change of piglets&#x02019; phenotype meant that effective screening and identification of resistant and sensitive individuals to <italic>E. coli</italic> F18 has become bottleneck for exploring the genetic basis of <italic>E. coli</italic> F18 resistance.</p><p>Recently, with the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has rapidly emerged as a major transcriptome profiling system. With the help of adapted bioinformatic tools, RNA-seq allows the exploration of the transcriptome in an unprecedented manner in terms of accuracy and data insight<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Meanwhile RNA-Seq technology can not only detect variations in gene expression patterns, but also identify splicing events, new isoforms, and different promoter and polyadenylation signal usage. However, it is difficult to analyze the molecular mechanism of <italic>E. coli</italic> F18 resistance using RNA-Seq technology in native Chinese pig breeds because of the lack of extreme phenotype individuals for <italic>E. coli</italic> F18 infection.</p><p>One of main purposes of this study was to obtain <italic>E. coli</italic> F18-resistant and -sensitive individuals in native Chinese pig breeds. In this study, Meishan piglets were used as model animals to test their susceptibility to <italic>E. coli</italic> F18 by challenging them through feeding them with <italic>E. coli</italic> F18 strains. Using a series of tests, such as <italic>E. coli</italic> F18 bacteria detection, bacteria counting and adhesion test of the pathogens to the epithelial cells of small intestine <italic>in vitro</italic>, we identified <italic>E. coli</italic> F18-resistant and -susceptible complete sib-pair individuals. In pigs, the functions of the small intestine include the establishment of a physical and immunological barrier against foreign antigens, such as natural toxins, and pathogenic and commensal microorganisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. <italic>E. coli</italic> F18 strain colonizes and replicates mainly in the duodenum. Based on the identified <italic>E. coli</italic> F18-resistant and sensitive individuals, to obtain detailed genetic information about the resistance mechanism, we sequenced the duodenal transcriptomes of Meishan piglets resistant and sensitive to <italic>E. coli</italic> F18 using a high-throughput sequencing platform &#x02013; Illumina HiSeq 2000. We obtained many differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the resistant group and sensitive group, which were analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis to identify important pathway or functional genes related to <italic>E. coli</italic> F18 infection. Furthermore, we used quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) technology to detect the expression of important pathway genes in small intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2) under LPS treatment. Additionally, an important gene was identified by gain- and loss-of-function assays in IPEC-J2 cells. This study determined the molecular regulation mechanisms and the critical genes involved in regulating piglets&#x02019; responses to <italic>E. coli</italic> F18 infection, which will pave the way for further genetic engineering to improve resistance to <italic>E. coli</italic> F18 in Chinese native pig breeds.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Yangzhou University Animal Experiments Ethics Committee approved the animal study proposal, with the permit number: SYXK(Su) IACUC 2012-0029.

The challenge experiment with <italic>E. coli</italic> F18 strain was carried out according to previously described methods<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. We collected feces from piglets in the same litter weaned after 30 days in the same feeding environment, which were used to detect common pathogens, including general pathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic> F18, <italic>E. coli</italic> K88) and viruses (transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), rotavirus (RV)) (PCR primers are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Twelve piglets per litter were randomly divided into two groups: the control group (two piglets) and the experimental group (ten piglets). Each piglet was housed individually in separate pens. They were fed ad libitum with a commercial-type compound feed for weaned piglets containing 21.7% crude protein, without antimicrobial additives and organic acids. Beginning at day 3 post-weaning, experimental piglets were challenged with a daily dose of 4.6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>8</sup> CFU of <italic>E. coli</italic> F18 strain once a day for up to 10 days, or until they showed diarrhea. No additional food was given and we ensured that piglets ate all food before the challenge experiment. Throughout the experiment, fecal shedding of the inoculated bacteria was monitored by daily fecal sampling and feces consistency was scored using the parameters &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;pasty&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;watery&#x0201d;. Only piglets with watery feces were considered as diarrheic.

About 100&#x02009;mg of duodenal tissue was removed and the scraped epithelium of the duodenum was placed into 1.5&#x02009;ml nuclease-free Eppendorf tubes, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C until further use.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>RNA isolation, cDNA library preparation and sequencing</title><p>Total RNA was isolated using the Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies), after which the concentration, quality and integrity were determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) and a Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent). Finally, six samples with RNA integrity number (RIN) values above 8 were used for libraries construction. Three micrograms of RNA were used as input material for the RNA sample preparations. Sequencing libraries were generated using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Briefly, mRNA was purified from total RNA using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. Fragmentation was carried out using divalent cations under elevated temperature in an Illumina proprietary fragmentation buffer. First strand cDNA was synthesized using random oligonucleotides and SuperScript II. Second strand cDNA synthesis was subsequently performed using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. Remaining overhangs were converted into blunt ends via exonuclease/polymerase activities and the enzymes were removed. After adenylation of the 3&#x02032; ends of the DNA fragments, Illumina PE adapter oligonucleotides were ligated to prepare for hybridization. To select cDNA fragments of the preferred 200&#x02009;bp in length, the library fragments were purified using the AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, CA, USA). DNA fragments with ligated adaptor molecules on both ends were selectively enriched using Illumina PCR Primer Cocktail in a 15 cycle PCR reaction. Products were purified (AMPure XP system) and quantified using the Agilent high sensitivity DNA assay on a Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent).

Although the experimental mice developed diarrhea, the mechanism of bacterial diarrhea was not caused by the adhesion of pathogenic bacteria to mice epithelial cells. Therefore, using mice as model animals to simulate piglet diarrhea is not feasible, indicating that we should conduct the challenge experiment with bacteria in piglets themselves. Recently, some studies analyzed the change in gene expression and immune factor level in pigs after <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Wang <italic>et al.</italic> reported that Yorkshire and Laiwu black pig were normal when challenged via orally <italic>E. coli</italic> F18 strain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, because piglet feed purchased from the market contained a high concentration of antibiotics, which can kill <italic>E. coli</italic> F18 strain to decrease the number of bacterial infections. Through summarizing and studying previous experiences, this study seriously considered the following points. Firstly, we detected rotavirus and <italic>E. coli</italic> (F18, K88) in piglets&#x02019; feces before challenge experiment, excluding the possibility of the experimental piglets carrying rotavirus and <italic>E. coli</italic>.

Thirdly, the challenge experiment was verified and validated by <italic>E. coli</italic> F18 bacteria detection, bacteria counting and adhesion of small intestinal epithelial cells. The above points established the effectiveness and feasibility of our piglet diarrhea model using an artificial challenge experiment.</p><p>To date, small intestine transcriptome analyses concerning ETEC infection in swine have mainly been conducted using microarrays<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Compared with microarrays, RNA-Seq allows to determine the transcript abundance within a larger dynamic range of expression levels, is not limited by the available genomic sequencing information during microarray production and can provide information about new isoforms. Previous studies merely analyzed ETEC infection from the cellular level and were not detailed enough to reveal the regulatory mechanism of bacterial diarrhea in piglets. In this study, we first obtained full-sib individuals that were resistant and sensitive to <italic>E. coli</italic> F18. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which the transcription profiles of duodenum tissues were characterized by RNA-seq in full-sib piglets resistant and sensitive to <italic>E. coli</italic> F18. Analyses of the transcriptomes allowed us to better understand the molecular mechanisms and regulatory pathways related to the resistance to <italic>E. coli</italic> F18. Using RNA-seq analysis, we identified 198 DEGs (125 were upregulated and 73 downregulated) in the resistant group compared with the sensitive group. GO function and pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the DEGs were mainly involved in immune system process belonging to the biological process category and to immune system pathways. A recent study reported the mechanisms that regulate the interaction between the immune system and the microbiota, focusing on the role of resident intestinal bacteria in the development of immune responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. In view of the immune system in which upregulated DEGs were involved, we identified the TLR4-mediated Toll-like receptor signaling pathway (TLRs) as a candidate pathway. The Toll-like receptor (TLR) family recognizes conserved microbial structures, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide and viral double-stranded RNA, and activates signaling pathways that result in immune responses against microbial infections<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. The TLRs sense microbial populations in the intestine and initiate proinflammatory signaling pathways against invading microbial pathogens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>.</p><p>In addition, several regulated genes identified as DEGs in the present study, such as <italic>CD14</italic>, <italic>CXCL11</italic>, are significantly involved in the TLRs pathway. CXCL11, belonging to chemokine family, is produced by a variety of cells, including leukocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells upon stimulation with interferons (IFNs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. CXCL11 and its receptor, CXCR3, are likely to be associated with important inflammatory diseases of livestock, as well as with protective immunity to infectious diseases and tumors. Su <italic>et al.</italic> reported that CXCL11 was predominantly expressed in CD<sup>+</sup><sub>14</sub> cells of the mouse colonic mucosa lamina, producing proinflammatory effects in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and they interacted with a bacterial flagellum protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, suggesting that the immune regulation of <italic>CXCL11</italic> is closely related to the expression level of <italic>CD14</italic>. CD14, as the adaptor molecule of TLR signaling pathway, plays an important role in bacterial infection as a high affinity receptor of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which activated intracellular signaling pathways, ultimately leading to release cytokines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Moreover, the DEGs identified here were also involved in other infectious diseases, including pathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> infection pathway and <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection pathway, in both of which the <italic>CD14</italic> gene plays a significant role. Systemic <italic>CD14</italic>-inhibition efficiently, though organ dependent, attenuated local inflammatory responses in porcine <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> sepsis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. CD14, as a key upstream innate immunity molecule, was related to the early inflammatory and hemostatic responses in a pig model of gram-negative sepsis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. As can be seen, <italic>CD14</italic> gene plays a role in immune and inflammatory regulation of porcine with <italic>E. coli</italic> infection. In this study, the expression of <italic>CD14</italic> was regulated in LPS-induced IPEC-J2 cells by qPCR and western blot, meanwhile immunohistochemical analysis showed the increased expression of <italic>CD14</italic> in the <italic>E. coli</italic> F18-resistant individuals compared to F18-susceptible. Furthermore, the knockdown of <italic>CD14</italic> caused significant reductions in the levels of the cytokines IL-6 and IL-12 in the IPEC-J2 cell supernatants. Meanwhile the adhesion ability of F18ab strain with IPEC-J2 cells was significantly increased (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). IL-6 is a cytokine with multiple biological activities, some of which are involved in various aspects of immune and inflammatory responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Decreases expression of IL-6 in swine lymphocytes leads to continuous immunosuppression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>.
