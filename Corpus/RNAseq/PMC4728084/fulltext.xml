In addition it encodes the RNA components, i.e. 2 rRNAs and 22 tRNAs, that contribute to the separate machinery of protein synthesis inside mitochondria, that generates these polypeptides. Defects in mitochondrial protein synthesis are a frequent primary cause of mitochondrial disease: see reviews [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145836.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Their genetic origin can be either nuclear or mitochondrial, and they may affect mitochondrial rRNAs, tRNAs, ribosomal proteins, translation factors, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, tRNA modifying enzymes or other accessory factors. They can show a wide range of tissue-specific symptoms that remains largely unexplained, varying dramatically also in severity and age of onset. Whilst the consequences of the primary molecular defect may be clear at the level of the translational machinery, the link to pathogenesis is poorly understood. It is assumed to have metabolic, cellular, physiological and developmental dimensions, the elucidation of which requires well-controlled studies in appropriate model systems.</p><p>Our analyses have focused on a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of mitochondrial disease (<italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup>) [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] in which a nuclear mis-sense mutation in the gene for mitoribosomal protein S12 [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] gives rise to a quantitative defect in mitochondrial protein synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] impacting all four OXPHOS enzyme complexes dependent on mitochondrial translation products [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The molecular phenotype of <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> resembles that seen in human disorders resulting from point mutations in proteins of the mitoribosomal small subunit, including MRPS16 [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and MRPS22 [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. At organismal level the <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> mutation gives rise to a complex developmental and behavioral phenotype, whose main features are larval developmental delay and susceptibility to paralytic seizures induced by mechanical shock, described as bang-sensitivity [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> adults show an altered pattern of gene expression [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] that suggests a transformation of metabolism to accommodate the OXPHOS defect engendered by the mutation. Specifically, there is up-regulation of lactate dehydrogenase and of enzymes involved in the dietary mobilization and catabolism of protein and fat that suggest a switch to glycolysis for ATP production and to other substrates for the supply of carbon skeletons for biosynthesis.</p><p>The phenotype of developmental delay and bang-sensitivity, as well as the main (bisexual) changes in gene expression in adults, are shared with the mutant strain <italic>sesB</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], carrying a point mutation in the gene encoding the major isoform of the adenine nucleotide translocase [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Since the <italic>sesB</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> mutation limits the supply of mitochondrially supplied ATP to the cell, we infer that these common features are the signature of defective OXPHOS in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Furthermore, the <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> phenotype is not alleviated by expression of the non proton-motive alternative oxidase AOX from <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>, nor by the non proton-motive alternative NADH dehydrogenase Ndi1 from yeast [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], despite the fact that AOX and Ndi1 can partially compensate for the specific phenotypes produced by knockdown of subunits of OXPHOS complexes IV and I, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145836.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145836.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This supports the idea that the developmental phenotype of <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> results primarily from insufficient mitochondrial ATP production, rather than disturbed redox homeostasis.</p><p>The <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> phenotype can be partially alleviated by genetic suppressors in either nuclear or mitochondrial DNA [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145836.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which appear to increase the supply of mitochondrial translation products above a certain threshold. These findings suggested that we might also be able to manipulate the phenotype environmentally, by culturing the flies on media containing a different balance of dietary components. Specifically, we reasoned that media rich in sugars should support glycolysis and thus alleviate the mutant phenotype. If successful this could suggest a potential route to dietary management of patients with mitochondrial disease, particularly those with a global impairment of mitochondrial protein synthesis and thus of OXPHOS.</p><p>Surprisingly we found an opposite effect, namely that the <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> phenotype was exacerbated by sugar-rich media. Analysis of metabolite levels, gene expression, drug sensitivity and the status of proteins known to be involved in growth regulation and metabolite sensing has allowed us to construct a profile of the metabolic changes produced by the combination of mitochondrial dysfunction and high sugar diet, and a mechanistic model for how this leads to severe growth impairment. This knowledge has broad implications for understanding disease processes and their relation to diet.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>High-sugar diet exacerbates the growth-retardation of flies with mitochondrial dysfunction</title><p>In order to test whether sugar supplementation would mitigate the developmental retardation fsof <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> flies, we cultured flies on different media containing a standard yeast composition (3.5% dried yeast, w/v), but increasing amounts of sucrose.

NADPH is required to drive biosynthetic reactions, notably fatty acid synthesis, but is also needed to maintain redox homeostasis. It is mainly produced by five &#x02018;workhorse&#x02019; enzymes of catabolism (Panel B of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), also linked to the provision of carbon skeletons for biosynthesis. We therefore measured the activity of these enzymes in extracts from <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> and control larvae, and the effects on their activities of the high levels of lactate and pyruvate, as well as gluconate. The maximal activities of the NADPH-producing enzymes were broadly similar in extracts from <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> and control larvae (Panel C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). However, when we added lactate or pyruvate at the high concentrations observed in <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> larvae grown in high sugar, we saw inhibition of three of the enzymes that contribute substantially to NADPH production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). The degree of inhibition of malic enzyme by pyruvate may be an under-estimate, since the <italic>in vitro</italic> assay is conducted in substrate excess, whereas <italic>in vivo</italic> the high levels of pyruvate should decrease throughput to very low levels, via product inhibition. Gluconate also had a minor effect on NADP-linked IDH activity. Taking account of the likely inhibition of malic enzyme <italic>in vivo</italic>, and assuming that the effects of the tested metabolites on the other enzymes are additive, this could partially explain NADPH depletion in <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> larvae.</p><p>Further down-regulation of malic enzyme by RNAi produced no significant worsening of the developmental delay, and might even have slightly alleviated it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), whilst effects on wild-type (<italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> heterozygous) flies were minimal. A similar experiment to test for toxic effects of gluconate (or the failure to detoxify glucose), by down-regulating glucose dehydrogenase (Gld), could not be meaningfully executed, since global RNAi against Gld was developmentally lethal to both wild-type and <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> flies, as is the null mutant [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, advanced glycation end-products did not accumulate in larvae grown on high-sugar diet (Panel B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), indicating that they cannot account for the deleterious effects of high-sugar diet on <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup>. However, as discussed below, the accumulation of gluconate in larvae grown on high-sugar medium implies a mechanism for the additional depletion of NADPH resulting from diet.</p><p>The disturbed amino acid levels in <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) prompted us to consider whether a dietary deficiency or excess of amino acids might underlie aspects of the phenotype. To test this, we cultured flies on media containing a variable amount of yeast, the major source of dietary protein, but a fixed sucrose concentration at (7.5%). Varying the amount of yeast produced no change in the developmental delay of <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g004">Fig 4D</xref> and Panel B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Above a threshold level of 3.75%, yeast supplementation had no further effect on either <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> or control flies. At lower yeast concentrations, both were retarded further, but to the same extent, with males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g004">Fig 4D</xref>) and females (Panel B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) affected similarly. Similarly, high-protein diet had no detrimental effect on flies grown on low-sugar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and Panels C-E in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), and might even have had a slightly beneficial effect in the zero-sugar medium. Dietary supplementation with ornithine, found at unusually high levels in <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> larvae grown on high-sugar diet, had only very minor effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g004">Fig 4E</xref> and Panels D and E in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Growth inhibition in flies with mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with modulation of S6K</title><p>Since the developmental outcome in <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> is still a viable fly, its developmental delay must be the result of a coordinated signaling process with most likely both an intracellular and an endocrine component. In order to determine the molecular mechanism restraining growth in <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> larvae on different diets, we interrogated the status of major signaling pathways already known to be involved in growth regulation. The best characterized such pathway responding to intracellular energy status is that of AMPK [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. ATP depletion against a constant level of AMP, as documented in <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> larvae, should lead to activation of AMPK by phosphorylation at Thr-172 (human numbering), which then down-regulates many downstream growth-related functions. Western blotting using AMPK-specific antibodies, revealed increased levels of phosphorylated AMPK in <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> compared to wild-type larvae (Panel F, sub-panels i and ii in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) which was further enhanced on high-sugar diet, although none of these changes was dramatic. The best-characterized response pathway to extracellular signals, including diet and insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS), involves the kinase Akt, whose activation by phosphorylation at serine-505 has a growth-promoting readout that also facilitates glucose-related metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Accordingly, growth of wild-type larvae on high-sugar diet led to a modest increase in the phosphorylated form of Akt (Panel F, sub-panels iii and iv in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s004">S4 Fig</xref>,) which, taking account of the loading control, appeared to be partially abrogated in <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup>. The Akt and AMPK pathways converge on mTOR, the key regulator of cytosolic protein synthesis and growth, whose canonical readout is the phosphoryation status of S6K [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Consistent with this, we observed a decreased amount of the isoform of S6K phosphorylated at Thr-398 (one of the mTOR target sites) in <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> compared with wild-type larvae, although in both genotypes the level of this isoform appeared marginally higher on high-sugar than zero-sugar diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g004">Fig 4F</xref>, panels ii). More strikingly, we observed a substantial decrease in total S6K in <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> larvae, specifically on high-sugar diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g004">Fig 4F</xref>, panels i; biological replicates in Panel F, sub-panels v and vi in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).

The following summary conclusions emerge.</p><p>As regards the non-coding RNAs, despite some striking changes in abundance, very few of them are functionally assigned at this time, and thus cannot be assessed further. The largest absolute changes in protein-coding genes were seen mostly in those which were already highly expressed, and fell into well-defined functional classes. Wild-type larvae on high-sugar diet, compared with those grown on zero-sugar diet (Sheet C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s010">S3 Table</xref>), showed strong induction of genes connected with cytosolic translation, glycolysis, the structural proteins of muscle and the larval cuticle, whist the most strikingly down-regulated genes were gut-specific, and connected with digestive functions, including proteases, lipases, lysozymes, components of the peritrophic membrane and other chitin-binding proteins. In contrast, the vast majority of these genes were either less responsive, unaltered or even oppositely regulated by high-sugar diet in <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> larvae, where digestive functions were amongst the most prominently up-regulated genes. Comparing <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> with wild-type larvae (Sheet A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s010">S3 Table</xref>), mitochondrial transcripts were down-regulated on both diets, whilst the most striking differences on high-sugar diet were those already indicated above. Intriguingly, whilst many cytosolic translational components were down-regulated in <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> on high sugar, one that was up-regulated was the inhibitory factor Thor (4E-BP). Many of the genes showing the largest proportionate changes remain functionally unassigned, but genotype-specific changes were rather similar on the two diets (Sheet A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s010">S3 Table</xref>), whereas diet-specific changes (Sheet C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s010">S3 Table</xref>) were largely different between the two genotypes. One of the most highly induced genes in <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> larvae irrespective of diet was p24-2, whose mRNA was induced over 1000-fold compared with its level in control larvae. p24-2 is one of two fly homologues of yeast p24, a protein required for vesicle trafficking in the secretory pathway. Up-regulation of p24-2 suggests ER stress, but we saw no changes in the level or splicing pattern of Xbp1 RNA (Panels H and I in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), considered a marker for the induction of the classic ER stress response.

Elevated lactate, pyruvate and alanine are common findings in mitochondrial disease patients [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], considered to represent increased dependence on glycolysis under conditions where mitochondrial NADH re-oxidation is impaired [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> larvae showed decreased levels of the glycolytic intermediate immediately upstream of the rate-limiting step, i.e. fructose 1,6-biphosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g003">Fig 3E</xref>), consistent with increased glycolytic flux. Lactate accumulation may reflect the need for lactate dehydrogenase as an alternative pathway to regenerate NAD+ but, since it is accompanied by high pyruvate, may also be a consequence of decreased TCA cycle capacity due to the OXPHOS defect. Pyruvate accumulation may be partially adaptive, by feeding anaplerotic pathways, but addition of dietary pyruvate (or lactate) to <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> partially phenocopied the effects of high-sugar diet, implying these end-products of glycolysis to be important agents of the metabolic crisis that limits growth, even if only via product inhibition of glycolytic flux, thus compromising the maintenance of ATP levels. The reason for the additional burden of pyruvate and lactate resulting from high-sugar diet is not immediately obvious. It may partly be a consequence of increased substrate availability for glycolysis and other catabolic pathways that converge on pyruvate. Logically, however, it also reflects maladaptive effects of sugar-dependent signaling.</p><p>Whist <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> larvae are able to maintain normal NAD+/NADH levels, NADP+/NADPH homeostasis is severely disturbed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). As well as its role as an electron donor for biosynthesis, NADPH buffers oxidative stress, most importantly as a cofactor in the regeneration of the reduced form of thioredoxin [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], which in <italic>Drosophila</italic> replaces the functions of glutathione reductase [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Mitochondria from <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> flies produce excess ROS [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], potentially accounting in part for NADPH depletion. High levels of pyruvate and lactate, which we demonstrate to inhibit key NADPH-generating enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), notably IDH and malic enzyme, may also play an influence.</p><p>The further depletion of NADPH in <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> grown in high sugar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) appears to be a compounding of these effects with an independent effect of high-sugar diet. Excess unmodified glucose is toxic because of its ability to react with the lysine side-chains of proteins, bringing about their irreversible inactivation via the Maillard reaction [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145836.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This toxicity is believed to play a major role in the pathology of diabetes (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]), and organisms use a variety of strategies to minimize exposure of the tissues to excess glucose. <italic>Drosophila</italic> can detoxify glucose via the FAD-linked enzyme glucose dehydrogenase (Gld, CG1152, EC 1.1.99.10), which produces gluconate as an inert end-product, avoiding the generation of peroxide [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145836.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Thus, as predicted, gluconate accumulates in larvae grown on high-sugar medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). Although the exact electron acceptor for Gld is not known [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], its regeneration should depend on the cytochrome P450 system, in which terminal oxidation is coupled to NADPH consumption, in the general reaction A-H2 + 2NADPH + O2 &#x02192; 2H2O + 2NADP+ A (where A is a generic electron acceptor). An effect on NADPH is evident even in wild-type larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), although it does not appear to impair development in the absence of the other metabolic disturbances seen in <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup>. However, its compounding with the effects of OXPHOS deficiency in <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> leads to the highly abnormal situation of a reversal in the NADPH/NADP+ ratio that must have serious consequences for many cellular processes. Notably, the processing of secreted proteins in the ER is highly dependent on NADP+/NADPH homeostasis [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145836.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Disturbed proteostasis in the secretory pathway [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] would be predicted to affect those tissues most exposed to dietary glucose and most dependent on secretion, i.e. the gut and its associated organs, and the epidermis, which secretes the larval cuticle at each molt. This is concordant with the altered patterns of gene expression that we observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s011">S4 Table</xref>).</p><p>The ability of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval gut to mount a classic ER stress-response is limited. Xbp1, the key transcription factor required to effect the response, is already reported to be constitutively activated in the larval gut [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], consistent with our own findings (Panerls H and I of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Neither diet nor the <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> mutation had any further effect on its global expression level or splicing, suggesting that there is only a limited capacity for handling further proteotoxic stress in the ER. The activation of accessory pathways for secretion, such as involving p24-2 (Sheet A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s010">S3 Table</xref>), may be a signature of this. P24 proteins are involved in the sorting of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored proteins into COPII vesicles [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145836.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] which then transit to the cell surface via the Golgi.

However, decreased OXPHOS capacity and limitations on glycolysis due to high pyruvate and/or lactate may not be the only reasons for ATP depletion. Protein folding and refolding are highly ATP-consuming processes, as is the proteolytic degradation of misfolded or aggregated proteins [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Disturbed ER proteostasis in the ER may therefore be a drain on already decreased levels of ATP.</p><p>The consequences of the amino acid abnormalities detected in <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> larvae are less clear. Deficiencies in specific amino acids are expected to trigger growth arrest and inhibition of cytosolic protein synthesis through the TOR pathway independently of the effects of ATP depletion. However, dietary supplementation with protein did not rescue <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup>. The amino acid imbalances in mutant larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g004">Fig 4D</xref>) are therefore best considered as a side-effect of pyruvate overload that, on their own, are insufficient to trigger growth arrest. Excess alanine, also seen in patients with elevated pyruvate [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145836.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], probably results from the action of alanine aminotransferase [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Similar arguments may apply to serine. The abnormalities in ornithine and citrulline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), combined with the observed changes in mRNAs for enzymes involved in their metabolism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s010">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s011">S4</xref> Tables), are harder to interpret, as are effects on polyamine levels, none of which offer any explanation for growth limitation in <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> (Panel C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Moreover, ornithine supplementation in zero-sugar diet did not phenocopy the effects of high sugar, and may even have slightly alleviated it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g004">Fig 4E</xref>).</p><p>Since it is difficult to manipulate the levels of pyruvate, ATP and NADPH independently, their relative contributions to the developmental phenotype are difficult to apportion.

We postulate that, in the wild, this would allow the fly to survive in different nutritional environments, perhaps including those in which it may be exposed to toxins targeted on OXPHOS or mitochondrial translation. The response clearly has both a transcriptional and post-translational dimension, though the underlying signaling machineries may overlap, and may also operate tissue-specifically, accounting for the many changes in expression of genes expressed uniquely in the gut, muscle or epidermis. Furthermore, although transcriptional responses most likely underlie the major changes in mRNA levels, we cannot exclude a contribution from non-coding RNAs regulated in response to the <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> mutation or the sugar content of the diet.</p><p>We found evidence for the involvement of several well-characterized signaling pathways converging on cytosolic protein synthesis, notably including the ATP-responsive AMPK and nutrient-sensitive (Akt) pathways, as well as the key target of TOR signaling, S6K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g006">Fig 6B</xref>).

However, it would appear that initiation is already working at close to maximal capacity in wild-type <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, since cycloheximide inhibits growth in a dose-dependent manner even at low concentrations. In contrast, at doses up to 100 &#x003bc;g/ml, <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> flies were refractory to cycloheximide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g005">Fig 5B</xref> and Panel C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s005">S5 Fig</xref>), indicating a condition where initiation, rather than elongation, is constrained, and is thus rate-limiting for protein synthesis and growth.

Thus, while total levels of the AMPK &#x003b1;-subunit are little altered, <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> flies show increased amounts of the isoform phosphorylated at Thr-172, which attenuates TOR signaling [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], but a corresponding decrease in the isoform of Akt phophorylated at Ser-505, which activates TOR. The increase in AMPK phosphorylation is consistent with the observed ATP depletion [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], but the mechanism by which Akt signaling attenuated remains unknown, and could involve any of the metabolic changes associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.</p><p>Consistent with these changes, <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> shows decreased amounts of the isoform of the key TOR target [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] S6K, phosphorylated at Thr-398, which in turn activates translational initiation [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, all of these changes are rather modest, raising doubts as to whether they, alone, could account for an effective halving of the growth rate during larval development.</p><p>The most important new link between S6K and growth regulation is our finding that the level of S6K protein itself (specifically, the homologue of human S6K1) is strongly decreased in <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> larvae grown on high-sugar medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g004">Fig 4F</xref> and Panel F in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).

Neither Sun et al.

The first is that further activation of AMPK in susceptible tissues (Panel F in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), resulting from the more profound depletion of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), triggers S6K turnover, e.g. via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. A second would invoke a regulator akin to AMPK, but activated instead by the abnormal NADPH/NADP+ ratio. A third such putative regulator would be sensitive to elevated gluconate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g003">Fig 3F</xref>), which may be considered a specific indicator of the stress of high dietary sugar in the fly. A further possibility is that S6K levels are regulated by the downstream consequences of these metabolic changes, for example in response to proteotoxic stress or translational imbalances (see summary model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g008">Fig 8</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0145836.g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0145836.g008</object-id><label>Fig 8</label><caption><title>Summary model of the growth phenotype of <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> in high-sugar medium.</title><p>NADPH depletion disturbs protein homeostasis in the ER (and may also be exacerbated by it, in a vicious cycle) consuming further ATP.

Whilst the down-regulation of growth in <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> might be at least partially cell-autonomous, the fact that it appears to emanate from a deficiency of mitochondrial protein synthesis in a specific tissue (i.e. the gut, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g006">Fig 6</xref>), and that one readout is altered feeding behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), it is likely to involve either a known [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] or still unknown endocrine circuit centered on the gut.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Tissue-specificity of the effects of mitochondrial dysfunction in development</title><p>Five pieces of evidence implicate the gut as a crucial tissue mediating the growth retardation of <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> larvae, particularly its enhancement in high-sugar diet. First, based on dye ingestion, we observed a decreased food intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). Second, specific gut alpha-glucosidases were down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), and further down-regulated in high sugar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), suggestive of decreased sugar absorption and accounting, at least partially, for decreased serum sugar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Third, mRNAs coding for gut-specific enzymes were amongst those most responsive to diet and genotype, many showing clearly opposite behaviour in <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> compared with wild-type (Sheets A and C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s011">S4 Table</xref>). The transcriptional readout of mitochondrial dysfunction in relation to diet is therefore largely gut-specific. Of note also is the fact that, in high sugar, <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> larvae showed down-regulation of many mRNAs coding for components of the machineries of cytosolic translation and secretion (Sheet A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s011">S4 Table</xref>) and, at the protein level, of S6K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g004">Fig 4F</xref> and Panel F in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), considered a key regulator of translation, whilst the gut is one of the most important secretory organs. Fourth, the additional metabolic stress arising from NADPH depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) as a by-product of glucose oxidation must logically occur in a tissue exposed to high sugar levels. Given the fact that serum sugar is not elevated in <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g002">Fig 2E</xref>) the only major tissues exposed to high sugar should be the epidermis and the gut. Finally, when directly tested using a gut-specific driver at 18&#x000b0;C, expression of the wild-type <italic>tko</italic> gene was able partially to rescue the developmental delay of <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), implicating the gut as a major tissue where insufficiency of mitochondrial protein synthesis impairs growth.

The expression of several of the insulin-like peptides is slightly increased at the RNA level (Panel G in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), but their exact functions in metabolic or growth regulation remain unclear, and mRNA levels may not reflect those of the peptides themselves [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Moreover, pAkt, considered a primary mediator of insulin signaling [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145836.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], although down-regulated in <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> compared with wild-type (Panel F in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), was still modestly increased in response to high-sugar diet (Panel F in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).</p><p>Changes in insulin-signaling may contribute to lowered serum sugar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g002">Fig 2E</xref>), enhanced expression of excretory sugar transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g002">Fig 2A and 2C</xref>), decreased muscle biosynthesis (Sheets A and C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s011">S4 Table</xref>) and increased triglycerides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g003">Fig 3G</xref>), but these may be considered as adaptive responses to mitochondrial dysfunction rather than a pathological signature and, at least to some degree, are seen also in <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> larvae grown on zero-sugar medium.</p><p>Because it is also manifest on zero-sugar medium, the elevated level of triglycerides seen in <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> is not simply a classic &#x02018;sugar-into-fat&#x02019; response to sugar overload. More likely, fat deposition represents an alternate system for storing energy needed to fuel metamorphosis, partially replacing the accumulation of muscle. Larval body wall muscle is largely turned over during metamorphosis [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], but <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> larvae exhibit down-regulation of mRNAs coding for structural proteins of muscle (Sheet A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s011">S4 Table</xref>). The response of wild-type larvae to high-sugar diet involves up-regulation of muscle and cuticular components, as well as glycolysis and the cytosolic translation system (Sheet A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s011">S4 Table</xref>). Unlike yeast or cancer cells, where high-glucose media promote more rapid growth [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], wild-type <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae do not grow more rapidly on a high-sugar diet, possibly even slightly slower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0145836.g001">Fig 1</xref> and Panel A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Increased biosynthesis of cuticle and muscle might be a signature of an avoidance response to a high-sugar environment. As already noted, sugar overload should be toxic to the epidermis and to the gut, due to protein glycation and/or NADPH depletion resulting from glucose oxidation. Increased production of cuticle proteins may protect the epidermis, whilst the accumulation of body wall muscle will facilitate the movement of the larva to a less stressful environment. The metabolic consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction may limit this response in <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> larvae. Muscle is also one of the most energy-consuming tissues, and developmental reprogramming that limits muscle biosynthesis, storing biomass for later catabolism during metamorphosis instead as fat, may be considered an energy-sparing response to ATP depletion that is signaled via AMPK or its downstream targets.</p><p>The metabolic crisis experienced by <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> larvae in high sugar diet may have a more general relevance in mitochondrial disease. Other data supports the idea that ketogenic or low carbohydrate diet is beneficial for mitochondrial disease patients or animal models thereof [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145836.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The combination of ATP deletion and glycotoxic stress is likely to occur in many contexts relevant to human pathology. Although glucose homeostasis operates differently in mammals, some secretory tissues are naturally susceptible to glucose overload, notably the gut, and perhaps most importantly, the islet cells of the pancreas, which must respond to physiological fluctuations in glucose. <italic>Drosophila</italic> Gld does not have a strict orthologue in mammals: however, it is member of a multigene family of choline-glucose dehydrogenases that ultimately consume NADPH, whose many mammalian members remain functionally unidentified.</p><p>Our findings implicate pyruvate overload, ATP depletion and disturbed NADP/NADPH homeostasis as key elements of the metabolic crisis resulting from OXPHOS deficiency, especially in the presence of high dietary sugar, with deranged protein homeostasis in the secretory pathway as an unexpected outcome. As well as suggesting possible new drug targets in mitochondrial disease, they may also be relevant to cancer. To facilitate rapid growth, many tumors switch to aerobic glycolysis for ATP production (the Warburg effect), at the same time frequently down-regulating OXPHOS, commonly by accumulating mtDNA mutations. However, if what is true of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae is also true of such tumors, high glucose levels should provoke a metabolic crisis that curtails growth or may even lead to apoptosis, if NADPH/NADP+ homeostasis is pushed beyond a certain limit. Since many of the commonly used drugs in cancer chemotherapy are metabolized via the NADPH-consuming cytochrome P450 system, NADPH depletion should be considered a possible mechanism by which they are really provoking tumor destruction. In this case, tumors that become chemo-resistant via activation of multi-drug resistance pathway might still be vulnerable to glucose overload.</p><p>In humans, pyruvate treatment has been suggested to be effective in some cases of mitochondrial disease [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], whereas other studies found no convincing benefits from treatments such as with dichloroacetate, designed to increase mitochondrial pyruvate utilization and thus decrease cytosolic pyruvate load (for review see [<xref rid="pone.0145836.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]). In <italic>tko</italic><sup><italic>25t</italic></sup> larvae, pyruvate supplementation is clearly deleterious, but dichloroacetate treatment also provided no benefit and tended to exacerbate rather than relieve developmental delay on both high and zero-sugar diets (Panel J in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0145836.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Thus, the issue is not pyruvate levels <italic>per se</italic>, but the inability of OXPHOS-defective mitochondria to metabolize pyruvate.
