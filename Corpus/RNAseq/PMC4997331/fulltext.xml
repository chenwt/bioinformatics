This is dependent upon standardization of workflows to ensure comparability both within and between studies. Here we propose the standard use of an alternate collection and stabilization method that would facilitate such comparisons. The DNA Genotek OMNIgene&#x02219;Gut Stool Microbiome Kit was compared to the currently accepted community standard of freezing to store human stool samples prior to whole genome sequencing (WGS) for microbiome studies. This stabilization and collection device allows for ambient temperature storage, automation, and ease of shipping/transfer of samples. The device permitted the same data reproducibility as with frozen samples, and yielded higher recovery of nucleic acids. Collection and stabilization of stool microbiome samples with the DNA Genotek collection device, combined with our extraction and WGS, provides a robust, reproducible workflow that enables standardized global collection, storage, and analysis of stool for microbiome studies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Advances in DNA sequencing have enabled researchers to broadly assess microbial communities in a culture-independent, high-resolution manner. Metagenomic studies have been used to monitor shifts in human microbiome composition and function associated with diseases such as obesity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, diabetes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, and cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Recent discoveries have suggested the utility of microbiome profiles as biomarkers with diagnostic and prognostic value<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. It is evident, however, that the validity and reproducibility of data from these studies are highly dependent upon the quality of the collected microbiome samples. For any analysis, an accurate microbiome snapshot must be captured when the sample is collected. Key to this is immediate stabilization of the sample. Although one study claimed no differences were detected after two weeks storage at room temperature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, many studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> have demonstrated the importance of proper storage of these samples for accurate results.</p><p>Recently, we reported on how sequencing library preparation artifacts can influence microbiome data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, highlighting the need for consistent and standardized protocols to improve the interpretation of microbiome data. There have also been recent calls from the larger scientific community for a standardized global study to assess the diversity of the human microbiome and correlations with health and disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. In order for such a study to be feasible, thousands of microbiome samples would need to be collected, stabilized in remote locations, and shipped to the laboratory for processing. Ambient temperature storage and shipment of samples would greatly facilitate and standardize such a study by enabling easy collection outside of the clinic, avoiding inconsistent sample handling and storage, and reducing shipping costs.</p><p>A recent study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> used 16S rDNA sequencing to compare a new commercially available ambient temperature stabilization kit, OMNIgene&#x02219;GUT (DNA Genotek, Inc. Ottawa, CAN), to stabilization in RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX), in Tris-EDTA buffer, and storage by freezing using repeated sampling from a single subject. The authors proposed use of OMNIgene&#x02219;GUT as an alternative stabilization method when refrigeration and cold-chain transportation are not available. We chose to extend this analysis to a larger subject population and to use whole genome sequencing (WGS) to analyze the microbial communities in each sample, as the impact of storage conditions can vary. WGS increases the resolution and specificity of metagenomic analyses compared to 16S rDNA sequencing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, and enables gene and functional analysis. We elected to compare freshly extracted samples without storage (Basal) to DNA Genotek stabilized samples (Stabilized) and to samples that were frozen at &#x02212;20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (Frozen), emphasizing conditions that are more readily available globally.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Nucleic acid output per mg stool is consistently higher in Stabilized samples</title><p>Donor stool samples were collected and DNA extractions were performed as described (see Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Throughout the time course, the amount of DNA recovered per mg stool input was significantly higher in Stabilized samples compared to both Basal (freshly extracted without storage) and Frozen samples. Stabilized samples on Day 0 recovered on average 79% more DNA than Basal samples and 74% more DNA than Frozen samples (<italic>p-</italic>values 0.0009 and 0.001 respectively). DNA recovered from Stabilized samples on Day 1, and Day 28 were also significantly higher than Frozen samples, with <italic>p</italic>-values of 0.004 and 0.0001 respectively, and on average 65% and 79% more DNA recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Consistent with DNA extractions, RNA extracted from Stabilized samples also gave higher total RNA recovered per mg stool input. On average, Stabilized samples yielded 250% more RNA than Basal samples on Day 0, and 1000% more RNA after 28 days freezer storage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). These extractions were significantly different, with <italic>p</italic>-values of 0.0006 and 0.007 respectively. High quality cDNA libraries were made reproducibly using RNA extracted from Stabilized samples, indicating that the RNA extracted was of high quality. Sequencing metrics from RNASeq libraries extracted from a Stabilized stool sample in duplicate are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table S1</xref>. These results indicate Stabilized samples yield significantly higher DNA and RNA than Frozen samples.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Assembly and sequencing metrics are largely unaffected by stabilization method</title><p>Sequencing metrics were compared to examine for any biases associated with the stabilization methods (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The summary of sequencing assembly metrics is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>. In order to ensure an unbiased comparison, we used the same number of non-human reads for assembly of all samples. In all sequencing assembly metrics tested, except for % human reads, no significant differences were detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>, <italic>p</italic>-values&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05: see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table S4</xref>). However the % human reads in Stabilized samples were significantly lower than Frozen samples, albeit a small decrease (0.04% vs 0.06%, <italic>p</italic>-value 0.00576). For each individual sample, the assembly quality was assessed by considering total contig length <italic>vs</italic>. contig rank in the order of decreasing length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). We did not detect any patterns based on stabilization method. Within sequencing metrics, the % duplicated reads was significantly lower in Stabilized samples, compared to both Basal and Frozen samples (<italic>p</italic>-values 0.02964 and 0.00139 respectively), and the fraction of low quality reads was lower in Stabilized samples compared to Frozen samples (<italic>p</italic>-value 0.03473). These results indicate that the sequencing and assembly results for Stabilized and Frozen methods largely are comparable, with the exceptions of the observed decreases in % human reads and % duplicated reads.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Stabilized samples yield taxonomic and abundance profiles consistent with Basal and Frozen signatures</title><p>An important aspect of microbiome collection and storage protocols is reproducibility. Relative species abundances of the top thirty species across all subjects were compared in each sample to determine the reproducibility of Stabilized samples to Basal and Frozen samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). In the majority of subjects, both Frozen and Stabilized samples retained similar species abundances to those of the corresponding Basal sample, with the exception of subject 13 for Stabilized samples, and individual timepoints for Frozen samples in subjects 1 and 13. Individual species abundance graphs for all subjects are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. S2</xref>. Relative species abundances from each time point of the Frozen and Stabilized samples were compared to the relative species abundances of the Basal sample using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity scores. Clustering based on these dissimilarity scores revealed that intra-subject variation was greater than changes based on stabilization method, as each subject clustered into its own clade, and these subject clades had short branch lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Bray-Curtis dissimilarity scores within Frozen samples ranged from 0.019 to 0.283, while dissimilarity scores within Stabilized samples had a narrower range from 0.016 to 0.172 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Both Frozen and Stabilized samples remained similar to the Basal sample with low Bray-Curtis dissimilarity score medians of 0.073 and 0.1 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>), indicating results with Stabilized samples are consistent with those of Frozen samples.</p><p>In healthy adults, 80% of fecal taxa fall within three phyla: Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. The fold change in Frozen and Stabilized Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phylum abundance relative to Basal was quantified in order to compare the degree of change in Stabilized samples. The Bacteroidetes phylum remained stable in both Frozen and Stabilized samples, with an average fold change of 0-fold across all time points relative to Basal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. S3a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table S5</xref>). The Firmicutes phylum remained stable in Frozen samples with an average of 0-fold across all samples, while the average was 0.2-fold in Stabilized samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. S3a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table S5</xref>). Comparing Frozen fold-changes to Stabilized fold-changes, the Day 1 Firmicutes and Day 28 fold changes for both Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were significantly different (<italic>p</italic>-values: 0.03864, 0.0155, and 0.01825 respectively), but this was not the case for Day 0 (<italic>p</italic>-values: 0.6772 and 0.06396 for Day 0 Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes respectively). However these incremental changes are unlikely to have a biological effect.</p><p>Individual species within a microbiome can perform the same function(s) as another individual species, which would be masked in a purely taxonomic analysis. Therefore characterizing the functional capability of a microbiome at the protein level is critical. Taking advantage of WGS, we compared relative TIGRFAM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> and Pfam<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> abundances from each time point of Basal, Frozen, and Stabilized samples to determine the similarity of stabilized samples to Basal using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity scores. Consistent with the taxonomic based distances, clustering based on these Bray-Curtis dissimilarity scores revealed intra-subject variation was greater than changes based on stabilization method, as the majority of subjects clustered into subject clades, and these subject clades had short branch lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. S4a</xref>). However, in subjects 1 and 12 for TIGRFAM, and subjects 1, 12, and 14 for Pfam, the time points/conditions were split across 2 distinct clades. TIGRFAM Bray-Curtis dissimilarity within Frozen samples ranged from 0.019 to 0.216 while distances within Stabilized samples ranged from 0.014 to 0.218 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>) indicating low variability within both stabilization methods. Both Frozen and Stabilized samples remained similar to Basal with low Bray-Curtis distance score medians of 0.038 and 0.046 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>), indicating Stabilized samples give consistent results to that of Frozen samples.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Stabilized and Frozen samples are reproducible</title><p>Ideally, metagenomic analyses of properly stabilized samples should produce identical data, regardless of the length of time that the sample is stored. In order to address the reproducibility of Freezing and Stabilized methods with time in storage, precision analysis was used to compare within a given method the relative species abundance values for Day 0, to the Day 1 and to the Day 28 relative species abundance values. Linear regression analysis was used to determine how well the line explains the data, with r<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1 indicating a perfect fit. In representative Subject 6, within Frozen samples, relative species abundance values of Day 0 compared to both Day 1 and Day 28 retain high reproducibility, with r<sup>2</sup> values of 0.99 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). Precision analysis in representative Subject 6 also showed high reproducibility in Stabilized samples, with r<sup>2</sup> values of 0.98 and 0.99 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). Regression values for all subjects comparing Day 0 to both Day 1 and Day 28 relative species abundances are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>. These results indicate Stabilized sample reproducibility is consistent with reproducibility found in Frozen samples.</p><p>Species richness and biodiversity are vital to the function of a microbiome and decreases in both are correlated with disease in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Richness was calculated by counting the number of distinct species found in the sample above a set threshold of relative species abundance and read count. To assess biodiversity we used Shannon&#x02019;s Diversity index (SDI), which takes into account both the number of distinct species, and the evenness of those species by accounting for the relative species abundances. Comparing samples within a method, both Frozen and Stabilized samples had similar richness and SDI scores across time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table S6</xref>). Using aggregate data that includes all subjects, no significant difference was observed between Frozen and Stabilized community richness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>, p-values&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.1 see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S6</xref>), however Stabilized samples had significantly, albeit very small, increased SDI scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>, <italic>p</italic>-value 0.00171, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table S6</xref>). These results indicate Stabilized samples richness are consistent with those of Frozen samples and biodiversity may be increased in Stabilized samples.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Stabilization of biological samples is crucial for accurate analysis of microbiome data, and for comparison across studies. Unstabilized samples introduce unwanted variation due to changes in the community caused by differential cell growth or death and the potential for nucleic acid degradation that can result in taxonomic predictions that do not accurately reflect the <italic>in vivo</italic> community at the time of sample collection. Current sample collection protocols from the NIH funded Human Microbiome Project (HMP) recommend sample storage at &#x02212;80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, while the Center for Disease Control recommends storage below &#x02212;15&#x02009;&#x000b0;C<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. These recommendations limit the ability to perform sample collections at geographic locations where access to these storage conditions do not exist, and limit collections from large cohorts that require storage of a large number of samples at these temperatures. In order for samples to be shared across laboratories, specimens undergo multiple freeze/thaw cycles or require an additional burden of aliquoting and archiving samples. In order to collect a large global reference set as proposed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, it will be important to implement a standard collection protocol that is not restricted by location, by availability of required storage conditions, nor by limitations on sample sharing.</p><p>In this study, the ability of the DNA Genotek OMNIgene&#x02219;Gut Stool Microbiome Kit (Stabilized) to stabilize and store stool samples was compared to fresh stool samples (Basal) as a reference point, and the standard storage protocol of freezing (Frozen). Stabilized samples were found to be equivalent or better than Frozen samples in all technical metrics tested, yet added additional functionality. Stabilized samples yielded higher quantities of both DNA and RNA, thereby decreasing the amount of stool needed for further analysis. This is especially important for mRNA sequencing, since &#x0003e;90% of the RNA is ribosomal and is discarded during processing. Stabilized and Frozen samples provided both unbiased and reproducible results comparable to those of the Basal sample based on measures of sequencing metrics, species abundance, functional profiles, and diversity measures. We also did not detect significant change between Stabilized and Frozen samples. Intra-subject variation was greater than changes based on stabilization method. These findings are consistent with recent work comparing this kit to other stabilization methods<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p><p>The majority of human microbiome characterization has focused on microbial community structure, the types and numbers of microbes present, but recently there is a transition towards a focus on microbial community function&#x02013;the metabolic activities and end products resulting from microbial activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. The application of WGS to microbiome characterization enables this functional level analysis, increasing the usefulness of microbiome analysis to the clinic. Compared to 16S rDNA sequencing at the same sequencing depth, WGS also increases resolution and specificity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, resulting in increased coverage of low abundant organisms, and enabling of gene level analysis. Progress towards medically actionable outcomes for the microbiome will depend on the characterization of the microbiome at the functional level, requiring WGS in future standardized workflows.</p><p>Global implementation of the DNA Genotek kit, or a similar collection/stabilization device, would present the microbiome community with increased consistency and standardization of sample collection and provides an automation-friendly device that enables high-throughput processing. This kit removes the need for expensive dry ice and cold pack shipping, as well as reduces the carbon footprint of &#x02212;20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C/&#x02212;80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C freezers, by permitting storage at ambient temperature. This device enables transfer of identical sample material between community members, as samples are immediately stabilized and homogenized, and aliquots can be taken at ambient temperature, removing the hindrance of freeze/thaw cycles. These properties enable collaborative studies, including laboratories in distinct geographical sites across the world, reducing the potential for location specific sample collection effects, and reducing costs. Together, the implementation of DNA Genotek stabilization with WGS enables functional characterization of global microbiomes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Experimental Design</title><p>Stool samples were collected from consented donors under an IRB approved protocol.

Amplification was performed by Veriti 96 well PCR (Applied Biosystems) followed by AMPure XP bead cleanup (Beckman Coulter, PN. A63880). Fragment size was measured using Labchip GX Touch high-sensitivity.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cluster Generation and Next Generation Sequencing</title><p>Samples were normalized to 1&#x02009;nM, pooled, and diluted to 8&#x02009;pM. The paired-end cluster kit V4 was used and cluster generation was performed on an Illumina cBot, with pooled samples in all 8 lanes. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 using SBS kit V4 chemistry. Median Cluster densities (K mm<sup>2</sup>) were 908.5 for Nextera XT.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Taxonomic assignment and assembly analysis</title><p>Microbiome sequences were processed and analyzed with Human Longevity Inc&#x02019;s (HLIs) proprietary microbiome annotation pipeline. Raw BCL data were de-multiplexed and converted to Paired End (PE) reads of 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;125 base pairs in FASTQ format, trimming the adapter sequence. Reads were then filtered using Trimmomatic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. After removal of low quality bases, and reads shorter than 90 nt, duplicated read pairs were identified with the program cd-hit-dup<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> by matching the first 50 bases from both R1 and R2 reads (cd-hit-dup parameter -u 50).</p><p>Reads were aligned to Human genome hg38 using BWA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> and all reads that mapped were excluded from downstream analysis. All non-human reads were mapped to HLI&#x02019;s reference genome database. This database consists of a collection of ~11,900 genomes of bacteria, archaea, viruses, and eukaryotes downloaded from NCBI; the collection includes both complete as well as draft genomes. After read-mapping, an in-house implementation of an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, similar to the GRAMMy algorithm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> was used to process the reads that were ambiguously mapped to multiple genomes in order to estimate Relative Genome Abundances (RGA). Based on the EM program&#x02019;s assignment of reads to genomes, the genome coverage, which is the total length of mapped reads divided by the reference genome length, was calculated for each reference genome. The relative abundance of a reference genome is the genome coverage divided by the sum of all genome coverages. The relative abundances were aggregated at each taxonomic rank: species, genus, family, order, class and phylum. As a measure of confidence in unique taxonomic assignment, relative species abundances below the threshold of 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> were removed from further analysis. Non-human reads were assembled using IDBA-UD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> to generate contigs. Since the size of assembly results highly depends on the amount of input reads, we started with an equal amount of 6.77 million high quality reads for each sample for assembly. After human reads removal, the non-human reads used for assembly are 6.73&#x02013;6.77 million.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>TIGRFAM/Pfam analysis</title><p>ORFs were predicted from scaffolds using MetaGene and compared with several reference protein or domain families, including COG, KOG, Pfam, TIGRFAM, and a comprehensive protein sequence database with RPS-BLAST (COG and KOG), Hmmer3 (Pfam and TIGRFAM) and NCBI BLASTP&#x02009;+&#x02009;(protein db). Here, the protein database contains the non-redundant proteins at 90% sequence identity from all proteins from the ~11,900 reference genomes. For metagenome samples, a portion of the reads, sometimes a significant portion of the reads, may not be assembled into scaffolds. These singleton reads were also analyzed and compared with the reference databases. For each sample, 5 subsets were made by randomly selecting reads from the singletons reads. Each subset is either 10% of the singleton reads or 100,000 reads, whichever is smaller. ORFs were predicted from these subsets using MetaGene and compared with the reference databases. The depth of coverage of scaffolds, based on the reads to scaffold mapping, were assigned to all the ORFs predicted from them. The depth of coverage of ORFs from a singleton reads subset is calculated as the total number of singleton reads divided by the number of reads in the subset.</p><p>Only the non-overlapping, top-scored alignments were used to calculate the protein family abundance, in a similar way of calculating the relative reference genome abundance. The protein family coverage is the sum of the alignment length multiplied by the depth of coverage of an ORF that hit the protein family, divided by the sequence length of the protein family. Both ORFs from the scaffolds and from singleton reads were considered. The contribution from the singletons was averaged from the 5 subsets. The relative protein family abundance is the protein family coverage divided by the sum of coverage of all protein families.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Richness and Biodiversity Calculation and Normalization</title><p>For each sample taxonomic identities and relative abundance were assigned as described above (see Methods: Taxonomic assignment and assembly analysis). In addition to the threshold requirement of relative species abundance of at least 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>, species with less than 100 read counts were also removed from richness and biodiversity analysis. Including only the species that met these threshold requirements, richness and biodiversity were calculated. Richness was calculated by counting the distinct number of individual species identified. Biodiversity was defined as Shannon&#x02019;s Diversity Index (SDI)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, which accounts for the number of distinct species and the relative species abundances. Each sample was then normalized to the corresponding Basal sample from the same subject to enable comparisons across different subjects who can have different levels of diversity. These normalized scores did not appear to be a normal distribution as shown by visual inspection.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Sequencing metrics</title><p>To determine significant differences in sequencing assembly metrics among the three sample types we used the Wilcoxon Ranked Sum test from the R statistical package<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>.
