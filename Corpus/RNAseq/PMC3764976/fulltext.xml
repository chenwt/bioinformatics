splice variants, representing approximately 24&#x02019;450 distinct genes.
Comparative analysis to the available genome-predicted transcriptomes
identified 10&#x02019;597 novel <italic>Hydra</italic> transcripts that encode 529
evolutionarily-conserved proteins. The annotation of 170 human orthologs
points to critical functions in protein biosynthesis, FGF and TOR signaling,
vesicle transport, immunity, cell cycle regulation, cell death,
mitochondrial metabolism, transcription and chromatin regulation. However, a
majority of these novel transcripts encodes short ORFs, at least 767 of them

11&#x02019;270 predicted transcripts that correspond either to silent genes or

Bilateria (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. <italic>Hydra</italic> anatomy is organized as a tube with an oral-aboral axis
consisting of two cell-layers and three populations of stem cells (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). Since the discovery of <italic>Hydra</italic> regeneration in the
mid XVIII<sup>th</sup> century, <italic>Hydra</italic> provides a unique model system to
study how exogenous perturbations can reactivate a developmental program in an adult
organism (see in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). Indeed, <italic>Hydra</italic> possesses the amazing ability to regenerate any
missing part upon bisection of its body column. To dissect the genetic cascades
supporting regenerative processes, a complete report of the genetic toolkit
expressed in this animal is necessary. Among cnidarians, genomic data are currently
available from three species, <italic>Hydra magnipapillata</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> (sea anemone) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and <italic>Acropora digitifera</italic> (coral) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Transcriptomic data are available from the colonial hydroid
<italic>Hydractinia equinata</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], from the jellyfish <italic>Clytia haemispherica</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], from the coral <italic>Acropora millepora</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and from two distinct <italic>Hydra</italic> strains that belong to the
heterogeneous <italic>vulgaris</italic> group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition, two sets of putative transcripts, called here pred-CA and
pred-RP, have been predicted from the <italic>Hydra magnipapillata</italic> genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In spite of these efforts, the transcriptome of <italic>Hydra</italic> is still
incomplete.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Phylogenetic position of </bold><bold><italic>Hydra</italic></bold><bold>. A</bold>) The

full-length RNA sequences, we combined two widely used high-throughput sequencing
pipelines, developed by Illumina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and 454 Life Sciences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] respectively. The Illumina technology produces shorter reads (currently
up to 150 bp) at a lower cost per base than the longer reads (~350 bp) produced by
the Roche 454 Titanium technology. Beside these differences, the two technologies
differ by the type of errors they generate, mostly base substitutions in Illumina,
and micro-insertions or deletions in 454 homopolymer stretches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], although the overall error rate is much lower in assemblies generated
using Illumina reads, partly due to higher coverages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Consequently assemblies of 454 RNAseq reads frequently contain
frameshift errors, which lead to truncated proteins after conceptual translation.
Despite sustained progress in the field, no single standard assembly procedure
mixing reads of different technologies has yet met general agreement. Here, we
reasoned that whenever Illumina and 454 sequences corresponding to a transcript were
available, Illumina-derived contigs (containing much fewer homopolymer errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]) were to be selected in priority for building consensus stretches. To
reflect this choice, we adapted a method that was previously used to assemble
Illumina contigs to 454 reads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Thanks to this strategy, we produced a <italic>Hydra</italic> transcriptome that
contains 48&#x02019;909 unique transcripts, including 10&#x02019;597 novel sequences.
Then, we performed a systematic comparative analysis of the RNAseq and
genome-predicted transcriptomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Production of an extensive transcriptome from Illumina and 454 reads</title><p>We produced a <italic>Hydra</italic> RNAseq transcriptome by combining 454 and Illumina

magnipapillata</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and they both belong to the <italic>vulgaris</italic> group
(Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C). In fact, those two strains are
hardly differentiable at the molecular level and are distinguished based on
their geographical origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The comparison of the <italic>Hydra vulgaris</italic> &#x0201c;Basel&#x0201d;

performed an initial assembly of the Illumina reads into contigs using
Velvet/Oases (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). Then in the course of the
subsequent assemblies, we performed the following manipulations (see Methods for
details): 1) Illumina contigs were duplicated (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1); 2) artificial base qualities were generated.
Finally, contigs longer than 2000 nt were chopped into 1999 nt with 1899 nt
overlapping segments to accommodate a requirement of the Newbler assembler. The
resulting sequences were used as input for Mira (Mira-<italic>dn</italic>) and Newbler
(<italic>Newbler-dn</italic>) assemblies along with 454 reads (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Assembly procedures of the </bold><bold><italic>de</italic></bold><bold>-</bold><bold><italic>novo

step. For steps 2a and 2b, artificial Phred quality values were produced
for the dataset called &#x0201c;Contigs&#x0201d; and the sequences were
duplicated in order to further correct frameshifts due to 454 sequencing
(see Methods section for details).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-14-204-3"/></fig><p>The outputs of Mira-<italic>dn</italic> and Newbler-<italic>dn</italic> were then joined using a
second round of Mira assembly with similar parameters (the assembly is called
meta-<italic>dn</italic>). Occasionally, meta-<italic>dn</italic> contained longer coding
sequences than the two original datasets and those sequences were retained (see
Methods for details). The <italic>de</italic>-<italic>novo</italic> assembly was complemented by
a genome-assisted (ga) assembly (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). With the
ga procedure, and in contrast to the <italic>de</italic>-<italic>novo</italic> procedure, very
short overlaps (up to 1 nt) between RNAseq reads that can be mapped
unambiguously to the genome are sufficient to expect contiguity and assemble
reads into contigs. Thus, in the case of transcripts with low coverage, the ga
assembly procedure frequently leads to more contiguous sequences when the
transcribed regions are available from the genome.</p><p>The ga assembly consisted in the independent mapping of the 454 and the Illumina
reads to the genome. The cufflinks software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] was then used to reunite the results of both mappings in a single
summary file, and the sequences of the modeled transcripts were extracted (see
Methods for details). Similarly to the <italic>de-novo</italic> assembly process, a
second round of assembly was performed using Mira with this dataset (meta-ga
assembly) and the longest open reading frames (ORFs) were retrieved for each
genome-assisted sequence (<italic>Hydra-ga</italic>). Finally, a dataset reuniting the
sequences with the longest ORFs that were found among the <italic>de-novo</italic> or
genome-assisted assemblies was retrieved (named
<italic>Hydra</italic>-bestof-<italic>Hydra</italic>-bo-). This <italic>Hydra</italic>-bo dataset
contains 48&#x02019;909 sequences, 45&#x02019;269 of which are longer than 200 nt
and have been deposited at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under the
accessions HAAC01000001-HAAC01045269.</p></sec><sec><title>Production of an hybrid RNAseq/genome-predicted transcriptome (Hydra-meta)
and saturation analysis</title><p>To evaluate the complexity present in the Illumina reads against a comprehensive
<italic>Hydra</italic> transcriptome that might be used as a reference for further
studies, the <italic>Hydra</italic>-bo transcriptome was pooled with genome-predicted
datasets (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A, see Methods for details),
resulting in a non-redundant set of contigs that contains a mixture between
RNAseq and genome-predicted sequences (<italic>Hydra</italic>-meta). Subsets of randomly
chosen Illumina reads were mapped onto the <italic>Hydra</italic>-meta dataset and the
number of reads mapped to each sequence was counted (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). Of the 57&#x02019;611 sequences present in the
<italic>Hydra</italic>-meta dataset, 7&#x02019;070 were never mapped with an Illumina
read, pointing to insufficient Illumina sequencing depth, or genes not expressed
in the condition tested. Another possibility is that some of the predicted
sequences are a consequence of overprediction and are in facts never expressed
although this cannot be determined from our data. The number of sequences mapped
by 1 or more reads (50&#x02019;541 sequences) exhibited saturation, as a random
subset containing 20% of all Illumina reads was sufficient to target 89.5% of
them. However, even if a large fraction of transcripts appeared to be detected
in this study, the fact that only 21&#x02019;746 contigs are mapped with 100 or
more reads indicates that the sequencing depth of the Illumina dataset alone
(53.6M reads) might be insufficient to assemble full length contigs for weakly
expressed transcripts.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Evaluation of the completeness of the </bold><bold><italic>Hydra</italic></bold>-<bold>bo

was deduced from the number of sequences in each dataset associated with a
measure of the redundancies they contain. Indeed, the presence of multiple
similar sequences in a dataset, due for example to allelic or splice variants,
would lead to an overestimation of the number of genes if not corrected for
internal redundancy. To assess the presence of multiple near-identical sequences
within transcriptomes, we aligned the coding nucleotide sequences from each
dataset against its whole dataset using megablast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The number of hits retrieved by each query sequence was counted and
a single value representing the average number of matches per query was
calculated. The measure, called the redundancy index (RI), is an indication of
the redundancy of the considered transcriptome (see in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A the numbers at the top of each lane. See Methods).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Comparative analysis of the </bold><bold><italic>Hydra vulgaris

significantly lower than those obtained for the genome-predicted transcriptomes

closely related sequences on the same set on average, we estimate the number of
<italic>Hydra</italic> genes to be ~24&#x02019;450 (48&#x02019;909/2.0). Following the

genes, and the pred-RP dataset had the highest estimate with 31&#x02019;243 genes.
For the <italic>Hydra</italic>-bo transcriptome, we counted a total of 28&#x02019;520
different expressed loci. Both numbers, 24&#x02019;455 based on transcript
redundancy or 28&#x02019;520 based on genetic loci exceed the number previously
predicted to be ~20&#x02019;000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However this initial number did not include pseudogenes or
transposons. Therefore the 24&#x02019;500 to 28&#x02019;500 estimation is compatible
with the fact that the RNAseq transcriptome assembled here incorporates a large
share of all sequences expressed in <italic>Hydra</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparative analysis between the Hydra-bo, AEP-454, and genome-predicted

characteristics, and next evaluated their respective functional content. The
lengths of the coding sequences of the <italic>Hydra</italic>-bo, pred-CA and pred-RP
transcriptomes exhibit similar size distribution (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A) except for a few sequences from the genome-predicted sets that

a large proportion of small ORFs (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>C). The lengths of the coding sequences of each dataset
were then compared to the length of the corresponding coding sequences found in
the pred-CA transcriptome (thus using each of the pred-CA sequences as a
standard, see Methods for details). This analysis shows a progressive increase
in the length of the successive intermediary datasets, with the first assembly
(PASA) containing the shortest coding sequences and the final assembly
(<italic>Hydra</italic>-bo) containing the longest (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). Over 60% of <italic>Hydra</italic>-bo sequences display either equal or
longer coding length when compared to pred-CA sequences (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B, grey shadow bar). Finally, the <italic>Hydra</italic>-bo
transcriptome contained more sequence representatives of pred-CA sequences than
any other dataset (88.2%, Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B, top

predicted transcriptomes, Blasts and functional annotations using Pfam and
Panther were performed (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D). Overall,
<italic>Hydra</italic>-bo matched more sequences (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D, left panel) and encoded more functional families than the three
other transcriptomes tested here (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D, right
panel). These gene families are listed in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>. We conclude that <italic>Hydra</italic>-bo not only contains longer

of transcripts when compared to <italic>AEP</italic>-<italic>454</italic> and genome-predicted

to a pooled version of the predicted datasets. Queries without hits (95%
similarity threshold on nucleotides, without using low complexity masking) were
retrieved and counted (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Among
<italic>Hydra</italic>-bo sequences, we found 38&#x02019;168 (78%) sequences that were
common between the predicted and the RNAseq datasets but also 10&#x02019;597
<italic>Hydra</italic>-bo sequences that were missing in the genome-predicted

9&#x02019;107 sequences unique to the genome-predicted sets (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B). All these sequences exhibit a low GC content

corresponding to <italic>Hydra</italic> genes, we aligned them to genomic sequences
allowing for a greater level of mismatches than in the previous analysis (i.e.
without using the 95% identity threshold) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S2B). 9&#x02019;884 sequences (93%) aligned to the genomic

were then aligned to proteins deduced from the full genome-predicted
transcriptomes using BlastX+ (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>:

genome-predicted proteins (E-value &#x0003c;10<sup>-10</sup>). The protein-alignments
conservation ranged from 20% to 100% with an average of 65.3%, indicating that
some RNAseq only transcripts probably correspond to paralogs of predicted
sequences, whereas a large number of them share only low sequence identity and
thus likely encode proteins not represented in the predicted datasets.</p><p>Finally, we compared the length of the ORFs of the RNAseq only and predicted only
datasets (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S2D). We noted a
significant difference as the RNAseq only set contains shorter coding sequences
with only 3&#x02019;494 (33.0%) encoding proteins longer than 100 amino acids
versus 8&#x02019;115 (89.4%) in the genome-predicted only set. In summary, both
datasets of transcripts seem to correspond to functional genes that encode
<italic>Hydra</italic> proteins although with striking differences in terms of ORF
length.</p></sec><sec><title>Novel <italic>Hydra</italic>-human orthologs identified among the RNAseq only
sequences</title><p>To characterize the proteins encoded by the RNAseq only and predicted-only
sequences, we performed Reciprocal best hits (RBHs), a procedure that provides a
powerful and reliable method to identify orthologs among large and multiple
sequence populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. As a first step, we deduced the proteomes of the <italic>Hydra</italic>-bo,
<italic>Hydra</italic>-meta, <italic>AEP</italic>-<italic>454</italic> and genome-predicted
transcriptomes, producing four distinct whole <italic>Hydra</italic> proteomes. Next, we
tested these four <italic>Hydra</italic> proteomes against the proteomes of 20 species
representative of non-metazoan (fungi, filifera, choanoflagellates), basal
metazoan (porifers), basal eumetazoan (cnidarians) as well as bilaterian
(lophotrochozoans, ecdysozoans, deuterostomes) phyla (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S3). We detected a similar numbers of pairwise
orthologs in the <italic>Hydra</italic>-bo, the <italic>Hydra</italic>-meta and the
genome-predicted proteomes, although slightly higher in the <italic>Hydra</italic>-meta
dataset. By contrast the number of orthologs retrieved from the
<italic>AEP</italic>-<italic>454</italic> proteome was consistently lower in all species as
anticipated from previous analyses.</p><p>Similarly we retrieved the RBH orthologs present in the RNAseq only and
predicted-only datasets from RBH computed on whole proteomes (as described in
the previous paragraph). In both datasets, this analysis identified low numbers
of orthologous proteins, 809 (8.9%) among the predicted-only sequences and 529
(5.0%) in the RNAseq only dataset (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>C). This
result suggests that a large fraction of these two gene datasets encode
<italic>Hydra</italic>-specific proteins, and might thus be considered as
taxon-restricted genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Nevertheless, we identified 170 novel orthologs to human proteins
among novel <italic>Hydra</italic> sequences (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The
annotations of the human proteins point to a variety of molecular and cellular
functions, encompassing cellular signaling (27) including RBH-orthologs to two
distinct FGF proteins, but also membrane proteins (20), cell metabolism (15)
including RBH-orthologs to LTOR1, LTOR4, to cytochrome c oxidase assembly
proteins 5 and 6 (-COA5, COA6-), post-translational modifications (14), vesicle
and protein transport (16) including a RBH-ortholog to synaptotagmin, cell cycle
regulation (13), protein biosynthesis (14), DNA-binding activity and
transcription (11) including RBH-orthologs to ATF3, RPA43, THAP1, cytoskeletal
organization (10), lipid metabolism (8), chromatin regulation (7 see below),
cell death (5), DNA repair and telomeres (6), meiosis and gametogenesis (5),
immunity and inflammation (4) including RBH-orthologs to NLRP3, NLRP12, NLRP14

their nucleotide sequence (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). Hence
the RNAseq only dataset contains a large number of expressed genes thus far
never identified. Some of them are conserved between evolutionarily-distant

of long contigs that encode short ORFs. Indeed we found 81 transcripts that
extend from 1000 bp up to 3&#x02019;531 bp but encode ORFs shorter than 100
residues (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>B). We tested the expression of
the 25 longest of these contigs by RT-PCR and 24 out of the 25 were
successfully amplified (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>D, and Additional
file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S5 and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). These transcripts might correspond to long
non-coding transcripts (ncRNA) although typical secondary structures found
in ncRNAs could not be detected (data not shown). However, when these
sequences were tested using BlastX+, we found that 18 of them hit on several
locations a unique long protein sequence most often from <italic>Hydra</italic>, but
also from <italic>Nematostella</italic> or even from bilaterian species (Additional
file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). This result suggested that these long
contigs with short ORFs actually correspond to proteins fragmented by
numerous mutations leading to stop codons. As these contigs align perfectly
on the genome, we could exclude errors during the assembly process. We then
searched systematically for this type of RNAseq only transcripts, i.e. that
would satisfy both criteria, a perfect match on genomic sequences and no
good match with genome-predicted transcripts (&#x0003c;95% sequence identity),
indicating that they were arising from other loci. On the 4'894 RNAseq-only
with short ORFs that do not span their full length, 3'958 sequences
perfectly align to the genome (100% identity and no gaps). 767 of those
align to predicted sequences with less than 95% sequence identity. This
number of 767 pseudogenes is likely an underestimate given the stringency of
the criteria used here.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Genome-predicted genes can be active or silent</title><p>To test the expression of genome-predicted sequences, we selected 25
genome-predicted transcripts that fulfilled the following criteria: not
represented in any transcript dataset (<italic>Hydra</italic>-bo,
<italic>AEP</italic>-<italic>454</italic>, ESTs), but matching a jellyfish ortholog that
would be expressed among the <italic>Clytia</italic> EST dataset (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). The RT-PCR experiment was performed in
conditions that ruled out any genomic contamination, i.e. RNA treated with DNAse
or not, PCR amplification performed on RNA and on cDNA (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>C). Among the 25 genome-predicted only sequences tested
that way, we could convincingly amplify 17 of them (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>C), indicating that a large proportion of these genome-predicted
only sequences are indeed expressed in homeostatic and/or regenerating
conditions in <italic>Hydra</italic> polyps. But this result also points to the 8/25
sequences that could not be amplified, and thus are expressed at a very low
level or not expressed at all in adult, budding or regenerating <italic>Hydra</italic>
polyps. This result would need confirmation at a larger scale but if confirmed
would allow screening strategies where genes active in jellyfish and silent in
<italic>Hydra</italic> could be identified. Such approaches could for example be
useful to help characterizing genes involved in the aplanulata transition, i.e.
when hydrozoan embryos lost the planula stage and became direct developpers,
when hydrozoa polyps lost the potential for budding medusae and thus
dramatically modified their life cycle.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>A powerful strategy to generate extensive and accurate transcriptomes</title><p>This study describes novel strategies to combine two widely used high-throughput
sequencing technologies, Illumina and 454 RNAseq, in order to compensate for
their specific errors and to produce accurate transcriptomes. Here we applied
these strategies to RNAseq transcripts of the freshwater cnidarian
<italic>Hydra</italic> resulting from the assembly of 53.6 millions Illumina short
reads to 1.2 million 454 Titanium longer reads. As each assembly has its own
specificities, in particular with respect to homopolymer errors, the sequences
from several datasets were pooled, and the sequences with the longest ORFs among
nearly identical transcripts were selected. This selection ensured that
duplicated sequences, either partial or containing frameshifts were discarded
from the dataset when a longer sequence was present. This study shows that the
combination of different RNAseq methodologies provides an efficient and
cost-effective strategy for further characterizing gene diversity in species
where a finished genome is not available. In particular, homopolymer errors were
effectively suppressed by our strategy. In turn, in giving priority to Illumina
over 454 sequences, it is possible that some substitution-type Illumina
sequencing errors are introduced although Illumina contigs generally exhibit
lower substitution errors than 454 ones as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>The RNA-seq transcriptome we established for the freshwater cnidarian
<italic>Hydra</italic> fulfills several criteria for high fidelity when compared to
other published transcriptomes, as evidenced by the different criteria used to
compare them; namely the total number of transcripts including the presence of a
large batch of novel transcripts, the length of these transcripts and their
redundancy. These characteristics will be helpful to study the regulation of
alternative splicing in developmental and stress contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Finally, we took advantage of the genomic-derived sequences to
extend and complete the RNAseq transcriptome. We now estimate that the
<italic>Hydra</italic> transcriptome contains approximately 24&#x02019;450 unique
genes.</p></sec><sec><title>As novelties, genes encoding evolutionarily-conserved proteins and short ORFs
in Hydra</title><p>As a result of the comparative analysis we conducted between the genome-predicted
transcriptomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], the <italic>AEP</italic>-<italic>454</italic> RNAseq transcriptome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and the <italic>Hydra</italic>-bo RNAseq transcriptome reported here, we
identified 10&#x02019;597 novel sequences in the <italic>Hydra vulgaris</italic> RNAseq
transcriptome, most of them actually unpredicted but present in genomic contigs,
and 35.5% found expressed either in the <italic>AEP</italic>-<italic>454</italic> transcriptome
and/or in ESTs. The RBH analysis of these RNAseq only sequences identified 529
evolutionarily conserved proteins with at least one ortholog among the other
tested species. 170 of these sequences show orthology with human proteins
annotated for molecular and cellular functions that can now be tested in
<italic>Hydra</italic>. Some protein-coding genes missing in the current version of
the <italic>Hydra</italic> genome can be explained by its fragmented status, which
prevents the systematic prediction of the transcriptional units. However, and
quite surprisingly, a majority of these novel sequences encode short ORFs
(7&#x02019;103 contain ORFs &#x0003c;100 residues), which could not be predicted. A
fraction of these sequences possibly correspond to peptide coding units as
peptides are abundant in <italic>Hydra</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], whereas some longer transcripts seem to be expressed as pseudogenes.
This result is of interest as pseudogenes are known to be submitted to gene
regulation and to regulate themselves the level of expression of coding genes
through a variety of mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The RNAseq transcriptome produced in this study together with the genome-predicted

genetic equipment of the last common ancestor of cnidarians. Moreover, the classical
<italic>Hydra</italic> model system is nowadays used in a variety of research topics
such as regeneration, developmental processes, aging, stem cell biology, innate
immunity and ecotoxicology. The deep comparison between genome-predicted and RNAseq
transcriptomes offers new tools for phylogenetic reconstruction and should help
decipher the gene regulatory networks involved in these processes. This

sequenced by GATC Biotech (Konstanz). Briefly, first-strand cDNA synthesis was
primed with a N6 randomized primer (biomers.net), standard 454 adapters were
ligated to the 5' and 3' ends of the cDNA and the cDNA was finally amplified
with 10 PCR cycles using the Herculase II (Agilent Technologies) proof reading
enzyme. Normalization was carried out by performing one cycle of denaturation
and re-annealing of the cDNA, removal of the double-stranded cDNA by passing the

cDNA with 9 PCR cycles. cDNAs in the size range of 600&#x02013;800 bp were eluted
from a preparative agarose gel and sequenced in one full plate (454 GS FLX

ERS163511-ERS163513) from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA).</p><p>The base calling that was performed on the Illumina sequencing images using Ibis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] yielded 64&#x02019;433&#x02019;175 reads of 76 bp. These reads were then
processed prior to assemblies as we removed i) the first 5 bp of each read,
corresponding to barcodes, ii) the reads that exactly matched the 12 first bp of
the Illumina 3&#x02019; adapters (not found in any 454 read, thus probably not
represented in the <italic>Hydra</italic> transcriptome) and the 3' end of these reads.
Then we also removed non-exact matches of adapters by using the -5 and -adapter
options of the Novoalign software (http://www.novocraft.com). Finally only reads
&#x02265;30bp were kept. After manual inspection, homo-polymers longer than 5
consecutive nucleotides located at 3&#x02019; ends were removed. Moreover, reads
containing more than 90% of bases with phred quality scores of 5 or less were
discarded using the fastq_quality_filter tool
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/">http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/</ext-link>). A total of
53&#x02019;599&#x02019;364 (83%) Illumina reads survived these preliminary cleaning
steps.</p><p>The Illumina reads were then assembled using the Velvet assembler v1.0.18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] followed by the Oases transcriptome wrapper v0.1.18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In total 17 independent assemblies with k-mers from 33 to 65 (with a
stepsize of 2) were performed in parallel and pooled together, yielding
455&#x02019;142 Illumina contigs (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). The edges
of these contigs were thoroughly cleaned for remaining adapter and trans-spliced
leaders sequences by using SeqClean (http://sourceforge.net/projects/seqclean/)
followed by removing all edges having an exact TAAG match within their first 15
bp or the reverse complement CTTA within the last 15 bp as these motifs are very
common hallmarks of trans-spliced leaders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title><italic>De</italic>-<italic>novo</italic> (<bold><italic>dn</italic></bold>) hybrid assemblies of Illumina contigs and 454 reads</title><p>Two independent assemblies were performed one using Mira 3.2.1.15 dev [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] (assembly called Mira-<italic>dn</italic>), and another using Newbler v2.6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] (Newbler-<italic>dn</italic> assembly), both requesting 50 bp as the minimum
overlap parameter and 95% as the minimum identity (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). Prior to the hybrid assemblies, Illumina contigs generated by
Velvet/Oases were thoroughly cleaned (see above) and were manipulated as
follows: 1) Illumina contigs were duplicated, and one bp was removed to the
front of each duplicated sequence so as not to produce exact duplicates. The
FASTA headers of the duplicates were slightly modified; 2) given the read size
limit of the Newbler assembly software (1999 nt as a maximum sequence length for
input), longer Illumina contigs were chopped to reach a maximum size of 1999 nt
with 1899 nt overlaps (in a manner similar to described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] 3) as the Velvet/Oases assembler does not produce quality files, an
artificial quality file was then generated for the contigs, attributing strong
phred quality scores of 40 to internal bases and weaker scores of 10 to 25 bp
edges as edges are more susceptible to contain errors. These combined steps
caused the number of Illumina contigs to increase from 455&#x02019;142 to
1&#x02019;067&#x02019;061 and this set was used as input for both Mira and Newbler
<italic>de</italic>-<italic>novo</italic> assemblies.</p><p>For Mira-<italic>dn</italic>, cleaned 454 reads were input along with Illumina contigs
and quality file; for Newbler-<italic>dn</italic> chromatogram files were input directly
and a fasta file along with the prepared Illumina contigs and qualities files.
In addition, a file containing all adapters and known trans-splice leaders was
input as trimming file (-vt option). The outputs of these two assemblies were
then joined using a second round of Mira assembly with similar parameters
(meta-<italic>dn</italic>). Occasionally, meta-<italic>dn</italic> contained longer
sequences than the two original dataset. To avoid unnecessary redundancy, the
longest deduced ORFs of a given RNA were selected from the different sets.</p></sec><sec><title>Genome-assisted (ga) assemblies</title><p>The ga assembly consisted first on the mapping of extracted and cleaned 454 reads
to the most complete version of the <italic>Hydra</italic> genome, i.e. the RP genome
assembly (JGI) using the PASA genome annotation tool version r09.01.201 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] with a minimum fraction of the read aligned to a single location of
50% and more than 93% identity (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). Overall,
88% of the reads were mapped and validated by PASA against this genome. Illumina
reads were then mapped to the genome using TopHat 1.0.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] with default options. The genomic hits retrieved by the TopHat mapper
(collected in the BAM file) were input to cufflinks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] together with the gene transfer format file (.gtf) produced by PASA
(as a gtf guide, -g option) and resulted in a single gtf file incorporating
information from both the PASA (454 reads) and the TopHat (Illumina reads)
processes. The RSEM package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] was finally used to extract sequences based on the genome coordinates
output by cufflinks. Similarly to the <italic>de-novo</italic> assembly process, a
second round of assembly was performed using Mira (see above) with this dataset
(meta-ga assembly) and the longest open reading frames (ORFs) were retrieved for
each sequence.</p></sec><sec><title>Redundancy removal</title><p>To keep only the longest unique ORFs, the meta-<italic>dn</italic> and meta-gn sequences
were 6-frame translated and the longest ORF of each sequence was selected.
Sequences shorter than 50 amino acids were not further considered and the 25
C-terminus of each sequence was trimmed, as the nonsense polypeptide translated
after a frame-shift is on average 15 residues long [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The proteins sequences were then clustered together using a global
identity threshold of 95% and a gap penalty of 20 using usearch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] to retrieve the longest sequence of each cluster. Remaining sequences
were aligned on themselves using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (Blast) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] without using the low complexity filter. The following procedure was
used to characterize and discard the sequences (matches) similar but shorter
than the query i) alignments smaller than 25 aa and self-reported matches were
ignored, ii) the query needed to be bigger than the match, iii) the pairwise
identity of the best alignment block per match needed to be &#x0003e;95%, iv) there
were no gaps in the alignment (to retain splice variants), v) the alignment
should span at least 95% of the match, vi) no more than 100 aa from the match
were unmatched by the query. Untruncated versions of remaining sequences were
retrieved (i.e. containing the 25aa that were removed at the beginning of the
procedure).</p></sec><sec><title>Removal of known contaminants in the RNAseq only and predicted-only

&#x0201c;RNAseq only&#x0201d; and the 11&#x02019;582 genome-predicted only sequences,
we tested these sequences sequentially in successive BlastN+ analyses, first
against the sequences of common <italic>Hydra</italic> contaminants (<italic>Artemia</italic>,
<italic>Curvibacter</italic>), then against <italic>Hydra</italic> genomes. The sequences
found in one database were not realigned to the next database. Using this
method, we removed from the 10&#x02019;741 RNAseq only sequences, 144 contigs not
attributed to <italic>Hydra</italic>, composed of 114 contigs of very low complexity
(i.e. stretches of repetitive elements), 21 transcripts corresponding to known
<italic>Artemia franciscana</italic> sequences (<italic>Hydra</italic> diet in the lab), and
nine others matching the genome of the &#x003b2;-proteobacteria
<italic>Curvibacter</italic>, a known <italic>Hydra</italic> symbiont. Concerning the
11&#x02019;582 genome-predicted only sequences, we removed 312 sequences
considered as contaminants, 247 from <italic>Curvibacter</italic>, and 65 as
low-complexity sequences. The resulting 10&#x02019;597 RNAseq only and
11&#x02019;270 predicted-only sequences were used for further analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence annotation</title><p>The <italic>Hydra</italic>-bo, <italic>AEP</italic>-<italic>454</italic>, pred-CA, and pred-RP

(releases 2013_01). Annotations of domains and protein families were performed
on deduced protein sequences with Pfam 26.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and Panther 8.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].

and genome-predicted sequences (<italic>Hydra</italic>-meta dataset)</title><p>Transcripts arising from the same locus (and overlapping) were merged together to
form one single transcript. The two distinct <italic>Hydra magnipapillata</italic>
genome assemblies currently available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], i.e. the Celera Assembler assembly (CA, GenBank accession number
ABRM00000000) and the Ringer-Phrap assembly (RP, GenBank accession number
ACZU00000000) are associated with two predicted sets of transcripts referred to
as &#x0201c;pred-CA&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;pred-RP&#x0201d; here: the gene model set
associated with the CA genome contains 17&#x02019;741 transcripts and the
RP-derived set 32&#x02019;338 transcripts. We produced a non-redundant set by
pooling the RNA sequences of the <italic>Hydra</italic>-bo (48&#x02019;909 sequences),
pred-CA (17&#x02019;741), and pred-RP (32&#x02019;338) datasets, aligned them to the
<italic>Hydra</italic> genomes by PASA. Sequences were first aligned to the RP
genome, then, the sequences not suitably aligned were realigned onto the CA
genome. Sequences not properly aligning to either genome were also retrieved as
they might represent true transcripts originating from currently unavailable
portions of the genome. All sequences represented an intermediate dataset of
70&#x02019;368 transcripts. Overall, 59&#x02019;316 sequences were validated on one
or the other genome (arising from 48&#x02019;217 different loci), 10&#x02019;208
were found in the genome but failed alignment validation due to the PASA options
used (see above), and 844 sequences did not align to the genome at all. The
longest ORF of each transcript was extracted, and a final round of global
clustering was performed on the protein sequences using usearch with a minimum
similarity threshold of 95% and strong gap penalties to retain most splice
variants (i.e. using the options -id 0.95 -iddef 2 -gapopen 20). The final set
contains 57&#x02019;611 protein sequences (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A).
The characteristics of the datasets are detailed in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S1. The <italic>Hydra</italic>-bo assembly is deposited
at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under the project number PRJEB445 and

an E-value &#x02264;10<sup>-30</sup>, were retrieved. De facto, a limit of maximum
250 alignments per query is specified by the default options. Importantly, using
coding sequences rather than full length sequences strongly reduced biases
caused by vector contaminants, repetitive sequences or post-translational
modification such as the addition of trans-splice leaders. In turn, the soft
filtering allows masking low complexity stretches during the search phase, while
using them in the scoring phase. Without the later, too many hits would fall
below the 98% identity threshold due to masked (low complexity) stretches
counted as mismatches.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of the sizes of the coding lengths to the sizes of the coding
sequences in the pred-CA transcriptome</title><p>Using megablast, the pred-CA coding transcripts were aligned to the each of the
other coding transcriptomes using a threshold of 98% sequence identity without
low complexity filter. The first hit was considered as representing the same
coding sequence than the query if the length of the alignment exceeded 100 nt.
The length of the tested contigs and corresponding pred-CA contigs were compared
using custom Perl scripts. Similarly, each pred-CA sequence was considered has
having no representative in the tested dataset for alignment spanning less than
100nt or having less than 98% identity (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B,

random numbers lying between 1 and 53&#x02019;599&#x02019;364 using R (sampling
without replacement). Corresponding reads were then fetched from the original
dataset using a custom Perl script. Subsets of reads were realigned to the

criteria: 1) best score between a given query and the different hits, 2) best
score between a given hit and the different queries. RBH analyses were performed
on a reference dataset containing representative proteomes selected for their
