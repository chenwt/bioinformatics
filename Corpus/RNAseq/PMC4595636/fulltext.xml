Mucus is a highly regenerative protective lubricant glycoprotein sheet secreted by host intestinal goblet cells; the inner mucus layer is nearly sterile. Here we show that the outer mucus of the large intestine forms a unique microbial niche with distinct communities, including bacteria without specialized mucolytic capability. Bacterial species present in the mucus show differential proliferation and resource utilization compared with the same species in the intestinal lumen, with high recovery of bioavailable iron and consumption of epithelial-derived carbon sources according to their genome-encoded metabolic repertoire. Functional competition for existence in this intimate layer is likely to be a major determinant of microbiota composition and microbial molecular exchange with the host.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="i1" xlink:href="ncomms9292-i1.jpg"/>The inner layer of the mucus that covers our intestine is nearly sterile.

In the small intestine the mucus is discontinuous, but in the stomach and large intestine (colon) there are two layers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Tight stacking of polymeric glycoproteins adjacent to the epithelium forms a compact inner layer that is largely sterile<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Following proteolytic dispersion of mucin polymers, the outer layer is looser and contains intestinal bacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Goblet cell secretion of mucin is orchestrated by inflammasome activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, and mucus thickens as the microbiota becomes more diverse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p><p>Mucus therefore forms an important intestinal compartment, and the glycoprotein is itself a microbial carbon source. Only some bacterial species have a sufficient repertoire of genome-encoded catabolic glycosidic enzymes to disassemble complex mucus glycans as a sufficient carbon source, so relatively few microbes can be considered as mucolytic specialists. For these mucolytic bacteria, mucus is a potentially distinct microbiological niche on the basis of the available carbon source. Mucus oxygen levels at atmospheric pressures are also low enough to allow the presence of anaerobes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. For example, <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</italic> has been shown to forage on mucus glycans in the caecum when plant polysaccharides are absent from the diet<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. The ability of <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> in the caecum to use mucus as an alternative carbon source is consistent with the concept that the outer layer of mucus is a separate microbiological niche for such mucolytic bacteria. However, this interpretation is indirect, because mucus is being constantly shed into the intestinal lumen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, so overall metabolic alterations under conditions of nutrient restriction do not necessarily show the extent of differences in resource utilization between the outer mucus layer and the intestinal contents under normal physiological and dietary conditions.</p><p>Aside from the utilization of mucus glycans as a niche carbon source, mucus is also known to retain non-mucolytic bacterial species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. For example, commensal <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> was found to replicate preferentially in the mucus during regrowth after antibiotic treatment on the basis of ribosomal content assessments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p><p>If the outer mucus layer is a generally separate microbiological niche for mucolytic non-specialists and specialists alike, three outstanding questions need to be addressed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. (i) Is the outer mucus layer a physical habitat sufficiently separate for microbes to assemble into distinct communities? (ii) Is there differential resource utilization of constituents other than mucin glycoprotein or oxygen? (iii) Do microbes in the mucus adopt special strategies for population persistence, such as general transcriptional and metabolic differences, compared with the same species in an adjacent compartment (in this case, the intestinal lumen)?</p><p>There is certainly evidence of minor differences between the composition of microbial communities in the outer layer of mucus of the large intestine and the luminal intestinal contents. This is on a background of considerable variability between the microbiota of mouse colonies, even between different rooms of the same vivarium, that changes the structure and functional properties of the mucus layer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. The dynamics of rapid mucus shedding into the lumen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> also mean that luminal bacteria will inevitably be contaminated with any bacterial species that have replicated in the mucus layer, so composition assessments <italic>per se</italic> do not reveal whether there are metabolic patterns that potentially define the general differences within individual species in resource utilization or strategies for population persistence within the mucus compared with the intestinal contents.</p><p>The very intimacy between microbial populations in the outer mucus layer and host intestinal tissues makes the existence of an outer mucus niche of intestinal microbes extremely important, as microbial metabolites are known to determine the differentiation and function of epithelial and immune cells in the intestinal mucosa<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Put the other way around, the host intestinal epithelial layer is being constantly shed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, giving scope for the host to succor different microbial species in their race to replicate and avoid extinction from the microbiota.</p><p>In this paper, we analyse the spatial distribution, functional metabolic and proliferative adaptation and fitness of different intestinal bacteria in the outer layer of colonic mucus in simple defined microbiotas. To understand the scope of niche differences in these parameters, we analyse the contrasting situations of monocolonization with two genetically well-defined intestinal microbes: <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> (a mucolytic symbiont, which is an abundant member of the healthy intestinal microbiota<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) and <italic>E. coli</italic> (a minor constituent that blooms under conditions of infectious and non-infectious inflammation with limited glycoside hydrolase activity for mucus metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). In these defined model gnotobiotic mice, we show that the outer mucus niche concept applies to resource utilization ranging beyond mucus metabolism, to mineral harvesting and utilization of shed host phospholipids. These differences in resource utilization reflect the specific bacterial genomic repertoires and establish distinct strategies for population persistence in the mucus compared with the luminal intestinal contents under normal fed physiological conditions.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Microbial consortia in the outer mucus layer</title><p>To determine how far the compositions of microbial populations differ according to transverse compartmentalization (within the mucus or the luminal contents) in the intestine, we started by comparing the compositions of the microbiota in aspirates of the outer mucus layer with those in the intestinal lumen of C57BL/6 wild-type mice colonized with a diverse specific pathogen-free (SPF) microbiota consisting of operational taxonomic units that cover more than 100 different genera (colonic luminal Shannon alpha diversity 8.22&#x000b1;0.88, <inline-formula id="d33e527"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e528" xlink:href="ncomms9292-m1.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <italic>n</italic>=28, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) We concentrated the analysis on the large intestine, because this is where the mucus layer is thickest and the microbial concentration is highest (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). We also confirmed by immunofluorescent staining and by using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing bacteria with two-photon microscopy at different <italic>Z</italic>-planes in these simplified animal models that bacteria were resident in the outer mucus layer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). In the caecum and colon of SPF animals, high-throughput 16S amplicon sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>) and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) on weighted Unifrac distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>) showed that the outer mucus layer had different representations of microbes compared with the intestinal lumen, and no significant differences were seen longitudinally along the gut (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Previous studies have also found differences in the composition of mucus and luminal intestinal microbial compositions of diverse microbiotas, for example, with <italic>Ruminococcus</italic> species, although considerable variability has been observed between colonies, even when housed in different rooms of the same vivarium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p><p>To confirm these data in a system where we have information at the species level, we generated a gnotobiotic mouse model with a stable defined moderately diverse mouse microbiota (sDMDMm<sub>2</sub>) that consists of 12 bacterial species (colonic luminal Shannon diversity 1.98&#x000b1;0.38, <inline-formula id="d33e572"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e573" xlink:href="ncomms9292-m2.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <italic>n</italic>=11, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Using these stable isobiotic mice, 16S amplicon and PCoA also showed that the compositions in the large intestinal outer mucus and the intestinal lumen were significantly different, although all constituents of the isobiotic microbiota were consistently present at some level in both compartments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). A limitation in applying microbiota composition analysis alone to substantiate the recess concept of a separate microbiological niche in the outer mucus layer compared with the luminal contents is that functional differences may be underestimated. Rapid turnover of mucus (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>) causes shedding of its microbial constituents, which are then detected in the intestinal lumen, even though they may not form a stable regenerative community in the luminal contents.</p><p>A generally distinct niche in the outer mucus would imply that bacterial mobility is restricted, even where the strain is motile. To assess this, we studied C57BL/6 mice that had been monocolonized with a motile strain of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6b&#x02013;d</xref>). Two-photon imaging confirmed that the bacteria were immobile up to the 5&#x02009;min recording time in the outer mucus, whereas tumbling was observed in PBS media and swimming in luminal intestinal fluid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 1&#x02013;3</xref>). This does not exclude a slower exchange between luminal and mucus compartments over the period of hours required for mucus regeneration and we cannot exclude the possibility that lack of visualized microbial motility in the mucus compartment could be due to technical imaging factors such as coverslip compression or the preparation of the tissue for imaging. Nevertheless, the morphology of the bacteria argued for replication rather than replacement as the mechanism of sustaining the mucus <italic>E. coli</italic> population in this monocolonized system. The mucus contained elongated bacilli and some forms at the end stage of binary fission (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6e and f</xref>). This provided the first of three lines of evidence that, at least for <italic>E. coli</italic>, regeneration of the population in the mucus layer during mucus turnover occurs selectively through mucus bacterial cell division rather than repopulation from the luminal contents.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Distinct transcriptional profiles of mucus layer microbes</title><p>Distinct bacterial niches in the outer mucus layer and the intestinal luminal contents also would imply that these are separate metabolic compartments with differential resource utilization, including, but not limited to, host mucus glycan constituents or increased oxygen availability in the mucus as an electron acceptor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. To address potential niche compartmentalization of bacterial metabolism, we initially studied C57BL/6 wild-type mice monocolonized either with <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> or <italic>E. coli</italic>. Both monocolonizations are rapidly progressing, achieving a high steady-state biomass of the monocolonizing bacterium within 18&#x02009;h following a calculated inoculation dose of as little as 1&#x02013;10 bacteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> is also known to be capable of both mucus and dietary glycan breakdown<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, whereas <italic>E. coli</italic> has a restricted glycoside hydrolase repertoire (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>), making them suitable contrasting models to study differential resource utilization under conditions where the mucus architecture measurements were not significantly different from mice permanently colonized for over 30 generations with an altered Schaedler flora (ASF; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). These are simplified models, and the mucus structure does thicken in mice with very diverse colonization as shown for SPF animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 1 and 2b</xref>). These monocolonizations did allow us to compare bacterial densities, transcriptional activities and metabolism in separate compartments for each individual microbial species independently of cross-feeding events, competition or inter-microbial exchange of vitamins, minerals or electron donors/acceptors, which can occur in mice that are colonized by multiple organisms.</p><p>We first carried out transcriptomic analyses of parallel luminal or outer mucus isolates. In both <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>) and <italic>E. coli</italic> monocolonized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>), we observed distinct transcriptional patterns in unsupervized analyses of replicate samples from the mucus, that differed from the transcriptional patterns of the same bacteria in the luminal contents (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1 and 2 for further details</xref>). To determine the specifics of the niche transcriptional patterns, we applied a network analysis using STRING<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. We improved the transcript annotation for <italic>B. thetaoiotaomicron</italic> available in STRING by using the SEED tools. The annotations also include the latest studies regarding the glycan utilization pathways in <italic>B. thetatiotaomicron</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. For both of the model bacteria studied under monocolonization conditions, there were distinct metabolic pathway clusters depending on whether the transcriptome had been derived from the outer layer of mucus or the intestinal contents. For example, <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> had increased N-linked glycosidase transcription in the mucus compared with the intestinal contents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), compatible with digestion of glycan side chains of mucus in this compartment and from shed dead host cells. However, luminal <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> expressed a distinct repertoire of glycoside hydrolases consistent with metabolism of dietary starch, mannans, arabinogalactans, xylose and galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 3</xref>). We concluded that this transcriptional evidence was consistent with <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> selectively utilizing particular members of its rich repertoire of glycoside hydrolases to degrade host complex carbohydrates in the outer layer of mucus or complex dietary carbohydrates resistant to host digestion in the luminal intestinal contents. We also found relatively increased expression of capsular polysaccharide synthesis loci in <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> residing in the intestinal lumen. This may be a result of increased biofilm formation on particulate luminal material, such as undigested plant wall fragments as previously suggested from chemostat transcriptional profile studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Iron harvesting dictates <italic>E. coli</italic> transcriptional regulation</title><p>Given that the abundant glycoside hydrolase repertoire of <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> allows it to exploit a wide range of host-secreted or dietary-derived complex carbohydrates, depending on its exact niche in the intestine, we next asked how <italic>E. coli</italic> as a facultative anaerobe with its limited glycoside hydrolase repertoire (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>) would adapt to life in these niches. We carried out comparative STRING analyses on the transcriptomes from the mucus or the large intestinal contents of <italic>E. coli</italic> monocolonized C57BL/6 mice that had been fed an identical diet used in <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> experiments. The predominant difference between <italic>E. coli</italic> residing in the mucus and in the intestinal contents was a notably increased expression of the ferric iron uptake pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 3</xref>). In support of these transcriptional data for critical iron harvesting in the mucus, we found lower total iron levels in colonic mucus (26.99&#x000b1;22.16&#x02009;ng&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, <inline-formula id="d33e736"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e737" xlink:href="ncomms9292-m3.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <italic>n</italic>=3 mice) compared with the luminal contents (120.64&#x000b1;35.07&#x02009;ng&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).</p><p>Fe<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> uptake genes are negatively regulated through the Fe-bound Fur master regulator<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, with counter-regulation of iron-storage genes mediated through Fe-Fur repression of RyhB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Expression ratios of members of the Fur/RyhB regulon showed that the system dominated the <italic>E. coli in vivo</italic> transcriptional repertoire in the colonic mucus in both <italic>E. coli</italic> monocolonized mice and when <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> was present in bicolonized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4</xref>). In contrast, there was a very modest effect of oxygen-driven differences between the two compartments of the known oxygen-sensitive genes in <italic>E. coli</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, most were equally expressed in the mucus relative to the intestinal contents, with only NADH dehydrogenase II complex and pyruvate dehydrogenase upregulated in the mucus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4</xref>). These <italic>E. coli</italic> transcriptomic signatures were also found in mice colonized with both <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4</xref>). Succinate dehydrogenase and succinyl CoA synthase, which are induced by oxygen and repressed by Fur/RyhB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, showed decreased mucus/contents expression ratios in line with the predominant requirement for iron harvesting by mucus bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b,c</xref>).</p><p>To confirm the transcriptomic data, we carried out metabolomic analyses of <italic>ex vivo</italic> cultures of <italic>E. coli</italic> on mucus harvested from germ-free mice. These showed markedly increased production of enterobactin&#x02014;a very high-affinity iron-chelating molecule produced as a siderophore by <italic>E. coli</italic> to capture iron under limiting conditions of bioavailability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 5</xref>). In contrast, <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic>, which assimilates iron in the form of haem, showed no overall difference in expression levels of genes encoding haem uptake pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4</xref>). Mammals use a variety of mechanisms to sequester ionic iron and limit its bioavailability in central body tissues: this generally limits the infectivity of microbes that need to assimilate iron in its ionic form<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Our data show that restriction of ionic iron also applies to the outer mucus layer of the colon and is consistent with the large number of iron metabolism genes found in intestinal bacteria compared with other host-associated niches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Non-preferred carbon source regulation in colonic contents</title><p>Transcriptional activity of luminal <italic>E. coli</italic> in monocolonized mice also showed evidence of a shift to non-preferred carbon sources including glycerol and fatty acid metabolism (FAD operon)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, with additional upregulation of transcript pathways annotated as the carbon starvation response and glyoxylate shunt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Regulatory RNAs associated with the transition to stationary phase were also upregulated.

Bicolonization did cause an increase the range of polysaccharide utilization loci of <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> with additional access to mucin O-glycans in the colonic mucus presumably as a result of increased glycan exposure (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Genes for maltose utilization in <italic>E. coli</italic> were relatively increased in the intestinal contents of bicolonized mice, presumably as a consequence of cross-feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). There were also transcriptional signals of increased oxidative stress in the mucus niche for both microbes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 14a</xref> and b and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4</xref>).

Diversely colonized mice and medium diversity gnotobiotic mice have different representations of microbes in the outer mucus layer compared with the luminal intestinal contents, even though luminal contents are inevitably contaminated by biomass shed from the mucus. Although most bacterial species inhabit both compartments, there is a special niche in the mucus with differential resource utilization and particular strategies for population compared with the same species in the intestinal lumen. Our illustration of stratification of 'fundamental' niches is a starting point to investigate the real-life complexity of 'realized' niches in which competition and synergies between different members of the microbial communities shapes their overall structure and function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. These realized niches will also be influenced by the increased thickness of colonic mucus in the presence of complex microbiotas and pathobionts, and by variability in the host diet.</p><p>There are a number of reasons to consider that microbes in the outer mucus layer may have a special functional role in the host&#x02013;microbial relationship. First, although inner mucus separates the microbes themselves from the epithelial layer, molecular exchange occurs bidirectionally between the outer mucus layer and the host, and there is also molecular uptake into the host through goblet cells during the secretory process<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Many microbial molecules can enter the host<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, including short-chain fatty acids that feed host epithelial cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> and regulate immunity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Molecular uptake from microbes is presumably most potent when they are adjacent to host tissues. Second, the mucus barrier protects against mucosal infections<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>; this effect is complemented in the intestine by the endogenous microbiota that fills this microbial niche in which enteric pathogens and opportunistic pathobionts must face intense competition to initiate infections. Third, some bacterial mutants that are unable to metabolize mucus constituents are poor colonizers compared with their parent strain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>, so adaptation to life in this layer may determine survival or extinction in the host. Finally, the mucus layer is a very challenging habitat as it is undergoing rapid renewal with a timescale of several hours. This means that microbes must be fit enough to be renewed or replenished at the same rate while competing with each other for resources to persist within this especially intimate and stressful niche of the host&#x02013;microbial intestinal biomass.</p><p>Much of the current literature, which seeks to relate intestinal microbiotas to host phenotypes or diet, is dominated by composition assessments of the microbes and their genomic composition in the luminal contents or in the excreta of human and animal hosts. Although such assessments can provide a first approximation of the microbiota biomass and metabolic potential, they do not capture actual metabolic variations along the length of the intestine or&#x02014;as we now show&#x02014;the different transverse niches. The colonic mucus niche harbours microbes that adapt their metabolism to the availability of shed host compounds, according to their genome-encoded repertoire. These functional differences, presented from studies in gnotobiotic mice, provide an insight into the likely complexity of metabolic interactions, both within consortia, and between consortia and their host. The functional interactions within microbial members of natural complex microbiota and their host are likely to vary not only according to community composition and diet, but also with position transversely and longitudinally in the intestinal tract.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mice and hygiene status</title><p>C57BL/6 mice were re-derived to germ-free status<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>.

For <italic>E. coli</italic> in monocolonized mice, the mucus high-expressed and luminal contents' high-expressed gene sets contained, respectively, 52 and 121 genes.

For <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> in bicolonized mice, the gene counts were 50 in mucus and 118 in luminal content. The proteins corresponding to the obtained gene sets were searched against the STRING database version 9.1(ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>) for protein&#x02013;protein interactions. Although a recent paper describes the version 10 of the STRING database<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>, this update was not available online during analysis, therefore all the work in this study was performed using version 9.1 with appropriate customization (J.P.L) to ensure currency of the database. The STRING software compiles available experimental evidence for the reconstruction of functional protein-association networks. The respective bacterial protein interactions data set was selected for each previously described gene set. For each interaction, STRING specifies a metric called &#x02018;confidence score'.
