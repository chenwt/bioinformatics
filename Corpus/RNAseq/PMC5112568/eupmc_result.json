    "Alternative splicing, polyadenylation, and chemical modifications of RNA generate astonishing complexity within eukaryotic transcriptomes. The last decade has brought numerous advances in sequencing technologies that allow biologists to investigate these phenomena with greater depth and accuracy while reducing time and cost. A commensurate development in biochemical techniques for the enrichment and analysis of different RNA variants has accompanied the advancement of global sequencing analysis platforms. Here, we present a detailed overview of the latest biochemical methods, along with bioinformatics pipelines that have aided in identifying different RNA variants. We also highlight the ongoing developments and challenges associated with RNA variant detection and quantification, including sample heterogeneity and isolation, as well as 'Omics' big data handling."
