Using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas we demonstrate that a subset of PDACs exhibits a strong pro-angiogenic signature that includes 37 genes, such as HDAC9, that are overexpressed in PDAC arising in KRC mice, which express mutated Kras and lack RB. Moreover, patient-derived orthotopic xenografts can exhibit tumor angiogenesis, whereas conditioned media (CM) from KRC-derived pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) enhance endothelial cell (EC) growth and migration, and activate canonical TGF-&#x003b2; signaling and STAT3. Inhibition of the type I TGF-&#x003b2; receptor with SB505124 does not alter endothelial activation <italic>in vitro</italic>, but decreases pro-angiogenic gene expression and suppresses angiogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Conversely, STAT3 silencing or JAK1&#x02013;2 inhibition with ruxolitinib blocks CM-enhanced EC proliferation. STAT3 disruption also suppresses endothelial HDAC9 and blocks CM-induced HDAC9 expression, whereas HDAC9 re-expression restores CM-enhanced endothelial proliferation. Moreover, ruxolitinib blocks mitogenic EC/PCC cross-talk, and suppresses endothelial p-STAT3 and HDAC9, and PDAC progression and angiogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>, while markedly prolonging survival of KRC mice. Thus, targeting JAK1&#x02013;2 with ruxolitinib blocks a final pathway that is common to multiple pro-angiogenic factors, suppresses EC-mediated PCC proliferation, and may be useful in PDACs with a strong pro-angiogenic signature.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Pancreatic cancer</kwd><kwd>Angiogenesis</kwd><kwd>TGF-&#x003b2;</kwd><kwd>STAT3</kwd><kwd>mouse model</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States, with dismal overall 5-year survival rates of 6% [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. PDAC most often presents at an advanced stage and with metastatic disease, which precludes resection, and is often associated with marked chemoresistance and intense desmoplasia that may interfere with tumor blood flow and hinder drug penetration into the pancreatic tumor mass [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Nonetheless, PDAC often exhibits foci of endothelial cell (EC) proliferation, and several [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], but not all [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] studies, have reported a positive correlation between blood vessel density, tumor vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) levels, and disease progression in PDAC. Moreover, pancreatic cancer cell lines secrete biologically active VEGF-A [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and its expression in the pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) may be associated with enhanced local tumor spread, increased incidence of liver metastasis, and decreased patient survival [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Studies using subcutaneous and orthotopic mouse models of PDAC have suggested that anti-angiogenic therapy is effective at suppressing pancreatic tumor growth. Thus, the anti-angiogenic agent TNP-470 reduced neoangiogenesis in tumors formed by MIA-PaCa-2, ASPC-1, and CAPAN-1 PCCs, resulting in decreased tumor growth and metastatic spread [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; targeting VEGF-A expression with a VEGF antisense construct markedly attenuated tumorigenicity in nude mice [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; VEGF-A fused to diphtheria toxin (DT-VEGF) internalizes in target cells via VEGFRs, inhibits protein synthesis, and directly suppresses the growth of HUVEC ECs, while decreasing tumor volume, tumor spread, and microvessel density in tumors formed by HPAF-2 and ASPC-1 PCCs [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; adenoviral vectors carrying sequences encoding soluble VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], or the VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor PTK 787 [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], inhibit the growth and metastasis of pancreatic tumors in severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mice and athymic mice.</p><p>Studies with the KPC genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of PDAC, which expresses mutated <underline>K</underline>ras and <underline>p</underline>53 alleles in the pancreas due to Pdx1-driven <underline>C</underline>re recombination [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], have suggested that pancreatic tumor masses have a paucity of blood flow [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] that can be enhanced to facilitate drug delivery to the tumor mass using therapies that promote tumor angiogenesis [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], or by targeting the stroma [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, a separate GEMM-based study using KP<sup>fl/+</sup>C mice, which also express mutated Kras but have p53 haploinsufficiency, suggested that stroma depletion worsens disease, but that it is reversible by anti-angiogenesis therapy with a VEGFR2 blocking antibody [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Thus, whether angiogenesis should be targeted in PDAC is not entirely clear.</p><p>Although studies in certain murine models raise the possibility that VEGFR signaling may have an important role in PDAC, targeting VEGF-A either with bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF-A antibody, or with VEGF Trap, which sequesters VEGF, has failed in clinical trials in PDAC patients [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This therapeutic failure might be due to the fact that PDAC also overexpresses additional angiogenic factors, such as TGF-&#x003b2;, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), and pro-angiogenic cytokines [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Nonetheless, a recent Phase II clinical trial indicated that vatalanib, an inhibitor of VEGF and PDGF receptors, slightly improved survival in metastatic PDAC [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, the role of angiogenesis in PDAC is more complex than previously appreciated and targeting multiple-angiogenic pathways may be more effective than targeting a single pathway.</p><p>We recently established a GEMM of PDAC [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] in which mice that express RB with LoxP sites in the introns flanking exon 19 were bred with KC mice (<underline>K</underline>ras-<underline>C</underline>re recombinase). KC mice carry an oncogenic <italic>Kras</italic> (<italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></italic>) allele within its own locus downstream of its endogenous promoter and silenced by a LoxP-Stop-LoxP element (LSL) upstream of the transcriptional start site [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The KRC compound mutant mice express oncogenic <underline>K</underline>ras in the pancreas which is devoid of <underline>R</underline>B due to Pdx1-driven <underline>C</underline>re recombination (22). KRC mice develop pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) -1 and -2 lesions at 2 weeks after birth and exhibit rapid PanIN progression to murine PDAC (mPDAC) (22) with increased expression of several cytokines, such as transforming growth factor betas (TGF-&#x003b2;s) and TNF-&#x003b1;, which are also overexpressed in human PDAC and are pro-angiogenic [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Moreover, PDAC in humans is often associated with loss of RB function [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], underscoring the potential relevance of the KRC GEMM to the human disease.</p><p>In the present study, using TCGA data, we determine that ~12% of PDACs exhibits a pro-angiogenic gene signature. We also establish a novel patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model directly from samples obtained by fine needle aspiration (FNA) during endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and demonstrate that ECs are present in the original tumor and that these human ECs survive when implanted into immunodeficient mice. Moreover, we show that KRC mPDACs express a pro-angiogenic gene signature that overlaps with many of the genes in the above TCGA subset, and that inhibiting JAK1&#x02013;2 signaling markedly prolongs survival in this model and suppresses cancer progression <italic>in vivo</italic>, while preventing ECs from stimulating PCC growth in culture. Therefore, targeting JAK1&#x02013;2 signaling may be especially useful in the subset of PDAC patients that exhibit a pro-angiogenic gene signature.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>A subset of PDAC patients express a strong angiogenesis gene profile and patient-derived orthotopic xenografts exhibit tumor angiogenesis</title><p>To assess the angiogenic potential of human PDACs we analyzed an RNASeq dataset from 85 PDACs in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), focusing on genes annotated to angiogenesis Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Hierarchical clustering revealed that out of 384 genes annotated to angiogenesis, approximately 128 were up-regulated in some tumors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). We therefore extracted this gene set, and performed a second cluster analysis to determine whether any patients exhibited similar angiogenesis gene expression profiles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Based on this analysis, 10/85 (~12%) PDAC patients were identified that harbored tumors in which multiple angiogenesis genes were up-regulated, suggesting that they exhibit a strong angiogenesis gene signature (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). By contrast, 59/85 PDACs (~69%) exhibited variable expression levels of these genes, suggesting that they have a moderate angiogenesis signature, whereas 16/85 PDACs (~19%) displayed a weak signature in which few genes were elevated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Differential expression analysis of tumors exhibiting a strong signature with those exhibiting a weak signature revealed that 77 angiogenesis genes were significantly up-regulated, 63 of which were pro-angiogenic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>A Subset of Human PDACs exhibit a strong angiogenic gene signature</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Hierarchical clustering of TCGA data show that genes annotated to angiogenesis (white lines) are up-regulated in some human PDACs (left).

Seven tissue samples were obtained by EUS-FNA, and all seven patients had suspected PDAC at biopsy, which was confirmed by cytology (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Of these, 5 formed large intrapancreatic tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>) that were palpable within 2 months, and the mean time to sacrifice was 5.7 &#x000b1; 1.6 months. These mice were termed EUS-PDOX mice to indicate that they are <underline>p</underline>atient-<underline>d</underline>erived <underline>o</underline>rthotopic <underline>x</underline>enografts generated with EUS-FNAs. Two EUS-PDOX tumors were established from EUS-FNAs of resectable tumors, and their tumor histopathology was consistent with that of the resected tumor, including the formation of mucinous ascites from a mucin-producing adenocarcinoma (EUS-PDOX1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>). By contrast, the other three EUS-PDOX tumors were established from EUS-FNAs of advanced stage tumors that were unresectable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate these tumors for angiogenesis we used the CD31 endothelial marker. CD31-positive cells were present in the stroma of all EUS-PDOX tumors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) and in adjacent normal pancreas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). To determine if endothelial cells (ECs) within the tumor mass were host- (murine) or biopsy- (human) derived, we used a human-specific CD34 antibody that did not mark ECs in normal murine pancreata (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), or in orthotopic tumors generated by intrapancreatic injection of human PCCs into athymic mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>). Consistent with the localization of CD31-positive cells, CD34 immunoreactivity was present in the stromal compartment of all EUS-PDOX tumors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Moreover, human-specific VE-Cadherin and CD105 (endoglin) antibodies marked ECs in EUS-PDOX tumors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), but were non-reactive with murine ECs in normal pancreata (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) or in human PCC-generated orthotopic tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, the tumor endothelium in first (F0) EUS-PDOX tumors that formed was, in part, patient-derived. EUS-PDOX tumors were either moderately differentiated with abundant stroma, or poorly differentiated with a paucity of stroma (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B&#x02013;1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>), and these histological features were maintained after their first <italic>in vivo</italic> passage (F1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref>). Although F1 tumors continued to harbor ECs, these ECs no longer expressed any human markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref>), indicating that as these tumors developed and grew they were able to readily recruit host-derived ECs.</p><p>Quantitation of endothelial and stromal markers in EUS-PDOX tumors revealed that tumors with abundant stroma, rich in collagens as determined by Masson's trichrome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) and Picosirius red (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1E</xref>), harbored more ECs than stroma-deficient tumors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B&#x02013;1C</xref>). It has been recently proposed that stroma-depleted mPDACs are poorly differentiated, but associated with either increased [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] or decreased [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] angiogenesis. To clarify this issue and determine whether angiogenesis is dictated by the differentiation status and extent of desmoplasia in PDAC, we used a human PDAC tissue microarray (TMA) in which 26 tumors were poorly differentiated and 28 were well-to-moderately differentiated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Irrespective of tumor differentiation, 45/54 tumors were rich in stroma (stroma+++), whereas 9 were relatively stroma-deficient (stroma+), allowing us to determine if angiogenesis correlated with stroma abundance. CD31 or CD34 immunoreactivity was present in all PDACs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), and was strong in 15/54 tumors, but moderate in 20/54 and weak in 19/54 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>), suggesting that some PDACs exhibit robust angiogenesis. However, when comparing poorly differentiated with well-to-moderately differentiated tumors, or stroma-rich vs stroma-poor tumors, there were no differences in either CD31 or CD34 immunoreactivity between these groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Therefore, in humans, PDAC angiogenesis is not necessarily associated with poorly-differentiated or stroma-deficient tumors.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Subsets of Human PDACs and KRC murine PDACs exhibit angiogenesis</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> H&#x00026;E staining shows that tumors in a human PDAC tissue microarray exhibit poor or well-to-moderate differentiation, and that some have abundant stroma (stroma+++), whereas others are relatively stroma-deficient (stroma+). <bold>(B)</bold> ECs are present in poor and well-moderately differentiated PDACs as evidenced by the presence of CD31 (top) and CD34 (lower) immunoreactivity.

Therefore, we next sought to determine whether KRC mPDACs exhibit angiogenesis. As in EUS-PDOX tumors, CD31 immunoreactivity in KRC mPDAC was present in sinusoidal-like blood vessels within the collagen-rich stroma adjacent to CK19-positive cancer cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), and in relatively larger blood vessels within the stromal compartment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>).

Moreover, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated that these genes were often the same as those up-regulated in human PDACs with a strong angiogenesis gene signature (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>). Thus, compared with the 77 gene TCGA signature, 42 genes were differentially expressed in KRC tumors, 37 of which were pro-angiogenic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).

After 3 weeks of therapy, we evaluated their pancreata for extent and severity of disease.

It is crucial, therefore, to develop a personalized therapeutic approach for PDAC. However, this is a daunting task given the complexity of the molecular alterations and mutations in PDAC. Moreover, only ~20% of patients undergo resection, and tissue biopsies obtained from the remaining PDAC patients (~80%) are generally too small for molecular analysis such as deep sequencing or RNASeq, in part due to the clinical imperative to analyze the samples in a manner that assures adequate patient care. Importantly, these samples consist of a mixed population of cells with extensive stroma, resulting in a paucity of cancer cells within the biopsy sample. By contrast, fragments from surgically resected samples can be implanted subcutaneously in immune-deficient mice to yield patient-derived xenografts (PDX), allowing the cancer cells to grow in vivo in sufficient quantities for investigators to conduct extensive cancer genome analyses [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Here we show that directly implanting EUS-FNA-derived samples into the pancreas of immune-deficient mice yields viable human orthotopic tumors termed PDOX.</p><p>Tumor angiogenesis is generally not believed to play a role in PDAC pathobiology. However, our transcriptome analysis of TCGA data served to identify a subset of PDACs exhibiting a strong angiogenic gene signature, and we used the PDOX model to confirm that angiogenesis occurs in PDAC. Thus, we determined that in their earliest <italic>in vivo</italic> passage (F0), PDOX tumors harbor many human ECs, pointing to their presence in the original tumors and underscoring their ability to survive for many months in the tumor microenvironment in this model. The intra-pancreatic location of the PDOX tumors avoids the issues that may occur with subcutaneous PDX models where blood flow derives from the subcutaneous compartment which is not relevant to PDAC. Importantly, PDOX tumors can be established from all PDAC patients, including the 80% of patients who are ineligible for surgical resection, and they can be established using relatively small tissue biopsies to generate tumors that recapitulate histological features of the original patient tumor, including moderate or poorly differentiated tumors with varying degrees of desmoplasia. Thus, our PDOX model could be useful for testing drug responses and designing strategies for personalized medicine.</p><p>mPDACs arising in KIC mice which express oncogenic Kras and are devoid of the Ink4a locus encoding p16 exhibit angiogenesis histologically and express pro-angiogenic factors [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In the present study we determined that KRC mice, which harbor oncogenic Kras and are devoid of RB [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], also exhibited tumor angiogenesis and a pro-angiogenic gene signature that partly overlapped with genes expressed at high levels in the angiogenic subset of TCGA PDACs, as further confirmed by GSEA.

Moreover, STAT3 silencing attenuated HDAC9 expression, and prevented CM from up-regulating HDAC9 in ECs. HDAC9 is a member of the class II family of histone deacetylases that includes HDACs 6 and 7, and all three HDACs exert pro-angiogenic effects in ECs [<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Whereas HDAC6 and 7 were not part of the pro-angiogenic signatures in human PDACs or KRC mPDACs, HDAC9 was part of both signatures, was abundant within ECs in human PDAC, and in PDOX and KRC tumors, and enabled PCC-derived factors to stimulate proliferation of ECs that lack STAT3. Thus, HDAC9 promotes angiogenesis downstream of STAT3 and could serve as a marker of angiogenesis and endothelial STAT3 activation in PDAC.</p><p>Our findings thus point to a model in which TGF-&#x003b2;s promote the expression of pro-angiogenic factors in PCCs that, in turn, activate ECs through STAT3-dependent pathways (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Two distinct observations support this conclusion. First, the pro-angiogenic signature in KRC mPDACs correlated with an active TGF-&#x003b2; gene signature, as determined by GSEA. Second, TGF-&#x003b2; increased the levels of STAT3-activating pro-angiogenic cytokines in KRC-derived CM, including VEGF-A and GM-CSF. Oncogenic Kras has been previously shown to upregulate VEGF-A [<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] and GM-CSF expression [<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Importantly, in addition to enhancing angiogenesis, GM-CSF can promote mPDAC progression by recruiting myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) which antagonize cancer-directed immune mechanisms [<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Thus, suppressing TGF-&#x003b2; pathways in PDAC can lead to attenuated angiogenesis and enhanced cancer directed immune activity by attenuating GM-CSF expression and by suppressing the direct actions of TGF-&#x003b2; on immune cells.</p><p>EC-derived factors are known to promote the proliferation of epithelial-type cells through paracrine interactions during hepatic cell regeneration [<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], and in lymphoma [<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], ovarian cancer [<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], and breast cancer [<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Using a 3D co-culture system we demonstrated for the first time that activated ECs promote PCC proliferation, and that this action is mediated by STAT3-dependent pathways. STAT3 is a known oncogene and survival factor that promotes cancer cell proliferation, tumor angiogenesis, and inflammation [<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Moreover, when oncogenic Kras is combined with loss of p53, both EGFR and STAT3 must be suppressed to block mPDAC development [<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], underscoring the importance of STAT3 in the earliest stages of PDAC progression. STAT3 is activated by JAK1&#x02013;2, and the JAK1&#x02013;2 inhibitor ruxolitinib has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera, and is currently being tested in pancreatic and breast cancer clinical trials. In addition to modulating PCC-autonomous actions, and cancer-associated inflammatory signaling, our findings suggest that STAT3 acts in ECs to promote tumor angiogenesis, and facilitate angiocrine actions. Thus, it was important to assess the consequences of ruxolitinib administration in the KRC GEMM. Impressively, when administered at an age when mPDAC has already developed, ruxolitinib suppressed tumor angiogenesis and disease progression in KRC mice, dramatically prolonging their survival. By contrast, ruxolitinib did not have any beneficial effects in KPC mice, which are hypovascular and did not exhibit a pro-angiogenic gene signature.</p><p>The current findings suggest that targeting JAK1&#x02013;2 with ruxolitinib could attenuate the proliferation of PCCs and associated ECs while dampening the actions PDAC-associated inflammatory cells and inflammatory cytokines, especially in those patients whose cancers express a strong pro-angiogenic signature. Taken together with recent encouraging Phase II data in metastatic PDAC using vatalanib, which targets pro-angiogenic VEGFRs and PDGFRs [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and ruxolitinib [<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], our TCGA analysis and the KRC GEMM data raise the possibility that PDAC patients should be selected for anti-angiogenesis therapy based on their pro-angiogenic gene signature. Our findings also suggest that ruxolitinib may be especially effective because it targets the JAK-STAT3 pathway that is downstream of multiple pro-angiogenic factors, and suggest that selection of patients for this type of therapeutic targeting may also exert beneficial actions by interrupting growth-promoting angiocrine pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Cell lines and conditioned media</title><p>KRC cells were cultured as described [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].
