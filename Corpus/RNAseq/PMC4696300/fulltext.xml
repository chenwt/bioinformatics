As expected, SNP analysis shows that these isolates are more closely related to each other than to the commonly used strains Lister 427, Antat1.1, and TREU927. TREU927 generally has smaller copy numbers of repeated genes than the other strains, while Lister 427 trypanosomes with a 30-year history of in vitro culture and cloning have more histone genes than the other isolates. The recently isolated trypanosomes were grown in rats, and their transcriptomes characterised. In comparison with cultured procyclic and bloodstream forms, there were increases in mRNAs encoding the stumpy-form markers ESAG9 and PIP39, with coordinated alterations in the levels of over 600 additional mRNAs. Numerous mRNAs encoding proteins of no known function were either increased or decreased. The products of the mRNAs that were increased in parallel with <italic>PIP39</italic> included not only enzymes of procyclic-form metabolism, but also components of the translational and RNA control machineries.

Disease in humans is caused by <italic>Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense</italic> and <italic>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</italic>, both of which are resistant to the trypanolytic factors. <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> differs from <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> only in that the former has an additional gene, called SRA, which mediates serum resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p><italic>T. brucei</italic> multiplies in mammals as long slender trypomastigotes. The long slender form has a very reduced mitochondrion, relying on glucose and substrate-level phosphorylation for ATP generation and variant surface glycoprotein for defence against humoral immunity. In contrast, the procyclic form, which is found in the Tsetse midgut, has a more elaborate mitochondrion and, on its surface, two repetitive proteins called GPEET and EP procyclin. Both bloodstream and procyclic forms are readily cultured in vitro. Another form is, however, present in the blood - the &#x0201c;stumpy&#x0201d; form. Stumpy forms are - as the name implies - relatively shorter and fatter than long slender forms, and have a slightly more elaborate mitochondrion with some cytochrome development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Stumpy forms are &#x0201c;pre-adapted&#x0201d; for procyclic differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. They are arrested at the G<sub>0</sub> stage of the cell cycle and can only resume dividing if placed into conditions conducive to development of procyclic forms.</p><p>When mice are infected with trypanosomes that can undergo stumpy differentiation (&#x0201c;pleomorphic&#x0201d; lines), there is an initial rise in parasites, which flattens out as stumpy differentiation occurs; trypanosomes then disappear from the blood as an immune response develops to the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). After a few days, new parasites with a different VSG appear in the blood. The result is a fluctuating parasitaemia, which can last for several weeks before the immune response of the animals is exhausted. To obtain pure stumpy-form populations, pleomorphic <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> are grown in immunosuppressed mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] to densities of about 2&#x02013;5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup>/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], but even without immunosuppression, most cells will be stumpy at peak parasitaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. One unexplained dichotomy is that in vitro, the same cell lines undergo growth arrest at the much lower density of 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Continuous passage of bloodstream-form <italic>T. brucei</italic> in either mice or culture strongly selects against the ability to complete stumpy differentiation. Many experiments are done using the resulting &#x0201c;monomorphic&#x0201d; lines, which have the advantage of growing fast and to densities up to 7 &#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup>/ml; this includes most cultures of the Lister 427 line. In general, mice infected with parasites that cannot make stumpy forms develop fulminating, non-resolving parasitaemias, unless the inoculum is very low.</p><p>Stumpy formation is triggered by a quorum-sensing mechanism: pleomorphic trypanosomes secrete, and also respond to, an as-yet-unidentified soluble factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The stumpy differentiation process can also be induced by addition of cell-permeable molecules which cause an increase in internal AMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. An RNA interference screen identified about 30 genes whose expression is required for the response to increased AMP; apart from genes involved in AMP metabolism, they include a variety of potential regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A protein tyrosine phosphatase called PTP1 inhibits differentiation of stumpy forms to procyclics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] by inactivating a second phosphatase called PIP39 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Two groups have investigated gene expression changes during differentiation of long slender trypomastigotes to stumpy forms, then procyclic forms using microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; Capewell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] extended the analysis of stumpy differentiation to polysomal RNA. All studies identified PIP39 among the mRNAs that had increased abundance in stumpy forms. Other stumpy markers are the surface receptor PAD1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and the secreted protein ESAG9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Use of ESAG9 as a stumpy marker is, however, complicated by the existence of numerous paralogues, which vary between trypanosome isolates. Using PAD1 as a marker, MacGregor et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] showed that in chronic mouse infections with pleomorphic trypanosomes, stumpy forms initially appear in the blood when parasitaemias exceed 10<sup>8</sup>/ml. After careful measurements through infection, and modeling, the authors concluded that the tendency of a parasite strain to make stumpy forms is a very important factor in determining the level of parasitaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>All transcriptome analyses published so far have been done using trypanosomes that have been in the laboratory for over 30&#x000a0;years. We recently isolated <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> from Ugandan sleeping sickness patients. We compared the transcriptomes of these parasites, grown in intact rats with only a single intermediate passage, with that of cultured monomorphic trypanosomes grown in culture. RNA preparations from two of the recent isolates had high levels of mRNAs encoding stumpy markers, and significant differences in expression of over 600 other genes, compared with the cultured cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trypanosome samples and infections</title><p>Patient recruitment was carried out at Lwala hospital in Kaberamaido district, which is situated in the relatively new <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> human African trypanosomiasis focus in North-Eastern Uganda.

All patients recruited into this study received written and verbal information explaining the purpose of the study and they gave informed consent. The ethical consent forms were written in English and translated into the local languages. For the children and adolescent participants (below 18&#x000a0;years), parents or guardians gave informed consent on their behalf. Peripheral blood (3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;ml) from confirmed Human African Trypanosomiasis patients was collected into an EDTA tube (BD Vacutainer) upon phlebotomy. An aliquot of the whole blood (600&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l) was cryopreserved, a drop (10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l) was spotted on Whatman paper for PCR diagnosis.

Once these parasitaemias had attained about 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> trypanosomes/ml, 2-week-old inbred Swiss white mice were infected with 500 parasites each. All infections were done at the same time. Parasites were counted by diluting 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of tail blood into 1&#x000a0;mL of phosphate-saline-glucose, then counting in a haemocytometer. Mice were killed if obvious terminal symptoms were observed.</p><p>For RNA preparation, rats were infected with 5000 parasites each. Parasites were followed using wet blood films, and parasitaemias were estimated by the matching method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

The buffy coat was transferred to a 1.5&#x000a0;ml microfuge tube, centrifuged at 6000&#x000a0;rpm for 2&#x000a0;min at room temperature in the microfuge and the pellet fraction resuspended in 1&#x000a0;ml of Trifast reagent (Peqlab, GmbH) for RNA preparation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sequence analysis</title><p>Trypanosomes were cultured exactly as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

Four isolates that readily infected mice on first passage were used to re-infect mice and the parasitaemias were followed. As expected, the new isolates caused fluctuating parasitaemias, which were fatal after 3&#x02013;5 weeks. All four lines showed similar maximal parasitaemias of 2&#x02013;3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>8</sup>/ml, suggesting that they have similar quorum sensing thresholds (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Although some differences between the parasitaemias were observed, we do not know whether these are intrinsic to the different isolates: for example, it is also possible that there were differing numbers of infectious parasites (not committed to stumpy formation) in the inoculates.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Parasitaemias from the four new isolates in mice.

Coverage was approximately 30-fold. The original reads for TREU927 were used for comparison. Copy number analysis for all genes is in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1. The TREU927 strain was initially chosen for sequencing because of its small genome, and low numbers of repeats were evident for several multi-copy genes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Three different clones of Lister 427 expressing the <italic>tet</italic> repressor were compared; these had a slight excess of histone genes, perhaps reflecting long years of selection for fast growth in culture (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). It would be interesting to investigate the copy-numbers in earlier, less-passaged stocks of Lister 427. A differentiation-competent AnTat1.1 isolate was intermediate in copy numbers for these particular genes. Including all genes, comparison of the new isolate data with the reference genome revealed about 24,000 indels and 150,000&#x02013;200,000 SNPs, slightly over 50&#x000a0;% of which were homozygous (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2). However, when large gene families such as those encoding Variant Surface Glycoproteins and Expression Site Associated Genes were removed, and the analysis was restricted to a single-copy open reading frames in the reference, the number of SNPs was reduced to 50,000. SNP analysis for the Lister427 and AnTat1 genomes revealed similar levels of deviation from the reference. We used the copy numbers to construct an evolutionary tree. Both this (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, inset) and phylogenetic analysis of the SNPs (not shown) showed, as expected, that the four Ugandan strains were more closely related to each other than to the other strains. The copy numbers of our repressor-expressing cultured bloodstream-form and procylic-form Lister 427 differed somewhat; this is not really surprising since these lines had been cultured separately for at least 25&#x000a0;years, and had also been transfected with plasmids and cloned.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Copy numbers of selected genes, deduced from shotgun sequencing</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2015_2338_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Some of the recently-isolated trypanosome transcriptomes show high levels of mRNAs encoding stumpy-form markers</title><p>We next obtained transcriptomes from the four isolates. Each was used to infect two rats, and the parasites were allowed to grow for 7&#x000a0;days, by which time the parasitaemias were estimated at between 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>8</sup>/ml and 6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>8</sup>/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We prepared RNA from buffy-coat parasites with minimal handling, since purification changes trypanosome transcriptomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Replicate RNA samples were analysed by high-throughput cDNA sequencing (RNASeq). Approximately 70&#x000a0;% of the reads aligned to the trypanosome genome (12&#x02013;30 million reads). Initial analysis showed that the transcriptomes of replicates correlated best with each other (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S3, sheet 1). We compared them with previously published results for cultured <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> Lister 427 bloodstream forms and procyclic forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and for lab-adapted <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> (strain Tbr729) grown in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Even when strict criteria were applied (Padj &#x0003c;0.001, &#x0003e;3-fold difference in expression) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S4), the numbers of &#x0201c;significantly regulated&#x0201d; genes in the new isolate transcriptomes were striking (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Notably, there was clear up-regulation of the <italic>PIP39</italic> mRNA, especially in the LW032 and LW042 samples, but also to some extent in the others (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S3, sheet 5). In addition, there were increases in reads that mapped to <italic>ESAG9</italic> genes, although the pattern was more heterogeneous (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), presumably due to inter-strain differences in <italic>ESAG9</italic> gene content, as well as use of different VSG expression sites (which contain <italic>ESAG9</italic> genes) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S3, sheet 5). PAD1 is a member of a multi-gene family. Read counts for the PAD family as a whole were increased in LW032 and LW042 transcriptomes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S3, sheet 5) but we cannot tell which paralogue they came from. These expression profiles suggested that the trypanosome samples from blood contained mixtures of trypanosomes at various stages of stumpy-form differentiation, with least stumpy-form expression in the Tbr729 sample, more in LW031 and LW024, and most in LW032 and LW042. The mRNAs that were most strongly regulated in LW032 and LW042 may therefore be stumpy-specific. This designation is however very tentative: although the parasitaemias in all rats were comparable with those seen at the first peak in mice, they were not counted accurately and we did not assess trypanosome morphology before RNA preparation.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Comparison of transcriptomes of pleomorphic bloodstream forms with laboratory-adapted trypanosomes. <bold>a</bold> Number of genes showing differences in expression, relative to cultured bloodstream-form Lister 427 parasites at 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> /mL.

Most of these mRNAs showed somewhat higher expression in LW031, a little more in LW024, and a peak in either LW042 or LW032 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S2).

Over the whole dataset, however, there was no correlation - perhaps because the previous experiments had used less sensitive methods. Intriguingly, genes encoding proteins of unknown function dominated the list (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). In a published RNAi screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], 16 of these were identified as being required for procyclic differentiation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S4, sheet 2). There were also many up-regulated genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, including ribosomal proteins and cytochromes.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Functional annotation of genes showing differential expression in the LW042 and LW032 transcriptomes.

These were enriched in mitochondrial proteins, and also included other enzymes implicated in procyclic metabolism. LW032 and LW042 showed increases in mRNAs encoding two uncharacterised protein phosphatases (Tb927.9.3470 and Tb92710.4930) and the RNA-binding protein RBP34. <italic>ZC3H11</italic> mRNA was also elevated. ZC3H11 is involved in the heat shock response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], so its mRNA could have been increased either as part of differentiation, but it is also possible that the rats had fever (this was not measured). Some changes might have been correlated with cell cycle arrest: we saw up-regulation of the mRNAs encoding subunit 10 of the anaphase promoting complex, cyclin 7, and kinetochore protein 16.</p><p>Rather surprisingly, 20 cytosolic ribosomal protein mRNAs also specifically increased in the LW042 and LW032 transcriptomes. Stumpy forms have very little translation compared with long slender forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] so should actually have lower ribosomal protein requirements. Perhaps these mRNAs, too, are not being well translated. Indeed, a previous analysis of stumpy-form polysomes, done using a sequence-tagging approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], indicated that ribosomal protein mRNAs are mostly rather poorly represented in the polysomal fraction.</p><p>Salivary gland trypanosomes contain a high proportion of metacyclics, which, like stumpy forms, are non-dividing. A comparison of their transcriptomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] with those of bloodstream and procyclic forms revealed 126 increased mRNAs that were also elevated in the LW032 and LW042 transcriptomes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S4, sheet 6). These included the two cell-cycle RNAs mentioned above, and mRNAs encoding the RNA-binding protein RBP5, a protein kinase and two chaperones.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>High stumpy-form marker expression is accompanied by reduced expression of genes required for cell proliferation</title><p>Stumpy forms are expected to show decreases in mRNAs required for cell proliferation. Of the 253 mRNAs that were significantly decreased in the LW032 and LW042 transcriptomes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S4, sheet 4), 41 (16&#x000a0;%) showed cell-cycle variation with an amplitude of at least 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. An amplitude of 1 means that highest expression measured was at least twice the lowest value.

There were also several protein kinases (including TOR1 and TOR3), and protein phosphatases in the list, four kinetochore proteins, two nuclear DNA repair enzymes, 8 proteins involved in kDNA replication, the histone variant H2AZ, a few ubiquitination pathway proteins, various components of the vesicular transport machinery, and some factors required for RNA processing. The mRNAs for translation elongation factor EF2 and the translation initiation helicase eIF4A1, and some tRNA synthetases, also had reduced abundance relative to cultured bloodstream and procyclic forms. Rather intriguingly, two homologues of the cap-binding initiation complex, eIF4E2 and eIF4G2, also showed decreases: there is no evidence that these are involved in translation and their function is unknown. There was slight enrichment for proteins involved in RNA metabolism; mRNAs encoding proteins with RNA-binding domains included the cell cycle binding sequence protein CSBP2, DRBD14, DRBD17, DRBD18, RBP10, RBP26, ZC3H12, ZC3H41 and ZC3H46 and Tb927.11.3500. For all of these genes, there was a gradation in expression that was the inverse of that seen in the up-regulated set (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Figure S3). DRBD18 - which regulates many mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] - and RBP26 mRNAs are also decreased in salivary gland trypanosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. 47 mRNAs were at least 2.5-fold down-regulated in both LW032 and LW042 and metacyclics (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S4, sheet 7), with reductions of no fewer than 8 mRNAs encoding RNA-binding proteins.</p><p>The set of genes in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S4, sheet 4 was selected to have decreased expression relative to the <italic>T. rhodesiense</italic> strain Tbr729 bloodstream-forms as well as the cultured bloodstream forms, but these two datasets were not identical. This is not really surprising: the chemical environments are different, and the cultured bloodstream forms were carefully harvested during exponential growth (density less than 1.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup>/ml), whereas the <italic>T. rhodesiense</italic> strain Tbr729 bloodstream-forms were harvested from blood at much higher densities. Twenty-three mRNAs were over-represented in cultured bloodstream forms only (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S4, sheet 5). These included mRNAs encoding 5 RNA-binding proteins: for example HNRNPH, which has roles in both mRNA stability and splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and RBP10, whose expression correlates with that of mRNAs encoding enzymes of bloodstream-form energy metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>Nearly 100 genes showed at least 3-fold less mRNA in all of the blood trypanosomes relative to cultured bloodstream- or procyclic-form Lister 427 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S4, sheet 6). They included <italic>PUF9</italic>, the product of which stabilises S-phase mRNAs, and one of its target mRNAs, <italic>PNT1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The mRNA for the mitotic cyclin CYC6 was reduced in the trypanosomes from blood, in salivary gland trypanosomes and also, interestingly, in metacyclic <italic>L major</italic>, which are non-dividing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Many of the RNAs that were less abundant in blood trypanosomes than in cultured ones were most decreased in the LW032 and LW042 cell populations, which suggests that these may be mRNAs that show very early reductions upon density sensing. Twenty-two of them were also under-represented in salivary gland trypanosome RNA; these included <italic>PUF2</italic>, <italic>PUF4</italic>, <italic>ZC3H8</italic>, <italic>PIE8</italic> and several encoding proteins implicated in signal transduction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The transcriptomes described here reveal hundreds of mRNAs whose expression levels were significantly decreased or increased in cells that had an elevated amount of <italic>PIP39</italic> mRNA. The transcriptome profiles are consistent with the biology of stumpy forms, with decreases in mRNAs required for cell proliferation, and increases in mRNAs encoding proteins of procyclic-form metabolism. It is well known that trypanosomes that have recently been transmitted naturally undergo stumpy differentiation at parasitaemias above 10<sup>8</sup>/ml, and our parasites were all harvested at parasitaemias above that threshold. These datasets may therefore illustrate the progressive changes that are seen during the development of stumpy forms. It will be interesting to compare these results with those from laboratory strains that have been characterised in detail with respect to cell shape, cell cycle stage, and expression of suitable markers. If it turns out that the transcriptomes of the recent isolates show more regulation than those of lab strains, it would make sense to investigate the recent isolates in more detail.</p><p>An increase in mRNA does not necessarily mean that the protein is being made. Results of ribosome profiling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and polysome analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] demonstrate extensive regulation of translation. Since stumpy forms have low overall translation activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], it is possible that many of the mRNAs that had accumulated in the LW042 and LW032 cell populations were being stored in a translationally inactive form, ready for rapid activation upon uptake by a Tsetse fly. To confirm that regulation of any specific gene correlates with stumpy development, the ideal procedure will be to analyse expression of the encoded protein at the single-cell level, with counter-staining against a recognised marker such as PAD1.</p><p>Probably the most interesting differences that we saw were in potential regulators. The transcriptomes of the recently isolated trypanosomes showed changes in mRNAs encoding numerous RNA-binding proteins and in signal transduction proteins that have not hitherto been recognised as being involved in differentiation. The most interesting, however, may be the proteins whose functions have not yet been characterised at all.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Comparison of our new transcriptomes with previous results, especially from functional screens, may suggest novel candidate regulators of trypanosome differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Availability of supporting data</title><p>All results are available at Array Express.
