Many DNA variants influence phenotypes by altering the expression level of one or multiple genes. The effects of such variants can be detected as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Traditional eQTL mapping requires large-scale genotype and gene expression data for each individual in the study sample, which limits sample sizes to hundreds of individuals in both humans and model organisms and reduces statistical power <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Consequently, many eQTL are likely missed, especially those with smaller effects <sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Further, most studies use mRNA rather than protein abundance as the measure of gene expression. Studies that have used mass-spectrometry proteomics <sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> reported surprising differences between eQTL and protein QTL (pQTL) for the same genes <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, but these studies have been even more limited in scope. Here, we introduce a powerful method for identifying genetic loci that influence protein expression in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyes cerevisiae</italic>. We measure single-cell protein abundance through the use of green-fluorescent-protein tags in very large populations of genetically variable cells, and use pooled sequencing to compare allele frequencies across the genome in thousands of individuals with high vs. low protein abundance. We applied this method to 160 genes and detected many more loci per gene than previous studies. We also observed closer correspondence between loci that influence protein abundance and loci that influence mRNA abundance of a given gene. Most loci cluster at hotspot locations that influence multiple proteins&#x02014;in some cases, more than half of those examined. The variants that underlie these hotspots have profound effects on the gene regulatory network and provide insights into genetic variation in cell physiology between yeast strains.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">We developed a method for detecting genetic influences on protein levels in large populations of genetically distinct individual yeast cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 1</xref>). The method leverages extreme QTL mapping (X-QTL), a bulk segregant QTL mapping strategy with high statistical power <sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. We quantified protein abundance by measuring levels of green fluorescent protein (GFP) inserted in-frame downstream of a given gene of interest. The GFP tag allows protein abundance to be rapidly and accurately measured in millions of live, single cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). To apply the method to many genes, we took advantage of the yeast GFP collection <sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, in which over 4,000 strains each contain a different gene tagged with GFP in a common genetic background (BY). For each gene under study, we crossed the GFP strain to a genetically divergent vineyard strain (RM) and generated a large pool of haploid GFP-positive offspring (segregants) of the same mating type. Across the genome, each segregant inherits either the BY or the RM allele at each locus, some of which influence the given gene&#x02019;s protein level. We took a starting population of over 500,000 segregants and used FACS to collect 10,000 cells each from the high and low tails of GFP levels (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 2A</xref>). Such selection of phenotypically extreme individuals from a large population provides high power to detect loci with small effects <sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. We extracted DNA in bulk from these extreme populations, sequenced it to ~34 fold coverage, and used an analysis method that combines information across linked SNPs to accurately estimate allele frequencies from this depth of coverage <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. We detected loci that influence protein abundance as genomic regions where the high and low GFP pools differ in the frequency of the parental alleles (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 3</xref>). We denote these loci &#x0201c;extreme protein QTL&#x0201d; or X-pQTL.</p><p id="P3">We applied our method to 174 abundantly expressed genes, 140 of which were chosen based on previous eQTL and pQTL results, while 34 were selected at random. False discovery rates were determined using control experiments in which two cell populations were collected at random with respect to GFP level and compared as described above (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 2B</xref>). High-quality results were obtained for 160 genes (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data 1</xref> contains details on the genes, including exclusion criteria). Across these 160 genes, we identified 1,025 X-pQTL at a false discovery rate of 0.7%. The median genomic region spanned by these loci was 68 kb (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). The resulting X-pQTL were highly reproducible as gauged by biological and technical replicates (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 1</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref> &#x00026; <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 4</xref>). The number of X-pQTL per gene ranged from 0 to 25, with a median of five. We compared these numbers to eQTL and pQTL results based on published mRNA and mass-spectrometry protein data on ~100 segregants from a cross between the same BY and RM strains we study here <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. 85 genes were assayed in all three data sets; for these genes, we observed a mean of 1.2 eQTL, 0.6 pQTL, and 7.2 X-pQTL (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Our method increased detection of loci that influence protein levels by an average of 1,100%, as compared to a 15% increase recently reported through improvements in mass spectrometry <sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the distribution of detected loci per gene approaches that previously predicted to underlie gene expression variation in this yeast cross <sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, indicating that the higher power of the method enabled discovery of loci with small effects that escaped detection in previous studies. Our detection of multiple X-pQTL per gene directly demonstrates considerable genetic complexity in protein expression variation.</p><p id="P4">By design, all cells in the experiments described above inherit the GFP-tagged gene of interest, and the surrounding local region of the genome, from the BY strain. Therefore, the detected X-pQTL are distant from the gene of interest, and likely influence gene expression in <italic>trans</italic>. Previous studies have shown that mRNA levels of many genes are influenced by genetic variants in or near the gene itself (local eQTL), the majority of which influence gene expression in <italic>cis</italic>
<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. In contrast, local pQTL were reported to be rare based on mass spectrometry data <sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. We investigated local X-pQTL by generating GFP-tagged strains for 41 genes in the RM genetic background, and repeating the crosses so that both parent strains carried GFP-tagged alleles, which then segregated among the progeny. We detected local X-pQTL at genome-wide significance for 20 genes (49%, <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 5</xref>), and several additional genes would pass a more relaxed local significance threshold (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Thus, local genetic variation affects protein levels for at least half of the genes we tested, in contrast to earlier observations <sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> but in line with more recent work <sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">The genetic basis of mRNA variation has previously been reported to be surprisingly different from that of protein variation <sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. For example, based on published microarray <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and mass-spectrometry data <sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> for genes also present in our current study, only 23% of the eQTL had a corresponding pQTL. By contrast, we observed that 60% of the distant eQTL had a corresponding X-pQTL whereas only 5% were expected by chance (randomization test, p &#x0003c; 0.01). The direction of QTL effect (i.e. whether higher expression is associated with the BY or the RM allele) agreed for 92% of these shared loci (randomization test p &#x0003c; 0.01). The local eQTL showed similar concurrence (13 of 21 local eQTL, or 62%, had a corresponding X-pQTL), with slightly lower directional agreement (77%). Thus, in line with recent results for strong local eQTL in yeast <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, at least half of both local and distant loci with effects on mRNA levels also influence protein levels. The fraction of pQTL with a corresponding X-pQTL was similar to that for eQTL (46% vs. 60%; chi-squared test: &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> = 1.1, p = 0.3).</p><p id="P6">We next asked whether the many new X-pQTL discovered here (i.e., those without a corresponding significant eQTL) are best explained by posttranscriptional effects or by mRNA differences that are too small to be detected at genome-wide significance thresholds. In support of the latter hypothesis, we found that X-pQTL that correspond to significant eQTL have larger effects than those that do not (Wilcoxon rank test, p = 6e-11, <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 6</xref>). Further, at X-pQTL without a significant eQTL the direction of allelic effect nevertheless agreed with that in the mRNA data 66% of the time (randomization test, p &#x0003c; 0.01). These results are consistent with the existence of many undetected weak-effect eQTL (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 2</xref> and <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 7</xref>), but larger studies of mRNA levels are needed to confirm this. We did observe some clear differences between X-pQTL and eQTL. For 21 of 109 significant distant eQTL (19%), we saw no evidence for a corresponding X-pQTL, even at low statistical stringency (LOD &#x0003c; 1). Five genes with strong local eQTL also showed no evidence for a local X-pQTL; conversely, four genes with a local X-pQTL had no corresponding eQTL (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 1</xref>). These cases may represent influences of genetic variation on posttranscriptional processes.</p><p id="P7">Distant eQTL in yeast, as well as in other species, are not randomly distributed throughout the genome, but instead cluster at &#x0201c;hotspot&#x0201d; loci that influence the expression of many genes <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. We observed such clustering of X-pQTL at 20 genome locations, each of which overlapped more X-pQTL (&#x02265;12) than expected by chance (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 2</xref>). The majority of all detected distant X-pQTL (69%) fell within a hotspot. Remarkably, these 20 X-pQTL hotspots captured nearly all of the mRNA hotspots identified in the eQTL data for the same cross <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> &#x00026; <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 2</xref>). In contrast, many eQTL hotspots did not correspond to a mass-spectrometry based pQTL hotspot <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">The X-pQTL hotspots had widespread effects on protein levels. The median fraction of genes a hotspot affected was 27% of the 160 genes tested, and two of the hotspots each affected more than half of the genes (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 2</xref>). The magnitude and direction of expression changes differed considerably among the genes influenced by a given hotspot (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Together, these observations are best explained by hotspots shaping the proteome in a hierarchical manner. Proteins with the largest abundance changes are likely to be closely related in biological function to the gene whose alleles underlie a hotspot. Abundance of more distantly connected proteins may be more weakly perturbed through mechanisms that influence the overall physiological state of the cell <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. The consequences of some genetic differences may thus reverberate through much of the cell. We illustrate these ideas with a closer look at three of the hotspots.</p><p id="P9">The hotspot at ~239 kb on chromosome XII influences the expression of nearly half the genes in our set (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). It contains the gene <italic>HAP1</italic>, a transcriptional activator of genes involved in cellular respiration <sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. In BY, transcriptional activation by <italic>HAP1</italic> is reduced due to a transposon insertion, while <italic>HAP1</italic> function is intact in RM <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Of the nine genes in our dataset that are under direct transcriptional control by <italic>HAP1</italic>
<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, seven were regulated by this hotspot (<italic>YHB1</italic>, <italic>ACS2</italic>, <italic>CYC1</italic>, <italic>ERG10</italic>, <italic>OLE1</italic>, <italic>ADO1</italic>, and <italic>PDR16</italic>), more than expected by chance (Fisher&#x02019;s Exact Test (FET) p = 0.02). Further, these seven direct <italic>HAP1</italic> targets all had reduced expression in the presence of the BY allele of <italic>HAP1</italic>, and they were more strongly influenced by the hotspot than the other genes linking here (Wilcoxon Test p = 0.002, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Similarly, the hotspot on chromosome XI contains the gene <italic>HAP4</italic>, which encodes a component of the Hap2/3/4/5 complex, an activator of respiratory gene expression with different target genes than <italic>HAP1</italic>
<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Direct transcriptional targets of this complex <sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> are enriched among the genes influenced by this hotspot in our data (5 / 6 genes, p = 0.0003), and these target genes were more strongly affected than other genes (Wilcoxon Test, p = 0.02). Notably, the BY allele was associated with lower expression at all these <italic>HAP4</italic> targets (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, variation at both <italic>HAP1</italic> and <italic>HAP4</italic> regulates direct targets involved in cellular respiration. In both cases, the RM allele is associated with a more respiratory cellular state <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, likely resulting in the weaker expression changes for the many other genes affected by these hotspots.</p><p id="P10">The hotspot on chromosome XV regulates the largest fraction of genes in our dataset (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 2</xref>). We previously showed that variation in the gene <italic>IRA2</italic> underlies the corresponding eQTL hotspot <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. <italic>IRA2</italic> is an inhibitor of the Ras/PKA signaling pathway, which regulates a wide variety of processes, including the cellular response to glucose <sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Addition of glucose to yeast growing on non-fermentable carbon sources results in expression changes at &#x0003e; 40% of all genes <sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, and the majority of these changes are mediated through the Ras/PKA pathway <sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. The BY allele of <italic>IRA2</italic> is less active than the RM allele <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, and is therefore expected to be associated with higher Ras/PKA activity <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Indeed, the effects of this hotspot on protein levels are correlated with the mRNA expression changes induced by glucose addition <sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> (Spearman rank correlation rho = 0.68, p &#x0003c; 2e-16, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). The BY allele thus mimics stronger glucose signaling <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> even though glucose levels are constant and identical for all cells in our experiments. Interestingly, activation of respiratory genes by <italic>HAP1</italic> and <italic>HAP4</italic> is a branch of glucose signaling that is independent of Ras/PKA activity <sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Thus, the BY laboratory strain differs from the wild RM strain in at least three key components of glucose sensing.</p><p id="P11">The hotspot effects often overlap for individual proteins. For example, the three hotspots described above jointly regulate a set of eleven genes in our dataset (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 8</xref>). The three BY alleles all reduced expression of five of these proteins. Interestingly, these five genes (<italic>ATP14</italic>, <italic>ATP17</italic>, <italic>ATP2</italic>, <italic>CIT1, MDH1</italic>; <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 8</xref>) are all involved in aerobic respiration, while the remaining six genes are not. The BY strain grows better than wild strains on glucose-rich media that favor fermentation over respiration <sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Consistent direction of eQTL effects for genes in a pathway can be interpreted as evidence for adaptive evolution <sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Thus, the <italic>HAP1</italic>, <italic>HAP4</italic> and <italic>IRA2</italic> hotspots may represent adaptations of BY to the glucose-rich culture conditions commonly used in the laboratory <sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">Ten X-pQTL hotspots did not have corresponding eQTL hotspots. They may arise from eQTL with effects below the detection limit of the earlier studies, or from variants that influence protein levels via posttranscriptional mechanisms. For example, the locus centered at 132,948 bp on chromosome II regulated about a third of genes in our dataset; the largest fraction among the 10 novel hotspots (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 2</xref>). The BY allele increased expression of multiple ribosomal proteins and translation factors, suggesting that this hotspot regulates the abundance of ribosomes (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> &#x00026; <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Interestingly, none of the ribosomal genes whose protein levels mapped to this hotspot had an eQTL at this locus, suggesting that it may influence ribosome abundance via posttranscriptional processes <sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">We developed a powerful method to detect genetic variants affecting protein levels and used it to uncover substantial complexity in gene expression regulation. Our findings imply that many more eQTL and pQTL will be discovered in studies with larger sample sizes in other species.

A challenge for accurate estimation of allele frequencies is mapping bias, i.e. a systematic tendency for sequencing reads corresponding to the reference strain to map better than reads that contain alleles from a non-reference strain. Mapping bias is of particular concern in our experiments because the yeast reference genome was generated from one of our strains (BY). We initially noted clear evidence of reference bias in our data, even though our reads were comparably long. We therefore took several steps to eliminate mapping bias.</p><p id="P26">First, we compiled a catalogue of high-quality SNPs from Illumina genomic sequence data of the BY and the RM strain <sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Second, we restricted this catalogue to SNPs that can be unambiguously aligned to RM by making use of the high quality RM reference genome that is available from the Broad Institute (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/saccharomyces_cerevisiae.3/Info.html">http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/saccharomyces_cerevisiae.3/Info.html</ext-link>). For each SNP, we extracted 30 bp up- and downstream sequence from the BY reference, and set the SNP position itself to the RM allele. We aligned the resulting 61 bp fragments (as well as their reverse complement) to the RM genome using BWA <sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. We kept only SNPs where both the forward and the reverse &#x0201c;read&#x0201d; aligned uniquely to RM, resulting in a set of 38,430 SNPs. Third, we aligned the reads from each experiment to both the BY and the RM reference using BWA <sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. At each SNP, we kept only reads that mapped uniquely and without mismatches. Thus, reads that span a SNP were only retained when mapped to the strain reference from which they originated. While we acknowledge that this procedure removes reads with sequencing errors, we found that the corresponding loss in sequence coverage was justified by the improved accuracy of allele frequency estimates. Finally, we removed likely PCR duplicates using a python script kindly provided by Martin Kircher, and estimated allele frequencies by counting at each SNP the number of reads that matched the BY or the RM references. Together, these procedures resulted in dense, accurate allele frequency estimates across the entire yeast genome.</p><p id="P27">Allele count data is available as <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Dataset 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Analyses of count data and QTL detection</title><p id="P28">Unless otherwise specified, all statistical analyses were performed in the R programming environment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.r-project.org">www.r-project.org</ext-link>). At each SNP, we calculated two statistics to describe the allele frequency distribution in the pools. First, we simply calculated the fraction of reads with the BY allele in each pool and subtracted these frequencies in the low GFP tail from those in the high GFP tail (&#x0201c;allele frequency difference&#x0201d;). Second, we calculated the p-value from a G-test comparing the number of BY vs. RM counts in the high to those in the low GFP tail. Because these two SNP-wise statistics can be highly variable at neighboring SNPs due to random sampling, we performed loess-smoothing along the chromosomes for plotting results for single genes.</p><p id="P29">For X-pQTL detection, we used the MULTIPOOL software <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. MULTIPOOL fits a graphical model to each chromosome that takes into account both linkage and variation in sequence coverage. MULTIPOOL reports a LOD score from a likelihood ratio test comparing a model with and a model without a QTL at the given position. MULTIPOOL was run in &#x0201c;contrast&#x0201d; mode, and with the following parameters: base pairs per centiMorgan (-c parameter) = 2200, bin size (-r) = 100. The pool size (-n) was set to 1,000 rather than 10,000 to allow for the fact that not all collected cells will survive. We noticed that MULTIPOOL can be highly sensitive to SNPs that are fixed or nearly fixed for one of the parental alleles. At these positions, MULTIPOOL sometimes produces very sharp peaks in the LOD curve that spike at single SNPs. We therefore removed SNPs with a BY allele frequency &#x0003e; 0.9 or &#x0003c; 0.1 prior to running MULTIPOOL. The resulting LOD curves robustly detect peaks, and are free from any single-SNP artifacts.</p><p id="P30">We used the empirical null sorts to set the genome-wide threshold for peak detection at a LOD &#x02265; 4.5 (s above).

We created a reference fasta file with two sequences for each gene as follows. First, we added the terminal 75 bp of the gene&#x02019;s ORF sequence immediately upstream of (but excluding) the stop codon to the first 75 bp of the GFP cassette. Second, we added the last 75 bp of the cassette to the 75 bp of genomic sequence immediately downstream of the stop codon.

First, the pools for gene YDR343C (<italic>HXT6</italic>) had 50&#x02013;60% of reads mapping to the gene YDR342C (<italic>HXT7</italic>). These two genes are close paralogs, and both the ends of their ORFs and their downstream sequence are virtually identical, suggesting that the apparent contamination is in fact due to reads randomly mapping to either of the two genes. Second, the pools for the gene YGR192C (<italic>TDH3</italic>) appeared to be ~20 &#x02013; 25% contaminated by the gene YGR009C (<italic>TDH2</italic>). These two genes are also close paralogues so that the ends of their ORFs used in our fusion library are identical, but have different downstream sequences. Off-target reads are therefore expected at 25% of reads for YGR192C. We retained both YDR343C and YGR192C in our analyses.</p><p id="P37">The remaining genes with apparent contamination have low absolute numbers of reads overlapping the cassette fusions so that a single off-target read has a disproportionate effect on the purity estimate.

The GFP cassette along with the HIS5 gene was amplified from genomic DNA extracted from the respective GFP collection strain using primers designed using sequences available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://yeastgfp.yeastgenome.org/yeastGFPOligoSequence.txt">http://yeastgfp.yeastgenome.org/yeastGFPOligoSequence.txt</ext-link>.

We detected several GFP mutations that were in common between the RM strain and the donor GFP from the corresponding BY strain and that were therefore already present in the GFP collection strains. At five genes, the RM strain carried silent mutations that were not found in the BY strain; these are unlikely to cause false positive local X-pQTL and the genes were retained in our analyses. We excluded six genes with nonsynonymous mutations present only in the RM allele where the RM allele was associated with lower GFP fluorescence. For three genes, we noted non-synonymous mutations in the RM GFP sequence where the RM allele associated with higher fluorescence. Because a fortuitous mutation in the GFP ORF is unlikely to increase GFP fluorescence, it is unlikely that the mutations alter the GFP signal in these three cases. These three genes were therefore retained in the analyses. Two of these three genes (YKL029C and YNL061W) had a local X-pQTL with concordant expression direction to a local eQTL, while the third gene (YBR067C) had a local X-pQTL and no data available in the eQTL dataset. Finally, we excluded one gene where the GFP cassette had no mutations, but where several sequencing reads spanned the end of the ORF without being interrupted by the GFP cassette, suggesting that not all segregants may have inherited a GFP-tagged allele. <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data 1</xref> details all gene exclusions.</p><p id="P41">In the paper, we present data for the 41 genes with high quality data. 21 of these genes (55%) have a local eQTL, as compared with 21% of all genes with eQTL data.

A local X-pQTL is called if the LOD score at the midpoint of the gene exceeds a given threshold (e.g. LOD &#x0003e; 4.5 for genome-wide significance). Because genome-wide significance is conservative when assaying only a single position in the genome as for local X-pQTL, we also used a more relaxed local significance threshold.

From each of 100 randomized sets, we calculated the number of eQTL that overlapped an X-pQTL, and what fraction of these overlapping QTL have an effect in the same direction. This test is conservative due to the presence of the linkage hotspots: because many genes link here in both the X-pQTL and eQTL data, a high degree of random overlap is expected.

Effect sizes for transcription factor targets and the remaining genes were tested using Wilcoxon rank tests.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Expression data for glucose sensing and PKA induction</title><p id="P57">To test if the putative <italic>IRA2</italic> hotspot mimics the effects of altered glucose sensing, we compared the effects of this locus on the genes in our dataset to mRNA expression data obtained by Zaman et al. <sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. In that work, the authors added glucose to yeast growing on glycerol (a non-fermentable carbon source) and measured the resulting mRNA expression changes using microarrays. We obtained these expression data from the PUMA database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://puma.princeton.edu">http://puma.princeton.edu</ext-link>). We averaged the results for each gene across the four available replicates of the 60 minutes time point post glucose addition (experiment IDs 100564, 101022, 101261, 105490). We calculated spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation between hotspot effect size and mRNA expression. The hotspot effects are polarized such that positive values correspond to higher expression being caused by the BY compared to the RM allele.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Extended Data</title><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><label>Extended Data Figure 1</label><caption><p id="P59">Overview of the experimental design</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms542520f4"/></fig><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><label>Extended Data Figure 2</label><caption><title>Illustration of FACS design</title><p id="P60">Shown is GFP intensity and forward scatter (FSC, a measure of cell size) recorded during FACS.
