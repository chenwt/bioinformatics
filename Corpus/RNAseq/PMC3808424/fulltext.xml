To start understanding the role of epigenetic changes during hypoxia, we investigated the long-term effect of hypoxia on gene expression and DNA methylation in hippocampal neuronal cells. Primary murine hippocampal neuronal cells were cultured for 7 days. Hypoxic stress of 1% O2, 5% CO2 for 24 hours was applied on Day 3, conditions we found to maximize cellular hypoxic stress response without inducing cell death. Cells were returned to normoxia for 4 days following the period of hypoxic stress. On Day 7, Methyl-Sensitive Cut Counting (MSCC) was used to identify a genome-wide methylation profile of the hippocampal cell lines to assess methylation changes resulting from hypoxia. RNA-Seq was also done on Day 7 to analyze changes in gene transcription. Phenotypic analysis showed that neuronal processes were significantly shorter after 1 day of hypoxia, but there was a catch-up growth of these processes after return to normoxia. Transcriptome profiling using RNA-Seq revealed 369 differentially expressed genes with 225 being upregulated, many of which form networks shown to affect CNS development and function. Importantly, the expression level of 59 genes could be correlated to the changes in DNA methylation in their promoter regions. CpG islands, in particular, had a strong tendency to remain hypomethylated long after hypoxic stress was removed. From this study, we conclude that short-term, sub-lethal hypoxia results in long-lasting changes to genome wide DNA methylation status and that some of these changes can be highly correlated with transcriptional modulation in a number of genes involved in functional pathways that have been previously implicated in neural growth and development.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a National Institutes of Health grant HL098053 to GGH.

The central nervous system is particularly dependent on oxygen for proper development and function. Hence, a hypoxic insult during development may cause significant cognitive and behavioral impediments at a later stage in life. For example, in the United States, perinatal asphyxia has an incidence of up to 8 per 1000 live births with results ranging from mild neurological difficulties to severe neonatal encephalopathy, including cerebral palsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Interestingly, these neurological diseases are not always easily correlated to hypoxia-induced neuronal injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This raises the question of how such temporary hypoxia influences long-term function of cells still viable after hypoxic stress.</p><p>While the detrimental effect of short-term hypoxia on neurological development has been phenotypically characterized, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the deleterious effects continue to be elucidated. Furthermore, although it is possible that severe hypoxia in early life can cause cell death, it is also possible that hypoxia can induce sub-lethal biochemical changes, including long-lasting alterations in gene expression. It has been shown that hypoxia activates certain genes necessary for cellular survival and adaptation in hypoxic conditions as well as genes for inducing cell injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. For example, acute modest hypoxia, in particular that lasting for minutes or hours, is known to upregulate genes coding for neuroprotective endoplasmic reticulum proteins, proteins involved in ubiquitinylation, and those involved in hypoxic neuronal death[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Concordantly, genes involved in cellular protection, neurogenesis, and neuronal regeneration were strongly repressed following such a stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Whether these gene expression changes persist many days after the short-term hypoxic stress has yet to be determined.</p><p>Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and histone modification, result in long-term changes in gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Epigenetic changes are central in controlling longer term effects of stresses such as in hypoxia-mediated gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. How acute hypoxic stress influences gene expression through modifications of DNA methylation and histone acetylation has been studied in the context of tumor suppressor genes and cancer progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Other research has demonstrated that intermittent hypoxia may initiate epigenetic changes leading to long-lasting increases in persistent oxidative stress and manifestations of cardiovascular disease in adult rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, the enduring effects and the extent of short-term hypoxia on methylation and subsequent gene expression in the central nervous system have not been explored. Thus, in this present study, we investigate the long-lasting impact of acute sub-lethal hypoxic stress on gene expression in hippocampal neuronal cells and hypoxia-induced changes in DNA methylation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials &#x00026; Methods</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

The CpG tag libraries were sequenced using Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx and returned ~1 GB of sequence partitioned into 36-nt long reads per library. The resulting sequence files were mapped to the <italic>Mus musculus</italic> reference genome (version mm9), and the data were analyzed by creating frequency histograms showing the number of times reads identified at any given CpG site.

Also, a greater proportion of promoter and CpG islands were hypomethylated rather than hypermethylated, several days after hypoxic exposure. These findings indicate that there is a correlation between whole genome changes in methylation and gene expression, days after sub-lethal hypoxic stress. When investigating the site of methylation in the 59 genes, it was evident that methylation as an epigenetic mechanism was strongly responsible for the observed lasting changes in gene expression. While these 59 genes fit the widely-accepted paradigm of the influence of methylation on gene expression, the majority of genes that had altered expression either did not have observed methylation changes within their promoter or displayed methylation modification that were contrary to the expected paradigm. This suggests that, while methylation plays a potential role in gene regulation, it is not the only mediator, and there is still much to be discerned regarding the role of methylation in gene expression regulation. </p><p>Transcription regulatory mechanisms are diverse and influenced by various environmental and chemical conditions. Histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases have been found to have a role in HIF1-dependent transcriptional induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Hypoxia-related microRNAs have also surfaced as important in processes such as apoptosis and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Ostensibly, epigenetic regulation of gene expression is rarely a uni-factorial mechanism influencing transcription. While one epigenetic mechanism may play a dominant role in regulating gene expression, there are many other epigenetic influences that may impact transcription. We found that variable expression of 59 genes was predominantly impacted by DNA methylation changes due to sublethal hypoxia. However, there were many other genes whose expression changes are not solely explained by methylation changes. Other epigenetic mechanisms are likely involved in these cases.</p><p>Of the 59 genes predominantly impacted by DNA methylation, 4 of them that displayed upregulation of RNA and demethylated promoter regions (APC, CTNNBIP1, CCND2, PLCB1) were found to be involved in the Wnt signaling pathway. APC and CTNNBIP1 act as negative regulators of the canonical pathway through disruption of &#x003b2;-catenin nuclear localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. PLCB1 interacts with the Ca2+ pathway and is involved in the development of normal cortical circuitry; mice without PLCB1 display changes in synaptic and dendritic morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. CCND2 encodes the Cyclin D2 protein involved in cell cycle regulation. Furthermore, Wnt is involved in the up-regulation of neuronal stem cell growth through HIF-1a signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. </p><p> We found that RICTOR, a subunit of the mTORC2 complex in the mTOR pathway, was found to have undergone both transcriptional up-regulation and substantial promoter de-methylation in the culture subjected to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0077859-t001">Table 1</xref>). However, Igf1, which has been characterized as an upstream regulator of the mTOR pathway, was found to be down-regulated with increased promoter methylation. While the functional characteristics of mTORC2 have yet to be fully elucidated, loss of mTORC2 has been implicated in impairment of long term memory and long term potentiation and plays a role in cytoskeleton organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. We hypothesize here that this up-regulation of mTORC2 is associated with the increased growth of dendrites with the return to room air after the hypoxic stress.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0077859-t001"
