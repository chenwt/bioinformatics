It is long known that elevated High-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c) levels are associated with reduction of the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This effect is mechanistically related to reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), a process that mediates excretion of excess HDL cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver ending ultimately in the faeces
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) plays a central role in this process and it was recognized that pharmacological inhibition of CETP mediated cholesterol transport would raise HDL-c levels resulting in protection from coronary heart disease. The Syrian hamster <italic>Mesocricetus auratus</italic> has become an important animal model for pre-clinical dyslipidaemia research because HDL-c levels are raised in response to drugs designed for human target proteins
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In contrast to mice and rats, CETP is expressed in hamster liver which explains raise of serum HDL levels in response to the CETP inhibitor Anacetrabip
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The Illumina human body map 2.0 project provides high-quality RNAseq based gene expression data for major human organs using pooled samples from healthy donors including liver (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</ext-link>). This database allows a comparative analysis of liver gene expression between humans and model organisms such as the primate <italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic> where a microarray based expression database of 36 liver samples became recently available as a part of a genome sequencing project
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Currently, lack of a fully annotated genome for <italic>M</italic>. <italic>auratus</italic> prevents development of reliable genome-based tools for transcript imaging such as microarrays or qPCR panels. Recently, the genome of the Chinese hamster <italic>Cricetulus griseus</italic> derived cell line (CHO)-K1 was published because it is the preferred host cell line for industrial production of recombinant proteins such as therapeutic antibodies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. For this reason, genome analysis and annotation was focused on the analysis of protein modifying systems such as fucosylation or glycosylation pathways. A partial transcriptome analysis of an antibody producing CHO line by RNA sequencing had been performed earlier
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The RNA source, the low transcript annotation coverage of approximately 40% combined with the absence of data in the public domain limits utility of this study for our project. Furthermore, a recent mitochondrial genome based study of rodent phylogeny shows that evolutionary relationship between <italic>M</italic>. <italic>auratus</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>griseus</italic> is comparable to that between <italic>R</italic>. <italic>norvegicus</italic> and <italic>M</italic>.<italic>musculus</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These circumstances suggested use of well annotated genomes such as rat, mouse or human as template for mapping and reliable annotation of Syrian hamster liver transcripts.</p><p>We show here, that simultaneous application of two independent deep sequencing technologies combined with searches across multiple database allows indeed unambiguous annotation and quantification of transcripts expressed in liver of the Syrian hamster. Triple match sequencing (TMS) can be applied for transcript profiling of any organism provided that annotated genomes of related species are available.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Experimental strategy</title><p>The underlying principle and the workflow of TMS are summarized in Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> (A and B). From total RNA, two libraries are constructed for NGS using a long-read (Roche 454) and a short-read (ABI SOLiD) technology. For the 454 library construction, we used polyT-primed cDNA because the 3<sup>&#x02032;</sup> sequence upstream of the poly-A tail is required for quantification of short-read tags. This approach allows identification of genes belonging to homologous families because the untranslated region has in general higher sequence diversity than the coding region. To achieve broad representation of transcripts independent of their expression levels it was crucial to normalize RNA abundance in the cDNA samples by competitive hybridization. 1.2 million 454 reads with an average length of 350 bases were assembled into contigs. Unique contigs together with unassembled reads were subsequently used as query for homology searches across well annotated transcriptome databases such as mouse, rat and human (RefSeq). This approach led to unambiguous annotation of 10&#x02019;800 transcripts corresponding to 57.4 per cent of the contigs assembled from the normalized 454 long-read library. Probing of human, mouse and rat RefSeq databases with unique query contigs typically produced matches to the same transcript in each library thereby improving annotation fidelity of hamster transcripts.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Triple match sequencing</bold> (<bold>TMS</bold>): <bold>principle and workflow.</bold> (<bold>A</bold>) A complex SAGE-tag based deep sequencing library is generated from total RNA and sequenced on a high-throughput platform (e.g. ABI-SOLiD, ABI-Proton, Illumina) for transcript quantification based on read frequency. A second normalized SAGE library from the same RNA and sequenced on a long read, low-throughput platform (e.g. Roche 454). mRNA reads from these libraries share the distal 3<sup>&#x02032;</sup>-sequence. The long reads are compared to related transcript databases (i.e. human, mouse, rat, dog; RefSeq) as detailed in Methods. (<bold>B</bold>) Deep sequencing libraries from total RNA were constructed for either SOLiD or 454 sequencing platforms. To ensure representation of low-abundance transcripts it is essential to normalize the 454 library by competitive hybridization. The long 454 reads are assembled into contigs and mapped to human, rat, mouse and dog RefSeq databases yielding about 10&#x02019;800 annotated genes (hamster liver transcriptome). 93% of 82 million short SAGE tags mapped to the hamster transcriptome and the remaining 7% to human RefSeq entries allowing quantification over 4 orders of magnitude. All 454 and SOLiD sequencing data generated here are available on request.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-14-237-1"/></fig><p>Our primary objective is to quantify hamster liver mRNA abundance for interspecies comparisons (see below). Using total liver RNA from the same samples sequenced by 454 technology, we generated SAGE short read libraries for processing on an ABI-SOLiD instrument. We relied on SAGE based bead libraries because the frequency of unique tags is directly proportional to transcript abundance
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. We performed four SOLiD runs yielding altogether 82 million usable reads. 93% of this pool mapped to the 454-contig assembly and the remainder mapped either to human, mouse, rat, or dog RefSeq databases (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). The high mapping efficiency supports the TMS approach and highlights the requirement of a long-read library for reliable mapping and annotation.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative comparison of transcripts involved in lipid metabolism in liver of H.sapiens, M.fascicularis, S.scrofa, M.auratus and R.norwegicus</title><p>The primary motivation for our study was to compare liver gene gene expression in hamster with humans and model organisms used in metabolic disease research.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The general concordance of the normalized datasets for each species is illustrated by the comparable expression levels of housekeeping genes across all species included in this deep sequencing based analysis (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, right panel). To compare expression of genes involved in lipid digestion, mobilization and transport we selected a set of 48 genes from the REACTOME database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reactome.org/">http://www.reactome.org/</ext-link>), because their functional interactions are well documented. Hierarchical clustering generated six distinct clusters of genes with similar gene expression patterns across all species (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; left panel; CL1- CL6). Cluster 1 contains apolipoprotein isoforms that are abundantly expressed in all species included here. ApoA2 was assigned to cluster five which contains transcripts involved in HDL-biosynthesis with very low expression in the rat. The cholesteryl-ester- transfer-protein (CETP) is the target of HDL-modifying drugs explaining lack of pharmacological responses in the rat model
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Cluster 2 contains highly expressed transcripts in all species adjacent to the most abundant liver specific transcript albumin. Clusters 3 and 4 are compiled of genes in the intermediate expression range, with notable interspecies variability. Finally, the mRNA expression levels in cluster 6 are in general low because these genes mostly belong to a network operating in the intestinal lumen. The protein kinase PRKACG as a testis-specific enzyme was properly assigned to cluster 6
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Altogether we failed to identify transcripts for five genes (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, left panel, grey boxes). The ApoA1 gene of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>fascicularis</italic> lacks a CATG motif required for SAGE-based sequencing using SOLiD technology.

The log2 values of normalized read counts are presented in a standard heat map as indicated. Grey fields indicate genes lacking valid expression data.

Using a SAGE based comparison of liver gene expression across five species we show that TMS derived data are comparable to mRNA quantification data using conventional genome based mapping. Similar to other vertebrates about 10&#x02019;800 genes are expressed in hamster liver at comparable levels (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S1).</p><p>The value of transcript identification in absence of an annotated genome has been recognized by others. Fletcher et al. have generated a partial transcriptome of the Woodchuck (<italic>Marmota monax</italic>) an animal model for experimental hepatitis B infection and hepatocellular carcinoma
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Randomly primed cDNA libraries were sequenced using 454-long read technology followed by contig assembly and annotation. This yielded a pool of 13&#x02019;448 unique transcripts which was used to build a custom microarray to analyze the transcriptional responses to virus infection and cure. Compared to TMS this process is more time consuming due to the need of microarray production and validation. A method termed TRINITY relies on graphics based assembly of high coverage short read or paired end cDNA libraries without reference genome
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In contrast to the Woodchuck approach, the three software modules constituting TRINITY can detect novel splice variants as demonstrated for fission yeast, mouse, and whitefly whose genomes were not available at the time of release. This approach is particularly suited for the analysis of tumor samples where gene re-arrangements and structural deviations can lead to novel variants of any gene
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Although TRINITY has powerful transcript assembly capabilities for short and long read data the current version of the program cannot perform transcript quantification. In our approach contig assembly of long-reads is solely performed for annotation followed by quantification using frequencies of short-read SAGE tags (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). Therefore, TMS is inherently unable to quantify or discover splice variants of the same gene. This requires construction of tissue specific cDNA libraries by random priming which was used to build the human &#x0201c;bodymap&#x0201d; gene expression database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.info/blog/2011/05/24/human-bodymap-2-0-data-from-illumina">http://www.ensembl.info/blog/2011/05/24/human-bodymap-2-0-data-from-illumina</ext-link>). TMS does not attempt to annotate species-specific transcripts because the approach relies on mapping to known mRNAs in other species. We note that any unmapped long reads are candidates for species specific transcripts of hamster. Normally, unique 454- reads or contigs matched the same RefSeq transcript from more than one species (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B) resulting in a significant improvement of annotation confidence.</p><p>As it turned out, the genome sequence or the partial transcriptome analysis of the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>griseus</italic> derived cell line CHO(K1) had only limited value for our project
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], because the annotation efforts in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>griseus</italic> focused mainly on pathways relevant for protein production and modification. Furthermore, the evolutionary distance between <italic>C</italic>. <italic>griseus</italic> and <italic>M</italic>.<italic>auratus</italic> is comparable to that between mouse and rat
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].
