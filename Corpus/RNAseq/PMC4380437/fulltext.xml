One mechanism by which cancer cells can become invasive is through the formation of structures called invadopodia, which are dynamic, actin-rich membrane protrusions that are sites of focal extracellular matrix degradation. While there is a growing consensus that invadopodia are instrumental in tumor metastasis, less is known about whether they are involved in tumor growth, particularly <italic>in vivo</italic>. The adaptor protein Tks5 is an obligate component of invadopodia, and is linked molecularly to both actin-remodeling proteins and pericellular proteases. Tks5 appears to localize exclusively to invadopodia in cancer cells, and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have demonstrated its critical requirement for the invasive nature of these cells, making it an ideal surrogate to investigate the role of invadopodia <italic>in vivo</italic>. In this study, we examined how Tks5 contributes to human breast cancer progression. We used immunohistochemistry and RNA sequencing data to evaluate Tks5 expression in clinical samples, and we characterized the role of Tks5 in breast cancer progression using RNA interference and orthotopic implantation in SCID-Beige mice. We found that Tks5 is expressed to high levels in approximately 50% of primary invasive breast cancers. Furthermore, high expression was correlated with poor outcome, particularly in those patients with late relapse of stage I/II disease. Knockdown of Tks5 expression in breast cancer cells resulted in decreased growth, both in 3D <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, our data also suggest that Tks5 is important for the integrity and permeability of the tumor vasculature. Together, this work establishes an important role for Tks5 in tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>, and suggests that invadopodia may play broad roles in tumor progression.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors acknowledge the use of tissues procured by the National Disease Research Interchange with support from NIH grant 5 U42 RR006042.

However, the ability of tumor cells to infiltrate their surrounding microenvironment and wreak havoc on an otherwise uncompromised biological system underlies tumor metastasis, and remains the major cause of death in breast cancer patients. Our goal is to identify the molecular mediators of invasion in breast cancer cells that may warrant efficient and targeted drug design in the future.</p><p>Tumor cells are obliged to penetrate, remodel and degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) in order to invade and metastasize [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. One recognized mechanism for ECM degradation is the formation of dynamic, actin-rich structures called invadopodia, which in tissue culture form on the ventral surface of cells in contact with ECM and act as focal sites of its degradation [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Invadopodia were first noted in Src-transformed fibroblasts [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and subsequently have been well described in many invasive human cancer cells, particularly those derived from breast cancer, melanoma and glioblastoma. A host of proteins are localized to invadopodia, including proteases, actin regulatory proteins and signaling molecules. Few, if any, of these molecules are selectively localized to invadopodia, however. This makes it challenging to separate the functions of invadopodia from those of other actin-based structures and protrusions. To circumvent this, many studies define invadopodia by the simultaneous presence of ECM degradative capacity, and key actin regulators such as cofilin or cortactin. However, it is not currently feasible to use these criteria to study the functions of invadopodia <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Some years ago, we identified a novel Src substrate and scaffold protein called Tks5, and showed that it both localized to, and was required for the formation of, invadopodia [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A number of Tks5 binding partners have been identified which can link Tks5 to both actin-remodeling proteins and pericellular proteases; these include ADAM-family metalloproteases [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and the adaptor proteins Grb2, nWASP and Nck2 [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Importantly, Tks5 appears to be localized exclusively to invadopodia in cancer cells, and our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies demonstrated its critical requirement for the invasiveness of breast cancer cell lines [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This prompted us to investigate the requirement for Tks5 for tumor growth and metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic>, initially using the experimental system of Src-transformed mouse fibroblasts. We found that knockdown of Tks5 using RNA interference impaired the tumorigenicity of the cells when introduced by either subcutaneous or intravenous routes, perhaps by impairing tumor angiogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These studies suggest that invadopodia-mediated invasive behavior may be pivotal not just for metastatic progression (for example intra- and extravasation), but may also impact the growth of the tumor.</p><p>Recently, three important studies have demonstrated the clinical prognostic relevance of Tks5 expression in glial-derived brain tumors [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], lung adenocarcinomas [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and prostate cancer [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], further justifying more detailed <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis of Tks5 function.

We used a commercial rabbit polyclonal antibody which we first validated for specificity for Tks5 using transfected cell populations (<xref rid="pone.0121003.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). The same batch of antibody, and the same staining protocol, was used on the breast cancer tissue microarrays (TMA), and a scoring system was developed. These TMAs also contained a few (&#x0003c;20) specimens of normal breast tissue and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Normal breast tissue was largely negative or 1+ for Tks5 expression, although we did detect occasional terminal lobules, and isolated ductal cells, which were strongly positive (<xref rid="pone.0121003.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). The DCIS specimens were largely 1+, although larger sample sizes would be needed to judge the reliability of this finding. Of the 163 evaluable primary invasive breast carcinoma specimens, only 1% showed no staining, 16% were 1+, 35% were 2+, and 48% were 3+ (<xref rid="pone.0121003.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). These findings support further study of Tks5 in breast cancer. However, batch-to-batch variability of the commercial antibody made us reluctant to use it for IHC of larger datasets to explore any association with tumor type and/or outcome. We therefore decided to use RNA sequence (RNAseq) analysis for our next experiments.</p><fig id="pone.0121003.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0121003.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Tks5 expression in breast tissue and breast cancer.</title><p>A) 293 cells were transfected with empty vector, or vectors expressing Tks4 or Tks5.

The long form (Tks5-long or Tks5&#x003b1;) refers to the full length protein with an amino-terminal PX domain followed by 5 SH3 domains. There are also short forms of Tks5 (Tks5-short, Tks5&#x003b2; and others) which are initiated at different, internal, promoter(s) and lack the PX domain. Only the PX domain-containing form of Tks5 can contribute to invadopodia formation, and in tissue culture, human cancer cell lines express only or predominantly this long, Tks5&#x003b1;, form [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, many primary human tumor samples do express short form mRNAs. Moreover, it was recently shown in lung cancer that a high ratio of long to short forms of Tks5 is associated with a worse prognosis [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We first used the methodology described in [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] to examine the breast cancer RNAseq dataset from the University of North Carolina [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We found no statistically significant association between either total Tks5 expression, or a high long/short ratio, and tumor type, grade or outcome (data not shown). We therefore focused our analysis on the long (Tks5&#x003b1;) form, by analyzing the expression of the first 5 exons, which encode the PX domain. Median Tks5&#x003b1; expression values were used as the cutoff to divide all patients into High (&#x0003e;median, n = 425) and Low (&#x0003c;median, n = 425) groups. First, patients were divided into stage I/II and stage III/IV groups, with Fisher&#x02019;s exact test used to determine any association. No significant association was found between Tks5&#x003b1; expression and disease stage (p = 0.56). In terms of breast cancer type, 56% of ER-positive, 51% of Her2-positive, and 38% of triple negative breast cancers were in the High group for Tks5&#x003b1; expression (p = 0.0013). Next, Kaplan-Meier curves and Log rank tests were used to evaluate any overall survival differences between High and Low Tks5&#x003b1; expressors. There was a significant difference in overall survival between the two patient groups, with a median survival time of 93.3 months for the High group and 132.0 months for the Low group (p = 0.049) (<xref rid="pone.0121003.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). It is noteworthy that the two survival curves overlap for the first 60 months. Beyond this time, the negative association between high Tks5&#x003b1; expression and survival becomes highly statistically significant (n = 142, p = 0.00078). Interestingly, for patients with stage I/II disease, median survival time for the High group was 84.5 months, and for the Low group 142.4 months (n = 626, p = 0.0057) (<xref rid="pone.0121003.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>), whereas for patients with stage III/IV disease, differences in median survival for the High group (104 months) and the Low group (131 months) were not statistically significant (n = 205, p = 0.65) (<xref rid="pone.0121003.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>). Multivariate analyses were also conducted. High Tks5&#x003b1; expression is still significant (p = 0.012) after adjusting for age in stage I and II patients, but not if more variables are adjusted. However, high Tks5&#x003b1; is a significant prognostic indicator (p = 0.017) after adjusting for age, BRCA subtype, and pathological stage in patients surviving more than 5 years post diagnosis. In summary, these analyses suggest that overall survival of patients with pathological stage I and II breast cancer is significantly influenced by Tks5&#x003b1; expression level, particularly for those more than 5 years post diagnosis.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Tks5 expression is required for tumor cell growth <italic>in vitro</italic> and in an orthotopic <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse model</title><p>Our previous findings demonstrated that Tks5 is required for breast cancer cell invasion and ECM degradation <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

Prior experiments revealed that Tks5 knockdown did not affect proliferation rates on tissue culture plastic when compared to controls [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore we chose to conduct these experiments in three-dimensional (3D) matrices of native type I collagen. We observed a decrease in 3D cell growth for Tks5-KD cells as compared to scrambled knockdown cells (<xref rid="pone.0121003.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). We also evaluated these cells in the well-established 3D tumorsphere assays using matrigel. Normally in this assay, non-transformed breast epithelial cells (such as MCF10A) display low proliferation and remain stable in terms of acinar size and shape, with acini resembling hollowed-out spheroids. In contrast, tumor cells such as MDA-MB-231 exhibit high proliferation and form extensive stellate structures that often bridge multiple cell colonies [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We found that MDA-MB-231-Luc cells expressing scrambled shRNA developed the transformed morphology previously reported. Conversely, while Tks5-KD cells did not exhibit a full reversion to the normal acinus formation seen with MCF10A cells, these cells produced only small and poorly organized clusters with less growth and fewer protrusions (<xref rid="pone.0121003.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>).

To verify this, we also performed a rescue experiment in which MDA-MB-231-luc cells expressing the D6 Tks5 shRNA (which targets the 3&#x02019; UTR of the endogenous mRNA) were engineered to re-express a GFP tagged form of Tks5 (Tks5-GFP) (<xref rid="pone.0121003.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C and 2E</xref>).

Because the size of the tumors did not influence the proliferation or apoptotic rate, both small and large tumors were used for these analyses.

Significantly, a pioneering study on Tks5 in human cancer found a clinical prognostic relevance in glial-derived brain tumors [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and prostate cancer [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and a recent study defined the importance of a high ratio of Tks5&#x003b1; to Tks5&#x003b2; mRNAs in lung cancer [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Our own examination of Tks5 using tissue microarrays revealed an increased Tks5 expression in clinical breast cancer specimens, with approximately half of primary invasive tumors displaying high Tks5 protein expression. Analysis of RNA sequencing data did not reveal any correlation between total Tks5 mRNA, or high Tks5&#x003b1;:&#x003b2; ratios, and outcome. However, there was a significant association between expression of the long form, Tks5&#x003b1;, and survival, particularly for those diagnosed with stage I/II disease. Interestingly, this association was most pronounced in the population with late (&#x0003e; 5 year) recurrence of disease. This intriguing finding suggests a role for Tks5&#x003b1; beyond initial metastatic spread, and raises the possibility that Tks5, and/or invadopodia, might be involved in tumor dormancy. This could be consistent with the finding of reduced tumor angiogenesis, since some studies have linked the angiogenic switch to escape from tumor dormancy [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As a caveat, we note that the survival data in the TCGA dataset does not list cause of death, and it is highly likely that some patients will have died of causes other than breast cancer. Nevertheless, further interrogation of the clinical relevance of Tks5&#x003b1; in breast cancer is clearly warranted. To this end, we are currently preparing an antibody specific for the PX domain of Tks5 for use in immunohistochemical analyses.</p><p>We used RNA interference to test the role of Tks5 in tumor growth. While the shRNA sequences we used would target both the long (&#x003b1;) and short (&#x003b2;) forms of Tks5, we note that human cancer cells in general, and MDA-MB-231 in particular, express predominantly Tks5&#x003b1; ([<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and <xref rid="pone.0121003.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). We found a marked inhibition of tumor growth in these experiments, regardless of shRNA sequence used, or whether knockdown was accomplished <italic>in vitro</italic> or after tumor establishment <italic>in vivo</italic>. These results are consistent with our previous findings using Src-3T3 cells [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and melanoma cell lines (unpublished). However, they differ from published data on Twist-expressing human mammary epithelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and mouse lung adenocarcinoma cell lines injected subcutaneously, where reduced metastasis, but no deficits in tumor growth at the injection site, were noted [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. There are many possible explanations for these discrepancies. One possibility is that site of injection is important, since the data shown here were obtained with orthotopic injections, although our Src-transformed fibroblast experiments also used the subcutaneous route. Tumor and/or cell type differences may also provide an underlying reason. In addition, we measured tumor growth during the first weeks after implantation, whereas Eckert et al [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and Li et al [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] only reported tumor weights at the end point of the experiment. Perhaps tumors eventually overcome the requirement for Tks5, or shRNA control of Tks5 expression is lost. One way to complement such knockdown xenotransplantation experiments and distinguish between these possibilities is to determine the role of Tks5 in a mouse model of breast cancer, which is currently underway. Regardless, because of the poor growth of the primary tumor we did not measure metastatic dissemination of the Tks5 knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells. However, our preliminary data suggest that when tumor cells were introduced directly into the circulation to circumvent the need for intravasation, metastatic growth in the lung was inhibited by Tks5 knockdown, which is in keeping with our previously published findings with Src-3T3 cells [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Why do tumors fail to grow when they lack Tks5? We noted less proliferation and more apoptosis, as well as increased hypoxia, within the tumors. This could perhaps all be explained by the aberrant angiogenesis we noted, characterized by thinner and leakier vessels. It is well established that the primary stimulus for angiogenesis in tumors is VEGF [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. By immunohistochemistry, we detected a marked reduction in vessel-associated VEGF staining in the Tks5 knockdown tumors, which is consistent with the angiogenesis defects we observe, and also consistent with the concept of an angiogenic switch regulating tumor progression [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, we have not noticed a reduction of VEGF expression in response to Tks5 knockdown <italic>in vitro</italic> (not shown). Future experiments will seek to address the reason for the reduced angiogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>, by examining the tumorigenic properties of breast cancer cells expressing forms of Tks5 mutated to affect its binding to various effector proteins.</p><p>Are the effects we observed on tumor growth due to loss of invadopodia, or because of some other function of Tks5, independent of its activity as an invadopodia scaffold? At this point we suspect the former. For example, it is the long (&#x003b1;) form of Tks5 which is required for invadopodia formation [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and the expression of this form correlates with poorer disease outcome. Furthermore, while the literature equates the presence of invadopodia with the first steps of the metastatic cascade, in particular intravasation, loss of other invadopodia proteins such as cortactin [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and MT1-MMP [<xref rid="pone.0121003.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] also has an effect on tumor progression. While cortactin and MT1-MMP are not found exclusively at invadopodia, complicating interpretation of these experiments, these data also support the possibility that loss of invadopodia function is the common feature of the tumorigenesis experiments. This might in turn suggest that the control of pericellular proteolysis, a key function of invadopodia, is at the heart of the phenotypes we observe. In keeping with this, VEGF, and other cytokines are growth factors, are processed to their mature and active forms by extracellular proteases. We are currently investigating this possibility in both the 3D and tumor growth assays described here.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec024"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We find that the high expression of Tks5&#x003b1;, particularly in patients with stage I/II disease, is associated with a worse outcome, regardless of tumor subtype, particularly for those patients with late recurrence. RNA interference experiments showed that loss of Tks5 was associated with reduced tumor cell growth, both <italic>in vitro</italic> in 3D culture, and <italic>in vivo</italic> in orthotopic sites. Tks5 knockdown resulted in defective tumor angiogenesis, accompanied by reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis and necrosis of tumor cells. Taken together with reports from the literature on other invadopodia proteins, these data suggest that invadopodia play broader roles during tumor progression beyond intravasation and extravasation, to impact tumor growth. We speculate that the control of pericellular proteolysis, and subsequent effects on both protein processing and extracellular matrix degradation, might be the underlying mechanism.
