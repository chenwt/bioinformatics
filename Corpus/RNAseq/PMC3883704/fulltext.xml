Transposition is mutagenic and organisms have evolved mechanisms to repress the activity of their endogenous TEs. Transposition in somatic cells is very low, but recent evidence suggests that it may be derepressed in some cases, such as cancer development. We have found that during normal aging several families of retrotransposable elements (RTEs) start being transcribed in mouse tissues. In advanced age the expression culminates in active transposition. These processes are counteracted by calorie restriction (CR), an intervention that slows down aging. Retrotransposition is also activated in age-associated, naturally occurring cancers in the mouse. We suggest that somatic retrotransposition is a hitherto unappreciated aging process. Mobilization of RTEs is likely to be an important contributor to the progressive dysfunction of aging cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Aging</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>transposable elements</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Aging is the primary risk factor for multiple diseases that are responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality, including dementias, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer. While aging is clearly multi-factorial, an important driver is believed to be the accumulation of DNA damage and epigenetic changes that lead to genome instability over time, especially in disorders such as cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Genome integrity is maintained by multiple pathways involving the DNA damage response machinery and chromatin remodeling complexes. These pathways, which are normally highly efficient, begin to lose their effectiveness with age contributing to destabilization of the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Multiple environmental as well as endogenous sources of DNA damage have been documented. One potentially important mechanism impacting genome stability is the activation of endogenous transposable elements (TEs), which can result in insertional mutagenesis, DNA damage and genome rearrangements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>].</p><p>Approximately half of mammalian genomes are comprised of repetitive sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Among the several classes of repetitive sequences, the two most abundant are non-coding tandem repeats (centromeric satellites, telomeric repeats) and TEs. Over evolutionary time most TEs have acquired multiple mutations and are no longer active, however a small fraction retain the ability to transpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. The most prominent TEs in the mammalian genome are retrotransposable elements (RTEs), which transpose through an RNA intermediate that is reverse transcribed into DNA and inserted at new sites in the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. There are three major families of RTEs: the long terminal repeat (LTR) RTEs, which include retroviruses, the long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), and the short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs). LTR RTEs and LINEs are autonomous by virtue of encoding reverse transcriptase and other proteins required for the retrotransposition process, whereas SINEs are non-coding and exploit the machinery encoded by LINEs to transpose.</p><p>Because of their autonomous replication, RTEs are commonly viewed as molecular parasites of the genomes that they inhabit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. The role that RTEs play in the physiology as well as evolution of their host organisms has been widely debated. On the one hand, transposition can promote evolution by promoting genetic diversity, for example by creating new patterns of gene expression through processes such as promoter recruitment or alternative splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Conversely, transposition is often profoundly deleterious, leading to insertional mutagenesis, DNA damage and genome instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Excess or uncontrolled transposition is clearly deleterious, and several mechanisms by which cells can keep RTEs tightly repressed have been documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. The first line of defense is heterochromatinization of the elements in the genome to prevent their transcription. Expression of RTEs is also opposed by several small noncoding RNA mechanisms.</p><p>Much of what is known about RTEs reflects their activity in the germline, since transposition events in somatic tissues would not be inherited from generation to generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Until recently retrotransposition in the soma was thought to be quite rare. However, recent evidence indicates that it may occur much more frequently than previously believed, especially during early embryogenesis. One tissue where retrotransposition appears to be especially active is the nervous system: L1 mobilization was observed in neural progenitor cells during development as well as in adult neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], and frequent new L1 insertions were reported in adult brain tissue relative to other tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Another group, however, found very few insertions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. One pathological process that appears to frequently lead to RTE activation is the development of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>].</p><p>We recently reported that RTEs become derepressed and start actively transposing during replicative senescence of human fibroblasts in cell culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. In this communication we extend these studies to the investigation of aging mouse tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Aging mouse tissues display decreased sensitivity to nuclease digestion</title><p>Accumulating evidence indicates that chromatin structure and organization change profoundly during aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. We found that several marks of heterochromatin become more abundant in nuclei of human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs) undergoing replicative senescence in vitro, as well as in several mouse and primate tissues in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. To investigate the functional consequences of these changes we performed nuclease (DNase I) sensitivity assays, a well-established method to assess chromatin compaction in intact nuclei. Nuclei isolated from young (5 month) and old (36 month) mouse livers were incubated with increasing concentrations of DNase I. The resulting DNA size distributions revealed that the ratio of high to low molecular weight DNA was higher in the 36 month old liver nuclei at all DNase I concentrations, indicating that a higher proportion of DNA is resistant to nuclease digestion in this tissue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>DNase I sensitivity of chromatin in intact nuclei</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The ratio of high to low molecular weight DNA for liver nuclei was calculated following agarose gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>).

Nuclei isolated from young liver showed greater DNase I digestion, indicated by longer DNA &#x0201c;tails&#x0201d; (and larger extent tail moments) following electrophoresis, than liver nuclei from old animals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 2A</xref>). These results show that liver chromatin in young mice has more genomic regions that are accessible to DNase I digestion. Since heterochromatin is more compact, and more resistant to nuclease digestion, these results indicate that a greater proportion of chromatin is in a heterochromatic state in the liver of old animals. Overall, these experiments suggest that chromatin rearranges with age in the liver, causing previously open regions of the genome to become more heterochromatic.</p><p>Skeletal muscle nuclei showed the greatest increase in heterochromatin-associated proteins with age, in both mouse and baboon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. To determine if skeletal muscle undergoes a similar decrease in chromatin accessibility with age as seen in the liver, nuclei isolated from young (5 month), old (24 month), and very old (36 month) skeletal muscle were subjected it to DNase I digestion and analyzed using the Comet assay. As seen in liver, skeletal muscle nuclei showed increased resistance to DNase I digestion with age, as indicated by the smaller extent tail moment. The 36 month old animals displayed the highest degree of resistance to DNase I (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 2B</xref>). These results indicate that age-associated chromatin rearrangements, leading to a more nuclease resistant (and presumably more compact) state, occur also in terminally differentiated, postmitotic tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title>mRNA expression decreases with age</title><p>An overall increase in heterochromatin should be reflected by a commensurate decrease in RNA production. We therefore quantified the amount of mRNA in liver tissue of mice of varying ages. Using a biochemical purification based on polyA selection we found a decrease of 20% at 24 months which increased to almost 2-fold (42%) at 36 months (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). To confirm that these results were not affected by systematic changes during the extraction procedure, we used a different method of mRNA quantification, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with oligo-dT probes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>). We found a decrease of 10% at 24 months. These data were acquired by imaging large numbers of nuclei and are statistically significant. It is well known that patterns of gene expression change profoundly with age in a complex and tissue-dependent manner, with both upregulation and downregulation taking place at the individual gene level. The results presented here do not contradict these observations, but in addition indicate that overall steady-state mRNA pools decrease with age, an effect that becomes especially pronounced at very advanced age. To our knowledge this age-associated trend has not been noted before, and agrees closely with the increasing hetero-chromatinization.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Total mRNA expression in aging liver</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) mRNA content in liver tissue was quantified by purification with oligo-dT magnetic beads and normalized to input DNA.

The latter changes allow the transcription of RTEs that culminate in active transposition. To investigate whether these phenomena also occur in mammalian tissues <italic>in vivo</italic> we performed RNA-seq on livers of 5, 24 and 36 month old mice. We analyzed the transcription of L1 LINEs, the largest family of potentially active RTEs, which were also prominently activated in HDF, using a bioinformatic pipeline we recently developed for the analysis of repetitive sequences in high throughput DNA sequencing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. There are 118 L1 subfamilies annotated in the mouse genome (build mm9, <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.repeatmasker.org/">www.repeatmasker.org/</uri>) and we found that many of them showed increased expression with age (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">B</xref>).

SEs, which do not transpose, are localized mostly in the centromeric, pericentromeric and telomeric regions of the genome comprising a significant fraction of cellular constitutive heterochromatin. Even though SEs are in a repressed state, they are transcribed at low levels during development, differentiation and in response to stress, and the transcripts may be an important component of kinetochore assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. SEs became prominently derepressed in HDF after entry into senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. The RNA-seq analysis showed that likewise the majority of SE subfamilies became derepressed in mouse liver, with the largest changes occurring between 24 and 36 months (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p><p>To reinforce and extend these bioinformatic data, as we had done in our studies of HDF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>], we turned to direct quantitative RT-PCR analysis (qPCR) of representative RTE subfamilies of interest. While in humans the only RTEs that are autonomously active are the L1 LINEs, several subfamilies of LTR RTEs are active in the mouse genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Hence, in addition to L1s, which are the most abundant active RTEs, we investigated the LTR RTEs MusD/ETn, which our RNA-seq data indicated were activated with age. SINEs (such as Alu in humans) are non-autonomous, but can be mobilized by L1 in trans. Since SINE transcripts are not polyadenylated, and hence were not well represented in our RNA-seq dataset, we also examined B1 and B2, the two major SINE families in the mouse genome. Finally, we also assessed the major pericentromeric SEs MSAT. In liver L1 RNA was unchanged at 24 months and showed a statistically significant increase at 36 months (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). MusD, B1 and B2 showed an increase at 24 months and either a further increase (MusD) or small drop (B1, B2) at 36 months. MSAT showed a strong increase (5-fold) at 24 months and a further increase (11-fold) at 36 months. Using the same primers we found even more pronounced increases in muscle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), where in all cases RNA expression increased at 24 months with further increases at 36 months (MSAT showed a remarkable 90-fold increase at 36 months).</p><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>qPCR analysis of RNA expression of representative RTEs and SEs</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from (<bold>A</bold>) liver and (<bold>B</bold>) skeletal muscle, quantified by qPCR using indicated primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>) and normalized to GAPDH.

It is accomplished by the reduction of caloric intake to approximately 60% of a healthy diet without malnutrition. Even though it was recently reported that the ability of CR to increase the lifespan of non-human primates is somewhat ambiguous, it was shown to significantly increase the healthspan (the proportion of lifespan free of age-associated diseases and frailty) of these animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>].

We also examined the effect of CR on the transcription pericentromeric SEs. As seen with the RTEs, the upregulation of their transcription was attenuated in 24 month CR animals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), indicating the calorie restriction also delays the loss of constitutive hetero-chromatin in centromeric regions.

However, RNA expression is only the first step that may eventually lead to transposition, and several cellular defense mechanisms are known to be active downstream of RTE heterochromatinization. Hence, we used the same primers as in the RNA analysis in a sensitive multiplex qPCR assay of genomic DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] to quantify the relative copy numbers of L1 and MusD elements in the genome. As noted above, L1 expression was not increased in the liver of 24 month animals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), and as expected, we did not see an increase in L1 copy number at this age (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). We found however a significant increase in L1 expression at 36 months, and we also detected a strong increase in genomic L1 copy number at this age.</p><p>In skeletal muscle L1 expression was increased already at 24 months (&#x0003e; 3-fold) and remained high at 36 months of age (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). In this case we did not see an increase in copy number at 24 months (only a trend that was not statistically significant), but by 36 months there was a clear increase in copy number (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). We do not know the reason for this difference between the two tissues, but a delay between increased expression and transposition is not surprising. Not all L1 transcripts lead to new insertions, as the transposition process is inefficient and often leads to abortive events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Furthermore, additional barriers to retrotransposition, such as surveillance by the small interfering RNA pathways, likely require time to overcome. These mechanisms may also differ from one tissue to another. MusD is a LTR retrotransposon with approximately 100 copies in the mouse genome, of which three are believed to be active. MusD expression increased at 24 months in both liver and skeletal muscle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), but again without a notable increase in copy number at this age (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). At 36 months MusD expression increased further, and a significant increase in genome copy number was detectable at this time. These results are consistent with the delay we observed between RNA expression and transposition of L1 RTEs. As with L1, abortive transposition attempts could lead to double stranded breaks that affect overall genome stability.</p><fig id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>qPCR analysis of DNA to assess RTE genome copy number</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) L1; (<bold>B</bold>) MusD.

The gene-poor regions overlap significantly with lamin-associated domains (LADs), are marked by H3K9Me3, and replicate late during S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>].

Others have reported an overall loss of core histones in senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. It is currently not clear how these findings can be reconciled. Therefore, the apparent relaxation of heterochromatin in LADs and pericentromeres for the time being should be taken as being relative to the rest of the senescent cell genome, as we do not yet know the absolute values of LAD heterochromatin compaction between young and senescent cells.</p><p>Here we report similar chromatin changes taking place during the normal aging of two mouse tissues (liver, skeletal muscle) as we have previously documented in senescent cells in vitro. In addition, we have added two new analytical methods to those used previously: assessment of the sensitivity of chromatin to nuclease digestion in intact, permeabilized nuclei, and a quantification of the overall polyadenylated mRNA content per cell. By both measures the overall level of chromatin compactness increases with aging: nuclei become more resistant to nuclease (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), and the total levels of mRNA decrease (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). These trends are consistent with our previous findings of age-associated increases in the levels of a heterochromatin associated protein (macro H2A) in the same tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>].</p><p>Most notably, we have shown here that the expression of both RTEs and SEs increases with age in mouse tissues. As in human cells, we found increased expression of both LINEs and SINEs. The mouse genome is more permissive for retrotransposition than the human genome, and several families of LTR retrotransposons are known to be active in the mouse. In agreement, we found age-associated increases in the expression of the LTR RTE MusD. Importantly, we have also found that increased transcription of L1 and MusD elements is associated with significant increases in their copy numbers, which is indicative of active transposition. In the case of L1, the primers we used detect approximately 5,000 (mostly evolutionarily recent) elements; hence, a 2-fold increase in copy number detected with these primers would be consistent with approximately 5,000 new insertions throughout the mouse genome. Finally, as in human cells, the most pronounced changes, both in terms of relatively early onset as well as a large magnitude, were found in the expression of pericentromeric satellite sequences. Although these elements do not transpose, they are known to be heavily heterochromatinized. The magnitude of the changes seen in satellites suggests that aging in the mouse affects globally the compaction of constitutive heterochromatin.</p><p>The changes that affect RTEs and SEs in mouse tissues very closely resemble our recent data obtained in a cell culture model of replicative cellular senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. It is unlikely, however, that the <italic>in vivo</italic> activation of RTEs can be attributed wholly to senescent cells. First, senescent cells in normal tissues are quite rare even at advanced ages. Second, skeletal muscle is a tissue with one of the lowest reported frequencies of senescent cells, whose levels do not appreciably increase with aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. Skeletal muscle is composed predominantly (&#x0003e;90%) of terminally differentiated, postmitotic cells (myocytes). One interpretation of our findings is that chromatin changes and RTE mobilization are not a unique feature of cellular senescence, but can also occur in chronologically aging postmitotic tissues. In other examples, the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> LTR RTE Ty1 is mobilized during chronological aging of this species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>], and several <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> LINE and LTR RTEs become active in aging neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. Hence, the age-associated &#x0201c;loosening&#x0201d; of RTEs appears to be conserved and can be found in several postmitotic cell types. Another interpretation is that postmitotic cells can acquire some phenotypes typically associated with cellular senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>].</p><p>It has been suggested that transposition may be beneficial by promoting new patterns of gene expression that could lead to evolutionary bursts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. It has also been argued that somatic retrotransposition is likely to be overwhelmingly deleterious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. The destabilizing effects of RTEs are not solely due to insertional mutagenesis, as retrotransposition is accompanied by many incomplete events that result in DNA double strand breaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. In turn, the transcription of RTEs and SEs is activated by DNA damage and a variety of stresses, creating a strong potential for positive feedback loops of increasing genome instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>].</p><p>Until recently retrotransposition in the soma was thought to be quite rare; however, as methods to detect these events have improved, so have reports of their occurrence. Somatic L1 retrotransposition has been noted in mouse neural progenitor cells and in human adult brain tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Here we extend these findings by showing that retrotransposition increases strongly with advanced age. Retrotransposition occurs frequently during human cancer development, but to what extent this is causal is still debated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Our data here extend these reports by showing that RTE activation and mobilization also occurs in naturally occurring cancers in the mouse. This finding should pave the way to studying the functional role of retrotransposition in the development of cancer using a variety of mouse genetic models.</p><p>The most important finding presented here is the apparent activation of retrotransposition during normal aging. We suggest that somatic retrotransposition is a potentially important aging process that can affect many tissues, and that the mobilization of RTEs is likely to be a significant contributor to the progressive dysfunction of aging cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. Reverse transcriptase, the cornerstone of the retrotransposition process, can be pharmacologically inhibited. Several antiviral drugs widely used in the treatment of HIV and HBV infections have been found to inhibit the L1 reverse transcriptase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. Given the large amount of research in this area, new compounds directed specifically towards the L1 enzyme could likely be developed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Tissue specimens</title><p>Mouse tissues of strain C57BL/6 were obtained from the NIA Aged Rodent Tissue Bank (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dab/aged-rodent-tissue-bank-handbook">www.nia.nih.gov/research/dab/aged-rodent-tissue-bank-handbook</uri>), or collected in-house from mice obtained from the NIA Aged Rodent Colonies (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dab/aged-rodent-colonies-handbook">www.nia.nih.gov/research/dab/aged-rodent-colonies-handbook</uri>).</p></sec><sec id="s4_2"><title>Nuclease sensitivity</title><p>The DNase I sensitivity assay is a long-standing and well-established method to assess chromatin compaction in intact nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>].

The library sizes were determined using the total mapping reads from the same experimental samples mapped to the mm9 mouse genome using Tophat with the default parameters (multi-map reads and reads mapping to splice junctions are included in the estimate of library size).
