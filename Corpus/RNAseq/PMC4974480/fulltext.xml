WAT macrophages, however, differ in their origin, gene expression and activities: unlike infiltrating monocyte-derived inflammatory macrophages, WAT-resident macrophages counteract inflammation and insulin resistance, yet, the mechanisms underlying their transcriptional programming remain poorly understood. We recently reported that a nuclear receptor cofactor&#x02014;glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-interacting protein (GRIP)1&#x02014;cooperates with GR to repress inflammatory genes. Here, we show that GRIP1 facilitates macrophage programming in response to IL4 via a GR-independent pathway by serving as a coactivator for Kruppel-like factor (KLF)4&#x02014;a driver of tissue-resident macrophage differentiation. Moreover, obese mice conditionally lacking GRIP1 in macrophages develop massive macrophage infiltration and inflammation in metabolic tissues, fatty livers, hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance recapitulating metabolic disease. Thus, GRIP1 is a critical regulator of immunometabolism, which engages distinct transcriptional mechanisms to coordinate the balance between macrophage populations and ultimately promote metabolic homeostasis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

The causes of obesity-associated metabolic disease reflect a complicated interplay of genetic, environmental and social factors which ultimately disrupt the balance between energy intake and expenditure. Regardless of aetiology, obesity is associated with a state of chronic low-grade inflammation in different tissues, including white adipose tissue (WAT), liver and vascular endothelium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Indeed, the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)1&#x003b2; and chemokines (CCL2, CCL5) in disease pathogenesis is well established<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Numerous studies have highlighted the central role of AT-associated infiltrating macrophages (ATM&#x003a6;) in perpetuation of WAT inflammatory state eventually leading to systemic insulin resistance in mouse models and in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p><p>Notably, ATM&#x003a6; comprise diverse populations of cells that differ in their functional characteristics, phenotypic features, intracellular metabolic state and even developmental origin. Despite their inherent plasticity and ability to adjust phenotypes to different environmental cues, ATM&#x003a6; can be broadly categorized into monocyte-derived inflammatory, which have been historically referred to as &#x02018;classically activated' or &#x02018;M1' and the tissue-resident macrophages originally termed &#x02018;alternatively activated' or &#x02018;M2' (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Tissue-resident macrophages are derived directly from the yolk sac or foetal liver and present in both lean and obese WAT where they support adipose homeostasis, suppress inflammation and promote local insulin sensitivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Conversely, the monocyte-derived macrophages abundantly infiltrate WAT during obesity where they form ring-like structures around dying adipocytes and secrete inflammatory mediators<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. As pathology progresses, inflammatory macrophages engulf lipids released by necrotic adipocytes and undergo transformation into multinucleated giant cells that further exacerbate inflammation. These two macrophage populations are phenotypically distinct: although both are characterized by the surface markers cluster of differentiation (CD)11b and F4/80, inflammatory infiltrating macrophages express CD11c, whereas resident macrophages express predominantly CD206 (mannose receptor (MRC)1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. The key transcriptional networks in the two macrophage populations also differ: infiltrating macrophage transcriptome is dominated by nuclear factor (NF)&#x003ba;B which drives the production of inflammatory mediators<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, whereas resident macrophages are programmed by coordinated actions of STAT6, Kruppel-like factor (KLF)4 and a nuclear receptor (NR) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)&#x003b3;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Several cytokines and growth factors have been implicated in the programming of the two phenotypes: exposure to interferon &#x003b3; and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) shifts the balance towards inflammatory macrophages, whereas IL4 or IL13 stimulation leads to resident macrophages-like phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. In addition, IL10 and glucocorticoid hormones (GCs) induce macrophage transcriptomes <italic>in vitro</italic> similar to that programmed by IL4 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) consistent with the anti-inflammatory effects of these signals.</p><p>GCs in particular have long been known as modulators of macrophage properties: acting through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a transcription factor of the NR superfamily, they potently suppress macrophage-mediated inflammation by both activation of anti-inflammatory genes and direct repression of genes encoding inflammatory mediators<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. After hormone binding, GR translocates into the nucleus and either binds directly to specific palindromic DNA sequences known as GC response elements (GREs) or &#x02018;tethers' to DNA through protein&#x02013;protein interactions with other DNA-bound factors to ultimately modulate gene transcription. Although in each case GR can either activate or repress transcription depending on the GRE sequence and composition of other DNA-bound regulators, typically, binding to &#x02018;conventional' palindromic GREs leads to activation of associated genes, whereas GR tethering to AP1 or NF&#x003ba;B usually attenuates transcription of their target genes. GR elicits transcriptional changes by recruiting multiple cofactors that act on components of basal machinery or chromatin. From over 100 GR-interacting cofactors, the members of the p160 family&#x02014; SRC1/Ncoa1, GRIP1/TIF2/SRC2/Ncoa2 (hereafter, GRIP1) and SRC3/Ncoa3&#x02014;are well established primary coactivators that serve as binding platforms for numerous secondary cofactors, commonly, with chromatin-modifying and remodelling activities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. All three p160s are modular proteins which are recruited by ligand-activated GR to palindromic GREs via their conserved NR interaction domain and facilitate transcriptional activation via their activation domains (AD) 1 and 2.</p><p>Interestingly, GRIP1, unlike other p160s, can also function as a GR corepressor at tethering sites relying on a unique repression domain: lack of GRIP1 in macrophages profoundly altered their transcriptome leading to a defective GR-mediated transcriptional repression of numerous cytokine and chemokine genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Moreover, the conditional deletion of GRIP1 in macrophages sensitized mice to LPS-induced endotoxin shock<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> suggesting that GRIP1 is protective against systemic inflammation <italic>in vivo</italic> due to its unexpected inhibitory role in inflammatory macrophage activation. In contrast, the mechanisms of GC-induced homeostatic macrophage polarization <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> are not well described. Interestingly, we showed recently that <italic>Klf4</italic> in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) is strongly induced by GCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> suggesting that GR may promote homeostatic macrophage phenotype by inducing <italic>Klf4</italic> expression and, potentially, GRIP1 may contribute to this process by serving as a conventional GR coactivator.</p><p>Here, we report that GRIP1 promotes the induction of anti-inflammatory macrophages in a manner that is independent of its function as GR coregulator. We present data on the molecular mechanisms underlying this unexpected role of GRIP1 in primary macrophages and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Further, we report that a genetic conditional deletion of GRIP1 in macrophages <italic>in vivo</italic> impairs not only the homeostatic control of inflammatory macrophages, but also the maintenance of the tissue-resident macrophages resulting in a multi-symptom metabolic disease in the context of an obesity-induced model of metabolic challenge.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>GRIP1 is required for efficient macrophage activation by IL4</title><p>To investigate whether GRIP1 is involved in GR-mediated induction of <italic>Klf4</italic>, we first evaluated by quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT-qPCR) <italic>Klf4</italic> expression in BMDM from Mx1-Cre<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>; GRIP1<sup>fl/fl</sup> (wild type (WT)) and Mx1-Cre<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup>; GRIP1<sup>fl/fl</sup> (conditional knockout (cKO)) mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Following an 18-h activation of BMDM with IL4, we pulsed the resulting M(IL4) with synthetic GC Dexamethasone (Dex) and found the induction of <italic>Klf4</italic> in GRIP1-deficient macrophages to be modestly attenuated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Unexpectedly, relative to WT M2(IL4), the expression of <italic>Klf4</italic> was significantly reduced in cKO immediately following IL4-mediated activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>) suggesting a role of GRIP1 in <italic>Klf4</italic> induction that is GC- and, thus, GR-independent. Using genome-wide transcriptome analysis of untreated BMDM [M(con)] and differentiated M(IL4), we identified 1211 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate (FDR) corrected <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) and selected for further study genes strongly upregulated in M(IL4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>) consistent with previous results<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. As expected, <italic>Klf4</italic> was strongly induced along with a number of other M(IL4)-signature genes (<italic>P</italic>=3.67E-47 (EDGE R); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Given that KLF4 is a &#x02018;master regulator' of IL4-induced polarization and drives the expression of many M2-enriched genes, we compared the expression of such transcripts in WT and cKO macrophages: similar to <italic>Klf4</italic>, <italic>Pparg</italic>, <italic>Mrc1</italic>, <italic>Arginase1</italic> (<italic>Arg1</italic>) and <italic>Cd163</italic> were expressed at comparable levels in na&#x000ef;ve WT and GRIP1 cKO M(con) but considerably less induced by IL4 in absence of GRIP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Furthermore, KLF4 and PPAR&#x003b3; protein levels were also significantly reduced in the cKO M(IL4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) corroborating the RNA expression data. Interestingly, the impaired induction of the M(IL4) genes was not uniform as the expression of other genes reportedly typical of the homeostatic macrophage phenotype, for example, interferon regulatory factor 4 (<italic>Irf4</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, NF IL3-regulated (<italic>Nfil3</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> and Il4 receptor alpha (<italic>Il4ra</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, was unaffected by GRIP1 deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p>Because IL4 signals through STAT6 to alter gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, we assessed whether the IL4 signalling pathway was intact in GRIP1 cKO macrophages. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1e</xref> demonstrates that WT and cKO macrophages show equal expression of STAT6 as well as comparable STAT6 phosphorylation on activating Tyr641 in response to IL4 stimulation. Consistently, the induction of typical M(IL4) genes that are direct targets of STAT6 in GRIP1 cKO was similar to WT at early time points (up to 6&#x02009;h) of IL4 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>) but dropped progressively by 18&#x02013;24&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that GRIP1 facilitates the IL4-induced differentiation of M(IL4) at later time points by a mechanism that operates downstream of STAT6 activation.</p><p>To verify that the consequences of GRIP1 loss on M(IL4) polarization were strain-independent, we have created a new mouse strain, the LysM-Cre GRIP1 cKO, (Methods section and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>) in which GRIP1 was deleted specifically in the myeloid lineage. In BMDM from these mice, we observed a near complete loss of GRIP1 transcript and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>), whereas the expression of two other p160 family members, <italic>Src1</italic> and <italic>Src3</italic>, did not substantially differ between genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). Importantly, when these BMDM were polarized to the M(IL4) phenotype, the induction of <italic>Klf4</italic> was significantly attenuated relative to matching WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h</xref>) suggesting that a requirement for GRIP1 in M(IL4) differentiation is mouse strain-independent.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>GRIP1 serves as a KLF4 coactivator</title><p>Lack of GRIP1 led to an impaired induction of several known KLF4 target genes (for example, <italic>Arg1</italic>, <italic>Mrc1</italic>, <italic>Pparg</italic> and <italic>Klf4</italic> itself). Importantly, this defect was only apparent following a long-term macrophage exposure to IL4, that is, conditions under which the KLF4 protein, whose expression is initially activated by STAT6, accumulates in a cell to further enforce the M(IL4) cell fate commitment. Therefore, we reasoned that, perhaps, GRIP1 functions as a KLF4 coactivator directly participating in the transcriptional regulation of KLF4 target genes.</p><p>To explore this possibility, we first assessed whether GRIP1 and KLF4 are within the same protein complex. 293T cells were transfected with GRIP1- and Flag-tagged KLF4-expressing plasmids, whole-cell extracts (WCE) prepared and subjected to co-immunoprecipitation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, pulling down Flag-KLF4 co-precipitated GRIP1 and vice versa, whereas neither protein was precipitated with normal rabbit IgG control antibodies. To test for the interaction between endogenous GRIP1 and KLF4 in macrophage-like cells, WCE of J774A.1 mouse monocytic cells (untreated or treated with IL4 for 24&#x02009;h to induce KLF4 expression) were immunoprecipitated with anti-GRIP1 antibody or IgG as control, and blotted for KLF4. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, KLF4 protein level was indeed significantly higher in IL4-treated cells, and GRIP1 co-precipitated KLF4 under these conditions.</p><p>To test whether there is a direct physical interaction between GRIP1 and KLF4, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down experiments with purified proteins. Full-length GRIP1 (diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>) or, as control, another structurally similar member of the p160 family, SRC1, were <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed and translated and tested for their ability to bind His-tagged recombinant KLF4 immobilized on an affinity matrix. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>, GRIP1 but not SRC1 were retained by His-KLF4. GRIP1 is a modular protein with well-defined protein&#x02013;protein interaction domains: the N-terminal bHLH-PAS domain, the centrally located NR boxes responsible for NR binding, the C-terminal AD1 and AD2 that recruit histone modifiers and a repression domain which mediates GRIP1 ability to serve as a GR corepressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). To begin to evaluate the importance of individual GRIP1 regions in mediating the interaction with KLF4, we tested GRIP1 truncation mutants lacking a part or all of its C-terminal half including its transcriptional regulatory domains (N1007 and N765, respectively) or the N-terminal half including the bHLH/PAS domain (765C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). We found that both N1007 and N765 bound KLF4, whereas 765C did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>) suggesting that GRIP1:KLF4 interaction is mediated by the N-terminal portion of GRIP1.</p><p>Our protein&#x02013;protein interaction data, together with the functional studies pointing to the importance of GRIP1 in KLF4-driven gene expression, were consistent with an idea that GRIP1 may act as a KLF4 coactivator at a subset of KLF4 target genes in M(IL4). Our chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed expected KLF4 recruitment to the known KLF binding sites of the <italic>Klf4</italic> and <italic>Arg1</italic> genes in differentiated M(IL4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Strikingly, GRIP1 was co-recruited to the same KLF binding sites as KLF4 under IL4-polarizing conditions. As a specificity control, we treated M(con) with Dex, and found no GRIP1 occupancy above baseline at the KLF4 target <italic>Arg1</italic>, whereas the GRE of the classic GR target <italic>Fkbp5</italic> showed a dramatic Dex-dependent GRIP1 enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that GRIP1 is recruited to KLF4 target genes in M(IL4) consistent with a direct participation in the transcriptional programming of IL4-activated macrophages.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>WAT inflammation and M&#x003a6; phenotype switch in obese cKO</title><p>Tissue-resident macrophages contribute to the regulation of lipid homeostasis in part by carrying out fatty acid (FA) uptake and &#x003b2;-oxidation in tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.

Next, we quantified ATM&#x003a6; in SVF of HFD-fed mice by FACS based on their CD45&#x0002b;CD11b&#x0002b;F4/80&#x0002b; phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>; consistent with results of immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>), GRIP1 cKO mice had considerably higher percentage of ATM&#x003a6; in SVF compared with WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref>).</p><p>To better understand which cells are responsible for WAT inflammation observed in GRIP1 cKO mice, we purified by FACS the two ATM&#x003a6; subpopulations, the inflammatory CD11c&#x0002b; and homeostatic resident CD206&#x0002b;. Quantification of FACS data revealed a significant increase in the GRIP1 cKO CD206&#x0002b; resident population relative to that in WT; CD11c&#x0002b; cell frequency was also trending higher in the cKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref>), even though this result is an underestimate of the CD11c&#x0002b; cell accumulation because lipid-filled foam cells derived from inflammatory CD11c&#x0002b; ATM&#x003a6; are expected to be lost in the lipid fraction during SVF purification. The analysis of total RNA from both populations showed a near complete loss of <italic>Grip1</italic> confirming the efficiency of deletion <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h</xref>). The expression of <italic>Tnf</italic> in GRIP1 cKO infiltrating CD11c&#x0002b; was dramatically increased relative to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h</xref>) in line with an increase observed in total eWAT.

Thus, under conditions of HFD, GRIP1-deficient tissue-resident anti-inflammatory macrophages were undergoing a phenotypic switch <italic>in vivo</italic> towards a more inflammatory cell type.</p><p>To better gauge the extent of inflammatory response that was occurring in the WAT of the cKO, we used low-yield RNAseq protocol (Methods section) to evaluate CD11c&#x0002b; macrophage transcriptome in the remaining RNA from WT and cKO infiltrating macrophages. Read distribution near GRIP1 Ex10 and 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3i</xref>) confirmed near complete deletion of GRIP1 Ex11 consistent with the originally reported GRIP1 whole-body KO (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). We performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to compare expression profiles of the 7,260 identified genes in the WT and cKO CD11c&#x0002b; macrophages and identify specific affected sets. This analysis revealed a remarkable upregulation of genes associated with inflammation and interferon response in GRIP1 cKO macrophages. The top three enriched sets (FDR, <italic>q</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) included TNF signaling via NFkB (MSigDB, M5890), interferon gamma response (M5913) and interferon alpha/beta signaling (M973) followed by several gene sets enriched in inflammation and inflammatory disorders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3j</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Only few enriched gene sets among top 50 with FDR <italic>q</italic>&#x0003c;0.1 were not directly linked to inflammation indicating that GRIP1-deficient eWAT infiltrating macrophages are not only present in greater numbers but are also more activated relative to their WT counterparts, consistent with the previously described role of GRIP1 as an inhibitor of inflammatory response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Obese GRIP1 cKO mice develop liver inflammation and steatosis</title><p>Prolonged HFD exposure in humans induces liver steatosis, a manifestation of NAFLD that is frequently associated with obesity and insulin resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>.

Importantly, despite lack of significant differences in liver weights between WT and cKO HFD-fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), a dramatic change in the overall liver morphology with disrupted architecture of hepatocytes and accumulation of large droplet-like structures was apparent in the cKO even following H&#x00026;E staining or F4/80 immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Indeed, the Oil red-O staining of neutral lipids in frozen liver sections from cKO mice revealed striking lipid accumulation compared with WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). This was further supported by the quantitative analysis of the size distribution of lipid droplets in Oil red-O-stained liver slices (Methods section), which confirmed a predominance of large lipid droplets in cKO relative to WT consistent with &#x02018;fatty liver'-like pathology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). As expected, gene expression analysis showed no increase in the abundance of CD68 considered to be a marker of Kupffer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, whereas the levels of inflammatory mediators (<italic>Tnf</italic> and <italic>Ccl2</italic>) were augmented in cKO livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Interestingly, despite a substantial deletion of GRIP1 in hepatocytes of cKO, the expression of genes involved in glucose and fat metabolism (<italic>Gck</italic>, <italic>G6p</italic>, <italic>Lpl</italic>, <italic>Fasn</italic> and <italic>Lipg</italic>) remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>) supporting the idea that the metabolic phenotype of GRIP1 cKO mice is due to the exacerbated HFD-induced chronic inflammation. Of note, liver morphology and the expression of inflammatory mediators and metabolic enzymes in livers of age-matched chow-fed mice was comparable between the two genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5d,e</xref>) suggesting that the inflammatory status of GRIP1 cKO within the time-frame examined is driven by the HFD.

To assess the metabolic status of our HFD-fed mice, we monitored glucose levels in WT and GRIP1 cKO mice during <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding and after overnight starvation. WT mice displayed normal blood glucose levels which dropped following overnight fasting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4c,d</xref>, Methods section and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 3&#x02013;5</xref>). In contrast, GRIP1 cKO mice were hyperglycemic at baseline and, strikingly, displayed no apparent response to overnight starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4c-d</xref>, Methods section and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 3&#x02013;5</xref>). To determine whether GRIP1 deficiency results in impaired ability to lower the blood glucose level, we performed a glucose tolerance test (GTT). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b,c</xref>, GRIP1 cKO mice had significantly elevated glucose levels after challenge relative to WT over the course of several hours. Moreover, serum insulin levels in HFD-fed GRIP1 cKO mice were also significantly increased compared with those in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). In an insulin tolerance test, injection of hyperglycemic cKO mice led to an eventual drop of glucose levels down to those seen in WT, but immediate reversal back to hyperglycaemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Thus, at 20 week of HFD, cKO were still transiently responsive to exogenously provided insulin, but endogenous elevated levels of insulin were insufficient to counteract hyperglycaemia. To assess whether WT and cKO mice display a difference in response to acute insulin administration in metabolic tissues, we injected HFD-fed mice with insulin and harvested their eWAT and muscle 10&#x02009;min later to evaluate the Thr308 phosphorylation of Akt&#x02014;a downstream kinase in the insulin signalling pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f</xref>, there was no detectable difference in Akt phosphorylation between genotypes in control (PBS-injected) mice despite baseline hyperinsulinemia of GRIP1 cKO, and insulin-injected WT mice displayed a significantly higher level of pAkt in eWAT and muscle. Strikingly, no apparent difference in Akt phosphorylation was seen in insulin-injected cKO relative to control mice, consistent with insulin resistance of these tissues. In contrast, at 20-week time point, no significant difference in plasma levels of free FA (FFA), triglycerides and corticosterone&#x02014;an endogenous GC that is known to promote insulin resistance&#x02014;were seen in WT versus cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5g</xref>).</p><p>As expected, WT and cKO mice fed normal chow showed similar fed and fasted blood glucose levels, identical glucose tolerance and comparable serum levels of insulin, FFA and triglycerides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>, Methods section and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 3&#x02013;5</xref>).

In contrast, the complex biology behind different populations of tissue-resident macrophages, in part due to their diversity, remains much less defined. Here we describe the function of a transcriptional coregulator which, in addition to its established role as a suppressor of inflammatory gene transcription, enables the optimal function of a key driver of the homeostatic macrophage phenotype.</p><p>Indeed, our <italic>in vitro</italic> and cell culture-based studies define GRIP1 as a classic KLF4 coactivator that physically binds KLF4 in cells and cell-free systems, is recruited in conjunction with KLF4 to KLF binding sites of known KLF4 target genes in M(IL4), and whose loss attenuates the expression of several genes known to be KLF4 targets, including, notably, the <italic>Klf4</italic> gene itself.</p><p>Interestingly, the absence of GRIP1 attenuated the expression of some M(IL4)-enriched genes but not others, and in our analysis thus far, only those genes that are reportedly direct targets of KLF4, rather than those of STAT6, were affected. This is also consistent with our data demonstrating that GRIP1 cKO macrophages retain normal IL4 signalling cascade and the induction of STAT6 target genes following brief IL4 exposure suggesting that both were GRIP1-independent.</p><p>KLF4 and other members of the KLF family of transcription factors are expressed in a highly tissue-selective manner and have been implicated in a variety of biological processes from reproduction and development to metabolism and regulation of cell death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. All KLFs share three C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>-type Zn-finger motifs at their highly conserved C-terminal domains which are responsible for sequence-specific DNA binding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. Their N-terminal regions are variable in size and sequence and were used to classify KLF proteins into three subfamilies: KLFs 3, 8 and 12 (group 1) typically repress gene transcription by binding to the C-terminal binding proteins (CtBP); KLFs 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7 (group 2) share the N-terminal acidic ADs and typically act as transcriptional activators; KLFs 9, 10, 11, 13, 14 and 16 (group 3) can repress transcription through the N-terminal Sin3a-interacting domain but are also capable of acting as transactivators<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. Further studies are needed to define the GRIP1-binding domain in KLF4, however, considering the high homology between group 2 KLFs, there is a formal possibility that GRIP1 interacts with other members of the KLF family acquiring a range of biological activities in a tissue-specific manner. KLF4 itself, in addition to its key role in macrophage activation, has been implicated in intestinal epithelial homeostasis acting as a tumour suppressor in colon cancer; furthermore, it promotes adipogenesis at early stages of adipocyte differentiation and is a critical factor in generating iPS cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>. It is tempting to speculate that the GRIP1:KLF4 interaction could potentially mediate KLF4 transcription programs in a cell- and context-specific manner.</p><p>Interestingly, GCs promote macrophage polarization programme <italic>in vitro</italic> resembling that elicited by IL4 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). In that regard, it is noteworthy that KLF4, is strongly induced by GCs (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>). Taking into consideration the established function of GRIP1 as a GR coactivator, our data are consistent with a model whereby pathways triggered by distinct stimuli functionally converge to initiate overlapping gene expression programs through a shared coregulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>; right). This model is further corroborated by colocalization of genomic GR and KLF binding sites, including those in the vicinity of the <italic>Klf4</italic> promoter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> and by an earlier observation that GR and KLF4 regulate partially overlapping sets of genes during epidermal barrier establishment in embryogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>. Furthermore, although the GRIP1 KLF4-binding region remains to be refined, GRIP1 may interact with GR (via NR box-3) and KLF4 (through the GRIP1 N-terminal region) simultaneously, perhaps within the same DNA:protein complex. This scenario appears plausible because <italic>in vivo</italic>, cells are likely to be exposed to IL4 and GCs at the same time, each signal promoting a specific part of the tissue-resident macrophage gene expression programme.</p><p><italic>In vivo</italic>, GRIP1 deficiency in macrophages resulted in a metabolic syndrome-like disease when mice were challenged with HFD. Indeed, obese GRIP1 cKO mice displayed enhanced macrophage infiltration in eWAT and liver, increased production of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators in WAT and liver, and a general shift of homeostatic eWAT-resident macrophages towards more inflammatory phenotype as evidenced by enhanced expression of TNF, CCL2 and IL6 and blunted expression of KLF4. Importantly, consistent with loss of GRIP1 affecting both pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophage populations, our genome-wide transcriptome analysis of infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages revealed their striking hyper-inflammatory phenotype whereby virtually every gene set over-represented in the cKO was linked to inflammation. We have previously identified GRIP1 as a corepressor for GR controlling the production of numerous inflammatory mediators<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, hence, deregulated monocyte-derived macrophage activation in GRIP1 cKO is likely to result in part from the loss of this homeostatic control mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>, left).</p><p>This inflammatory state by 20 weeks of HFD resulted in the NAFLD-like changes in the liver with striking lipid accumulation, and, systemically, in fed and fasting hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinemia and glucose intolerance all of which are indicative of developing insulin resistance. Indeed, although exogenous insulin transiently lowered blood glucose in GRIP1 cKO mice down to WT levels, the insulin signalling pathway in eWAT and muscle, as assessed by Akt phosphorylation, was no longer responsive, suggesting that these mice are likely to progress to a more severe resistance over time, similar to a human condition. We predict that in a time-frame of longer than 20 weeks of HFD used in this study, WT mice will ultimately succumb to glucose intolerance and steatotic liver, however, the absence of GRIP1 in myeloid cells dramatically accelerates this process.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe a direct role of a p160 coregulator in immunometabolism. GRIP1 was evaluated over a decade ago in total body KO mice which were reportedly protected from HFD-induced obesity, displayed reduced FA uptake and increased lipolysis in WAT, as well as enhanced adaptive thermogenesis in BAT. These effects were attributed to a possible role of GRIP1 in adipocytes as a coactivator for PPAR&#x003b3; (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>). The apparent striking difference in the phenotype of the myeloid cell GRIP1 cKO is not entirely unexpected. In fact, the well-known diabetogenic systemic effects of GCs mediated by GR function in WAT and liver are in sharp contrast with the anti-inflammatory effects of GCs in macrophages. It is also notable that &#x02018;fatty livers' in our GRIP1 cKO mice develop in the absence of appreciable change in the expression of liver metabolic enzymes. This phenotype is quite different from that caused by the hepatocyte-specific GRIP1 deletion which led to dramatic changes in liver enzyme expression on fasting<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>. These findings further underscore that in our GRIP1 cKO, the disease is caused primarily by macrophage-driven chronic inflammation rather than an intrinsic metabolic defect. They also suggest that future drug design efforts focused on tissue-selective therapeutics perhaps hold a greater promise than those aimed at systemic side effect-free compounds.</p><p>Collectively, our studies show the importance of GRIP1 in homeostatic macrophage activation and function. They suggest that GRIP1 relies on two distinct mechanisms in different macrophage populations to ensure metabolic health in face of HFD challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). Specifically, GRIP1 serves to restrain the transcription of inflammatory mediators by monocyte-derived macrophages and their infiltration of metabolic tissues, and, at the same time, it cooperates with GR, and more prominently, KLF4, to enforce the homeostatic transcription programme in tissue-resident macrophages. Given the importance of the immunomodulatory effects of tissue-resident myeloid cells in vascular homeostasis and wound healing, our data have broad implications for numerous inflammatory conditions beyond metabolic disease.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Statistical analysis for organ weight and blood glucose data</title><p>All data were presented as Mean&#x000b1;s.d.
