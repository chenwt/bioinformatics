Genes expressed in the photoreceptor lineage were marked with H3K4me3 in the Cd73-positive cell fraction; however, the level of H3K27me3 was very low in both Cd73-positive and -negative populations. H3K27me3 may be involved in spatio-temporal onset of a subset of bipolar-related genes. Subsets of genes expressed in amacrine and retinal ganglion cells, which are early-born retinal cell types, were suggested to be maintained in a silent state by H3K27me3 during late-stage retinogenesis. In the outer nuclear layer, upregulation of Rho and rod-related genes were observed in Ezh2-ablated retina, suggesting a role for H3K27me3 in the maintenance of proper expression levels. Taken together, our data on the transition of lineage-specific molecular signatures during development suggest that histone methylation is involved in retinal differentiation and maintenance through cell lineage-specific mechanisms.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The vertebrate neural retina is organized into a laminar structure comprised of six types of neurons and glial cells, M&#x000fc;ller glia, and astrocytes. Rod photoreceptors form the outer nuclear layer (ONL) together with the cone. In the inner nuclear layer (INL), interneurons such as horizontal, amacrine, and bipolar cells are found in addition to the M&#x000fc;ller glia cell body. In the mouse, these major retinal cell classes are generated from a common population of multipotent retinal progenitor cells between embryonic day (E) 11 and postnatal day (P) 10 in a conserved temporal order<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), amacrine cells, cone photoreceptors, and horizontal cells differentiate at relatively early stages, primarily before birth, while bipolar cells and rod photoreceptors are mainly generated at later stages after birth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.</p><p>As in other tissues, epigenetic mechanisms play pivotal roles in retinal health and diseases. DNA methylation had been well-documented in retinal development and is involved in diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and retinoblastoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Methylation of basic amino acids in histone proteins is a crucial epigenetic mechanism for gene expression regulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Failed histone methylation is a cause of various diseases, including cancer. Retinal development is also regulated by various histone modifications. The dynamics of various histone markers in chromatin organization of mouse rod photoreceptors during development has been reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Ehmt2/Kmt1c/G9a, a histone H3K9/K27 demethylase, is essential for the differentiation and survival of retinal cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Nrl ChIP sequence revealed that Nrl bound to Kdm5b gene, a histone H3K4 demethylase, and loss of function analysis supported the importance of Kdm5b in rod maintenance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p><p>The di- and tri-methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me2/3) by Ezh2/Kmt6 together with polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a gene repression mechanism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. We focused on the roles of H3K27me3 during retinal development. Based on loss of function analyses of Ezh2 and Jmjd3, we reported that H3K27me3 modification in Bhlhb4 and Vsx2 genes is critical for the maturation of PKC- and Recoverin-positive bipolar cell subsets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. INL-specific expression of Jmjd3 plays a role in the cell lineage specific function of H3K27me3. Interestingly, examination of the detailed expression pattern of Ezh2 and Jmjd3 during retinal development also showed striking differential expression patterns of Ezh2 between the ONL and INL during retinal development, suggestive of the differential roles of the H3K27 methylation system in cell lineages in the ONL and INL. H3K4 methylation is one of the most well-studied histone methylation patterns, and it acts positively on the transcription of target genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Previous studies examining the comprehensive genomic map using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIPseq) showed that genes expressed in mature rod photoreceptors have a unique signature of <italic>de novo</italic> H3K4me2 accumulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p><p>Therefore, it is important to analyze histone modifications in a cell type-specific manner, especially in segregating rod and other cell types. In mouse, rod commitment occurs on embryonic day 12 (E12) to postnatal day 7&#x02013;8 (P7&#x02013;8), and differentiation peaks after birth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. We purified rod and photoreceptor precursors using the specific expression of Cd73<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> from mouse retina at P2, P5, and P8. From the same retinal samples, we also purified a Cd73-negative population consisting of interneurons, M&#x000fc;ller glia, and RGCs. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and ChIPseq for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 were performed. We found that cell lineage- and genes-specific modifications of histones during retinal development.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>The outer nuclear layer (ONL) and inner nuclear layers (INL) are differentially affected by the loss of histone H3K27 methylation in Ezh2 knockout mice during retinal development</title><p>We previously examined the phenotype of retina-specific Ezh2 conditional knockout mice (Ezh2-CKO) and found that the thickness of Ezh2-CKO retina was comparable to control retina during the embryonic period but decreased slightly after birth; the reduction became prominent at around P6<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. To examine the molecular signatures of ONL and other cells separately in this mouse model, we performed flow cytometry using Cd73, which is specifically expressed in precursor and mature rod photoreceptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Cd73 expression was observed from E18 by RT-PCR, and Cd73 protein was detectable from P1 by flow cytometry<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. We performed RNAseq using purified Cd73-positive (P)- and CD73-negative (N)-populations of Ezh2-CKO retina and processed the obtained sequence data as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>. We used P12 mouse retinas because at this stage, photoreceptors begin to degenerate in the mutant retina, and the expression of gene subsets in bipolar cells and photoreceptors, both of which differentiate during later stages of retinal development, is apparent.</p><p>Global changes in gene expression in Ezh2-CKO showed a large number of upregulated genes in the Cd73N population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). However, fewer genes were upregulated in the Cd73P population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>), which is in accordance with the low expression level of Ezh2 in the Cd73P population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Only some genes were commonly upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>) or downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>) between the Cd73P and Cd73N populations. We listed the top 15 genes upregulated in the Cd73N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>) and Cd73P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>) fractions, and M&#x000fc;ller glia-related genes, such as <italic>Apoe, Dkk3, Rlbp1, Dbi,</italic> and <italic>Slc1a3</italic>, were enriched in the Cd73N list. The majority of the genes in the Cd73P list were known rod-specific genes. We next examined protein expression of Rho and Rcvrn, which were upregulated in the Cd73P population in Ezh2-CKO retina, by immunostaining. Rhodopsin and Rcvrn showed stronger signals in Ezh2-CKO retina than in control retina at all examined developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h</xref>). Since previous studies indicated that overexpression of Rho leads to photoreceptor degeneration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, we hypothesized that elevated expression of Rho may play a role in the degeneration of ONL in Ezh2-CKO. Taken together, different roles were thought to be involved in the reduction of INL and ONL in Ezh2-CKO, supporting the importance of independent histone methylation analysis of INL and ONL.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Comprehensive analysis of gene expression patterns in rod photoreceptors and other cells during retinal development, using Cd73-based cell fractionation, and classification of genes according to their expression patterns</title><p>To examine the molecular signature of ONL and other cells independently during the postnatal period of mouse retina, which is a critical period for late-born retinal subset development, we purified Cd73P and Cd73N cell fractions from mouse retina at P2, P5, and P8; the purified cell fractions were designated as Cd73 positive cells (Cd73PC) and Cd73 negative cells (Cd73NC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We also prepared whole retinas at E15 and E18, which consisted of mostly progenitor cells and early-born retinal subtypes such as retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), cone, and horizontal cells. These cell fractions were then subjected to RNAseq to obtain a comprehensive gene expression pattern. To verify the RNAseq results for analysis of cell lineage molecular signatures, we categorized the list of genes (19,954 genes) into 15 distinct clusters using K-means according to their expression patterns obtained using GeneSpring (Agilent Technologies) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 1a</xref>). Approximately 7,000 genes were not expressed in any stage or subset of the retina (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 1a</xref>, C2 cluster), and we analyzed all clusters (excluding C2) based on gene ontology (GO) analysis. GO terms with &#x0003c;0.25 Benjamini values were chosen, and hierarchical clustering using -log10 p-values by DAVID analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> identified roughly five major groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 1b</xref>). Genes in group 1 (C1, C3) were expressed highly in retinal progenitors and decreased rapidly in Cd73P photoreceptors after birth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 1a</xref>). These genes were mostly correlated with cell cycle and proliferation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>, C1, and C3), suggesting that cell cycle-related genes disappear rapidly when cells are committed to rod photoreceptor differentiation. The GO terms of group 2 (C5, C12) were related to translation and metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table S1, C5, C12</xref>), suggesting that genes involving basic physiological activities were maintained at high expression levels regardless of the developmental stage or cell type. Group 5 genes (C7, C13) were characterized by high expression in rod photoreceptors; a number of light- and vision-related GO terms were found in this group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table S1</xref>, C7, and C13).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Genes specifically expressed in rod photoreceptors were classified according to their expression pattern</title><p>We next focused on genes specifically expressed in rod photoreceptors and directly compared genes between Cd73P and Cd73N populations at each stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a&#x02013;c</xref>). First, we examined the expression patterns of several genes reported to belong to certain retinal cell-specific gene subsets and found differential expression of these genes between the cell fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 2a</xref>). We then chose the genes that were expressed more highly in Cd73PC than Cd73NC or <italic>vice versa</italic>, with 1.5-fold changes in the absolute values at each stage designated as upregulated or downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a&#x02013;c</xref>). Overlap of genes specific in Cd73 positive cells (Cd73PG) at P2, P5, and P8 was examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>), and the genes were categorized into four groups according to their expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). The first group (Cd73PG_A) contained genes expressed specifically in Cd73PC from P2, maintained at high expression levels in Cd73PC at P5 and P8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>,f). The second group contained genes expressed from P5 in Cd73PC (Cd73PG_B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>,g), and the third contained genes that were expressed in Cd73C at P8 (Cd73PG_C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>,h). Genes expressed in Cd73PC at P2 but that then decreased in the following developmental stages were categorized as group D (Cd73PG_D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>,i).</p><p>GO analysis indicated that group A genes were highly enriched in vision functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table S2A</xref>). In classes B, C, and D, there were GO terms unrelated to vision functions, and no terms showed significantly low Benjamini values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table S2B&#x02013;D</xref>), suggesting that the roles of these genes in retinal development have not been shown previously.</p><p>Then, we verified the expression of the Cd73PG_A genes with low fold changes, i.e., less than a 2.0-fold difference between Cd73PC and Cd73NC, in the RNAseq data. There were 12 genes with less than a 2.0-fold difference at two or all three of the stages. We examined the expression patterns of these genes by qPCR in newly prepared triplicate samples of Cd73P and Cd73N cell fractions at P2, P5, and P8. In addition, Crx, which is a critical photoreceptor-specific gene and showed less than a 2.0-fold change at P5, was included for validation. All cases, except for one, showed statistically significant differential expression between Cd73P and Cd73N cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 2b&#x02013;d</xref>), justifying the use of a 1.5-fold threshold.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>ChIP sequencing (ChIPseq) of histone H3K4 and H3K27 trimethylation using Cd73P and Cd73N cell fractions revealed high H3K4me3 and low H3K27me3 levels at photoreceptor-specific gene loci</title><p>To analyze the involvement of histone methylation in lineage- and stage-specific gene expression patterns of the retina, we assessed H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 genomic occupancy by ChIPseq using the Cd73PC and Cd73NC fractions from P2, P5, and P8 retina. We first examined the average levels of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in Cd73PG and Cd73NG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2j</xref>,k). Average cumulative signals of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 at +/&#x02212;5 kb of the transcription start site (TSS) of Cd73PG or Cd73NG at each stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a&#x02013;c</xref>) were calculated and shown as a box plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2j</xref>,k). The H3K4me3 level of Cd73PG was significantly higher in Cd73PC than Cd73NC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2j</xref>), suggestive of a positive correlation between the H3K4me3 level and gene expression level. The H3K27me3 level in Cd73PG loci was low in all samples and slightly lower in Cd73NC than in Cd73PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2k</xref>, left panel). In contrast, H3K27me3 in Cd73NG showed higher levels in Cd73PC than in the Cd73N population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2k</xref>, right panel), suggesting that Cd73N-specific genes are suppressed in the Cd73P population by H3K27me3 markers.</p><p>To examine the relationship between the transition in expression of photoreceptor-related genes and histone modifications, we directly compared the gene expression levels and H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 modification levels of Cd73PG_A genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 3a,b</xref>).

H3K27me3 level was significantly lower in Cd73PG_A loci both in Cd73PC and Cd73NC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 3a</xref>), with a few exceptions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 3a</xref>, insets). Strong signals were observed at each gene locus in both Cd73PC and Cd73NC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 3c</xref>), but the signal patterns were slightly different (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 3d</xref>), suggesting that different machinery incorporates H3K27me3 at the same gene locus in different cell lineages.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Positive correlation of H3K4me3 levels with the expression levels of photoreceptor-specific genes in the Cd73P cell fraction</title><p>To examine the roles of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 gene expression in more detail, we performed hierarchical clustering of Cd73PG_A by using values of histone H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 of Cd73PC and Cd73NC at P2, P5, and P8. We found that there were roughly nine different sub-clusters in Cd73PG_A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 4a</xref>). Although we did not consider expression levels for clustering, genes in the same sub-clusters showed strikingly similar expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>), suggestive of a contribution of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in gene expression patterns. H3K4me3 levels in some sub-groups were very low, suggesting that H3K4me3 modification contributes to the high expression of photoreceptor-related genes, but only in limited cases.</p><p>We then explored H3K4 and H3K27 methylation levels in embryonic retina using published H3K4me2 and H3K27me3 ChIPseq data from E17 and P1 whole retina<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.

We first examined expression patterns of genes categorized as bipolar-, amacrine-, or RGC-specific in a previous report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> using our RNA sequence data of Cd73PC and Cd73NC. To explore the Cd73N-specific expression of genes, we calculated relative expression levels of each gene in Cd73NC to that in Cd73PC, and clustered genes according to their expression pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 4b,c</xref>). A cluster of genes that did not show higher expression in Cd73PC than in Cd73NC were excluded from further analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 4b,c</xref>, grey colored clusters). Remaining genes in each subclass were designated as BipolarG, AmacrineG, and RGCG. We then compared expression levels versus H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 levels for these genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 6a&#x02013;c</xref>). Gene expression and H3K4me3 levels showed a positive relationship in most cases in Cd73NC. Levels of H3K27me3 were scattered and had weak or no correlation with gene expression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 6</xref>). Hierarchical clustering of genes according to H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 levels yielded sub-clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 4e&#x02013;g</xref>), and again (as in the case of Cd73PG_A, although we did not include information on expression levels for the clustering) sub-clusters showed their specific characteristic gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a&#x02013;c</xref>). A variety of H3K27me3 patterns were observed among subclusters.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>BipolarG genes may include targets of the H3K27me3 demethylase Jmjd3</title><p>H3K27me3 levels of BipolarG_C3 were high, excluding Cd73NC in the P8 population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), and C3 contained <italic>Bhlhb4</italic>, which was previously identified as a target of Jmjd3, suggesting that these genes are de-methylated by Jmjd3, which was expressed specifically in postnatal INL<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. A heat map of H3K27me3 tracks around the TSS of each gene showed that the number of genes in bipolar C3 have strong modifications in both Cd73PC and Cd73NC fractions at P2 around TSS and disappeared in Cd73NC at P8 corresponding to the stage of bipolar cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>), suggesting these genes are additional direct targets of Jmjd3. Genome browser patterns clearly indicated a loss of H3K27me3 peaks around TSS in bipolar C3-related genes in the Cd73NC fraction at P8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Genes related to early-born amacrine and RGC subsets showed high H3K27me3 levels</title><p>AmacrineG_C2 showed high levels of H3K27me3 in all samples (especially P5 and P8), which may contribute to the low expression level of the genes in P5 and P8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figs 4</xref>b and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5</xref>a,c). Since amacrine is an early developing subtype, genes were likely turned off after differentiation was complete. Similarly, RGCG_C1 showed high H3K4me3 levels in both Cd73NC and Cd73PC, but high levels of K27me3 in Cd73PC, probably to suppress the expression of these genes in Cd73PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). RGCG_C2 genes had conspicuously high H3K27me3 levels in Cd73P, highlighting the importance of turning these genes off in Cd73P cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). In addition, H3K27me3 levels in Cd73NC were low for RGCG_C2 genes compared with those in Cd73PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figs 4</xref>c and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5</xref>a,d), suggesting that maintaining high expression levels of these genes is important for RGC functioning. This observation is in agreement with the high expression levels of Jmjd3 in RGC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. More than 30% of genes categorized as amacrine- and RCG-specific were upregulated in both the Cd73PC and Cd73NC fractions of Ezh2-CKO retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Several transcription factors are expressed almost exclusively in RGCs, such as Dlx1/2, Pou4f, Irx, and Gfl1 family members<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. We examined the H3K27me3 modifications associated with these gene loci; surprisingly, very weak signals were seen in the Cd73NC fraction, but very strong signals were seen in the Cd73PC fraction at P2, as well as in both fractions at P8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>). However, the expression levels were not augmented in Ezh2-KO retina, suggesting that methylases other than Ezh2, probably Ezh1, are responsible for the high H3K27me3 levels at these gene loci.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this report, we analyzed the changes in the molecular signatures of Cd73P photoreceptors and other retinal cells that were Cd73N cells during a critical differentiation period in retina. The data include gene expression and histone modification patterns in these cell lineages at different developmental time points. Such multi-dimensional datasets of primary tissue can be used to analyze cell lineage-specific molecular events during differentiation. Previous studies using photoreceptor-specific knockout mice revealed many molecular aspects that occur specifically in photoreceptor lineages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Our data further revealed and highlighted the dynamics of photoreceptors, as well as other retinal neuron-specific events by direct comparison of molecular events in photoreceptors and other cells. This is a powerful approach to analyze cell lineage-specific molecular events; however, we need to be careful of the risk of artifacts introduced by cell sorting, although we performed cell sorting quickly at the expense of purity. For lineage-specific analysis of the Cd73N population, which is a mixture of a few cell lineages, we need to isolate the individual cell lineages, but so far the appropriate cell surface antigens have not been identified. However, we previously used an anti-Isl1 antibody to purify cells for ChIP qPCR application, and we are currently investigating applicable antibodies for use in isolating other cell lineages for this purpose.</p><p>Previous studies observed strong H3K4me2 signals at the loci of rod-specific genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. We found that photoreceptor-specific gene loci were also marked by H3K4me3; however, this was not observed in non-photoreceptor cells. Based on clustering according to histone modification patterns, we observed various patterns of H3K4me3 modification in each sub-cluster, suggesting that rod-specific genes are not regulated uniformly but rather through multiple mechanisms. In most cases, H3K4me3 signals were already observed at the P2 stage, suggesting that H3K4me3 is involved in the initial stage of transcription. We explored whether this photoreceptor lineage-specific H3K4me3 signal was gained after commitment to the photoreceptor lineage, and ChIPseq data of the whole retina at E17 and P1 by Popova <italic>et al</italic>. indicated that levels of H3K27me3 in progenitors were similar to levels of Cd73P at P2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. These finding suggested that photoreceptor-specific H3K4me3 signals were present even before apparent differentiation into photoreceptors. However, determining the level of selectivity to the photoreceptor-related gene loci in retinal progenitor cells requires further study. IPA analysis revealed strong involvement of Nrl, Crx, and Otx2, which are well-documented as critical transcription factors for photoreceptor development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, as upstream molecules in certain subclasses of genes. Nrl ChIPseq identified the Kdm5b gene locus as one of the binding sites of Nrl<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, and our data suggested a contribution of Nrl to photoreceptor-specific gene expression levels, as well as H3K4me3. However, we could not identify specific Nrl binding sites in more than half of Cd73P-A gene loci, suggestive of involvement of other transcription factor(s) for H3K4me3 modification during the very early stages of photoreceptor differentiation.</p><p>H3K27me3 modification of a subset of bipolar-related genes was downregulated in the Cd73N fraction at P8, which is a stage corresponding to bipolar cell maturation; this result is consistent with our previous report that Jmjd3 plays a pivotal role in the de-methylation of bipolar-related genes to achieve temporally spatially appropriate expression. Our previous study suggested that <italic>Bhlhb4</italic> and <italic>Vsx1</italic> are direct target gene loci of the Ezh2/Jmjd3 system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, and current studies revealed additional genes categorized as bipolar that are potential direct targets of Ezh2/Jmjd3. We observed strong Cd73P fraction-specific H3K27me3 signals in several genes of not only bipolar, but also amacrine cells and RGC. This suggests that H3K27me3 is involved in a mechanism to protect and maintain rod photoreceptors by preventing unnecessary or toxic gene expression for their differentiation or maintenance.</p><p>As a potential mechanism for ONL degeneration in Ezh2-KO retina, we observed upregulation of rhodopsin. Excess rhodopsin was reported to lead to photoreceptor degeneration in transgenic mouse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, supporting our hypothesis. However, investigation of H3K27me3 signals at the Rho locus showed broad, but weak, H3K27me3 signals along the entire locus, suggesting that regulation of Rho and other genes by H3K27me3 may differ from that of bipolar-related genes, which display H3K27me3 signals around the TSS. A previous report suggested that broad enrichment across gene bodies corresponds to transcriptional inhibition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, but since the H3K27me3 signals were weak, we also need to consider the indirect effects of Ezh2-KO on Rho upregulation.</p><p>We previously showed that Ezh2 was strongly expressed in retinal progenitor cells, and after differentiation, it was expressed exclusively in RGC and INL at the protein level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. There are two homologs in mammalian Ezh: <italic>Ezh1</italic> and <italic>Ezh2</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. As reported in other tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, <italic>Ezh1</italic> was only very weakly expressed in proliferating cells in the retina, but was weakly expressed in both Cd73P and N fractions at later stages. Although immunostaining did not detect expression of Ezh2 in ONL<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, we observed weak <italic>Ezh2</italic> signals in Cd73PC by RNAseq, suggestive of a contribution of Ezh2 in ONL. Previous studies proposed a model suggesting the importance of PRC2-Ezh2 for <italic>de novo</italic> establishment of H3K27me3 in dividing cells, whereas PRC2-Ezh1 is required for its maintenance in resting cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Changing the level of another member of the PRC2 complex, Jarid2, plays important roles for switching from Ezh2 to Ezh1 involved in the PRC2 complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Expression of <italic>Jarid2</italic> in our RNAseq data was indicative of strong and ubiquitous expression of <italic>Jarid2</italic> in retina, suggesting that Jarid2 may not be a key factor responsible for the switch between Ezh2 and Ezh1 expression, and further study is underway to reveal the physiological roles of Ezh1 in retinal development and maintenance.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mice</title><p>All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo and conducted in accordance with the ARVO (Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology) statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research.
