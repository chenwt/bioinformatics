Thus, nuclear genes encode the vast majority of their proteome. Organelle-to-nucleus communication takes place through retrograde signaling (RS) pathways. Signals relayed through RS pathways have an impact on nuclear gene expression but their target-genes remain elusive in a normal state of the cell (considering that only mutants and stress have been used so far). Here, we use maize cytolines as an alternative. The nucleus of a donor line was transferred into two other cytoplasmic environments through at least nine back-crosses, in a time-span of&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;10 years. The transcriptomes of the resulting cytolines were sequenced and compared. There are 96 differentially regulated nuclear genes in two cytoplasm-donor lines when compared with their nucleus-donor. They are expressed throughout plant development, in various tissues and organs. One-third of the 96 proteins have a human homolog, stressing their potential role in mitochondrial RS. We also identified syntenic orthologous genes in four other grasses and homologous genes in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. These findings contribute to the paradigm we use to describe the RS in plants. The 96 nuclear genes identified here are not differentially regulated as a result of mutation, or any kind of stress. They are rather key players of the organelle-to-nucleus communication in a normal state of the cell.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>retrograde signaling</kwd><kwd>nuclear gene expression</kwd><kwd>cytolines</kwd><kwd>maize transcriptome</kwd><kwd>bioinformatics</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants have an important energy-converting organelle besides the mitochondrion: the plastid. Both organelles contain a small number of genes in their genomes: 120 in the plastid and 57 in the mitochondria, respectively (<xref rid="evw245-B59" ref-type="bibr">Sugita and Sugiura 1996</xref>; <xref rid="evw245-B63" ref-type="bibr">Unseld et&#x000a0;al. 1997</xref>). But the organellar genomes outnumber the nuclear genome by as much as 5,000 to 1 (<xref rid="evw245-B4" ref-type="bibr">Bendich 1987</xref>; <xref rid="evw245-B9" ref-type="bibr">Cavelier et&#x000a0;al. 2000</xref>). Despite this ratio, it was originally thought that organellar DNA was highly conserved compared with its nuclear counterpart and therefore, that any phenotypic variation was mainly due to the latter (<xref rid="evw245-B65" ref-type="bibr">Wolfe et&#x000a0;al. 1987</xref>). This view is currently changing with the aid of new technologies (e.g., next generation sequencing&#x02014;NGS), which offer the possibility of transcriptome-wide gene expression and comparative analyses. In this respect, <xref rid="evw245-B38" ref-type="bibr">Moison et&#x000a0;al. (2010</xref>) sequenced plastid and mitochondrial genomes in 95 accessions of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and concluded that there was considerable genetic polymorphism in both organelles. Furthermore, there is a significant body of evidence showing that cytoplasm&#x02013;nucleus interaction is important in explaining phenotypic variation in many different species, like rice, mouse, yeast or <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="evw245-B48" ref-type="bibr">Roubertoux et&#x000a0;al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="evw245-B61" ref-type="bibr">Tao et&#x000a0;al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="evw245-B43" ref-type="bibr">Rand 2005</xref>; <xref rid="evw245-B15" ref-type="bibr">Dimitrov et&#x000a0;al. 2009</xref>). Retrograde pathways have been defined in order to describe the existing cross-talk between the organelles and the nucleus, and to understand how nuclear gene expression (NGE) is modulated according to signals received from both organelles (<xref rid="evw245-B21" ref-type="bibr">Gray et&#x000a0;al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="evw245-B45" ref-type="bibr">Rhoads and Subbaiah 2007</xref>; <xref rid="evw245-B10" ref-type="bibr">Chi et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>).</p><p>Mutants that are defective in the retrograde signaling (RS) pathways have been extensively used in trying to untangle how organelles control NGE (reviewed in <xref rid="evw245-B26" ref-type="bibr">Jung and Chory 2010</xref>). But mutants have limited potential to explain this phenomenon in a broader context. This is because the genes identified to respond to RS are linked to a single original stimulus, which is a mutation and all the expression changes downstream are the result of it. Therefore it still remains unclear if these genes are the only targets of the retrograde pathways or other adjustments come into play in a nonmutant cell environment. These other adjustments might change the paradigm we use to explain organelle-to-nucleus communication.</p><p>To circumvent the problem of using the less informative mutants, <xref rid="evw245-B25" ref-type="bibr">Joseph et&#x000a0;al. (2013</xref>) recently took a metabolomics approach using the reciprocal Kas&#x000d7;Tsu <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> recombinant inbred lines (RILs) population to investigate the effect of the cytoplasm on cell metabolites. They concluded that 80% of the metabolites are controlled by the cytoplasmic genome. Thus, it is clear that the cytoplasmic genetic make-up of the cell plays an important role in the functioning of nuclear loci, but no key players responsible for the observed effect have been identified yet.</p><p>Cytolines represent a better model to study the effect of cytoplasm (including its organellar genomes) on NGE than RILs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. By repeated backcrossing one can transfer the nucleus from a donor line (used as male/pollen donor) to several other cytoplasms, thus creating isonuclear lines, or cytolines. The plastids and mitochondria present in the resulting lines are only of maternal origin, as they are not transmitted by pollen in most angiosperms and all studied grasses (<xref rid="evw245-B11" ref-type="bibr">Conde et&#x000a0;al. 1979</xref>; <xref rid="evw245-B56" ref-type="bibr">Soliman et&#x000a0;al. 1987</xref>). Maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic> ssp. <italic>mays</italic>), like other cereal crops, is an ideal candidate for the creation of such cytolines. It has an easy pollination process and also has visible and easily measurable phenotypes, which may vary depending on the cytoplasm. For these reasons, <xref rid="evw245-B1" ref-type="bibr">Allen (2005</xref>) used one maize inbred line and back-crossed it repeatedly into various cytoplasms of teosinte (<italic>Zea mays</italic> ssp. <italic>parviglumis</italic>; maize&#x02019;s ancestor) and observed the phenotypes of the resulting cytolines. He concluded that cytoplasmic genomes have a significant effect on morphological, developmental, and functional characters. These results were based on empirical phenotypic observations. No molecular approach has been implemented to understand the changes taking place in the newly created lines at the gene expression level. <xref rid="evw245-B60" ref-type="bibr">Tang et&#x000a0;al. (2013</xref>) took a step forward and analyzed the molecular background (not gene expression) of several maize cytolines that displayed significant phenotypic differences when compared with their donor lines. The authors were interested in two important traits for maize breeding: plant height and ear height. Using 154 microsatellite markers, 22 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified through simple sequence repeat (SSR) mapping, which may contain genes directly under the control of the cytoplasmic genomes (chloroplast or mitochondria).</p><p>Interactions between cytoplasmic and nuclear genomes also influence agronomic traits of rice, but no specific loci have been identified either (<xref rid="evw245-B61" ref-type="bibr">Tao et&#x000a0;al. 2004</xref>). In a recent study, <xref rid="evw245-B13" ref-type="bibr">Crosatti et&#x000a0;al. (2013</xref>) transferred the wheat nucleus (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) into two other species to examine NGE in depth using microarray technology. About 540 nuclear genes were found to have a significantly altered expression pattern when the wheat nucleus was transferred into <italic>Hordeum chilense</italic> cytoplasm, whereas only 11 and 28 genes significantly changed their expression in transfers to cytoplasm from <italic>Aegilops uniaristata</italic> and <italic>Aegilops tauschii</italic>, respectively.</p><p>To sum up, all studies above present significant evidence that organellar genomes are involved in controlling NGE, but mainly mutants have been used so far in untangling the RS pathways in various organisms. Maize is a model plant well suited for studies of NGE using cytolines, which circumvent the shortcomings of mutants. No study has used NGS technology to sequence the whole transcriptome in such lines. They have been subjected, instead, to phenotypic, microarray, and metabolomics analyses (<xref rid="evw245-B61" ref-type="bibr">Tao et&#x000a0;al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="evw245-B1" ref-type="bibr">Allen 2005</xref>; <xref rid="evw245-B13" ref-type="bibr">Crosatti et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="evw245-B25" ref-type="bibr">Joseph et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we transferred the nucleus of a donor line into two other cytoplasmic environments of the same species (<italic>Zea mays</italic> ssp. <italic>mays</italic>), through at least nine back-crosses, thus creating three cytolines. Their transcriptome was sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq2500 instrument and the data validated using a custom-made microarray chip. We identified 96 nuclear genes that could potentially function as targets of the RS pathways. More importantly, these genes are not differentially regulated as a result of mutation or any kind of stress. They are rather key players of the organelles-to-nucleus communication in a normal state of the cell. We also identified syntenic genes in four other grasses and homologous genes in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, hinting towards a general mechanism in plants, where the RS pathways target these key nuclear genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Plant Material and RNA Extraction</title><p>Inbred line TC208 was back-crossed ten times (as pollen donor) to inbred lines TC316 and W633, respectively, during 1992&#x02013;2004.

Three cytolines (B, Cyt1, and Cyt2) were created by crossing inbred line B (always as male: i.e., pollen donor) into inbred lines A1 and A2, respectively. After ten such crosses, 99.95% of the acceptor lines/cytoplasm donors&#x02019; genetic material is replaced by that of inbred line B. Neither mitochondria, nor chloroplast are transmitted through pollen. The three cytolines share the same nucleus, which resides on different cytoplasmic environments, each characterized by its own organellar genomes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="evw245f1p"/></fig>

Consequently, the paternal line B will contribute 50% of the cell&#x02019;s proteome, i.e., line B&#x02019;s nuclear genes will code 50% of the proteins present in the cytoplasm of the F1 progenies. In subsequent crosses, line B&#x02019;s contribution towards the generation of the cytoplasm itself will constantly increase up to 99.95%. At the end of the tenth cross, the resulting cytoplasm will be composed of the organelles of line A1/A2, but in a cytoplasmic environment generated exclusively from translating line B&#x02019;s mRNA. Thus, the three cytolines (Cyt1, Cyt2, and B) have the same nucleus and cytoplasm, but different organelles (chloroplast and mitochondria) that were not transmitted through the pollen of line B (always used as paternal line). Therefore, the only influence that could trigger a change in NGE would be exerted through the RS pathway. The cytolines were later maintained by sib-mating or self-mating. They are the result of approximately two decades of breeding efforts, considering the inbreeding process of the three lines (B, A1, and A2), which had preceded the cytolines creation.</p></sec><sec><title>The Organellar Genomes Differentially Regulate over 1,000 Nuclear Genes</title><p>Transcriptome sequencing, using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument, revealed that 5,009 genes changed their expression pattern in Cyt1 and 1,914 in Cyt2, respectively, when compared with their nucleus donor line B (using a stringent <italic>P</italic>

MapMan is a widely used software in the Omics field (having collected more than 1,200 citations so far) due to its modular structure, which allows for the creation of nonredundant gene ontologies (Scavenger module), easy visualization of the genes of interest on schematic diagrams (Image Annotator module), and most importantly, due to its statistical power in evaluating the genes&#x02019; responses in the context of metabolic pathways or biological processes (PageMan module).

Thus, approximately 600 transcripts were identified as common in the two cytoplasm-donor lines (Cyt1 and Cyt2) when compared with the nucleus donor line B (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw245/-/DC1">supplementary table S5</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw245/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). The genes coding for them are silent (or expressed at undetectable levels) in the donor line and become expressed as a result of the novel cytoplasmic environment of Cyt1 and Cyt2, respectively. To get more insights into the functions of these putative proteins we used the software BLAST2GO (<xref rid="evw245-B12" ref-type="bibr">Conesa et&#x000a0;al. 2005</xref>).

Many more are involved in signal transduction (e.g., GO:0007165), protein phosphorylation (e.g., GO:0006468) and other processes that could potentially alter NGE as a result of retrograde signals received from the new organellar genomes of the two cytolines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw245/-/DC1">supplementary figs.

Research on mitochondria-to-nucleus communication is less advanced. It is however clear that a certain overlap does exist between chloroplast and mitochondrial RS, with ABI4 transcription factor providing a strong case in this regard (<xref rid="evw245-B19" ref-type="bibr">Giraud et&#x000a0;al. 2009</xref>).

But studying how nuclear genes expression changes as a result of a (single) stimulus may not provide a holistic view of the mechanism. Therefore, the use of mutants and stress does not have the potential to identify key nuclear genes that respond to retrograde signals in a normal state of the cell, but cytolines do. This is because the same nucleus is under the influence of different cytoplasms, each having its own set of organellar genomes. By identifying genes that are differentially regulated in such cytolines, we can argue that these are molecular switches that the RS pathways use to relay signals to the nucleus and control NGE according to the cell&#x02019;s needs. However, our experimental design cannot capture the entire set of nuclear genes that respond to retrograde signals. To do so, one can envision a similar approach to defining the pan-genome/pan-transcriptome of a species by sequencing the transcriptomes of a larger cytolines pool. The 96 genes identified here are a valuable addition to the scant extant knowledge on the nuclear targets of RS. We labeled them as &#x0201c;key nuclear genes&#x0201d; that respond to RS pathways, having been filtered from the larger set of 1,179 candidates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw245-F2">fig. 2</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw245/-/DC1">supplementary table S1</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw245/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online) and based on their functional analysis, as we show below.</p></sec><sec><title>Filter Criteria and Microarray Validation</title><p>Here, we identified 96 nuclear genes that are differentially regulated in the two cytoplasm-donor lines (Cyt1 and Cyt2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw245-F1">fig. 1</xref>) compared with the nucleus-donor line (B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw245-F1">fig. 1</xref>).

This is almost twice the number of genes identified by <xref rid="evw245-B13" ref-type="bibr">Crosatti et&#x000a0;al. (2013</xref>) as being differentially regulated when wheat nucleus was transferred to <italic>Hordeum chilense</italic> cytoplasm. The authors identified 540 genes as differentially regulated in an interspecies comparison&#x02014;where one would expect significant changes to occur&#x02014;whereas our experimental setup is intraspecific. The filtering criteria used in the study above were a 2-fold change in expression and a <italic>P</italic> value&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05 for a gene to be considered as having altered expression. In contrast, we used a much more stringent <italic>P</italic> value (&#x02264;&#x02009;0.01) that was even adjusted for multiple testing, but did not set a fold-change threshold. Using these criteria we avoided missing important genes from the analyses, like transcription factors, whose impact on NGE might be substantial even with a slight change in their transcript level. Working with the entire dataset is also important when analyzing gene expression using MapMan, as the software sets the results in the context of metabolic pathways or biological processes (<xref rid="evw245-B64" ref-type="bibr">Usadel et&#x000a0;al. 2009</xref>).

<italic>GRMZM2G010349</italic> is also a good example when the two platforms for transcriptome analysis are compared: NGS versus microarray. Using just the microarray technique this gene would have been missed from the analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw245/-/DC1">supplementary table S2</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw245/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online), whereas NGS provides a higher resolution. As we show above, when the experiments carried out using the NGS platform were replicated using a custom-made microarray there was a core set of 19 genes that could be validated in both Cyt1 and Cyt2 and 19 more genes in just one (i.e., 38 out of the 96). The first 19, highlighted in blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw245-F3">figure 3</xref>, tend to cluster towards the ends of the heat-map generated from log<sub>2</sub> fold change values. This can be attributed to the microarray platform, which has a lower dynamic range compared with an NGS instrument being able to identify only those genes that are either strongly up- or down-regulated. It is also worth mentioning that not all of the 96 genes identified by NGS-transcriptome analysis were spotted on the custom-made microarray chip. These are: <italic>GRMZM2G071226, GRMZM2G066865</italic> and <italic>GRMZM2G066791</italic>.</p><p>When comparing the number of differentially regulated genes from B versus Cyt1 and B versus Cyt2, respectively, they differ by 2.6-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw245-F2">fig. 2</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw245/-/DC1">supplementary table S1</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw245/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). We speculate that the extant difference relates to the pedigree of the three inbred lines used to create the three cytolines. This translates into different polymorphisms of the organellar genomes of Cyt1 and Cyt2 having a differentiated impact (through RS) on the gene expression of B line nucleus. However, in order to properly assess this impact, one would have to sequence a representative pool of organellar genomes in maize, similar to the work of <xref rid="evw245-B38" ref-type="bibr">Moison <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> (2010</xref>) in <italic>Arabidopsis.</italic> The number of inbred lines selected for this analysis would have to be proportional to the maize genetic diversity worldwide.

This is because various stress factors have been shown to trigger the production of secondary metabolites (<xref rid="evw245-B42" ref-type="bibr">Ramakrishna and Ravishankar 2011</xref>). Consequently, one could hypothesize that cytolines act as a mutation per se, thus resembling the widely used mutations and stress factors as tools for studying RS. The high number of genes mapped to the &#x0201c;<italic>cell wall</italic>&#x0201d; bin of MapMan may be explained by the high complexity of the cell wall itself, a structure that is only present in plants and whose maintenance requires an intensive traffic through the secretory pathways (<xref rid="evw245-B29" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Brandizzi 2014</xref>). Indeed, several of our candidate genes code for proteins that are targeted to the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw245-F6">fig. 6</xref>). <italic>Lipid metabolism</italic> is the third most abundant bin, grouping 14 of the 96 genes. Lipids play important roles for instance in cell signaling (<xref rid="evw245-B22" ref-type="bibr">Hannun and Obeid 2008</xref>), thus conferring potential roles as relays to some of those 14 proteins. For example, GRMZM2G060886 and GRMZM2G093666 putative proteins are part of the adenosyl-<sc>l</sc>-methionine-dependent methyltransferases superfamily, whose members are involved in signal transduction (<xref rid="evw245-B52" ref-type="bibr">Schubert et&#x000a0;al. 2003</xref>). Several other genes, including STN7-ortholog, which are not part of the three most abundant classes mentioned here, may play a role in relaying signals received from the retrograde pathways: (1) GRMZM2G122715 is a putative calcium sensing receptor, with a role in sensing and signaling environmental stimuli in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="evw245-B5" ref-type="bibr">Bordo and Bork 2002</xref>); (2) GRMZM2G454952, a ZDS (zeta carotene desaturase) putative protein, has been shown to act in a signaling pathway that controls chloroplast and leaf development.

These kinases catalyze the conversion of DAG (diacylglycerol), a known second messenger, to PA (phosphatidic acid), playing a central role in cell signaling (<xref rid="evw245-B36" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000e9;rida et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Genes of Interest Have Syntenic Orthologs in the Grasses and Homology to Human Proteins</title><p>To further build upon the importance of our genes of interest, we identified their syntenic orthologs (i.e., genes that occur in the same order on a chromosome) in four more plant species from the <italic>Poaceae</italic> family, using data from <xref rid="evw245-B50" ref-type="bibr">Schnable et&#x000a0;al.

The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> homologs for these genes are listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw245/-/DC1">supplementary table S3</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw245/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online. Furthermore, <italic>GRMZM2G004534</italic> is a putative pyruvate kinase, which could be involved in the MAPK cascades that are characteristic to the fourth RS pathway, i.e., reactive oxygen species (<xref rid="evw245-B10" ref-type="bibr">Chi et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>). All of the above indicate that many of the genes we have identified here are potentially involved at different levels in the four RS pathways currently defined for plastid to nucleus communication. By means of ABI4 transcriptional activity, which integrates signals coming from the mitochondria, they may also act as nuclear receptors for this organelle&#x02019;s retrograde signals.</p><p>The signals relayed through the four plastid RS pathways are grouped into two categories according to their function: biogenic control and operational control (reviewed in <xref rid="evw245-B41" ref-type="bibr">Pogson <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> 2008</xref>). The first category includes signals related to organelle biogenesis, which are mainly generated during early plant development, whereas the latter responds to developmental and environmental cues that command adjustments of the energy metabolism. Our experimental setup captures both modes of RS, biogenic and operational, probing NGE in 9-day-old seedlings. However, it does not differentiate between the two.</p></sec><sec><title>Co-Localization of Genes and QTLs Defined for Two Important Agronomic Traits</title><p>Plant height and ear height are two of the most important agronomic traits for maize, directly linked to biomass production and yield, respectively. <xref rid="evw245-B60" ref-type="bibr">Tang et&#x000a0;al. (2013</xref>) demonstrated that 39.91% of the phenotypic variation observed for ear height and 8.75% for plant height was due to the influence of the cytoplasmic environment on the nucleus. We hypothesize that the 23 genes identified here to co-localize with the QTLs defined by <xref rid="evw245-B60" ref-type="bibr">Tang et&#x000a0;al. (2013</xref>) are nuclear targets of the cytoplasmic signals that cause the observed phenotypic variation. Nine of those genes are part of either lipid metabolism (5) or cell wall (4) bins defined by MapMan (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw245/-/DC1">supplementary tables S2 and S3</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw245/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online), two classes of importance for the phenotypic traits of interest. <italic>GRMZM2G443715</italic>, e.g., is involved in cellulose synthesis, whereas <italic>GRMZM2G157113</italic> is involved in fatty acid synthesis and elongation. <italic>GRMZM2G348551</italic> is one of the &#x0201c;classical&#x0201d; genes of maize (<italic>Sugary2</italic>) and functions as a starch synthase. However, other genes are involved in lipid or cell wall degradation, an indication that there is a complex interplay among them leading to the observed phenotypes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw245/-/DC1">supplementary table S3</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw245/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online).</p></sec><sec><title>Transcript De Novo Assembly of the Reads Not Matching the Reference Genome</title><p>Because of the incomplete status of the B73 genomic sequence (<xref rid="evw245-B51" ref-type="bibr">Schnable et&#x000a0;al. 2009</xref>), one would expect that not all of the transcripts identified in an RNA-seq experiment of another inbred line would match the reference. Plus, the average rate of polymorphism in two maize inbred lines is ten times higher than that in humans and higher than that observed between humans and chimpanzees (<xref rid="evw245-B7" ref-type="bibr">Buckler et&#x000a0;al. 2006</xref>). Copy number variation (CNV) and presence/absence variation (PAV) are also high when two maize inbred lines are compared (<xref rid="evw245-B58" ref-type="bibr">Springer et&#x000a0;al. 2009</xref>). In this context it is conceivable that new transcripts are identified every time a new inbred line is investigated. Here, we used Trinity to perform a <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of the reads that did not map to the reference genome and then subjected them to BLAST2GO analysis (<xref rid="evw245-B12" ref-type="bibr">Conesa et&#x000a0;al. 2005</xref>). Next, we compared those <italic>de novo</italic> transcripts that are common to the two cytoplasm-donor lines versus the nucleus-donor line (i.e., common to Cyt1 and Cyt2 compared with B). We hypothesize that the &#x0223c; 600 transcripts identified (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw245/-/DC1">supplementary table S5</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw245/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online) are the result of a change in the methylation status of the genes encoding them. They only become active in the new cytoplasmic environments of Cyt 1 and Cyt2. Future work will need to validate the presence of these predicted transcripts before probing the methylation status of the respective gene bodies and promoter sequences in the nucleus-donor line and the two cytoplasm-donor lines. The approximately 100 transcripts included in GO terms related to gene expression (GO:0006355, GO:0006351, GO:1903506, and GO:0010468) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw245/-/DC1">supplementary figs.

We used an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument to sequence their transcriptome and identified 96&#x02009;key nuclear genes, which integrate signals coming through the retrograde pathways. Our approach differs from previous studies through the use of cytolines, rather than the use of mutants that are defective in the RS pathways or cells that are under some sort of stress. This allowed us to investigate RS in a normal state of the cell. In total, 96 genes are differentially regulated in both Cyt1 and Cyt2 compared with the nucleus donor line B. They have a ubiquitous expression pattern and the vast majority of them have a syntenic ortholog in the four other grass species investigated, as well as an orthologous copy in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Therefore, these findings contribute to the paradigm we use to describe the RS in plants. Concurrently, we present strong evidence that at least 7 of the 96 genes are well conserved in the animal lineage, representing potential targets in a mitochondria-to-nucleus communication, for which no distinct pathway has been described so far.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>
