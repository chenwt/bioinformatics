The plasmalemmal Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump isoform 2 (PMCA2) a calcium ion efflux pump, was the first protein identified to be crucial in the transport of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions into milk during lactation in mice. In these studies we show that PMCA2 is also expressed in human epithelia undergoing lactational remodeling and also report strong PMCA2 staining on apical membranes of luminal epithelia in approximately 9% of human breast cancers we assessed. Membrane protein expression was not significantly associated with grade or hormone receptor status. However, PMCA2 mRNA levels were enriched in Basal breast cancers where it was positively correlated with survival. Silencing of <italic>PMCA2</italic> reduced MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell proliferation, whereas silencing of the related isoforms <italic>PMCA1</italic> and <italic>PMCA4</italic> had no effect. <italic>PMCA2</italic> silencing also sensitized MDA-MB-231 cells to the cytotoxic agent doxorubicin. Targeting PMCA2 alone or in combination with cytotoxic therapy may be worthy of investigation as a therapeutic strategy in breast cancer. PMCA2 mRNA levels are also a potential tool in identifying poor responders to therapy in women with Basal breast cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The enrichment of milk with calcium is vital to neonatal and infant development.

In contrast to its related isoforms PMCA1 and PMCA4, PMCA2 has a restricted tissue distribution with high levels of expression in cerebellar Purkinje neurons and cochlear hair cells, and in mammary glands during lactation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. In the rat and mouse mammary gland from lactating animals, PMCA2 is the predominant isoform<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p><p>The role of PMCA2 in lactation is evidenced by the phenotype of PMCA2 null mice, which in addition to harboring defects in hearing and balance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, produce milk with significantly lower levels of calcium ions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Additionally, weaning-associated <italic>PMCA2</italic> suppression is a critical regulator of mammary epithelial apoptosis during involution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Despite the important role of PMCA2 in the rodent mammary gland, there have been no studies of PMCA2 in the context of changes associated with lactation in humans, and there have been only limited studies of PMCA2 in the context of human breast cancer. <italic>PMCA2</italic> mRNA levels are elevated in some breast cancer cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, and a tissue microarray (TMA) study suggested that high expression of PMCA2 protein predicts poor survival in patients under 50 years of age, and is associated with HER2-positive disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. In terms of functional evidence, exogenous expression of PMCA2 in T47D breast cancer cells reduces their sensitivity to cell death mediated by the calcium ionophore ionomycin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, and disruption of PMCA2&#x02019;s interaction with calcineurin can trigger apoptosis in a variety of breast cancer cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. However, the biological role of PMCA2 in breast carcinogenesis is generally not well understood, and the breast cancer subtypes where it might be most important and its potential utility as a therapeutic target are also still unclear.</p><p>In this study, we assessed the expression of PMCA2 protein in normal human breast tissue with histologic evidence of lactational change, and the association between plasmalemmal PMCA2 protein and mRNA levels were assessed against histopathologic indicators and molecular subtype markers in breast cancer. We also evaluated the consequences of <italic>PMCA2</italic> silencing on the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and their sensitivity to doxorubicin, an anthracycline chemotherapy frequently used to treat breast cancer.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>PMCA2 expression in human breast tissue exhibiting lactational remodeling and malignant transformation</title><p>Elevated PMCA2 is a feature of mammary glands from lactating mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, however, PMCA2 expression has not been assessed in human breast tissue undergoing lactational change. Therefore, we used unique tissue specimens from a breast cancer patient in the third trimester of pregnancy to investigate PMCA2 expression in histologically normal glandular tissue in the context of lactational remodeling (morphological changes and positive &#x003b2;-casein staining are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A,B</xref>). Positive PMCA2 staining was observed on the plasma membranes of the epithelial cells, but not the surrounding stromal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C,D</xref>). The magnified image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>, arrows and insert) shows elevated PMCA2 expression on the luminal membrane compared to the basal membrane, consistent with a role for PMCA2 in the direct transport of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into milk.</p><p>The possible pathological role of PMCA2 was assessed in human breast cancer samples. TMAs comprising 96 breast tumors in duplicate were assessed for PMCA2 expression by IHC. The tumors were mostly histological grade 3 invasive ductal carcinomas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1E&#x02013;G</xref> show examples of the three types of staining observed: no staining, cytoplasmic staining or membranous staining. Since PMCA2 is a plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transporter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, tumors with cytoplasmic but not membrane staining were classified as negative in our analysis. In total, 9/96 (~9%) of invasive tumors analyzed were PMCA2 plasma membrane positive (PMCA-PM+). We investigated associations between PMCA2 plasmalemmal expression and key prognostic indicators (histological grade, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 status). A significant correlation between PMCA2-PM+ staining and the common breast cancer pathological markers, tumor grade, ER, PR or HER2 status was not observed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>; Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05). However, we found a relationship with HER2-positivity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>), with 8/9 of the PMCA2-PM+ cases also HER2+ according to clinical diagnostic criteria (&#x0003e;6 copies of the <italic>ERBB2</italic> gene by SISH). PMCA2 membrane expression is not particularly frequent in breast cancer and so in a cohort of 96 tumors this association did not reach statistical significance (Fisher&#x02019;s exact <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.077), nevertheless given that the same trend was observed by others in a separate cohort<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> this relationship could illuminate aspects of the biology underlying PMCA2 function and/or behavior of HER2+ breast tumors.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>PMCA2 mRNA is significantly enriched in the Basal breast cancer molecular subtype where is it associated with survival</title><p><italic>PMCA2</italic>, <italic>PMCA1 and PMCA4</italic> mRNA levels were compared in breast cancer molecular subtypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> from RSEM data from the TCGA consortium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A&#x02013;C</xref>). Consistent with the IHC data presented above, there were individual breast cancers with relative high levels of PMCA2 (ATP2B2) in all of the molecular subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>), this was not seen for PMCA1 (ATP2B1) or PMCA4 (ATP2B4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B,C</xref>). PMCA2 levels were, however, significantly enriched in the Basal molecular phenotype compared to HER2, Luminal A and Luminal B. Assessment of PMCA2 levels in Basal breast cancer cell lines identified PMCA2 as the minor isoform at the mRNA level in all basal breast cancer cell lines, with a trend for cell lines with higher levels of PMCA2 to be identified as Basal B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Indeed, PMCA2 levels were significantly greater in Basal B breast cancer cell lines compared to Basal A, a trend which was also observed for PMCA1 but not PMCA4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). In contrast to basal breast cancer cell line differences, PMCA2 levels were not significantly different between the recently defined triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) molecular subtypes, BLIS, BLIA, LAR and MES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>) and there was no significant distribution of tumor subtypes in the low and high PMCA2 expression groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>). However, assessment of patient survival in TNBC, identified PMCA2 levels as positively associated with patient survival, this stratification was more pronounced than the stratification by the defined molecular subtypes in TNBC; BLIA, BLIS and MES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>). The positive association between PMCA2 levels and survival in Basal breast cancers was also observed in three different patient cohorts and this positive association was not consistently seen for PMCA1 or PMCA4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 2&#x02013;4</xref>). PMCA2 mRNA was significantly elevated in specific breast cancers in both HER2 and Basal molecular subtypes, although within each subtype there was clear variation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), this variance within Basal breast cancers may be the cause of the association between PMCA2 and survival in this subtype. Correlation analysis demonstrated a positive and significant correlation between PMCA2 and the Basal marker EGFR across all breast cancers, however, within the Basal subtype this association was negative (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>PMCA mRNA levels in MDA-MB-231 Basal-like breast cancer cells</title><p>Given the focus of past studies of PMCA2 on luminal-like breast cancer cells, PMCA2 was assessed in MDA-MB-231 cells that are a representative Basal B breast cancer cell line. <italic>PMCA2</italic> mRNA was detected in MDA-MB-231 (Basal-B/Claudin-low molecular subtype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) by real-time RT-PCR.

PMCA2 protein analysis in this cell line, suggested low levels of PMCA2 protein or a lack of full length PMCA2 protein in MDA-MB-231 cells, despite confidence in the antibody and techniques used (e.g. PMCA2 was readily detectable in human tissue; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D,G</xref>).

This relationship did not reach statistical significance, owing largely to the size of the PMCA2+ subgroup in our study (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9 cases). A key difference between our study and VanHouten&#x02019;s was that we assessed the subcellular localization of PMCA2. We analyzed membrane-associated PMCA2 as a categorical variable, whereas the previous study used digital scoring to quantify overall tumor cell positivity as a continuous variable. This is an important distinction given that the membrane residence time of ion pumps is dynamic and often tightly regulated, and subcellular compartment-specific expression of PMCA2 alternative splice isoforms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> has not been thoroughly investigated.</p><p>Our investigation of PMCA2 levels in molecular breast cancer subtypes supported our IHC data of high levels of PMCA2 across different breast cancer subtypes. Specific breast cancers of the Basal, Luminal A, Luminal B and HER2 molecular subtypes had high levels of PMCA2, this was not as obvious for PMCA1 and PMCA4. However, this large cohort identified that PMCA2 mRNA levels were significantly higher in basal breast cancers overall compared to Luminal A, Luminal B and HER2 subtypes. The absence of any differences in PMCA1 and PMCA4 in the different molecular subtypes reinforces the potential unique roles of the PMCA2 isoform in the breast in both lactation and in breast cancer. Although PMCA2 levels were higher in Basal B vs Basal A breast cancer cell lines, PMCA2 levels were not different amongst the recently identified TNBC molecular subtypes BLIS, BLIA, LAR and MES. However, PMCA2 levels were highly correlated with patient survival in triple negative breast cancers and basal breast cancers, which was seen across multiple cohorts. In these cases, high levels of PMCA2 were associated with better patient survival. This is in contrast to a previous report of Oncomine cDNA microarray data in only patients under the age of 50, which found a negative association between high PMCA2 levels and survival<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Our identified relationship between high levels of PMCA2 mRNA and patient survival in basal breast cancers, may represent an ability for PMCA2 to identify less aggressive basal breast cancers and signify that PMCA2 overexpression is a not a driver in breast cancer. The potential dichotomy in PMCA2 levels between subtypes and its correlation with survival in the basal subtype is exemplified by the very different association between EGFR and PMCA2 in all breast cancers (positive correlation) versus the basal subtype (negative correlation). Hence, within basal breast cancers, PMCA2 may associate with characteristics of better prognosis which may make it a biomarker for good survival. This association does not exclude the potential of PMCA2 as a drug target in some breast cancer cells, either via the previously proposed mechanism of promotion of apoptosis through PMCA2 inhibition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> and/or the anti-proliferative effects of PMCA2 inhibition identified in MDA-MB-231 cells in this study. These complex relationships and associations could be further explored by detailed comparisons of the consequences of PMCA2 silencing in different cell-lines as well as different patient derived xenograft models.</p><p>Previous studies of PMCA2 in human breast cancer cells have focused on the role of this Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump in protection against cell death mediated by agents that produce sustained increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>CYT</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> or its role in apoptosis regulation through interactions with calcineurin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. However, calcium signaling also plays a vital role in cell cycle regulation in cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> and global inhibition of PMCA expression reduces the proliferation of ER+, luminal-like MCF-7 breast cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. In these studies, PMCA2 was the only PMCA isoform associated with proliferation of basal-like MDA-MB-231 cells, despite the lower expression of this pump relative to other isoforms. The lack of any effect of <italic>PMCA1</italic> silencing on cellular proliferation may seem surprising given that this isoform is the predominant regulator of global [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>CYT</sub> in MDA-MB-231 cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. However, Curry <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that despite only modest effects on global [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>CYT</sub> with <italic>PMCA4</italic> silencing, <italic>PMCA4</italic> but not <italic>PMCA1</italic> silencing augmented apoptosis mediated by the Bcl-2 inhibitor, ABT-263, likely through selective effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent NFkB activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. The ability of <italic>PMCA2</italic> to regulate MDA-MB-231 proliferation may also be due to localized specific regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent transcription factors involved in proliferation. However, other mechanisms are also possible. For example, the pronounced increase of <italic>PMCA2</italic> mRNA in MDA-MB-231 cells with increasing confluence <italic>in vitro</italic> may reflect dynamic expression of PMCA2 at critical stages of the cell cycle, such that silencing of <italic>PMCA2</italic> has pronounced effects only at specific stages of cell division. Moreover, the ability of specific regions of PMCA2 to interact with calcineurin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> suggests that the entire intact PMCA2 protein may not be required to have a functional consequence in at least some breast cancer cells.</p><p>Our data raise the possibility that PMCA2 depletion or inhibition could be a chemo-sensitizing strategy in some breast cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. On the background of PMCA2 deficiency, we found that a low dose of doxorubicin was sufficient for pronounced inhibition of MDA-MB-231 proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting tumor-targeted PMCA2 depletion or inhibition may allow the use of doxorubicin doses associated with a better side effect profile in these cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data provide further evidence for an important role of PMCA2 in calcium transport during human lactation, and the expression of PMCA2 in a significant percentage of breast cancers. PMCA2 function does not appear to be restricted to the regulation of cell death pathways in breast cancer cell lines, and may regulate other hallmarks of cancer including sustained cellular proliferation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Targeting PMCA2 to reduce breast tumor cell proliferation and increase sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapy is a strategy worth further investigation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Human clinical samples</title><p>Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples of histologically normal human breast tissue exhibiting pregnancy-induced lactational change were obtained from Pathology Queensland.
