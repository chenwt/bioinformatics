Class 1 and 2 Dyrks represent the original, best-characterized DYRK family members, and will hereafter be referred to as the Dyrks. Drosophila encodes a single Class 1 member, minibrain (Mnb)/Dyrk1A, and two Class 2 family members, smi35A/DmDyrk2 and DmDyrk3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076775-Lochhead2">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Class 1 Mnb/Dyrk1A, is a prototype family member first described in <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076775-Tejedor1">[7]</xref>. Both Mnb/Dyrk1A and its mammalian ortholog, Dyrk1A, play critical roles in a variety of processes, particularly neurogenesis in the optic lobes and central brain hemispheres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076775-Tejedor1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076775-Fotaki1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076775-Laguna1">[9]</xref>. Loss of both copies of the gene in the fly or one copy in the mouse produces remarkably similar phenotypes &#x02013; a dramatic reduction in the size of the brain (50% normal size) with accompanying loss of mental faculties, and an overall reduction in the size of the animal (80% normal). Humans are similarly affected, with complete or partial loss of one allele of Mnb/Dyrk1A producing a distinctive clinical syndrome involving primary microcephaly, short stature, intrauterine growth retardation, facial dysmorphism and mental retardation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076775-Moller1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076775-vanBon1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076775-Oegema1">[12]</xref>. Mnb/Dyrk1A is also implicated in a number of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer&#x02019;s, Parkinson&#x02019;s, and dementia of Lewy bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076775-Kim1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076775-Kimura1">[14]</xref>. Additionally, Mnb/Dyrk1A is located on human chromosome 21 and is viewed as a significant contributor to the pleiotropic effects of Down Syndrome (DS), also known as trisomy 21, including microcephaly, mental retardation, and early onset Alzheimer&#x02019;s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076775-Tejedor2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076775-Wiseman1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076775-Park1">[17]</xref>.</p><p>In contrast to Mnb/Dyrk1A, very little is known about the <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of DmDyrk2 and Dyrk3. We previously identified DmDyrk2 in a screen for novel tyrosine kinases using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody-based screen of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic expression cDNA library. In this initial characterization of the gene, we demonstrated that DmDyrk2 was expressed and was active as a kinase at all stages of the Drosophila life cycle with particular high levels of expression during the embryonic and pupal stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076775-Lochhead2">[6]</xref>.</p><p>DmDyrk2 is the putative protein product of the smell impairment mutant <italic>smi35A</italic> but this issue has not been fully resolved.

In a footnote of a separate report, smell impairment was also attributed to two additional P-element insertions (<italic>k16716</italic> and <italic>k06901</italic>) mapping within 21 bp of the original site. These three P-elements are located only &#x0223c;20 bp upstream of the wing blister (<italic>wb</italic>) gene and nearly 29 kb from <italic>smi35A/DmDyrk2</italic>. However, the strongest smell-impaired phenotype was associated with <italic>k11509</italic> flies, containing a P-element insertion in the first intron of the <italic>DmDyrk2</italic> transcription unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076775-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).

Therefore, to generate a transcriptional null allele, we focused on deletions that removed regions upstream of the original P-element insertion site and selected the most extensive, <italic>DmDyrk2<sup>1w17</sup></italic>, for further characterization. PCR primers spanning the deleted region were identified and used to examine genomic DNA from WT and <italic>DmDyrk2<sup>1w17</sup></italic> animals.

Sequence analysis of the 1 kb product revealed that the <italic>DmDyrk2<sup>1w17</sup></italic> allele contains a 2,248 bp deletion that removes 1,170 bp upstream and 1,078 bp downstream of the TSS including the entire first exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076775-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).

Due to these ambiguities, we made use of <italic>DmDyrk2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> flies to re-examine this issue. To monitor smell avoidance, we employed a T-maze assay using 1% benzaldehyde as the odorant, the same odorant and concentration used in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076775-Anholt1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076775-Ashburner1">[19]</xref>.

A response index (RI) was then calculated with a positive value indicating preference for the odorant and a negative RI value representing aversion.

Terminal differentiation of ommatidia in the compound eye occurs as a wave. The leading edge of the wave is visible as an indentation termed the MF which moves posterior to anterior across the eye disc. In front of the MF, unpatterned cells divide freely. With passage of the MF, cells arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and patterning begins within the furrow. As the furrow progresses, cells within and behind the MF are recruited into photoreceptor clusters in an ordered sequence. After passage of the MF, cells which have not differentiated as photoreceptors reenter S phase and divide a final time, the so called &#x0201c;second mitotic wave&#x0201d;.

Furthermore, the eye phenotype requires developmental changes initiated by passage of the MF. These results are consistent with the premise that signaling pathways and/or substrates impacted by Dyrk expression are not present, or are not functional, except during a critical period after cells have committed to a particular cell fate with limited proliferative ability but prior to terminal differentiation.
