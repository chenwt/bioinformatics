Cytokinin is a plant hormone linked to the control of leaf development and is known to regulate a wide range of genes including many transcription factors. Currently there is little known of the leaf transcriptome in tomato and how it might be regulated by cytokinin. We employ high throughput mRNA sequencing technology and bioinformatic methodologies to robustly analyze cytokinin regulated tomato leaf transcriptomes. Leaf samples of two ages, 13d and 35d were treated with cytokinin or the solvent vehicle control dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 2 h or 24 h, after which RNA was extracted for sequencing. To confirm the accuracy of RNA sequencing results, we performed qPCR analysis of select transcripts identified as cytokinin regulated by the RNA sequencing approach. The resulting data provide the first hormone transcriptome analysis of leaves in tomato. Specifically we identified several previously untested tomato orthologs of cytokinin-related genes as well as numerous novel cytokinin-regulated transcripts in tomato leaves. Principal component analysis of the data indicates that length of cytokinin treatment and plant age are the major factors responsible for changes in transcripts observed in this study. Two hour cytokinin treatment showed a more robust transcript response indicated by both greater fold change of induced transcripts and the induction of twice as many cytokinin-related genes involved in signaling, metabolism, and transport in young vs. older leaves. This difference in transcriptome response in younger vs. older leaves was also found to a lesser extent with an extended (24 h) cytokinin treatment. Overall data presented here provides a solid foundation for future study of cytokinin and cytokinin regulated genes involved in compound leaf development or other developmental processes in tomato.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by USDA-NRI grant 2008-35304-04457 and AAES-HATCH grants 370220-310007-2055 and 103600-310010-2055.

Here we used RNA-seq to perform the first transcriptome analysis of cytokinin response in tomato leaves and one of the few conducted in species other than Arabidopsis and rice. We examined genome-wide gene expression in response to cytokinin in 13d and 35d old tomato leaves detecting 28,606 unique transcripts and more than one thousand that showed a response (at least 2.5 log2 fold change) to cytokinin in various samples. Among these cytokinin responsive transcripts were previously un-examined tomato orthologs of cytokinin regulated genes from other species, such as cytokinin oxidases, type-A response regulators, and cytokinin receptors. Additionally, we identified several novel cytokinin regulated genes, including a Xanthine/uracil permease family protein and a Cytochrome P450 with abscisic acid 8&#x02032;-hydroxylase activity that are both highly induced by cytokinin. This study generated the first complete transcriptome analysis of cytokinin in tomato leaves providing valuable data for identifying cytokinin regulated genes that are involved in leaf developmental processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Transcriptome Analysis</title><p>In order to conduct a full transcriptome analysis of cytokinin response in tomato leaves of different ages we assembled a custom transcriptome reference and assessed differential expression from paired-end (2&#x000d7;50 bp) and singleton (1&#x000d7;54 bp) Illumina RNA sequences. To obtain a broader sampling of transcripts found in leaf tissue at a single plant age, tomato leaves of two different ages, 13d and 35d, were treated with exogenous cytokinin, 5 &#x000b5;M Benzyl Adenine (BA) or the solvent vehicle control dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 2 h or 24 h, after which RNA was isolated for sequencing.

Within the biological process class, a large number of cytokinin responsive genes fall into the categories of metabolic process, cellular process, response to stimulus, biological regulation, and developmental process, indicating that cytokinin plays a role in the regulation of cellular metabolism, dealing with external stimulus, and development in plants. Within the molecular function class, many cytokinin responsive genes show binding activity (binding to ions, small molecules, nucleic acids, and proteins), enzyme activity, transporter activity, and transcription factor activity. This demonstrates that cytokinin affects genes that encode proteins with diverse functions such as transcription factor genes that can regulate plant growth and development by activating or repressing their specific target genes. Many of these cytokinin responsive genes encode proteins that are localized in intracellular membrane bounded organelles, plastids, mitochondria, cytosol, and vacuole. The plastid thylakoid localization indicates that a number of cytokinin responsive genes are involved in photosynthesis-related processes.</p><fig id="pone-0055090-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0055090.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Gene ontology analysis of cytokinin regulated genes in both young and older leaves.</title><p>The percent of cytokinin regulated genes which belong to each of the major GO categories identified is shown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0055090.g003"/></fig><p>The gene ontology analysis indicates that a number of cytokinin responsive genes are involved in signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055090-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

Overall the cytokinin responsiveness of these cytokinin signaling components mirrors what has been seen in several previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055090-Brenner2">[10]</xref>. Since hormone crosstalk often occurs, we also looked at whether cytokinin treatment has an effect on the biosynthetic genes of other plant hormones such as auxin and ABA, although most of these genes are not known in tomato.

These genes have diverse functions such as signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, metabolism, transport, and photosynthesis, although several have unknown functions. Within this group of genes there are several that are linked to induction by cytokinin in other species. One of these classes of genes is the type-A response regulators, which have been previously shown to be rapidly induced by cytokinin through different approaches and are almost always in the top set of cytokinin induced genes in transcriptome analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055090-Rashotte1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055090-DAgostino1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055090-Brenner1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055090-Brenner2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055090-Taniguchi1">[32]</xref>.

The transcripts Solyc01g088160.2 and Solyc04g016430 encoding a cytokinin oxidase were induced 3.7 and 5.4 log2 fold, respectively. Cytokinin oxidase (CKX) is an enzyme which catalyzes the degradation of cytokinin, and it is not surprising to see it induced since if the plant is exposed to excess levels of cytokinin there would be an attempt to break it down using this enzyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055090-Mok1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055090-Schmlling1">[34]</xref>.

The first strand of cDNA was diluted 50 times before it was used in the qRT-PCR. qRT-PCR was performed with the SYBR-Green chemistry in an Eppendorf Mastercycler ep realplex with gene specific primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055090.s003">Table S3</xref>). Each reaction contains 9 &#x000b5;L of SYBR-Green supermix, 5 &#x000b5;L of cDNA template, and 3 &#x000b5;L of forward and reverse primers (4 &#x000b5;M). The qRT-PCR program consists of one cycle at 95&#x000b0;C for 15 sec, followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95&#x000b0;C, 45 sec at 57&#x000b0;C, and 25 sec or 40 sec at 68&#x000b0;C.
