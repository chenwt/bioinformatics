RNAi can be easily achieved in many eukaryotes by either injecting or feeding dsRNAs. This mechanism has demonstrated its potential in fundamental research on genetics, medicine and agriculture. However, the possibility that insects might develop refractoriness to RNAi remains unexplored. In this study, we report that the oriental fruit fly, <italic>Bactrocera dorsalis</italic>, became refractory to RNAi using orally administered dsRNA targeting endogenous genes. Furthermore, refractoriness to RNAi is not gene-specific, and its duration depends on the dsRNA concentration. RNAi blockage requires the endocytic pathway. Fluorescence microscopy indicated that in RNAi refractory flies, dsRNA uptake is blocked. Genes involved in the entry of dsRNAs into cells, including <italic>chc, cog3, light</italic> and others, are down-regulated in RNAi refractory flies. Increasing the endocytic capacity by improving F-actin polymerization disrupts RNAi refractoriness after both primary and secondary dsRNA exposures. Our results demonstrate that an insect can become refractory to RNAi by preventing the entry of dsRNA into its cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>RNAi is a conserved mechanism by which endogenous genes are silenced by dsRNAs in a sequence-specific manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. dsRNAs can be delivered into animals by various methods, including injection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, feeding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> and transgenic expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. These dsRNAs are then processed by a member of the RNase III family, Dicer, into siRNAs of approximately 21 nucleotides in length<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. The siRNA works as a guide and is loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), leading to sequence-specific mRNA cleavage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. RNAi can be cell-autonomous or non-cell-autonomous<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Cell-autonomous RNAi refers to RNAi that occurs within a single cell. Non-cell-autonomous RNAi refers to the ability of dsRNA to trigger RNAi in cells that are distant from the initial site of RNAi or the location where the dsRNA was introduced<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. For the efficient use of RNAi in pest control, the focus must be on non-cell-autonomous RNAi caused by the feeding of dsRNAs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The use of RNAi in pest management requires the dsRNA to be ingested in the lumen without being degraded, then taken up in the intestinal cells. Then, the dsRNA molecules can pass through the intestinal cells and into the body cavity, where they can act on other tissues, such as muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p><p>Because RNAi is easy to induce and highly efficient, it has been widely used throughout the scientific field. It has become a basic method in functional genetic studies. Genome-wide screens for genes involved in many biological pathways have been successfully carried out using RNAi-based methods<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Although RNAi-based therapy has not been fully realised, several achievements in related areas still provide hope for success<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. RNAi is also a promising tool in agricultural science, and especially in pest management, as an environmentally friendly pesticide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p><p>RNAi experiments have been carried out in various insect orders, including the Diptera<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, Coleoptera<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, Lepidoptera<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, Hemiptera<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and Isoptera<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Two landmark articles demonstrated the feasibility of the oral administration of dsRNA in insects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, supporting the use of RNAi in insect pest control. However, RNAi in insects has yielded varying results. Among the insects in which RNAi has been investigated, some appear to be RNAi-insensitive<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. For example, feeding dsRNAs to adults of the Dipteran species <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> failed to elicit RNAi<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. In the Lepidopteran species <italic>Spodoptera litura</italic>, gene silencing using dsRNA was observed only with injection; the feeding method failed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. An attempt to silence the <italic>nitroporin 2</italic> gene in 4th instar larvae of <italic>Rhodnius prolixus</italic> failed despite the large quantity of dsRNA that was used (80&#x02005;&#x003bc;g)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that both dsRNAs and siRNAs activate the type I interferon (IFN) system in mammalian cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Unlike in vertebrates, it is generally believed that IFN responses do not exist in invertebrates because the critical genes or major effectors of the IFN pathway are absent in these species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Recent studies have shown that the RNAi pathway plays an important role in invertebrate viral immunity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Robalino et al. (2004) injected dsRNAs derived from vertebrate immunoglobulin genes, fish non-coding genomic DNA, bacterial vector sequences, and the Taura syndrome virus into marine shrimp. Each of these sequences induced protection against infection with the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Administration of dsRNA that targets either virus-specific or non-specific sequences can trigger an antiviral response that controls viral infections in honey bees<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. However, importantly, this viral immunity was not sequence-specific; it could be activated by dsRNAs derived from any sequence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p><p>To date, there is little, if any, evidence indicating that an organism can become refractory to dsRNA-induced RNAi. Here, we report that the insect <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> can become refractory to RNAi triggered by feeding. Refractoriness is caused by a decrease in the endocytic entry of dsRNA into the intestinal cells, thus preventing RNAi. Digital gene expression (DGE) and qPCR analysis show that several genes involved in endocytosis are down-regulated. Increasing the endocytic capacity by promoting actin assembly can reverse the refractoriness. The mechanism of RNAi refractoriness uncovered here might explain why RNAi is difficult to achieve in certain insects.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Feeding of dsRNAs targeting endogenous genes induces protection against secondary RNAi</title><p>Unlike vertebrates, invertebrates lack acquired immunity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. However, growing empirical evidence suggests that previous exposure to a parasite can lead to increased protection in response to a subsequent challenge<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. In invertebrates, this phenomenon is termed &#x0201c;immune priming&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. In this study, we aimed to determine if primary RNAi could further influence secondary RNAi in <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>. First, we tested the effects of prior RNAi using a dsRNA sequence targeting a non-endogenous gene on a subsequent RNAi by exposure of dsRNA targeting an endogenous gene. These dsRNAs were derived from enhanced green fluorescent protein (<italic>egfp</italic>) (186&#x02005;bp), <italic>Discosoma</italic> sp. red fluorescent protein (<italic>dsred</italic>) (192&#x02005;bp), the <italic>hly</italic> gene from <italic>Listeria monocytogenes (hly)</italic> (207&#x02005;bp). The flies were divided into two groups. The challenged group (Ch) was fed an artificial diet containing one of the above dsRNAs for 6&#x02005;hr. The other group, referred to as the naive group (Nv), was fed a normal artificial diet. Five days post-first exposure (dpe), both the challenged group and the naive group were orally administered a dsRNA targeting either the <italic>sex peptide receptor (spr)</italic> gene (280&#x02005;bp) or the <italic>ribosomal protein L19 (rpl19)</italic> gene (205&#x02005;bp). <italic>rpl19</italic> is housekeeping genes encoding ribosomal protein L19 subunit. Our results showed that <italic>rpl19</italic> is uniformly expressed in all tissues in <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S1</xref>). <italic>spr</italic> mediates post-mating behaviour changes in female flies. <italic>spr</italic> is highly expressed in the midgut, and is also expressed in the head and the reproductive organs in <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> (data unpublished). The results showed that, in the first round of RNAi, none of the three exogenous dsRNAs affected the expression of <italic>spr</italic> or <italic>rpl19</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S2A, B</xref>). In addition, <italic>spr</italic> dsRNA and <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA did not have mutual effect on each other expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S2A, B</xref>). In the secondary RNAi assay, both the naive group and the challenged group exhibited strong RNAi; the expression of the target genes was reduced by more than 60%, demonstrating the efficiency of the RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). These results suggest that exposure to a dsRNA targeting a non-endogenous gene did not reduce the effect of subsequent exposure to a dsRNA against an endogenous gene. We also tested if dsRNA length could affect the secondary RNAi outcome. The results showed that exposure to 92&#x02005;bp and 494&#x02005;bp <italic>egfp</italic> dsRNAs did not change the effect of a secondary RNAi targeting either <italic>rpl19</italic> or <italic>spr</italic>. Both the na&#x000ef;ve and the challenged group exhibited strong RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). It indicates that the length of dsRNAs targeting exogenous genes do not affect the outcome.</p><p>Next, we used <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA as the first exposure for the challenged group, whereas <italic>egfp</italic> dsRNA was used for the naive group. <italic>rpl19</italic> expression decreased by 65.2% after the first exposure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S3A</xref>). The RNAi effect disappeared four days after the first RNAi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S3A</xref>). As expected, the naive group showed efficient RNAi after secondary exposure to a dsRNA targeting <italic>rpl19</italic>; in this group, <italic>rpl19</italic> expression decreased by 66% at 5&#x02005;dpe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, in the challenged group, after secondary RNAi, depletion of <italic>rpl19</italic> could not be observed at 5&#x02005;dpe. This phenomenon suggests that an initial exposure to <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA prevents RNAi-induced gene silencing after a second exposure to the same dsRNA.</p><p>We next examined the duration of RNAi refractoriness. We set the time lag between the two RNAi exposures to 10, 20 or 30 days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S4</xref>). First we examined <italic>rpl19</italic> and <italic>spr</italic> gene expression in the untreated flies. Our results suggest that there is no expression level fluctuation for <italic>spr</italic> and <italic>rpl19</italic> during 30 days in the untreated flies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S5A, B</xref>). qPCR results of secondary RNAi suggested that, although RNAi refractoriness decreased with time, it was still observable after secondary RNAi at 10 and 20&#x02005;dpe. After a secondary oral administration of <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA, <italic>rpl19</italic> mRNA levels were only down-regulated by 25% and 39% at 10 and 20&#x02005;dpe, respectively, in the challenged group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). By contrast, insects that were first treated with either <italic>egfp</italic> dsRNA or <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA exhibited strong <italic>rpl19</italic> depletion after 30&#x02005;dpe, indicating that the RNAi refractory period lasted no more than 30 days after initial exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). These results demonstrated that exposure to orally administered <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA induced a change in the insect host that made it refractory to the effects of subsequent RNAi targeting <italic>rpl19</italic>. Our results show that feeding <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> a dsRNA against a specific gene reduced the RNAi efficiency of a second exposure to dsRNA against the same gene.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>RNAi refractoriness is not sequence-specific and is influenced by the concentration of the priming dsRNA</title><p>We next examined if RNAi refractoriness primed by <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA was also effective against secondary RNAi targeting <italic>spr</italic> at 5&#x02005;dpe. The results showed that prior ingestion of <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA provided protection against subsequent RNAi targeting <italic>spr</italic>. Feeding the naive group with <italic>spr</italic> dsRNA lead to an approximately 70% down-regulation of <italic>spr</italic> expression after secondary RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). By contrast, the group initially challenged with <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA showed no reduction in <italic>spr</italic> gene expression after secondary <italic>spr</italic> RNAi at 5&#x02005;dpe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). There was no significant difference between the naive group and the challenged group when secondary <italic>spr</italic> gene silencing was assessed at 20&#x02005;dpe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). We then tested if a dsRNA targeting a gene other than <italic>rpl19</italic> could elicit RNAi refractoriness. To address this question, we chose <italic>spr</italic> as a target gene for initial dsRNA exposure. The results showed that, in the challenged group, the initial exposure to <italic>spr</italic> dsRNA induced refractoriness towards to secondary exposure to both <italic>spr</italic> dsRNA and <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C, D</xref>). The refractory state primed by <italic>spr</italic> dsRNA protected <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> for 5&#x02005;dpe after secondary exposure to both <italic>spr</italic> and <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA. However, this refractory period was much shorter than that provoked by <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA. There was no difference in gene expression between the challenged and the naive groups fed either <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA or <italic>spr</italic> dsRNA after 10&#x02005;dpe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C, D</xref>). These results indicate that a refractory state can be provoked by dsRNAs with different sequences. Because we did not observe this refractory state using <italic>egfp</italic> or other dsRNAs targeting exogenous genes, we assume that only dsRNAs targeting endogenous genes can trigger RNAi refractoriness.</p><p>We next explored if the concentration of dsRNA used in the first exposure influenced RNAi refractoriness. The results showed that 100&#x02005;ng/&#x003bc;l <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA decreased <italic>rpl19</italic> expression by 38%, but that 10&#x02005;ng/&#x003bc;l <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA did not decrease <italic>rpl19</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). Both dsRNA concentrations could block RNAi-mediated gene silencing after secondary exposure to two different dsRNAs 5&#x02005;dpe. Nevertheless, the refractory periods were shorter than those induced by the 1000&#x02005;ng/&#x003bc;l treatment. In the group treated with 100&#x02005;ng/&#x003bc;l, secondary exposure 10&#x02005;dpe decreased <italic>rpl19</italic> expression by 40% in the challenged group and by 70% in the naive group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). No difference could be observed between the naive and challenged groups after secondary exposure 20&#x02005;dpe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). This shortened period of refractoriness was more obvious when analysing its effect on a second exposure to <italic>spr</italic> dsRNA; in this case, the RNAi refractory period lasted no longer than 10 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>). The refractoriness induced by the 10&#x02005;ng/&#x003bc;l <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA were even shorter than those induced by 100&#x02005;ng/&#x003bc;l <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D, E</xref>). These results clearly illustrated that the duration of RNAi refractoriness to dsRNAs is correlated with the dsRNA concentration used for priming. In addition, we show that effective target gene silencing after the first exposure was not a prerequisite for RNAi refractoriness. Since that only the dsRNAs targeting endogenous genes could induce the RNAi refractoriness, this process might involves the dsRNA and target mRNA interaction. In addition, the fact that target gene silencing is not necessary for the RNAi refractoriness demonstrated that low level of dsRNA and target mRNA interaction, although not enough to silence target genes, is enough to elicit RNAi refractoriness. Thus, the high level of this interaction caused by high concentration of dsRNA guarantees a prolonged refractoriness.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Disruption of the endocytic pathway inhibits dsRNA entry</title><p>We next investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying RNAi insensitivity. In our conditions, the midgut is expected to be involved in dsRNA uptake<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Cy3-labelled dsRNAs were used to track dsRNA in the midgut cells of naive and challenged insects. Fluorescence microscopy revealed differences between the <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA-challenged group and the <italic>egfp</italic> dsRNA naive group after secondary exposure to <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>). In the naive group, dsRNA begins to enter the cell after 30&#x02005;minutes of incubation, and after another 30&#x02005;minutes, the dsRNAs accumulate in a spot near the nucleus. This indicates that <italic>egfp</italic> dsRNA treatment did not impair the ability of dsRNAs from the second exposure to enter the midgut cells. However, in the <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA-challenged group, the dsRNAs failed to enter the midgut cells, as indicated by labelled dsRNAs accumulating outside the cells after both 30 and 60&#x02005;min. These fluorescence microscopy observations demonstrate that the challenged group failed to respond to dsRNA feeding due to impaired dsRNA cellular uptake.</p><p>Two mechanisms of dsRNA uptake have been identified: one is mediated by the SID-1 transmembrane protein, and the other is mediated by endocytosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. However, there is no <italic>sid-1</italic> gene in several insect genomes, including that of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Two independent works have shown that <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> relies on receptor-mediated endocytosis to take up dsRNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Bafilomycin A1 (Baf), a specific inhibitor of vacuolar proton ATPases, is often employed to demonstrate the requirement for low endosomal pH. Our results showed that pretreating the <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> midgut with baf blocked dsRNA entry into the midgut cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). This strongly supports the notion that, in <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>, the entry of dsRNA into the cells requires endocytosis. We next examined the expression of genes reported to be responsible for the cellular entry of dsRNA in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. These genes, such as <italic>chc, rab7, light</italic> and <italic>saposin</italic>, influence several crucial steps of endocytosis, including vesicle formation and transport, intracellular transport and lipid metabolism. Saleh et al. have shown that, in cell culture assays, RNAi against each of these genes inhibits dsRNA entry<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. qPCR results showed that, in the <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA-challenged group, most of these genes were repressed 24&#x02005;hr after secondary exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). For example, <italic>chc</italic>, a key gene required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis that encodes the clathrin heavy chain protein, was down-regulated by more than 60%. A similar level of down-regulation was observed for the <italic>rab7, arf72a, light</italic> (a vacuolar protein sorting <italic>Vsp41</italic> orthologue) and <italic>vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (V-H-ATPase)</italic> genes, which encode components of the endocytic vesicle trafficking and protein sorting pathways. Other genes, including members of the Golgi complex (COG) family (e.g., <italic>ldlCp, cog3</italic> and <italic>bet3</italic>) were also down-regulated. <italic>nina c</italic>, which is required for actin polymerization and cytoskeletal organization, was also down-regulated after the second exposure. These results raised the hypothesis that RNAi refractoriness is caused by a decrease in endocytosis. In order to find if the RNAi refractoriness is systemic, we directly injected <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA into the flies to see if it could bypass RNAi refractoriness. The result showed that, in the challenged group, direct injection of dsRNA could not reduce the expression of the target gene at 5&#x02005;dpe. This result demonstrated that this refractoriness is systemic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>Actin assembly has been shown to be an essential element of endocytosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) induces the formation of cellular F-actin in a dose-dependent manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. To test the role of endocytosis in RNAi refractoriness, we investigated the ability of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to disrupt RNAi refractoriness. Applying H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> during the secondary exposure disrupted RNAi refractoriness; a second exposure with 100&#x02005;ng/&#x003bc;l <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA and 5% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>resulted in a 41.1% decrease in target gene expression compared with the <italic>egfp</italic> dsRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>). This is also supported by fluorescence microscopy; we found that dsRNA successfully entered the cells after co-incubation with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>). Because increasing the endocytic capacity with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> led to a higher level of RNAi-mediated gene silencing, our results strongly suggest that refractoriness to RNAi is mediated by a decrease in endocytosis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>DGE analysis reveals that RNAi refractoriness is intrinsic</title><p>Our results showed that 10&#x02005;ng/&#x003bc;l <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA could not efficiently reduce <italic>rpl19</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). Therefore, we tried to determine if RNAi insensitivity could also occur during the first dsRNA exposure. RNAseq analysis was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed after the first dsRNA exposure. RNA samples extracted at 8, 12 and 24&#x02005;hr after exposure to 10&#x02005;ng/&#x003bc;l <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA or <italic>egfp</italic> dsRNA were mixed together and sequenced.</p><p>A total of 5,973,846 and 6,512,317 raw paired-end reads with a length of 100&#x02005;bp, corresponding to 10&#x02005;ng/&#x003bc;l <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA treatment and 10&#x02005;ng/&#x003bc;l <italic>egfp</italic> dsRNA treatment libraries were generated respectively. A total of 5,793,444 and 6,363,092 clean reads were left after removing reads with adaptors, reads containing poly N and low quality reads from raw data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Table S1</xref>). We mapped the sequences of two DGE libraries to the reference transcriptome dataset of <italic>B. dorsalis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, which contains 48,876 unigenes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S6</xref>). This analysis identified 190 genes whose expression varied in response to feeding <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA compared with <italic>egfp</italic> dsRNA treatment. The gene set comprised 26 up-regulated and 164 down-regulated genes. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis indicated that the genes were enriched for 5 biological processes (p &#x0003c; 0.001), including translation regulator activity, cell motility and transport (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Table S2</xref>). KEGG analysis of the differentially expressed genes showed that they function in several processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S7</xref>). The up-regulated genes mainly function in metabolism and translation, whereas the down-regulated genes primarily function in metabolism, translation and transcription, folding, sorting and degradation and transport and catabolism.</p><p>Importantly, several genes that play a crucial role in endocytosis were found to be down-regulated in the 10&#x02005;ng/&#x003bc;l <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA-treated flies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). <italic>chc</italic> and <italic>hsc70</italic>, which encode factors that work with auxin to uncoat CCV from cargo<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, as well as <italic>saposin</italic>, were found to be down-regulated. In addition, the expression of three genes encoding different F-actin isoforms, <italic>actin 3, actin 4</italic> and <italic>actin 5</italic>, was reduced. The dynamic polymerization of actin has a central role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which reshapes the plasma membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. The expression of three kinases, <italic>hexo</italic><italic>kinase 2</italic>, <italic>map2k1</italic> and <italic>pgk1</italic>, which regulate endocytosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, was also repressed. However, we failed to identify genes that had been previously characterised as involved in insect immunity; these genes encode components of the Toll, Imd and Jak/STAT pathways. This is consistent with the findings of Flenniken and Andino<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, who used microarrays to identify genes involved in the dsRNA-mediated antiviral response in honey bees; they did not identify any classical immunity genes. These results, as well as ours, suggest that dsRNA-mediated antiviral defence may involve unique genes and signal transduction cascades<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. In addition, we did not find core genes in the RNAi machinery, like <italic>dicer 2</italic> and <italic>argonaute 2</italic>, in the DGE analysis, indicating the RNAi refractoriness is not due to the different activity of the RNAi machinery. The RNAseq results imply that endocytosis-mediated RNAi refratoriness also occurs at the first dsRNA exposure. To validate this hypothesis, we co-fed flies with 5% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and 10&#x02005;ng/&#x003bc;l <italic>rpl19</italic> dsRNA, a dsRNA concentration that does not reduce <italic>rpl19</italic> expression. However, <italic>rpl19</italic> expression still decreased 33.5% relative to the <italic>egfp</italic> dsRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>). This result demonstrates that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which influences endocytosis, can also influence RNAi-induced gene silencing. This observation reinforces our conclusion that variation in endocytic capacity can influence RNAi and that RNAi insensitivity is linked to a decrease in endocytic activity.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Taken together, our findings indicate that <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> possesses a mechanism to down-regulate dsRNA-mediated RNAi. We also demonstrated that primed RNAi refractoriness involves clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We hypothesize that our findings will extend to other insect species. In line with this assumption, other works have already shown that receptor-mediated endocytosis influenced dsRNA entry in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Our conclusion is also supported by the work of Whyard<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, who showed that feeding dsRNA encapsulated by transfection reagents could induce RNAi in four different <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, whereas direct dsRNA feeding did not work. This suggests that a mechanism involved in dsRNA entry is impaired in <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. We speculate that this defect is linked to a reduction in endocytosis. A recent report focused on the early response of <italic>Drosophila S2</italic> cells to viruses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Interestingly, this work showed that receptors such as Sr-CI, Eater and TepI were significantly down-regulated after pathogenic virus treatments, and significant changes in phagocytic activity were observed. It is known that together, Sr-CI and Eater contribute to more than 90% of dsRNA uptake into S2 cells. Considering the evolutionary conservation and functional relevance of the dsRNA entry pathway in intact organisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, this change in membrane transport capacity might be common in host-pathogen interactions.</p><p>RNAi is an important viral defence mechanism in insects. The mechanism that we uncovered might affect the viral defences of insects and could explain the variability observed between the various physiological states that influence endocytosis. It also suggests that infection by a virus could influence RNAi silencing against a second virus or against a second exposure to the first virus. Furthermore, our work also has important consequences for the use of RNAi in other insects; it could explain why RNAi is difficult to achieve in some insect species. It also provides a solution to this problem by showing that promoting endocytosis enhances RNAi. In summary, our findings provide a perspective into mechanisms that allow invertebrates to protect their genetic information from non-self dsRNAs.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Fly rearing</title><p><italic>B. dorsalis</italic> flies were reared at the Institute of Urban and Horticultural Pests at Huazhong Agricultural University.
