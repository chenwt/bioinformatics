Virulence mechanisms of UPEC in the context of urinary tract infections have been subjected to extensive research. However, understanding of the fitness mechanisms used by UPEC during bacteremia and systemic infection is limited. A forward genetic screen was utilized to detect transposon insertion mutants with fitness defects during colonization of mouse spleens. An inoculum comprised of 360,000 transposon mutants in the UPEC strain CFT073, cultured from the blood of a patient with pyelonephritis, was used to inoculate mice intravenously. Transposon insertion sites in the inoculum (input) and bacteria colonizing the spleen (output) were identified using high-throughput sequencing of transposon-chromosome junctions. Using frequencies of representation of each insertion mutant in the input and output samples, 242 candidate fitness genes were identified. Co-infection experiments with each of 11 defined mutants and the wild-type strain demonstrated that 82% (9 of 11) of the tested candidate fitness genes were required for optimal fitness in a mouse model of systemic infection. Genes involved in biosynthesis of poly-N-acetyl glucosamine (<italic>pgaABCD</italic>), major and minor pilin of a type IV pilus (<italic>c2394</italic> and <italic>c2395</italic>), oligopeptide uptake periplasmic-binding protein (<italic>oppA</italic>), sensitive to antimicrobial peptides (<italic>sapABCDF</italic>), putative outer membrane receptor (<italic>yddB</italic>), zinc metallopeptidase (<italic>pqqL</italic>), a shikimate pathway gene (<italic>c1220</italic>) and autotransporter serine proteases (<italic>pic</italic> and <italic>vat</italic>) were further characterized. Here, we report the first genome-wide identification of genes that contribute to fitness in UPEC during systemic infection in a mammalian host. These fitness factors may represent targets for developing novel therapeutics against UPEC.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Uropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> is a major cause of bacterial bloodstream infections in humans.

Despite the prevalence of these infections and potential difficulties in treatment, little is known about the fitness and virulence mechanisms employed by <italic>E. coli</italic> to establish a systemic infection.</p><p>The marriage between transposon mutagenesis and high-throughput (HT) sequencing has resulted in the emergence of powerful techniques that can be harnessed for global functional genomic studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003788-vanOpijnen1">[6]</xref>.

Bacterial pathogens are adept at co-opting genes that are otherwise used in non-pathogenesis related roles for gaining fitness advantage during infection. In this context, fitness refers to enhanced survival and growth within a given niche. Genes that promote colonization and survival of UPEC within murine hosts are referred to as fitness factors in this manuscript. A subset of the fitness factors reported here, represent virulence factors that meet the criteria defined by molecular Koch's postulates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003788-Falkow1">[10]</xref>.

Mice were inoculated intravenously with an inoculum derived from a saturating transposon mutant library of a clinical bacteremia isolate, <italic>E. coli</italic> CFT073. Transposon mutants that colonized and survived in mouse spleens (output) were isolated. Transposon insertion sites in the input and output samples were mapped to the genome of the UPEC strain CFT073. 242 candidate fitness genes that are required for optimal survival in the spleen were identified in the primary screen. Genetically defined mutants were constructed and tested for <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> fitness phenotypes using assays relevant to the infection biology of UPEC. A subset of these fitness factors are also involved in the development of UTI in a mouse model and suggests the existence of shared fitness mechanisms used at these disparate body sites. In summary, we present a comprehensive study of fitness factors that augment the survival of UPEC during systemic disseminated infection in a mammalian host.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Generation of a transposon mutant library</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> CFT073, isolated from the urine and blood of a patient hospitalized with pyelonephritis and bacteremia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003788-Mobley1">[12]</xref>, was used to construct a high-density transposon mutant library.

Three doses (10<sup>6</sup>, 10<sup>7</sup> and 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mouse) were compared in the CBA/J mouse model of systemic disseminated infection. Mice were inoculated via tail vein, and livers and spleens were collected 24 h post inoculation (hpi). An inoculum of 10<sup>7</sup> CFU resulted in consistent colonization without causing distress in the inoculated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003788-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Inoculation with 10<sup>6</sup> CFU led to poor colonization, whereas a dose of 10<sup>8</sup> CFU resulted in 20% mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003788-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).

Therefore, a bacterium that successfully survives in the spleen should contain the full complement of fitness factors that are critical for survival in that niche, including the ability to overcome host defenses activated during systemic bacterial infection.

At least a single transposon insertion site was observed in 3020 genes and an additional 843 intergenic regions, which could exert polar effects of downstream genes. A relatively short region in the genome (30 Kbp in length) reveals the presence of transposon insertion mutants with a broad range of fitness factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003788-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).

This might have led to a reduction in the diversity of the mutant pool used for infection, compared to the original pool comprising of 360,000 transformants and may explain the fact that we identified only 6732 independent transposon insertion sites.

The EZ-Tn<italic>5</italic> transposon used for random mutagenesis was not modified to incorporate promoter regions at either end; therefore, the transposon insertion mutations could exert polar effects on co-transcribed genes. Additionally, random events could result in the loss of a transposon mutant during infection and could result in misinterpretation as a fitness gene. In co-infection experiments, nine of the 11 (82%) tested mutants revealed a fitness defect confirming the validity of our primary screen.</p><p>Seven of 372 predicted transposon mutants with a fitness defect (1.9%) were found in another study as essential genes in a laboratory strain of <italic>E. coli</italic>

Another possible explanation is the emergence of suppressor mutations that negate the effects of original mutation. It is also possible that these are artifacts due to sequence similarity to parts of other non-essential genes or gene duplication events. Potentially, some of the essential genes involved in non-structural components could be complemented by other transformants within the mutant pool. These genes constitute only a small fraction of all the fitness genes unraveled in this study.</p><p>A previous study in ExPEC during systemic infection in a mammalian host, led to the identification of type 1 pilus; P fimbria; Hma and ChuA, heme receptors; TonB, iron uptake energy transducer; Ksl, K2 capsule biogenesis; and NanA, <italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminate aldolase as fitness determinants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003788-Smith1">[11]</xref>.

Cells were washed with PBS, overlaid with the inoculum at an MOI of 10 and incubated for 30 min. Two identical plates, for 0 h (T<sub>0</sub>) and 2 h (T<sub>2</sub>), were set up during each experiment. Supernatants were aspirated and cells were washed three times with PBS. Fresh RPMI1640 supplemented with gentamicin (200 &#x000b5;g/ml) was added and incubation was continued. The T<sub>0</sub> plate was removed at 15 min post gentamicin addition and cells were lysed with saponin (10%, w/v in water). Lysates were plated to determine the number of intracellular bacteria. T2 plates were processed as described here at 2 h post gentamicin addition. Percent killing was calculated as the percent of intracellular bacteria that were killed within RAW 264.7 cells. Killing percentages of mutants were compared to that of wild-type bacteria to determine the comparative fitness of a given mutant during survival within RAW 264.7 cells. The experiment was repeated three times with three technical replicates per strain.</p></sec><sec id="s4o"><title>RT-PCR</title><p>RNA was extracted from <italic>E. coli</italic> CFT073 cultured in LB or in filter sterilized human urine to mid-exponential phase or from cells harvested from urine of mice infected with wild-type strain using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen).
