The advent of next-generation sequencing and the comparative ease and speed with which WGS assemblies can be constructed for mammalian and many other genomes allowed sequencing projects to move beyond these concerns, accepting high quality draft genomes with nearly complete gene spaces. Some genomes, however, are larger and more complex than the typical mammalian genome, including those of salamanders (&#x0003e;20 gigabases (Gbp)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], hexaploid wheat (16 Gbp) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and conifers (20 Gbp) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. To mitigate some of the computational challenges of genome assembly from short next-generation sequencing reads for these more complex genomes, various &#x02018;divide and conquer&#x02019; strategies have been developed. These strategies include chromosome sorting and capture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], large-insert-clone pooling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and large-clone tiling paths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. While each approach reduces the sequence assembly problem to a set of smaller, more tractable problems, they require substantial resource development in advance of sequencing.</p><p>Many of the arguments &#x02018;against a whole-genome shotgun&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] remain valid today. WGS assemblies are often rough drafts consisting of numerous, small contigs with gaps of unknown size between them. Abundant transposable elements that often form nested structures are prone to collapse in WGS assembly, resulting in an underrepresentation and mis-assembly of repetitive sequences in the final assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The experiences derived from sequencing large and highly repetitive plant genomes have made it clear that while WGS assemblies are typically able to deliver a rough draft of the non-repetitive portion of a genome, true reference sequences with high contiguity and near-complete genome representation are only accessible following the paradigm of clone-by-clone-sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Despite their shortcomings, WGS approaches for large genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] have important advantages that include (1) simplicity of library preparation and (2) uniformity of coverage. However, for very large (&#x0003e;10 Gbp), complex or polyploid genomes substantial computational resources may be required simply to manage the volume of data, and to address the challenge of resolving near-identical genomic sequences that are longer than the scale set by read length and pairing information. While the human WGS assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and other chromosome-scale mammalian assemblies (for example, mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]) are computational <italic>tours de force</italic>, they ultimately rely on non-sequence data such as physical maps to assemble the chromosomes. The largest WGS assemblies that have been attempted to date (Norway spruce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], white spruce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and loblolly pine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], all approximately 20 Gbp) remain highly fragmented and are not yet organized into chromosomes. Importantly, whole genome assemblies of polyploid genomes have not yet been attempted. Instead, artificial diploids in the case of autopolyploids such as potato [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] or the progenitor species of allopolyploids such as wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and rapeseed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] have been sequenced.</p><p>Hexaploid bread wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L., 1C&#x02009;=&#x02009;16 Gbp, 2n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6x&#x02009;=&#x02009;42) is one of the most important agricultural crops, along with rice and maize. It is widely believed, however, that the hexaploid wheat genome is recalcitrant to WGS assembly and genome-wide physical mapping due to a high repeat content and potential difficulties in separating homeologous loci in the different subgenomes, which are not problems with the diploid rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] genomes. An early attempt at a WGS assembly resulted in a highly fragmented and genetically unanchored assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, it was considered necessary to isolate individual chromosomes by flow-cytometry prior to sequencing and assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. So far, the map-based sequence of a single chromosome has been completed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and shotgun assemblies of the remaining 40 chromosome arms have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Here, we describe an integrated approach to WGS assembly and genome-wide genetic mapping in hexaploid wheat. We shotgun-sequenced two unrelated individuals and a population of their recombinant progeny to varying depths, and constructed an ultra-dense genetic map. By computationally integrating the WGS assemblies and the sequence-based genetic map, we produced linked assemblies that span entire chromosomes, albeit including only the accessible non-repetitive portion of the genome. We achieved short-range contiguity (half the assembly in contigs longer than 7 to 8 kilobases) and physical linkage (half the assembly in scaffolds longer than 20 to 25 kilobases) using large-scale WGS assembly. Longer-range linkage and ordering at the chromosome scale (hundreds of megabases) is achieved through a <italic>de novo</italic> ultra-dense genetic linkage map based on &#x0003e;10 million single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. This linkage map also provides internal validation of assembly correctness. We demonstrate that this approach can be used to assemble previously intractable genomes on the scale of the large and repetitive hexaploid bread wheat genome. At the same time, we expand methods similar to those applied in diploid species such as barley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], horseshoe crab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] or <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]<italic>.</italic></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Whole-genome shotgun assembly</title><p>We generated a total of approximately 175-fold coverage (approximately 3 terabases) Illumina WGS sequence from two (hexaploid) bread wheat lines, &#x02018;Synthetic W7984&#x02019; (30-fold coverage) and &#x02018;Opata M85&#x02019; (15-fold), and a set of 90 doubled haploid (DH) lines derived from W7984/Opata F<sub>1</sub> hybrids; the &#x02018;SynOpDH&#x02019; population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] (Tables S1, S2, and S3 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Each DH line was sequenced to an average coverage of 1.4&#x000d7;. An existing genotyping-by-sequencing map of the SynOpDH population comprising 20,000 SNP markers provides an independent resource to validate our results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. We targeted W7984 for <italic>de novo</italic> assembly, and therefore produced more data and library types (30&#x000d7; coverage in paired-end and mate-pairs ranging from 250&#x000a0;bp to 4.5 kbp in size) for this genotype. Datasets are described in more detail in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>We assembled the 30&#x000d7; shotgun sequence for W7984 using an enhanced version of &#x02018;meraculous&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] adapted for high performance computing (the name is a pun on the use of k-mers - contiguous nucleotide sequences of length k - to accomplish the assembly). Meraculous is a hybrid de Bruijn-graph/layout-based assembler that implements the following stages: (1) counting of k-mers, rejecting k-mers that arise from rare sequencing errors; (2) construction of a distributed mer-graph; (3) efficient traversal of the unique paths in this graph, which represent uncontested assembled segments in the genome (UUtigs); (4) organization of these paths into longer units by threading reads through these UUtigs and utilizing paired-end and mate-pair constraints; and (5) filling of residual gaps using pairing constraints. Meraculous is parallelized, can be used on a cluster or, in a new distributed implementation, on high performance systems, allowing efficient assembly of essentially arbitrarily large datasets. Based on available sequence depth we selected a basic word size k&#x02009;=&#x02009;51 that provides sufficient k-mer depth and allows approximately 45% of the genome to be uniquely assembled (Figure S1 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). A small amount of prokaryotic and organellar contamination (26.8 Mbp in 17,054 scaffolds) was identified and removed.</p><p>The total estimated genome size of W7984 is 16 Gbp, consistent with prior measurements/estimates for <italic>T. aestivum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. We produced approximately 30&#x000d7; total sequence coverage in fragment libraries, which corresponds to approximately 18&#x000d7; coverage in 51-mers (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). The very low-depth uptick (51-mer frequency below approximately 5 counts) represents sequencing errors that are easily distinguished from the error-free portion of the distribution without error correction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>51-mer depth distribution for homozygous parental lines. (A)</bold> 51-mer frequency distribution for W7984 (red), compared with Opata (black). W7984 was sequenced more deeply to enable <italic>de novo</italic> WGS assembly. Uptick at low depth (below 51-mer frequency of approximately 5) corresponds to sequencing error. Peak frequency (approximately 18 for W7984, approximately 11 for Opata) represents the typical number of 51-mers covering nucleotides in the non-repetitive regions of the genome. <bold>(B)</bold> Cumulative frequency distribution for W7984 and Opata as a function of estimated genomic copy count (51-mer frequency divided by peak 51-mer frequency from panel (A)). Note logarithmic scale on the horizontal axis. The two curves lie on top of each other, as expected for two accessions from the same species. Approximately 45% of the hexaploid wheat genome is found in regions that are single copy as measured by 51-mers (estimated genomic copy count &#x02264;2), and the remainder is typically at high 51-mer copy number (approximately 40% of the genome is found in 10 or more copies). The distribution rises smoothly through estimated genome copy counts of two and three, indicating the three subgenomes of hexaploid wheat are largely differentiated at the scale of a 51-mer.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13059_2015_582_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B shows the cumulative distribution of genome coverage as a function of relative k-mer depth, excluding the low-depth error peak. Shown on a logarithmic depth scale, it is evident that (1) the wheat genome comprises approximately 6 Gbp of 51-mer unique sequence that is accessible to de Bruijn style assembly (based on the position of the knee in this cumulative plot, approximately 6.0 Gbp is found at estimated copy number &#x0003c;1.5); (2) there is no clear genomic feature at double or triple copy, indicating that the A, B, and D subgenomes of hexaploid wheat are largely differentiated at k&#x02009;=&#x02009;51; and (3) a large fraction of the genome is associated with much higher copy repeats (note logarithmic scale), which will require longer reads, or physical or optical mapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] approaches to assemble. For example, we estimate that approximately 4 Gbp of the genome is found at &#x0003e;100&#x000d7; copy number on a 51-bp scale. If the k-mer size is increased to 81, the unique fraction of the genome at this k-mer scale would increase to approximately 10 Gbp (Figure S1 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), suggesting that additional sequence depth at current read lengths would increase the assembled sequence.</p><p>We emphasize that the cumulative k-mer depth distribution shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B is only a rough guide to the outcome of an assembly, since it does not capture the distribution of repetitive sequences across the genome. For example, multi-copy k-mers that are embedded in otherwise k-mer unique sequence can generally be assembled using paired-end information, since their non-repetitive contexts can be established by flanking sequence. In a specific case of interest for wheat, any exons that are identical between homeologs can be assembled into their appropriate loci based on the more divergent surrounding intronic and intergenic sequence. Conversely, some single-copy k-mers, if embedded in otherwise highly repetitive surroundings, may only be assembled into contigs not much longer than a k-mer, and will be absent from the assembly if only substantial contigs are retained. So the estimated unique sequence derived from the knee in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B is only a rough guide.</p><p>The &#x02018;meraculous&#x02019; WGS assembly of W7984 spans a total contig length of 7.883 Gbp and a total scaffold length of 9.117 Gbp (Table S4 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). (As noted above, the contig length is somewhat longer than the rough estimate of 6 Gb of unique sequence based on Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B.) The difference between scaffold and contig length corresponds to gaps within scaffolds whose approximate sizes are known (Table S5 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). If we exclude scaffolds shorter than 1 kbp, the respective totals are 6.763 Gbp in contigs in 7.985 Gbp of scaffolds. Half of the assembly is represented in 304,023 contigs longer than 6.7 kbp and in 120,236 scaffolds longer than 21.2 kbp. (For scaffolds longer than 1 kbp the contig and scaffold N50 lengths are 8.3 kbp and 24.8 kbp, respectively.)</p><p>In comparison the chromosome-arm assemblies of &#x02018;Chinese Spring&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] total 10.1 Gbp with a scaffold N50 length of 2.3 kbp excluding scaffolds shorter than 1 kbp; however, the total &#x02018;Chinese Spring&#x02019; scaffold length drops to 7.0 Gbp with an N50 length of 4.2 kbp, so a full 3.1 Gb of this assembly is in very short scaffolds less than 1 kbp. Thus, our whole genome assembly using only short-insert data is comparable in quality to the chromosome-arm assemblies (also performed with only short-insert data, but typically with 30 to 200&#x000d7; shotgun depth compared with our uniform 28&#x000d7; short-insert coverage). When longer-range paired ends from a whole genome library are included, our WGS assemblies produce a substantially longer assembly, more than doubling the typical contig size and extending the scaffolding by a factor of 5 to 6 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). As shown below, these extended sequences allow more complete genes to be captured, and enhances our ability to attach assembled scaffolds to the genetic map, and therefore to be positioned at a specific chromosomal location.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>
<bold>Cumulative distributions of assembled sequence as a function of scaffold and contig length.</bold> The total amount of assembled sequence in scaffolds or contigs longer than a minimum length is shown. As the available paired-end insert size is increased, the W7984 WGS assembly becomes progressively longer, with the inclusion of short-inserts (&#x0003c;500&#x000a0;bp) only (red); the addition of medium-inserts (700&#x000a0;bp to 1 kbp; dark blue); and finally the inclusion of approximately 4 kbp insert mate pairs (green). For comparison, the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium chromosome-sorted assembly of &#x02018;Chinese Spring&#x02019; (CSS) is also shown (black dashed line). Cumulative contig distributions for W7984 (light blue) and CSS (gray dashed line) are also depicted. As predicted by assembly theory, these quantities are exponentially distributed with decay lengths proportional to the N50 length scale of the assembly. This demonstrates that the excess length of the CSS assembly is restricted to an abundance of very short sequences (less than 1 kbp in length) that are outside of the body of the main exponential decay curves.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13059_2015_582_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p>The high nucleotide-level accuracy of the WGS assembly is confirmed by comparison with six known genic sequences (exons plus introns) from the W7984 genotype: the three homeologs of the DELLA protein gene <italic>Reduced height 1</italic> (<italic>Rht-1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and of the gibberellin biosynthesis enzyme <italic>ent-kaurenoic oxidase</italic> (<italic>KAO</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. These six genes provide 15,453&#x000a0;bp of known W7984 sequence; all are found to be contained within six scaffolds of at least 20 kbp in length with 11,043&#x000a0;bp (71.5%) covered by contig sequence from these scaffolds (an additional non-redundant 1,027&#x000a0;bp (6.6%) is found in five small scaffolds each less than 200&#x000a0;bp). While four discrepancies (Figure S2 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) were found between the assembly and the W7984 GenBank sequences, all four appear to be errors in the GenBank entries based on comparison with our shotgun sequence in accordance with prior assessment of the high base-level accuracy of meraculous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. When these same W7984 gene sequences are compared with the chromosome-sorted &#x02018;Chinese Spring&#x02019; assemblies, one gene is not found, and the other five are captured across two or three scaffolds each, covering a comparable fraction of the genes (76.2% for Chinese Spring scaffolds of all sizes, versus 78.1% for our W7984 assembly).</p><p>To assess the global gene-space completeness of our whole genome assembly and the chromosome-sorted shotgun assemblies of the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC), we compared them to a set of 6,000 (non-repetitive) full-length cDNA sequences from <italic>T. aestivum</italic> cv. &#x02018;Chinese Spring&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>; Table S6 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The majority of these cDNAs aligned over at least 50% of their length to single scaffolds in the two assemblies with the expected near-perfect identity (77.7% meraculous, 76.3% IWGSC; minimum 99% nucleotide identity). An additional approximately 20% are consistent with alignment to over 50% of the length of a homeologous locus with approximately 97% nucleotide identity (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>

While the SNP rate between these two lines is 0.38%, some loci will vary by more than 1% in W7984 and miss the cutoff, underestimating the completeness of our assembly. Conversely, loci that are missed by the &#x02018;Chinese Spring&#x02019; chromosome shotgun assemblies may be credited with a &#x02018;hit&#x02019; if a near-identical (99% identical) homeologous locus is aligned.

The completeness of our assembly may, therefore, be underestimated by this approach. Interestingly, while 3,662 of 6,000 (61.0%) full length cDNAs are found at minimum 99% identity and 50% length in both assemblies, some cDNAs are found in one assembly but not the other, with a slight edge (1,001 versus 918) in our whole genome assembly (Figure S3 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p><p>These results demonstrate that the whole-genome assembly approach for wheat presented here is comparable in completeness to shotgun assemblies from sorted chromosomes, each capturing approximately three-quarters of known genes in reasonably complete form (more than half the transcribed sequence represented in a single scaffold). The gene spaces captured by the two approaches do not completely overlap, and thus have some complementarity to each other. Together the two assemblies capture 93% of known genes at the specified criteria of a minimum of 50% length covered at 99% identity. The WGS approach achieves longer-range linkage, however, due to the wider complement of mate-pair libraries.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Ultradense genetic linkage map</title><p>To produce an ultra-dense genetic linkage map of hexaploid wheat, we used the POPSEQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] approach, generating low-depth WGS sampling of 90 DHs from the SynOpDH population (approximately 1.4&#x000d7; per individual). We used two complementary methods to discover segregating genetic markers, taking advantage of the abundant sequence variation between the parental lines (0.32% SNP rate). First, we aligned all reads to the <italic>de novo</italic> W7984 draft assembly and identified 24.6 million putative single nucleotide variants using standard methods. Since we required segregating SNPs for mapping, we eliminated variants that were due to homologous/paralogous alignment and sequencing error by filtering the candidate variants based on expected allele frequency for a bi-parental DH population. Filtering reduced the putative variants to 19.0 million robustly segregating SNPs that were subsequently used for genetic mapping and anchoring.</p><p>In a second, assembly-independent approach, we identified 2.2 million pairs of 51-mers that (1) share a common 50-mer prefix, differing only in their final base (polymorphic condition); (2) are the only 51-mers with this 50-mer prefix (bi-allelic condition); (3) are found differentially in the parental data sets (polymorphic condition); (4) are each found in a narrow frequency range (40 to 50&#x000d7;) in the pooled SynOpDH data (approximately 90&#x000d7; homozygous 51-mer depth) (segregation condition). These pairs represent 50-mers that occur at single copy in both W7984 and Opata, but where the 51st nucleotide differs in the two parents due to allelic polymorphism (SNPs or other variants). After eliminating 51-mer pairs that occurred in both allelic states in any DH individual, we find 1.7 million remaining pairs that behave as segregating markers in the SynOpDH population. We observed a low level of sequencing error, residual polymorphism and/or cross-sample contamination. The number of segregating variants obtained by both of our approaches exceeds the number of markers used in recent sequence-based genetic mapping efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] by three orders of magnitude.</p><p>The markers were clustered into linkage groups using log-odds (LOD) score thresholds by two methods, including a new, computationally efficient clustering algorithm that exploits the inherent linearity of genetic maps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. From the 21 resulting clusters, we subsampled robust markers with little or no missing data to build a framework genetic map using standard software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Preliminary linkage maps identified 10 SynOpDH individuals with partial or complete loss of a chromosome arm, which were excluded from the final map construction. Scaffolds with co-segregating SNPs were then anchored to map locations based on a LOD score &#x0003e;8. Using a second iterative approach, a high confidence framework map with minimal missing data was produced using 112,687 markers and totaling 2,826&#x000a0;cM in 1,335 recombination bins (Table S7 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

Shotgun sequence-based maps made with the two independent approaches show near perfect agreement. For example, of scaffolds placed on the map by both methods, only 0.002% are discordant with respect to chromosome identity, and map coordinates between the two methods are correlated (with a Pearson r-value of 0.95) and with an independently generated genetic map [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>

This is substantially more than the 56.7% of full-length cDNAs that can be assigned to contigs of the chromosome-arm shotgun assemblies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] anchored to the genetic framework map using the same criteria. With a weaker restriction of 25% length alignment, our map-anchored assembly captures 81.1% of known genes, while the map anchored chromosome-arm shotgun assemblies capture only 65.2%. This is consistent with the high degree of fragmentation of the chromosome-arm assemblies based on only a single insert library, which limits both their ability to capture entire genes as well as their ability to be placed on the genetic map. Note that by using independently known full-length cDNAs, our comparative analysis of the assemblies is independent of the completeness or quality of the predicted IWGSC gene set. Lists of cDNAs that can be found with &#x02265;99% in only one of the assemblies are given in Additional files <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>.</p><p>The ultra-dense genetic map also allowed us to validate the local accuracy of our WGS assembly, since SNP markers at the ends of an assembled scaffold should show identical (or occasionally almost identical) segregation patterns and therefore lie at the same map position. Discrepant segregation of markers at the ends of a scaffold therefore suggests an assembly error internal to the scaffold. By this approach, we estimated that the mis-join rate of the WGS assembly is approximately one per 1,000 scaffolds (or less than one mis-join per 3.2 Mbp of scaffold sequence). IWGSC contigs assigned by sequence alignment to the same meraculous scaffold had concordant chromosome assignments in 99.6% of the cases, further supporting the high accuracy of our scaffolding algorithm. The limited discrepancies can arise from mis-assembly in our whole genome approach, mis-sorting in the chromosome-based strategy, or mis-identification of homologous scaffolds between the two wheat genomes (based on 99% identity, 2 kbp length).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Diversity between wheat accessions and subgenomes</title><p>We used our alignments of short reads of Opata and W7984 against the assembled sequence of Chinese Spring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] to estimate the nucleotide diversity between these three genotypes (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). The diversity in coding sequences was slightly less than half that of the entire genome. There were fewer differences between the two wheat cultivars Chinese Spring and Opata M85 than between either of these and the recently synthesized W7984. This trend is most pronounced in the D genome, which has lost a large fraction of the diversity found in the progenitor genome of <italic>Aegilops tauschii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The reduced diversity in the D genome of <italic>T. aestivum</italic> cultivars has been an obstacle to genetic map construction in mapping populations derived from elite breeding material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], but can be overcome by using synthetic wheats such as W7984. We note that SNP rates based on short read alignment may be underestimates because short reads originating from regions of high diversity are more difficult to align to a diverged reference. For instance, the SNP rate between W7984 and Opata M85 based on alignment to the assembly of W7984 (0.32%) is higher than the rate calculated from alignments against Chinese Spring (0.29%).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>

We found 1,501,127 intervals &#x02265;50&#x000a0;bp (cumulative length: 343.0&#x000a0;Mb) that were present in the assembly of Chinese Spring and were covered by Opata M85 reads, but had no read coverage in W7984 (Dataset S1 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Relating the cumulative length of all deletions in a subgenome to the length of all genetically anchored contigs, we found that 1.17%, 1.19%, and 1.07% of the anchored sequence of the A, B and D subgenomes, respectively, exhibited presence-absence variation between W7984 and Chinese Spring. However, only 15.9% of deleted intervals (54.7&#x000a0;Mb) were located on genetically anchored (that is, mostly low-copy) regions. This finding supports the notion that presence-absence variation is common in the highly repetitive genome of polyploid wheat.</p><p>Lastly, we used our alignments of cDNA sequences against the assemblies of W7984 and Chinese Spring to estimate the diversity between the three subgenomes of hexaploid wheat. The three subgenomes were clearly differentiated (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B).

This shotgun assembly captures more than three-quarters of known wheat genes, and the ultradense genetic map anchors over 81.1% of the transcribed genes to a chromosomal position. Remarkably, the hexaploid structure of the bread wheat genome was not an insurmountable obstacle for a WGS approach, since we could exploit the sequence divergence between sub-genomes and disomic inheritance in bread wheat.</p><p>Recently, the IWGSC has published shotgun assemblies of 40 chromosome arms and the complete chromosome 3B of bread wheat that were constructed only from a single type of short-insert paired-end library, since it is generally not possible to construct useful long-insert mate-pair libraries from DNA of flow-sorted chromosomes that have been subjected to multiple displacement amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Compared with a chromosome-by-chromosome shotgun approach, our WGS approach has the apparent disadvantage of having to disentangle homeologous regions from the three subgenomes. However, this drawback is more than offset by the ability to use long-range connectivity information afforded by easily constructed mate-paired libraries.</p><p>An intuitive explanation for this result is that chromosome sorting only simplifies the separation of homeologous sequences in genic or low-copy regions. By contrast, the most common transposable elements occur so abundantly even in only a single chromosome arm that they thwart attempts to assemble them correctly with short reads only. In light of this limited utility of a chromosome-by-chromosome shotgun approach, ongoing and future genome sequencing projects in other highly repetitive and/or polyploid cereal crops, such as rye and oats, may adopt a simpler, straight-forward whole-genome strategy to construct a draft sequence assembly instead of establishing elaborate protocols for efficient flow-sorting and subsequent chromosome-wise shotgun assembly. Likewise, it may be feasible to construct a genome-wide physical map of the wheat genome using sequence-based fingerprinting methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] that can distinguish between fragments from homeologous loci. These considerations do not diminish the importance of clone-based approaches to achieving the ultimate goal of a finished sequence for hexaploid wheat, the long-term aim of the IWGSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p>At first glance, the summary statistics of our assembly might look unimpressive. After all, we were able to assemble only 9.1 Gbp of a total estimated genome size of 16 Gbp. However, the fraction of the genome in assembled contigs is in the same range as the chromosome-by-chromosome shotgun assembly of IWGSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] (9.1 Gbp versus 10.1 Gbp), suggesting that the problems are intrinsic to the wheat genome and short read datasets. Importantly, the better contiguity of our assembly made it possible to anchor a much larger fraction of the genome (7.1 Gbp versus 4.4 Gbp) to chromosomal locations using the same genetic information that was used to anchor the IWGSC assembly, but taking advantage of longer scaffolds that have a higher probability to carry at least one segregating polymorphism. Moreover, our assembly is substantially better than a first WGS assembly of hexaploid wheat from 5&#x000d7; coverage of 454 reads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The N50 of this assembly was far below 1&#x000a0;kb and it was only with the help of an additional transcriptome assembly that complete gene sequences could be constructed and at least partially assigned to one of the subgenomes. If we seek comparison outside the Triticeae, the contiguity and genome representation of our assembly are worse than those of a WGS assembly of white spruce, which achieved an N50 of approximately 20&#x000a0;kb and near-complete genome coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, the repeat structure of conifer genomes may be less adverse to WGS assembly than that of cereal grasses, since the genome of loblolly pine was found to contain fewer nearly identical repetitive elements than the genome of maize or sorghum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p><p>Despite its obvious shortcomings, our assembly will serve as a useful resource for the wheat community, very much like the incomplete and highly fragmented assembly of barley, which nevertheless has enabled the development of cost-efficient resequencing strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], reference-based genetic mapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] and fast gene isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Integrating the WGS assembly of barley with a genome-wide physical map, clone sequence information and gene models predicted from RNA sequencing resulted in a highly useful genomic framework of the barley genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], mapping 1.2 Gb of largely genic sequences. The sequence resources and genetic marker information provided by the present wheat assembly will assist the ongoing efforts of producing at first physical maps and then map-based sequences of all chromosome arms of wheat. So far, these efforts had to rely on the barley POPSEQ map as a proxy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] or low-density conventional maps that are difficult to integrate with scarce sequence data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p><p>Even in the context of WGS methods, our assembly can still be improved. The addition of more shotgun sequence depth would allow longer k-mers to be used, resulting in the incorporation of more repetitive sequences. It is worth emphasizing that while the wheat genome is commonly described as being 80% repetitive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], this is a biological criterion based on transposable element detection and classification. Depending on the choice of k, far more than 20% of the genome is accessible to shotgun assembly, since diverged &#x02018;repetitive&#x02019; sequences can still be distinguished at the nucleotide level. Even with our modest choice of k&#x02009;=&#x02009;51, more than 40% of the hexaploid wheat genome can be assembled and mapped. We also note that the shotgun coverage of the recombinant progeny accounts for a substantial amount of sequence that could, in principle, be incorporated into the assembly with further algorithm development.

Three &#x02018;800&#x000a0;bp&#x02019; fragment libraries were prepared and sequenced using long run chemistry on the Illumina HiSeq 2500, producing nominal paired 250&#x000a0;bp reads. Two of the three attempted &#x02018;800&#x000a0;bp&#x02019; libraries showed substantial bimodality when aligned to preliminary assemblies, including not only the desired peak insert size at approximately 800&#x000a0;bp but also a large collection of pairs with short inserts (&#x0003c;400&#x000a0;bp). All sequences were used for contig building, but only unimodal libraries were used for scaffolding. Two LFPE (ligation-free paired end) mate pair libraries were generated as follows. DNA fragments were generated using the 5500 SOLiD Mate-Paired Library Construction Kit (SOLiD&#x000ae;). Genomic DNA (5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) was sheared using the Covaris E210 (Covaris (Woburn, MA, USA)) and gel size selected to target an insert size of 1.5 kbp (library OAGT) and 4 kbp (PSWH). The sheared DNA was end repaired, and ligated with biotinylated internal linkers. The DNA was then circularized using intra-molecular hybridization of the internal linkers. The circularized DNA was treated with plasmid safe to remove non-circularized products. The circularized DNA was nick translated and treated with T7 exonuclease and S1 nuclease to generate fragments containing internal linkers with genomic tags on each end. The mate pair fragments were A-tailed and purified using Streptavidin bead selection (Invitrogen). The purified fragments were ligated with Illumina adaptors and amplified using 10&#x000a0;cycles of PCR with Illumina primers to generate the final library. Quantitative PCR was used to determine the concentration of the libraries and were sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq.

Contigs were generated using all short fragment libraries (but excluding mate-pair libraries). An initial round of scaffolding was performed using reads from all fragment libraries that were found to &#x02018;splint&#x02019; pairs of contigs by 51-mer alignment. This splint-only-scaffolding protocol has not been used in previous meraculous assemblies, but was developed specifically to cope with the unique combination of insert sizes, depths of coverage, and genome complexity presented by this project.

The marker sequences and associated genotype calls are available as Dataset S6 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Efficient clustering into linkage groups</title><p>This marker set was clustered into 21 linkage groups using a novel clustering algorithm (BubbleCluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]), which takes advantage of the underlying linear structure of genetic maps to produce a clustering of the markers in just over an hour of run time using one core of a quad-core AMD Opteron 8378 server. For this clustering a LOD threshold of 9 was used, and the resulting clusters included 1.34 million markers with no missing data in at least 46 of the 88 retained individuals. No significant minor clusters were found beyond the largest 21, which ranged in size from 5.2&#x000a0;k to 127.5&#x000a0;k markers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Establishing a framework map</title><p>A framework map was derived from the 100,000 markers placed in clusters with the least missing data in the genotype array using MSTmap. This map was found to be in strong agreement (see <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Results</xref>) with the alternative map, which used markers derived from more conventional SNP-finding methods (see above), and is noteworthy in that it is produced directly from analysis of the shotgun sequence, requiring neither an existing assembly nor map (and was generated in less than 3&#x000a0;hours of wall-clock time using software specifically tailored to produce ultra-high-density genetic maps in a high-performance computing environment). Map locations of 50&#x02009;+&#x02009;1-mer markers are given in Dataset S7 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Attaching scaffolds to the map</title><p>By the uniqueness property of the underlying k-mers in a meraculous assembly, the set of 50&#x02009;+&#x02009;1-mer markers may be directly and uniquely assigned to scaffolds in the assembly by BLAST (or other suitable alignment method) with wordsize 51; 84% of markers in the set are assignable to scaffolds by this technique. These are assigned to 442&#x000a0;k scaffolds spanning 5.28 Gbp (267&#x000a0;k scaffolds larger than 1 kbp spanning 5.23 Gbp). Markers placed in linkage group clusters are assigned to 321&#x000a0;k scaffolds spanning 4.51 Gbp of the assembly (215&#x000a0;k scaffolds larger than 1 kbp spanning 4.48 Gbp). Of scaffolds with two cluster-assigned markers attached, 48/45,805 (0.10%) are found to have markers with conflicting linkage group designations, indicating a very low rate of potential misassembly (or marker mis-assignment). The net separation of marker pairs across this set indicates an inter-chromosomal misassembly rate of no more than one per 3.3 Mbp. We note that this assembly-independent framework map can be extended by identifying k&#x02009;+&#x02009;1-mer markers on scaffolds, and combining the (sparsely sampled) markers on each scaffold into a haplotype &#x02019;super-marker&#x02019; with limited missing data.

Chinese Spring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] that are polymorphic in the respective pair of accessions and had at least 1&#x000d7; coverage in both W7984 and Opata M85. This analysis was based on the short read alignment against the Chinese Spring assembly (see &#x02018;Read mapping and SNP calling&#x02019;). Then, we divided this number by the number of all bases of the Chinese Spring assembly that have at least 1&#x000d7; coverage in both W7984 and Opata M85. These calculations were performed separately for the entire genome, the three subgenomes and for coding sequences.
