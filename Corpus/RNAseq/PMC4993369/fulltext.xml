The exact molecular mechanisms by which HPTMs influence silencing and activation, however, are still to be better understood. Here we show by a combined approach of quantitative mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) and transcriptional network analysis (RNA-seq) that the core regions of silent <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> SM clusters generally carry low levels of all tested chromatin modifications and that heterochromatic marks flank most of these SM clusters. During secondary metabolism, histone marks typically associated with transcriptional activity such as H3 trimethylated at lysine-4 (H3K4me3) are established in some, but not all gene clusters even upon full activation. KdmB, a Jarid1-family histone H3 lysine demethylase predicted to comprise a BRIGHT domain, a zinc-finger and two PHD domains in addition to the catalytic Jumonji domain, targets and demethylates H3K4me3 <italic>in vivo</italic> and mediates transcriptional downregulation. Deletion of <italic>kdmB</italic> leads to increased transcription of about ~1750 genes across nutrient-rich (primary metabolism) and nutrient-limiting (secondary metabolism) conditions. Unexpectedly, an equally high number of genes exhibited reduced expression in the <italic>kdmB</italic> deletion strain and notably, this group was significantly enriched for genes with known or predicted functions in secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Taken together, this study extends our general knowledge about multi-domain KDM5 histone demethylases and provides new details on the chromatin-level regulation of fungal secondary metabolite production.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>In this work we monitored by proteomic analysis and ChIP-seq the genome-wide distribution of several key modifications on histone H3 in the model fungus <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> cultivated either under optimal physiological conditions (active growth) or less favourable conditions which are known to promote the production of secondary metabolites (SM). When we correlated the chromatin status to transcriptional activities in actively growing cells we found that the silenced SM gene clusters are flanked by heterochromatic domains presumably contributing to silencing but that the bodies of the clusters only carry background levels of any of the investigated marks. In nutrient-depleted conditions, activating marks were invading some, but by far not all transcribed clusters, leaving open the question how activation of these regions occurs at the chromatin level. Surprisingly, a large number of these gene clusters actually depend on KdmB for normal activation and it will be interesting to see in future how this protein thought to mainly act as repressor by removing positive H3K4m3 marks switches gears to activate transcription directly or indirectly.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F3703</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Strauss</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Lower Austria Science Fund NFB</institution></funding-source><award-id>LS12-009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Strauss</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSG-14-184-01-DMC.</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1735-8266</contrib-id><name><surname>Lewis</surname><given-names>Zachary A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by: Austrian Science Fund (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fwf.ac.at">www.fwf.ac.at</ext-link>) grant F3703 and Lower Austria Science Fund NFB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nfb.at/forschung/foerderung/life-science-calls/">http://www.nfb.at/forschung/foerderung/life-science-calls/</ext-link>) grant LS12-009 to JS and American Cancer Society grant RSG-14-184-01-DMC to ZAL.

Chromatin structure is necessarily dynamic and the underlying mechanisms involve remodeling of nucleosomes as well as depositing and removing posttranslational modifications on N-terminal and central residues of histones proteins (HPTMs) present in the nucleosome octamer [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Some of these histone marks, such as acetyl groups on lysines, profoundly influence the chromatin landscape by neutralizing the positive charge of histones thereby weakening the interaction between nucleosomes and DNA and increasing chromatin accessibility [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. HPTMs also work indirectly by providing binding sites for chromatin-associated proteins that promote or inhibit specific genomic functions. Notably, many HPTMs recruit additional chromatin-modifying enzymes that add new or remove existing marks, enabling cells to dynamically regulate chromatin structure in response to environmental or developmental cues. Fungi have served as model systems for chromatin studies and in many basic mechanisms they are similar to higher eukaryotes but in some aspects they are quite different and this fact allows evolutionary insights into the development of chromatin regulatory systems (reviewed in [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]). For example, there is ground-laying work from the filamentous ascomycete <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>, where the molecular machinery relating heterochromatin formation and DNA methylation was deciphered [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Similar to animals also in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>crassa</italic> Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1), docks on di- or trimethylated lysine-9 on histone H3 (H3K9me2/3) to promote heterochromatin formation [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and in addition is important to maintain H3K27me3, another repressive mark, at facultative heterochromatin [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This mark was found to span 6.8% of the fungal genome [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] corresponding to over 700 transcriptionally repressed genes, some of which are upregulated upon deletion of the H3K27 methyltransferase [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. While H3K27 methylation and elements of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) responsible for depositing this mark are present in <italic>Neurospora</italic> and the <italic>Fusarium</italic> group of fungal pathogens (see below) this silencing mechanism has not been detected in <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, DNA methylation has not been found in the Aspergilli although a cytosine methyltransferase is functionally expressed in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> and has a role in regulating sexual development [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Mycotoxins, antibiotics, pigments and other low molecular weight natural products are summarized under the term of secondary metabolites (SMs). The <italic>Fusarium</italic> and <italic>Aspergillus</italic> genera are large groups of fungi comprising important plant and animal pathogens and they all produce (SMs) at certain developmental stages or under conditions of growth restriction, nutrient limitation and environmental stress (reviewed in [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). It was shown initially in <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> by genetic analysis that expression of the corresponding SMs biosynthetic genes, which are usually organized in gene clusters, is under chromatin control (reviewed in [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). Under conditions of active growth SMs genes are silenced by H3 deacetylation [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] as well as by the H3K9 methylation machinery of ClrD (KMT1/ DIM-5 homolog) and the hpo homolog HepA [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Interestingly, H3K4 methylation and a subunit of the COMPASS complex which are usually known to be associated with gene activation, also contribute to silencing although this has only been observed for a small subset of SM genes [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Several recent studies in a number of other fungi have implicated heterochromatin as a regulator of secondary metabolism and the production of virulence factors. In the plant pathogens <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> (wheat and maize pathogen) and <italic>F</italic>. <italic>fujikuroi</italic> (rice pathogen) as well as in the fungal endophyte <italic>Epichlo&#x000eb; festucae</italic>, H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 regulate expression of specific gene clusters responsible for the production of secondary metabolites [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. H3K9me3 and HP1 were also shown to negatively regulate other virulence factors such as genes encoding small secreted proteins (SSPs) in <italic>Leptosphaeria maculans</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>How HPTM patterns change as SM clusters switch from a repressed state to an active state is not completely understood. The requirement of histone H3 and H4 acetylation for SM gene expression is well documented in Aspergillus species through HDAC inhibitor studies and SAGA- complex mutants [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Interestingly, co-cultivation of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> cells with <italic>Streptomyces rapamycinicus</italic> led to an anomalous activation of several SM genes in the fungus [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and this process is correlated with increased H3 acetylation of the corresponding genes and strictly dependent on GcnE, the catalytic subunit of the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> SAGA acetylation complex [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Also in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>fujikuroi</italic>, activation of the GA, bikaverin and fumonisin clusters was correlated with increased acetylation of H3K9 [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to acetylation, the role of histone methylation in fungal SM gene expression is much less clear. In <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic>, silent SM clusters are highly enriched for repressive H3K27me3, whereas trimethylated H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3), an activating mark, is apparently excluded. Upon deletion of the H3K27 methyltransferase <italic>kmt6</italic>, the silent fusarin C and carotenoid clusters are activated, but H3K4me3 does not accumulate in these clusters [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A similar situation was shown in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>fujikuroi</italic> where increases in H3K4me2 were only observed in two genes of the gibberellin (GA) cluster. Similar to the case for H3K4me, expression of SM cluster genes in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> was not associated with increased H3K36me3 [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In contrast, H3K36me3 was gained for the sterigmatocystin (ST) and several other SM gene clusters in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> during activation [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>H3K4me3 is an HPTM with important roles in transcription and this mark is generated by the COMPASS (<underline>Comp</underline>lex <underline>as</underline>sociated with <underline>S</underline>et1) protein complex containing the Set1 methyltransferase catalytic subunit in addition to several regulatory and scaffold proteins [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. COMPASS is not essential in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> although synthetic lethality of Set1 and Swd1 subunits was found with mutations in mitotic regulators [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Generally, H3K4me3 has been shown to be recognized by three different domains associated with proteins of various functions. One recognition module is the PHD domain, present for example in the &#x0201c;Inhibitor of Growth&#x0201d; (ING) protein, which recruits histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and deacetylase (HDAC) complexes [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. H3K4me3 is also recognized by the double TUDOR domain of JMJD2A, a JmjC family demethylase that removes methyl groups from di- or trimethylated H3K9 [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and by the tandem chromodomain of CHD1, an ATP- dependent nucleosomal remodeler [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] recently shown to be necessary for inhibition of intragenic initiation or initiation from cryptic promoters and thus maintaining normal transcript elongation [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Accordingly, H3K4me3 plays a central role in the chromatin regulatory network. Usually, H3K4me3 peaks at the transcription start sites (TSSs) and its occurrence is correlated with gene expression [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, the Set1 protein also displays some moonlighting activities as it recruits deacetylase activity independently from the H3K4me3 mark and subsequently promotes heterochromatin formation and transcriptional repression at distinct loci in the fission yeast genome [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].

Here, we characterize another member of the JmjC demethylase family, KdmB, which acts on H3K4me3 <italic>in vivo</italic>, thus is assigned to the Jarid group of enzymes. Jarid (JMJ&#x02013;AT-rich interacting domain-containing protein) subfamily demethylases have been shown to target di- and trimethylated H3K4 and are therefore generally considered to be repressors of gene transcription, though they can also act as activators [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].

RBP2 represses transcription via H3K4me3 demethylation and association with an HDAC complex, however when associated with retinoblastoma protein (pRb), it activates certain genes in the mammalian genome [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].

Although a subset of these genes showed increased expression in the <italic>kdmB&#x00394;</italic> mutant (<italic>kdmB&#x00394;-up/G</italic> 4), this was not accompanied by an increase in H3K4me3 probably due to the already very high K4 methylation levels in the wild type. Consequently, a further increase would hardly be possible and thus the effect of <italic>kdmB</italic> deletion on H3K4 trimethylation is more subtle compared to genes generally not heavily marked by H3K4me3.</p><p>In contrast to the repressive function, KdmB also seems to have a positive role in transcription. <italic>kdmB</italic> deletion led to reduced expression of 750 genes belonging to both low (WT-up/G1) or high (WT-up/G3) H3K4me3 groups, accompanied by lower H3K4me3, on average, in the mutant. Based on these correlations we can conclude that KdmB function is required for normal expression of these roughly 750 genes, but whether KdmB directly targets these loci or indirectly affects transcription via the transcriptome network remains to be determined.</p><p>We also constructed metaplots of H3K4me3 distributions under SM conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006222.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).

However, in locus-specific analysis by RNA-seq and ChIP-seq (see below), we also found some transcriptionally silent regions with high H3K4me3 as well as some highly transcribed genes with very low levels of this mark (see analysis below) indicating that specific genomic regions exist in which this general positive correlation between H3K4me3 and transcriptional activity does not apply.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>KdmB is specifically required for induction of SMB genes</title><p>Our initial correlation analysis of H3K4me3 and transcription revealed that among genes requiring KdmB for full transcription, the category of SMB genes was significantly enriched (p &#x0003c; 0.05).

Removal of this modification is accomplished by members of the KDM5-family demethylases, typically resulting in repression of the targeted locus. In fact, the first characterized H3K4 demethylases LID2 [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and RBP2 [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] were identified as transcriptional repressors. However, these proteins and all KDM5 members are composed of multiple domains which are necessary for the diverse functions these regulators play. For example, demethylase activity of KDM5 is only one of the important functions required for Drosophila development [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. In addition, some domains have been associated with gene activation, for example, mammalian Jarid1a is recruited to the <italic>Per2</italic> circadian gene promoter where it inhibits HDACs function and promotes transcription [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. We also found in our study that deletion of KdmB has both activating and repressing effects. We found a genome-wide 20% increase in acetylated H3 N-termini and increased transcription of around 630 genes under standard growth conditions (nutrient sufficiency, primary metabolism) in strains lacking KdmB. These results provide evidence that the protein functions as a repressor that is able to remove H3K4me3 and perhaps recruit HDACs. Our data also demonstrate that KdmB is an H3K4me3 demethylase. The protein removed this modification <italic>in vitro</italic> and genes that are overexpressed in a KdmB-deficient mutant show increased H3K4me3. Unfortunately, from our data, we cannot deduce which part of this gene set is directly targeted by KdmB and which may be indirectly silenced through transcriptome network effects. ChIP analysis of KdmB tagged versions will be able to clarify this point in future.</p><p>On the other hand, for around 750 <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> genes KdmB is required for full transcription. It is possible that KdmB mediates activation directly via one or more domains such as the potentially DNA-binding Zn-finger or ARID domains or the methylated histone binding PHD domain. However, deciphering how KdmB promotes transcription requires further investigation. Strikingly, the majority of the genes under positive KdmB control are related to the production of secondary metabolites. These small natural products are defense and signaling molecules of fungi produced during development, under stressful or nutrient-limiting conditions [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and it is interesting that a general chromatin regulator such as KdmB takes up this specialized function in metabolism. We have shown that KdmB regulates (directly or indirectly) almost 5% of the genome during PM and over 10% during SM. The activation signal for the induction of genes involved in SMs production is transmitted <italic>via</italic> the so-called <italic>velvet</italic> activation complex containing also a protein termed LaeA that influences chromatin structure [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It will be interesting to determine if KdmB functions in this pathway. It is possible that KdmB could regulate SM gene expression by demethylation of SM regulatory proteins. Recently it was shown that several JmjC family demethylases can target non-histone substrates; however this function, to our best knowledge, has not been demonstrated for Jarid family demethylases [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>].</p><p>This role of KdmB in SMB gene activation appears to be independent of its histone demethylase enzymatic activity. In <italic>kdmB&#x00394;</italic>, low levels of H3K4me3 and H3 lysine acetylation in SM gene clusters under activating conditions are likely the consequence of lower transcription at these <italic>loci</italic>.</p><p>One of the most striking features of silent <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> SM clusters is a very low abundance or virtual absence of the four investigated histone marks within the borders of these gene clusters. At the moment we cannot exclude the possibility that other histone marks define the chromatin landscape within and around SM gene clusters. A large number of SM clusters, as exemplified here for sterigmatocystin (ST), penicillin (PEN), orsellinic acid (ORS), teraquinone (TDI), derivative of benzaldehyde 1 (DBA), austinol (AUS) and asperthecin (APT) are located in regions for which H3K4me3, H3K36m3 or H3Ac can hardly be detected. Even the monodictiphenone (MDP, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006222.s013">S13 Fig</xref>) and asparthecin clusters (APT, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006222.s012">S12 Fig</xref>), which are located within euchromatic regions, display a low-abundance of HPTMs. A distinguishing feature of these two clusters, which are not activated by the conventional SMB culture conditions applied here, is the lack of flanking by H3K9me3 domains which are characteristic for the majority of the analyzed SMB gene clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006222.s007">S7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006222.s013">S13</xref> Figs). Although truncated KdmB demethylates H3K9me3 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006222.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) we did not see increased levels of this mark in the <italic>kdmB</italic>&#x00394; mutant neither at specific loci nor at the genomic scale. This strongly suggests that <italic>in vivo</italic> H3K9me3 is not a target of KdmB. Moreover, no KDM5-type H3K9 demethylases have been described in other ascomycete fungi including <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> or <italic>N</italic>. <italic>crassa</italic>. In <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> we even see genome-wide reduced levels of this mark in the mutant and it is likely that this reduced H3K9me3 is an indirect consequence of increased H3K4me3 or increased H3 acetylation. In addition to H3K9me3, the chromatin landscape changes slightly also for the other tested marks when the silent SM gene clusters are activated. The majority of the genes in these clusters gain H3K36me3 at their 3&#x02019; region and H3Ac at their 5&#x02019; region. Marking by H3K4me3, however, only occurs for a limited number of genes within these clusters such as some selected genes within the ST cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006222.g008">Fig 8</xref>) or the <italic>orsD</italic> gene positioned within the ORS cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006222.s010">S10 Fig</xref>).</p><p>A similar situation was recently reported in two different <italic>Fusarium</italic> species in which the H3K4 dimethylation level (H3K4me2) was compared to SMB gene transcription. In the rice pathogen <italic>F</italic>. <italic>fujikuroi</italic>, only two out of seven highly transcribed genes in the gibberellin cluster were significantly decorated with H3K4me2 [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and also in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic>, a pathogen of wheat and maize, genes in the fusarin C or the carotenoid biosynthesis clusters carried only background levels of this mark [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It is still remarkable that Liu and colleagues found an essential function of the H3K4 methyltransferase Set1 for the expression of the TRI gene cluster coding for deoxynivalenol biosynthesis [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] and in this latter study, H3K4me2 was clearly enriched over the background level and positively correlated with active transcription. Additionally, in contrast to our study, Connolly et al. [<xref rid="pgen.1006222.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] found H3K36me3 enrichment across the whole chromosome independent of transcriptional activity. These comparisons already highlight the high diversity of chromatin-based regulation in SMB gene expression within one single organism and even more between different organisms and which histone modifications are determining whether the SMB signal is transmitted to the transcriptional machinery or not. Surprisingly, the H3K4 demethylase KdmB plays an essential role in the activation process although this histone mark is not present in the targeted regions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec012"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Strains, media, growth conditions and transformations</title><p><italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006222.s014">S1 Table</xref>.
