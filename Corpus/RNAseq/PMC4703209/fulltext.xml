The molecular characterisation of this process in <italic>Biomphalaria/Schistosoma</italic> system was undertaken to reconcile mechanisms with phenomena, opening the way to a better comprehension of innate immune memory in invertebrates.

This engenders selective pressures comparable to those experienced by Gnathostomes [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and means that invertebrates should possess sophisticated immune systems capable of dealing with such pathogens. Indeed, recent studies have shown that the immune defenses of invertebrates are more complex and specific than previously thought, and the existence of innate immune memory or priming has been suggested [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>To date, the observations of invertebrate innate immune memory have been mainly phenomenological and based on ecological or phenotypic studies, and little work has addressed the potential molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these processes. The innate immune system of invertebrates includes the barrier functions of the epithelium, the cellular immune response and the humoral defense response [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]: the former refers to mucosal immunity and hemocyte responses (phagocytosis, encapsulation, melanization), while the latter includes pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), antimicrobial peptides, coagulation, and the production of cytolytic molecules or reactive intermediates of oxygen and nitrogen [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. During the primary infection of an invertebrate, the pathogen is recognized at the first encounter and the cellular and humoral defense responses are coordinated to neutralize the intruder. To the best of our knowledge, the existing studies investigating the molecular mechanisms of innate immune memory in invertebrates have all suggested that the cellular immune response and/or hemocyte phagocytosis is/are improved upon a subsequent encounter with the same pathogen [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For example, in <italic>Porcellio scaber</italic>, enhanced phagocytosis was demonstrated after a first encounter with different bacteria species (<italic>Bacillus thuringiensis/Escherichia coli)</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>, hemocytic differentiation evidenced by increased mRNA levels of hemocyte-specific genes, such as thioester-containing protein 1 (TEP1) and leucine rich repeat immune protein 1 (LRIM1) was reported following initial exposures to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and bacteria [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In shrimp, bacterial challenge was followed by an enhanced cellular immunity characterized by a significant increase in the percentage of phagocytic cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The innate immune memory response in invertebrates has been previously described as being involved in two mechanisms, namely:</p><list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p>a process of acquired resistance or sustained response that consists of a long-lasting protection against a later challenge that persists even if the pathogen is neutralized; or</p></list-item><list-item><p>a recalled response that consists of the ability to store information of previously met pathogens and recall it later to generate a faster and more powerful response against a subsequent exposure to the same pathogen.</p></list-item></list><p>However, the international community working on invertebrate innate immunity believes that the existing innate immune memory observations cannot be used in isolation. Instead, they should be used to construct hypotheses that need now to be exhaustively tested with rigorous functional, cellular, biochemical and molecular methods, until all alternative explanations are eliminated [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. To fully understand the capabilities of invertebrate immune systems, we must use global molecular approaches at the whole-organism level to investigate the mechanisms that form the basis for innate immune memory, while being guided by the existing observations and phenotypic descriptions. Without this demonstration, the existence of immune memory process in invertebrates will remain controversial and doubted by many immunologists [for the polemic, see [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]].</p><p>Recently, we demonstrated that a primo-infection of the Lophotrochozoan vector snail, <italic>Biomphalaria glabrata</italic>, with <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> protected completely the snail against a homologous secondary challenge [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Total protection was reached 10 days after primo-infection, and was maintained for the rest of the snail&#x02019;s lifespan. Our findings provided evidence for the existence of a time-dependent acquired innate immune memory in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic> snails [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Moreover, we used homologous and heterologous challenges to demonstrate that this innate immune memory was genotype-dependent, in that the protection decreased with increasing neutral genetic distance between the parasites used for the primo-infection and the secondary challenge [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Here, we sought to investigate the molecular mechanisms of innate immune memory in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic> in response to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> infections. We precisely describe the snail&#x02019;s immune response phenotypes, then characterize the molecular determinants involved in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic> innate immune memory via a global transcriptomic approach and a targeted proteomic analysis of plasmatic factors performed in combination with RNA interference. This work provides the first global investigation of the molecular processes supporting innate immune memory in an invertebrate model. Moreover, <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> snails have an important role in the transmission of Schistosomiasis the second most widespread human parasitic disease after malaria causing 200,000 deaths annually. More emphasis on snail-related research, on the role of snails and parasite intramolluscan larval stages in transmission is essential for changing the way we attempt to eradicate parasitic diseases [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

For primo-infection, Brazilian <italic>Biomphalaria glabrata</italic> (BgBRE) snails were individually exposed to 10 miracidia of their sympatric Brazilian <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> trematode parasite (SmBRE). Following infection depending on the compatibility status of the snail/parasite couples, some of the miracidia were encapsulated by the hemocytes (snail immune cells) or developed into primary sporocysts (intra-molluscan stage of the parasite). Intramolluscan parasite stages include two generations of sporocysts (primary sporocyst (SPI) and secondary sporocyst (SPII)) and the production of cercariae. SPII developed inside SPI and migrated to reach the snail hepato-pancrea. Cercariae developed inside SPI and migrated back into the snail to reach the aquatic environment. Twenty-five days after primo-infection, the snails were challenged for a second time with again 10 SmBRE miracidia. In this case all miracidia degenerated in snail tissues, demonstrating the activation of a humoral immune response. Immune phenotypes observed during innate immune memory process were analyzed using a histological approach (see <xref rid="ppat.1005361.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A, 2B &#x00026; 2C</xref>). In order to explore the molecular mechanisms of innate immune memory several experimental procedures were designed. A RNAseq experiment was realized with samples recovered from uninfected snails (Naive 1, Naive 2), samples recovered at 1, 4, 15 and 25 days post primo-infection (DPPI) and at 1, 4 and 15 days post-secondary challenge (DPC) (see <xref rid="ppat.1005361.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Based on RNaseq results, functional validation of the FREP immune recognition receptor was undergone. First, individual quantification were made for all FREPs annotated on transcriptomic analysis (see <xref rid="ppat.1005361.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). FREP knockdown was then carried out by siRNA injection, normalized by siGFP and monitored by Q-RT-PCR (see <xref rid="ppat.1005361.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B &#x00026; 4C</xref>). Finally, to confirm the involvement of plasmatic factors in innate immune memory, snail hemolymph was recovered (Naive, 15, 25 DPPI and 15 DPC) and plasmatic fraction was characterized by 2D-gel electrophoresis (see <xref rid="ppat.1005361.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A &#x00026; 5B</xref>). Plasma samples were also injected to na&#x000ef;ve snails to demonstrate that immune protection could be acquired following primed snail plasma transfer (see <xref rid="ppat.1005361.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1005361.g001"/></fig><sec id="sec003"><title>Snail and parasite strains</title><p>The present work utilized a strain of <italic>Biomphalaria glabrata</italic> originating from Brazil (BgBRE), along with its 100% compatible sympatric strain of <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> (SmBRE).

Twenty more snails were recovered at each of 1, 4 and 15 days after the secondary challenge; equimolar amounts of each of these experimental groups were joined together into a single sample designated as days post-secondary challenge (DPC) sample.

Fifteen days post-challenge, snails were fixed and the parasite prevalence was determined by identifying schistosome primary sporocysts (SpI), in snails tissue as previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Proteomic screening of primed snail plasma</title><p>Hemolymph was collected from the head-foot region of 50 BgBRE snails (5 pools of 10 snails, 5 biological replicates) at each time point of the infection process (Na&#x000ef;ve, 15DPPI, 25DPPI, and 15DPC).

Five functional groups were identified: innate immune response proteins (receptors, effectors, and regulators), scavengers of reactive oxygen species, cell signaling proteins, gametogenesis-related proteins, and glycolysis-related proteins. Thirty seven percent of the identified molecules belonged to the innate immune response group (23 of 62 proteins) (<xref rid="ppat.1005361.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Consistent with our RNAseq results, we observed an important enrichment of potential humoral immune candidates in the plasma of primed snails. The molecules involved in immune recognition and opsonization included numerous isoforms belonging to different families of circulating immune receptors that were also identified in our transcriptomic analysis (e.g., C-type lectins, &#x003b2;-1,3-glucan binding protein, and hemagglutinin/amebocyte aggregation factors).

The latter finding suggests that the reactive oxygen species pathway may be activated as part of the humoral innate immune memory response of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic>. Moreover, RNAseq cluster 4 (molecules down-regulated upon secondary challenge) included transcripts whose products are involved in the epithelial and cellular immune response, such as macrophage mannose receptors, extracellular matrix compounds and mucins. This strengthens our contention that there is a shift from cellular or mucosal immunity to humoral immune response during the innate immune memory response in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic> snails.</p><p>An unexpected result of this study was the identification of RNAseq cluster 3 and proteomic cluster 1. Until now, innate immune memory was believed to be the result of two potential regulatory processes: (i) a sustained immune response consisting of the long-lasting up-regulation of immune molecules after a primo-infection (as observed in RNAseq cluster 1 and proteomic cluster 2); or (ii) a recalled response that consists of the ability to store information and recall it later for a faster and more powerful response against subsequent pathogenic exposure (never been observed in any of the RNAseq or proteomic clusters) [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Here, we provide the first report of a novel unexpected regulatory process for invertebrate innate immune memory, in which transcripts are specifically up regulated following the secondary challenge (RNAseq cluster 3, proteomic cluster 1) without having been previously activated by the primo-infection. This new observation warrants further study, such as through the identification of its potential molecular hallmarks, including the genetic (activation of transcription factors) and/or epigenetic (DNA methylation, chromatin markers, lncRNA, miRNA, etc.) factors that form the basis for this exclusive secondary challenge innate immune memory response.</p><p>To validate the potential roles played by the identified molecular candidates in the observed innate immune memory phenotype, we performed three sets of experiments: we used RNAi to knockdown certain FREPs and examined the priming response; we characterized the snail plasma proteome; and we examined the effect of injecting na&#x000ef;ve snails with plasma from primed snails.</p><p>As FREP lectins showed extensive differential representation following the secondary challenge (see <xref rid="ppat.1005361.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>), and they are known to play key roles in the immunobiological interactions between <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic>, they were chosen as candidates for RNAi invalidation. The FREPs comprise one or two amino-terminal immunoglobulin domains (IgSF) and a carboxyl-terminal fibrinogen domain (FBG). They belong to a multigene family of at least 14 members, and undergo somatic rearrangements leading to remarkable diversification [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. FREPs can precipitate soluble antigens derived from trematodes. Their expression levels increase in response to infection with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and they form immune complexes with similarly highly polymorphic and individually variable mucins (the <italic>Sm</italic>PoMucs) that act as antigens of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The high level of diversification within FREP family members results in a huge proportion of partial FREP transcript sequences generated by the RNAseq <italic>de novo</italic> assembly [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We were unable to precisely identify the FREP variants/isoforms present in the various RNAseq clusters. Thus, to confirm the role of FREPs in innate immune memory, we invalidated FREP 2, 3, and 4, as they had previously been demonstrated to be involved in the response of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic> to trematodes. More specifically, FREP 2 is involved in immune complexes [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]; FREP 3 knock-down reverts the snail resistance status to trematodes [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]; and microarray analysis showed that FREP 4 is over-expressed following infection by <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. SiRNA-mediated knock-down of FREP 2, 3 and 4 (<xref rid="ppat.1005361.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>) was found to reduce the innate immune memory phenotype by 15% (<xref rid="ppat.1005361.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). These results indicate that these FREPs are involved in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic> innate immune memory, but demonstrate also that additional molecular partners (and/or other FREP variants) also play roles in the pathogen recognition and innate immune memory of this snail.</p><p>Our characterization of the plasmatic proteome confirmed that most of the molecules identified in the RNAseq data were present and differentially expressed at the protein level. The presence of these molecules in snail plasma also confirms that they act as circulating humoral factors. The most promising candidates for participation in innate immune memory were found in protein cluster 1 (secondary challenge-specific proteins) and protein cluster 2 (sustained-response proteins) (<xref rid="ppat.1005361.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Numerous PRRs were identified (e.g., macrophage mannose receptors, C-type lectin, hemagglutinin, and &#x003b2; -1, 3-glucan binding proteins). Interestingly, we did not recover any FREP in this proteomic analysis of primed snail plasma. We speculate that the FREPs were lost from our analysis due to their precipitation with parasitic antigens [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Alternatively, and as suggested previously for other families of highly variable molecules [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], the different variants may be expressed at such low levels that they are not visible on 2D gel electrophoresis. Indeed, we recently demonstrated that FREPs are expressed at a low level compared to other PRRs in naive <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic> snails [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Plasmatic proteome was also composed of cytotoxic and cytolytic molecules, including antimicrobial peptides [AMPs; e.g., hydramicin, mytimacin and lipopolysaccharide binding protein/bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (LBP/BPI)], and the biomphalysin. We recently reported the molecular cloning and functional characterization of the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic> biomphalysin and its involvement in the killing of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Biomphalysin, which shares a common architecture with proteins belonging to the aerolysin superfamily, is strictly expressed in immune-competent cells. Recombinant biomphalysin was shown to bind to parasitic membranes and exhibit cytotoxic activity toward <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> sporocysts. Our RNAseq and proteomic analyses primarily recovered immune recognition factors, many of which had multiple isoforms. This suggests the involvement of both translational and post-translational regulation. Additional work is now needed to clarify the functions of these molecules in the humoral innate immune memory response of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic>. For example, C-type lectins are known to be involved in the innate immune memory responses of mollusks; their expression levels increased in the scallop, <italic>Chlamys farreri</italic>, following vaccination with heat-killed <italic>Vibrio anguillarum</italic>, and successive challenges with <italic>V</italic>. <italic>anguillarum</italic> or <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic> enhanced this protection [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In addition to their roles in pathogen recognition and opsonization, lectins also possess direct cytotoxic activities. Examples of cytotoxic lectins include plant-derived ricin from <italic>Ricinus communis</italic> beans [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], the fungus-derived N-acetyl-D-galactosamine-specific lectin from <italic>Schizophyllum commune</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and the invertebrate-derived hemolytic lectin, CELIII, from <italic>Cucumaria echinata</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Thus, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that some of the lectins identified in the present study may participate in the humoral innate immune memory response both as recognition receptors and as cytotoxic/cytolytic molecules involved in killing the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> SpIs of the secondary challenge.</p><p>Lastly, we explored whether the transfer of plasma from primo-infected snails could provide recipient na&#x000ef;ve snails with enhanced immunity. In a previous study, plasma transfer from <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic>-resistant <italic>Biomphalaria tenagophila</italic> to susceptible snails was associated with a transfer of resistance [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Here, we found that transfer of primed snail plasma to naive snails significantly reduced the prevalence of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> infection by more than 20% compared to controls (<xref rid="ppat.1005361.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). A comparable experiment was previously performed using the mosquito, <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>, and its bacterial pathogens [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The transfer of cell-free hemolymph from infected mosquitoes into healthy mosquitoes triggered increases in the hemocyte populations of transferred mosquitoes, indicating that humoral factors could promote a cellular immune response that protected mosquitoes against subsequent bacterial challenges [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In <italic>Biomphalaria</italic>, plasma transfer experiments demonstrated that soluble humoral factors are released into the hemolymph of primed snails, and that the transfer of such factors activates/regulates the humoral immune response in recipients and confers enhanced antischistosomal immunity against subsequent encounters with the pathogen.</p><p>To conclude, we evidence for the first time the molecular basis of innate immune memory in an invertebrate model, and we demonstrate the role of humoral factors in such phenomenon. The previous studies addressing the molecular mechanisms of innate immune memory in invertebrates have mainly suggested the involvement of elevated hemocyte phagocytosis [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic>, innate immune memory seems to be supported by humoral factors that trigger the degeneration/death of the parasite. Moreover the innate immune memory protection was previously shown to decrease with increasing neutral genetic distance between the parasite used for the primo-infection and the one used for the secondary challenge [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. We hypothesized that better protection against a homologous (vs. heterologous) secondary infection involves the mobilization of specific repertoires of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic> immune receptors to target certain subsets of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> genotypes. Our present findings prompt us to speculate that the genotype-dependent innate immune memory of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic> may be supported by a diverse repertoire of FREPs and other PRRs (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1005361.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005361.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). As previously suggested [<xref rid="ppat.1005361.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], PRRs might serve as collaborative recognition factors that can be processed as homologous or heterologous multimers, which then act as immune recognition complexes to increase the host&#x02019;s PRR repertoire and mediating anti-pathogen responses. Once recognized, the pathogen is neutralized by the release of cytotoxic/cytolytic circulating factors. Here, we demonstrate that biomphalysin is highly transcribed following secondary challenge and consumed at the protein level during innate immune memory response, suggesting that biomphalysin may play a major role in neutralizing the pathogen following immune recognition. Clearly, future studies are needed to fully understand how these molecules mediate and regulate the specificity of the innate immune memory defense seen in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic>.</p><p>To reconcile mechanisms with phenomena a molecular characterisation of innate immune memory in <italic>Biomphalaria/Schistosoma</italic> model was undertook. Transcriptomic, proteomic, and functional validation lead us to a new molecular comprehension of innate immune memory processes and prompted us to revisit the artificial dichotomy between innate and memory immunity in invertebrate systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1005361.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Correlation between RNAseq and Q-RT-PCR.</title><p>The correlations between the RNAseq reads per kilobase per million (log2 RPKM) values and the corresponding Q-RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values were calculated and shown for 36 randomly selected transcripts.
