We have previously described that the expression of CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) increases during monocyte differentiation to macrophages and it is further up-modulated by HIV-1 exposure. Moreover, CCL2 acts as an autocrine factor that promotes viral replication in infected macrophages. In this study, we dissected the molecular mechanisms by which CCL2 neutralization inhibits HIV-1 replication in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), and the potential involvement of the innate restriction factors protein sterile alpha motif (SAM) histidine/aspartic acid (HD) domain containing 1 (SAMHD1) and apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing, enzyme-catalytic, polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3) family members.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>CCL2 neutralization potently reduced the number of p24 Gag<sup>+</sup> cells during the course of either productive or single cycle infection with HIV-1. In contrast, CCL2 blocking did not modify entry of HIV-1 based Virus Like Particles, thus demonstrating that the restriction involves post-entry steps of the viral life cycle. Notably, the accumulation of viral DNA, both total, integrated and 2-LTR circles, was strongly impaired by neutralization of CCL2. Looking for correlates of HIV-1 DNA accumulation inhibition, we found that the antiviral effect of CCL2 neutralization was independent of the modulation of SAMHD1 expression or function. Conversely, a strong and selective induction of APOBEC3A expression, to levels comparable to those of freshly isolated monocytes, was associated with the inhibition of HIV-1 replication mediated by CCL2 blocking. Interestingly, the CCL2 neutralization mediated increase of APOBEC3A expression was type I IFN independent. Moreover, the transcriptome analysis of the effect of CCL2 blocking on global gene expression revealed that the neutralization of this chemokine resulted in the upmodulation of additional genes involved in the defence response to viruses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Neutralization of endogenous CCL2 determines a profound restriction of HIV-1 replication in primary MDM affecting post-entry steps of the viral life cycle with a mechanism independent of SAMHD1. In addition, CCL2 blocking is associated with induction of APOBEC3A expression, thus unravelling a novel mechanism which might contribute to regulate the expression of innate intracellular viral antagonists <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, our study may potentially lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for enhancing innate cellular defences against HIV-1 and protecting macrophages from infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12977-014-0132-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Monocyte-derived macrophage</kwd><kwd>CCL2</kwd><kwd>HIV-1</kwd><kwd>Restriction</kwd><kwd>SAMHD1</kwd><kwd>APOBEC3A</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Early after its discovery, it has been established that HIV-1, like other retroviruses, infects not only CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes but also macrophages. The presence of HIV-1-infected macrophages <italic>in vivo</italic> has been documented in various tissues, including brain, lung and gut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Although their precise contribution to the infection and pathogenesis of HIV-1 is still a matter of debate, the importance of macrophages in these processes is highlighted by their involvement in early-stage viral transmission, persistence, and virus dissemination throughout the body of the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Once infected, macrophages promote rapid virus dissemination by transmitting viral particles to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells via a transit &#x0201c;virological synapse&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. As macrophage has the ability to cross the blood-tissue barrier and to migrate into tissues, HIV-infected macrophages are potent agents for viral delivery to all tissues and organs. Macrophages are considered as viral reservoirs because they are long-lived cells resistant to the cytopathic effects of HIV-1 and &#x0201c;hide&#x0201d; the virus in safe intracellular compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This allows maintaining a hidden HIV-1 reservoir for ongoing infection, hardly eradicable by currently available pharmacological therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, efforts directed to defining the mechanisms and factors controlling HIV-1 replication in macrophages may provide the basis for devising new, long-term successful treatment of infected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Chemokines and their receptors are deeply involved in the control of HIV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In addition to CCR5- and CXCR4-binding chemokines interfering with HIV-1 infection at the entry level, other chemokines have been shown to play a role in this infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In particular, CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2; formerly monocyte chemotactic protein-1, MCP-1) is induced during several human acute and chronic viral infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In addition to HIV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], virus-derived proteins such as gp120 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], Nef [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], matrix protein p17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and transactivator protein Tat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] increase the expression and release of this chemokine. CCL2 is produced by a variety of cell types, with monocytes/macrophages representing the major source among leukocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Although the precise contribution of CCL2 in HIV-1 infection and pathogenesis remains to be established, growing evidence suggests that it may play important roles in these processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We previously found that CCL2 is up-regulated during monocyte differentiation to macrophages and it is further increased upon HIV-1 infection or exposure to viral proteins. Furthermore, this chemokine acts as an autocrine factor that sustains viral replication in HIV-1 infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, the mechanism(s) by which CCL2 fosters HIV-1 production remains to be elucidated.</p><p>A variety of host cell factors can interfere with HIV-1 replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Among these, the protein sterile alpha motif (SAM) histidine/aspartic acid (HD) domain containing 1 (SAMHD1) was recently identified as a restriction factor in myeloid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. SAMHD1 is a dGTP-regulated deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTP) hydrolase that limits the pool of dNTP available for reverse transcription, therefore reducing HIV-1 infection of myeloid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Recently, it has been shown that SAMHD1 can restrict HIV-1 infection also through degradation of viral RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In addition to SAMHD1, members of the apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing, enzyme-catalytic, polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3; A3) family of cytidine deaminases are potent innate intracellular viral antagonists which restrict HIV-1 replication in target cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The human genome encodes seven A3 genes (A3A, A3B, A3C, A3D/E, A3F, A3G and A3H) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. A3 proteins are widely expressed in hematopoietic cell populations, including T cells, B cells and myeloid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In particular, A3A and A3G are critical for monocyte resistance to infection and their decreased expression during macrophage differentiation results in a permissive target cell population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Beyond the well known capacity of type I interferon to induce the expression of some A3 family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], little is known concerning the factors and mechanisms regulating the expression of these enzymes in myeloid cells. Thus, their identification might offer great opportunities to prevent HIV-1 from infecting and persisting in macrophages.</p><p>In this study, we aimed at dissecting the molecular mechanisms by which CCL2 blocking restricts HIV-1 replication in macrophages. We report that neutralization of this chemokine reduces the number of infected macrophages, without affecting viral entry, and impairs viral DNA accumulation. Interestingly, whereas SAMHD1 expression and function are not altered by CCL2 blocking, a strong and selective induction of A3A expression is associated with the CCL2 neutralization-mediated restriction of HIV-1 replication. Therefore, our study highlights the potential of targeting this chemokine to impair early steps of HIV-1 replication and to strengthen innate intracellular pathways to thwart HIV-1 infection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Neutralization of endogenous CCL2 reduces the proportion of HIV-1 infected MDM</title><p>In our previous studies we found that CCL2 neutralization reduced the release of p24 Gag antigen in HIV-1 infected monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. To examine the mechanisms by which CCL2 blocking inhibits HIV-1 replication in these cells, experiments were performed to assess whether neutralization of this chemokine affected the total number of infected cells. Toward this aim, MDM cultures established from several donors were exposed for 20&#x000a0;h to anti-CCL2 or control antibody (Ab) and then challenged with HIV-1<sub>BaL</sub>. The proportion of infected cells was determined 14&#x000a0;days post-infection by flow cytometry after permeabilization and staining for intracellular p24 Gag. A marked variability in the percentage of p24 Gag<sup>+</sup> cells was observed among donors, ranging from 2.4 to 77.3% [median value: 28.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.4 (SE); n&#x02009;=&#x02009;22]. Despite this variability, treatment with anti-CCL2 Ab strongly reduced the percentage of p24 Gag<sup>+</sup> cells in all the donors analyzed (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). In spite of an occasional effect of control Ab on this parameter, anti-CCL2 Ab significantly reduced the proportion of p24 Gag<sup>+</sup> cells with respect to control Ab treatment in all the donors analyzed. In particular, as shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B, exposure to anti-CCL2 Ab reduced the fraction of p24 Gag<sup>+</sup> cells to 0.23&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.04 (SE) fold compared to control Ab treatment (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). In keeping with previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], the reduction of infected cells was associated with a marked inhibition of the release of p24 Gag in culture medium of MDM treated with anti-CCL2 Ab [0.19&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.05 (SE) fold <italic>vs.</italic> control Ab; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001]. Furthermore, an increase of CCL2 production following HIV-1 infection was found in these donors. In particular, at 14&#x000a0;days post-infection the median CCL2 secretion in uninfected cells was 8,410.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1,027.5 (SE) pg/ml, whereas it increased to 18,982.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2,102.1 (SE) pg/ml (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) upon infection with HIV-1. Measurement of CCL2 release in Ab treated cultures showed that the anti-CCL2 Ab effectively neutralized the chemokine produced by MDM (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1A).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Neutralization of endogenous CCL2 reduces the proportion of HIV-1 infected MDM.</bold> MDM were treated with anti-CCL2 or control Ab (2.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml) for 20&#x000a0;h. <bold>(A, B)</bold> Cells were then infected with HIV-1<sub>BaL</sub> (3000 TCID<sub>50</sub> per well) as described in Methods.

To this aim, we used a recombinant virus, mutated in the e<italic>nv</italic> gene and pseudotyped with Vesicular Stomatitis Virus G-protein (VSV-G), which enters macrophages through a CD4/CCR5-independent pathway and completes only a single round of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. MDM exposed for 20&#x000a0;h to anti-CCL2 or control Ab were challenged with (VSV-G) HIV-1 and the percentage of p24 Gag<sup>+</sup> cells was measured 3&#x000a0;days post-infection. The percentage of p24 Gag<sup>+</sup> cells ranged from 17.1 to 77.5% [median value: 49.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;24.7 (SE); n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4]. Despite this variability, treatment with anti-CCL2 Ab markedly reduced the percentage of p24 Gag<sup>+</sup> MDM in all the donors analyzed (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). In particular, the proportion of p24 Gag<sup>+</sup> cells following treatment with anti-CCL2 Ab was reduced to 0.41&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.16 (SE) fold with respect to untreated cells (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Control experiments were performed in the presence of the reverse-transcriptase inhibitor zidovudine (AZT) to ensure that the detected fraction of infected cells was not biased by cell membrane-attached p24 Gag. As expected, a strong reduction in the fraction of p24 Gag<sup>+</sup> cells was observed in the presence of AZT. Measurement of CCL2 release in Ab treated cultures showed that the anti-CCL2 Ab effectively neutralized the chemokine produced by MDM also in these conditions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1B).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Endogenous CCL2 neutralization does not affect entry of HIV-1 in MDM</title><p>We then investigated whether CCL2 blocking-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 replication could be due to reduced viral entry in MDM. To this aim, we used fluorescent HIV-1-based Viral Like Particles (VLPs) pseudotyped with either VSV-G or R5 HIV-1 Env from the Ada strain (VSV-G-VLPs and Ada-VLPs, respectively), which has been previously shown to enter different types of cells with high efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. MDM exposed for 20&#x000a0;h to anti-CCL2 or control Ab were challenged with VLPs and the percentage of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells was measured after 2 and 4&#x000a0;h of incubation at 37&#x000b0;C. Control experiments were performed by incubating cells at 4&#x000b0;C. As shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, about 50% of MDM were GFP<sup>+</sup> following 2&#x000a0;h of incubation with VSV-G-VLPs, whereas viral entry driven by Ada-VLPs was less efficient and rendered fluorescent about 10% of the cells. Similar proportions of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were detected following 4&#x000a0;h of incubation at 37&#x000b0;C. Interestingly, treatment with anti-CCL2 or control Ab did not modify entry of either Ada-VLPs or VSV-G-VLPs (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2).

As expected, a strong reduction in the fraction of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells was observed in these conditions, thus confirming that the fluorescence detected in target cells indeed relied on authentic viral fusion events (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Microscopic analysis of target cells showed a strong fluorescence associated with VSV-G-VLPs challenged MDM, while a significant lower signal was detected in the cells challenged with Ada-VLPs (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C). Finally, the internalization of VLPs was further confirmed by confocal microscope analysis (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>

Studies conducted thus far have shown a multifaceted impact of CCL2 in HIV-1 pathogenesis and disease progression. In particular, CCL2, mainly produced by monocytes/macrophages both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, recruits CCR2<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages, which represent key target cells for HIV-1 infection. This chemokine also enhances viral replication in T cells by increasing CXCR4 expression and HIV-1 entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic>, high CCL2 levels in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of HIV-infected individuals correlate with viral load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Moreover, a genetic polymorphism in the <italic>CCL2</italic> gene (2518G/A), linked to an increased production of the protein, is associated with increased risk of HIV-1 infection, disease progression and development of HIV-associated dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Finally, the increase in plasma viremia observed in acutely HIV-infected individuals is associated with a rapid and sustained elevation in CCL2 plasma levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].</p><p>We have previously found that CCL2 expression was up-regulated during monocyte differentiation to macrophages and it was further increased by HIV-1 infection; conversely, endogenously released CCL2 promoted HIV-1 replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Consistently, infection of MDM with HIV-1 in the presence of anti-CCL2 Ab resulted in a potent inhibition of p24 Gag Ag release with respect to control cells, in the intracellular accumulation of this viral antigen and in remarkable changes in cell morphology and size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Thus, CCL2 may represent an autocrine factor important for enhancing virion production likely by affecting the macrophage cytoskeleton. The present study indicates that additional, early post-entry steps of the HIV-1 life cycle are also impaired upon CCL2 blocking. In fact, we report here that neutralization of CCL2 potently reduces the proportion of p24 Gag<sup>+</sup> cells during the course of either a productive infection with R5 HIV-1<sub>BaL</sub> or a single cycle infection with (VSV-G) HIV-1. Since neither HIV-1 based VLP entrance nor reverse transcription immediate products levels are affected by CCL2 blocking, the mechanism of CCL2 neutralization-mediated restriction occurs independently of HIV-1 entry and RT activity. Conversely, CCL2 blocking potently limits the accumulation of viral DNA, both total, integrated and 2-LTR circles.</p><p>In the present study we also provide evidence that endogenous CCL2 may represent an autocrine factor acting as a negative regulator of A3A expression in macrophages. In fact, targeting CCL2 induces A3A mRNA and protein expression to levels observed in freshly isolated monocytes. This effect is specific for A3A among the A3 family of cytidine deaminases, since the expression of the other A3 enzymes, including the most characterized anti-HIV protein A3G, is not induced by CCL2 blocking. Interestingly, the increase of A3A expression elicited by CCL2 neutralization in MDM occurs independently of type I IFN. The identification of an IFN independent pathway of A3A induction is of significance, particularly in the context of viral infection. Most viruses, including HIV-1, are known to evade the host immune response by blocking IFN-mediated anti-viral responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Intriguingly, it has been shown that SIV infected astrocytes produce CCL2 that binds to the CCR2 receptors on macrophages resulting in suppression of specific IFN stimulated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Our finding, showing that the A3A antiviral response can be activated through a mechanism other than the IFN-driven one, unravels a novel pathway which may contribute to regulate the expression of this enzyme <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In addition to CCL2, other CC chemokines, namely CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5, are constitutively released by MDM and their production can be further increased following HIV-1 infection of these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Our data indicate that neutralization of these chemokines does not affect A3A protein levels. Thus, modulation of A3A expression seems to be a CCL2 specific task and not a general function of chemokines. CCR2 is the only CCL2 receptor described thus far. Two different isoforms of this receptor, named a and b, have been identified. They represent alternatively spliced variants of a single gene that differ only in their carboxyl tails. In a previous study we demonstrated that monocyte differentiation to macrophages resulted in a decrease of CCR2 mRNA, particularly the b isoform, as well as of CCR2 levels at the plasma membrane. The decrease of CCR2 expression was associated with a reduced biological response of MDM to CCL2 in terms of calcium flux and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. In the present study, the role of CCR2 in the CCL2-mediated modulation of A3A expression was not investigated. However, we speculate that low levels of CCR2 expression could mediate the observed phenotype. Furthermore, both increased CCR2 expression and enhanced response to CCL2 have been described in HIV-1-infected leukocytes by other groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Thus, it cannot be excluded that enhanced CCR2 expression in HIV-1 infected macrophages could contribute to the observed effects on viral replication and A3A expression. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that an endogenous chemokine can act as a negative regulator of A3 protein expression. In this regard, previous studies reported that triggering of CCR5 or CCR6 by CCL3 and HSP70 or CCL20 and human &#x003b2;-defensin 2, respectively, supported A3G expression. Interestingly, in these studies the increase in A3G levels was associated with inhibition of HIV-1 replication in CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes and dendritic cells (DC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>].</p><p>Since the identification of A3 cytidine deaminases as HIV-1 antiviral factors, a considerable amount of studies have explored the role of these proteins in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection and the underlying mechanisms of action. Cells belonging to the myeloid lineage express all members of the A3 family, but A3A is the only one restricted to these cells among the white blood cells targets of HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. A3A shares sequence and functional homology with A3G and is a potent inhibitor of retrotrasposons, Parvovirus and HTLV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Its role as inhibitor of HIV-1 replication is controversial. In fact, although past studies indicated that A3A does not exert an anti-HIV activity in established cell lines in which it is ectopically expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], more recent studies revealed that an anti-HIV activity is explicit only in cells in which A3A is naturally expressed, i.e. myeloid cells. In this regard, Berger and colleagues reported that the pool of A3A present in primary macrophages, DCs and differentiated THP-1 cells (that mimic macrophages upon differentiation) is directly capable of inhibiting incoming viruses at the reverse transcription step. In that study, A3A expression has been shown to be up-regulated in MDM exposed to HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. We do not observe such effect in our infected MDM cultures, in which A3A is increased over the basal level only as a consequence of CCL2 neutralization. The apparent discrepancy between these results and ours can be, at least in part, explained by the different protocol used for monocyte culture, which may greatly influence the ability of MDM to activate innate immune reactions and support HIV-1 replication. To this regard, it has been recently shown that MDM generated in the presence of M-CSF are more permissive to HIV-1 replication, but paradoxically have a strongest innate immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Furthermore, additional studies pointed to an up-regulated expression of A3A as the causal factor of the restriction of HIV-1 replication elicited by different conditions in myeloid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. In particular, exposure to exogenous type I IFNs, or to the type I IFN-inducing cytokine IL-27, has been shown to stimulate A3A expression in both macrophages and DCs and to inhibit HIV-1 replication in the former and viral spread to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the latter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. In macrophages, treatment with IFN-&#x003b1; resulted in a strong induction of A3A expression and reduction of HIV-1 DNA accumulation, associated with an increased G-to-A editing of viral DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Finally, Cassetta and co-workers reported that restriction of HIV-1 replication in M1 polarized macrophages was associated with the up-regulated expression of A3A, but not A3G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>].</p><p>Although in this study we demonstrate that CCL2 neutralization impairs HIV-1 DNA accumulation, the cellular factors that sustain this inhibition remain to be identified and the mechanisms deciphered. Keeping in mind the effect on viral DNA accumulation, a role for host restriction factor(s) affecting this step of the HIV-1 life cycle might be suggested. In this regard, we excluded the involvement of SAMHD1 in this phenomenon. In fact, our data strongly indicate that neither altered SAMHD1 expression nor function likely account for the restriction of HIV-1 replication mediated by CCL2 neutralization. Although SAMHD1 has been shown to reduce the pool of dNTPs thus inhibiting the reverse transcription step especially in myeloid cells, a recent study reported that this factor moderately restricts a macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strain in MDM, whereas it potently inhibits HIV-1 replication in undifferentiated monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. In accordance with this report, it has been shown by other groups that SAMHD1 is not a major effector of the early type I IFN-mediated block toward HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Furthermore, our data indicate that CCL2 blocking does not affect the expression of Mx2, recently shown to restrict HIV-1 replication by inhibiting the nuclear accumulation and integration of HIV-1 reverse transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Conversely, we found a strong association between CCL2 neutralization-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 replication and induction of A3A expression. Interestingly, the levels of A3A expression elicited by CCL2 blocking in MDM are comparable to those of freshly isolated monocytes, where this enzyme has been demonstrated to restrict HIV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In keeping with these data, other groups reported that inhibition of HIV-1 DNA accumulation in myeloid cells was correlated to A3A expression in different conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. However, since our efforts to deplete A3A protein in anti-CCL2 Ab-treated MDM using siRNA have not been successful, as already experienced by other groups in different experimental settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>], we could not formally prove the involvement of this protein in the observed inhibition of viral replication. Thus far, we cannot rule out the possibility that other not yet identified factors may be involved in the restriction of HIV-1 replication elicited by CCL2 blocking. In this regard, our data show that other genes related to the defense response to viruses are upmodulated in MDM exposed to anti-CCL2 Ab, thus suggesting that several factors might contribute to the restriction of HIV-1 replication elicited by CCL2 neutralization. Future work is required to define whether the CCL2 blocking-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 replication in MDM is associated or not with an increased G-to-A editing of viral DNA and/or with others mechanisms of HIV-1 restriction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Neutralization of macrophage-derived CCL2 potently restricts HIV-1 replication by inhibiting early post-entry steps of the viral life cycle. Since macrophages represent potential viral reservoirs capable of producing replication-competent HIV-1 virions even in the presence of effective combination antiretroviral therapy, targeting CCL2 may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for enhancing cellular defences against HIV-1 and protecting macrophages from infection. Interestingly, enhanced CCL2 expression has been also found in ectocervical tissue explants following HIV-1 infection, and neutralization of the chemokine in this experimental system has been shown to result in viral transcription decrease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. Thus, since the heterosexual route through female reproductive tract mucosal surfaces is the predominant mode of HIV-1 transmission, targeting CCL2 may offer a tantalizing possibility of leveraging innate immunity to fend off viral infection at the entry route.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Ethics statements</title><p>Healthy donor Buffy coats were obtained from Centro Trasfusionale-University of Rome &#x0201c;Sapienza&#x0201d;.

The concentration of the extracted DNA was determined by Real Time PCR quantitative amplification of RNase P gene using TaqMan RNase P Detection Reagents Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Total HIV-1 DNA amount was determined using primers and probe that recognize the HIV-1 <italic>gag</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. Standard curve was generated using the genomic DNA from the 8E5 cell line, a T lymphoblastoid cell line that contains a single defective copy of HIV-1 genome per cell.</p><p>Integrated HIV DNA was quantified by a two-step <italic>Alu-gag</italic> PCR assay. The first PCR was performed in triplicate for each sample, using two primers annealing to Alu sequences (AluFw 5&#x02032;-<italic>GCCTCCCAAAGTGCTGGGATTACAG</italic>-3&#x02032;; AluS 5&#x02032;-<italic>TCCCAGCTACTGGGGAGGCTGAGG</italic>-3&#x02032;; final concentration: 100nM each) and one primer annealing to <italic>gag</italic> gene (HIV-gag Rev nt 1505&#x02013;1486: 5&#x02032;- <italic>GTTCCTGCTATGTCACTTCC</italic>-3&#x02032;; final concentration: 600nM). Samples were amplified in triplicate also with the HIV-gag Rev primer alone (<italic>gag-only</italic> PCRs) in order to establish whether the level of integration is detectable (see below). Standard curve was generated using serial dilutions of genomic DNA extracted from a standard cell line prepared as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. The number of HIV proviruses per cell of the standard cell line was calculated with the same procedure used to calculate total HIV-1 DNA and then adjusting the result by the number of assayed cells calculated by RnaseP gene quantification. The standard curve ranged from 10,000 to 1 integrated HIV-1 copies per well. To keep the number of <italic>Alu</italic> DNA sites constant in each reaction, uninfected PBMC genomic DNA was added to each sample (including standards and controls) to reach the concentration of 70&#x000a0;ng of genomic DNA per well. The parameters for the first PCR were as follows: 10&#x000a0;min at 95&#x000b0;C followed by 25&#x000a0;cycles at 95&#x000b0;C for 15&#x000a0;sec, 50&#x000b0;C for 15&#x000a0;sec and 72&#x000b0;C for 3&#x000a0;min and 30&#x000a0;sec and finally 5&#x000a0;min at 72&#x000b0;C. The second real-time PCR step detects HIV-specific products by using primers annealing to the R and U5 regions within the HIV LTR: RU5 R forward (5&#x02032;-<italic>TTAAGCCTCAATAAAGCTTGCC</italic>-3&#x02032;), RU5 U5 reverse (5&#x02032;-<italic>GTTCGGGCGCCACTGCTAGA</italic>-3&#x02032;) and RU5 Probe (5&#x02032;- <italic>CCAGAGTCACACAACAGACGGGCACA</italic>-3&#x02032;); this real-time PCR was performed on 5 ul from each replicate of both <italic>Alu-gag</italic> and <italic>gag-only</italic> PCRs of standard curve and unknown samples. The PCR parameters were as follows: 3&#x000a0;min at 95&#x000b0;C followed by 45&#x000a0;cycles at 95&#x000b0;C for 3&#x000a0;sec and 60&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;sec. Student&#x02019;s t-test was performed to determine whether Cts derived from the <italic>Alu-gag</italic> PCRs were significantly lower than those from the <italic>gag-only</italic> reactions. If <italic>Alu-gag</italic> Cts are statistically lower than <italic>gag-only</italic> Cts (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) for the same sample, HIV-1 integrated copies can be calculated with reference to the standard curve. Otherwise, the level of integration is to be considered below the limit of detection of the assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>].</p><p>The 2-LTR DNA circles were quantified by SYBR Green real-time PCR and amplified from extracted DNA with 25 nM forward primers HIV-F (<italic>5&#x02032;-TGTGCCCGTCTGTTGTGTGACT-3&#x02032;</italic>) and 25 nM reverse primer HIV-R1 (<italic>5&#x02032;-TGGTGCTACAAGCTAGTACCAGT-3&#x02032;</italic>) spanning the LTR&#x02013;LTR junction (modified protocol from Reigadas S et al.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. A plasmid containing the 2-LTR junction sequence was used to generate the standard curve (ranging from 10,000 to 1 copy) for 2-LTR DNA circles quantification; each curve point was obtained diluting the plasmid DNA in 50&#x000a0;ng of genomic DNA from HIV negative donors PBMCs. The PCR parameters were as follows: 20&#x000a0;sec at 95&#x000b0;C followed by 45&#x000a0;cycles at 95&#x000b0;C for 3&#x000a0;sec and 62&#x000b0;C for 1&#x000a0;min.

HIV-1 DNA load and HIV-1 2-LTR circles load were normalized to the amount of cellular DNA by quantification of RNAseP copies and were expressed as number of copies/10<sup>6</sup> cells. The limit of detection was 2 copies/10<sup>6</sup> cells for total HIV-1 DNA and 200 copies/10<sup>6</sup> cells for HIV-1 2-LTR circles.
