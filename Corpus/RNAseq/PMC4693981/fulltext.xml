Here we focused on three mutations that rose to high frequency in the early stages of adaptation within 12 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> populations subjected to thermal stress (42 &#x000b0;C). All the mutations were in the <italic>rpoB</italic> gene, which encodes the RNA polymerase beta subunit. For each mutation, we measured the growth curves and gene expression (mRNAseq) of clones at 42 &#x000b0;C. We also compared growth and gene expression with their ancestor under unstressed (37 &#x000b0;C) and stressed conditions (42 &#x000b0;C). Each of the three mutations changed the expression of hundreds of genes and conferred large fitness advantages, apparently through the restoration of global gene expression from the stressed toward the prestressed state. These three mutations had a similar effect on gene expression as another single mutation in a distinct domain of the <italic>rpoB</italic> protein. Finally, we compared the phenotypic characteristics of one mutant, <italic>I572L</italic>, with two high-temperature adapted clones that have this mutation plus additional background mutations. The background mutations increased fitness, but they did not substantially change gene expression. We conclude that early mutations in a global transcriptional regulator cause extensive changes in gene expression, many of which are likely under positive selection for their effect in restoring the prestress physiology.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>experimental evolution</kwd><kwd>bacterial adaptation</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Organisms are often exposed to stressful environments. To cope, they have evolved responses based on the duration of the stress. For example, bacteria that are exposed to increased temperatures display a transient heat shock response, which involves upregulation of genes encoding heat stress proteins (<xref rid="msv228-B50" ref-type="bibr">Richter et al. 2010</xref>), followed by a period of phenotypic acclimation (<xref rid="msv228-B23" ref-type="bibr">Gunasekera et al. 2008</xref>). If the environmental stress is sustained over a long period of time, individuals may eventually accumulate mutations that result in long-term adaptation of the population. Although acute responses to stress have been well characterized (<xref rid="msv228-B23" ref-type="bibr">Gunasekera et al. 2008</xref>), the mechanisms of stress acclimation and adaptation are understood less well (<xref rid="msv228-B51" ref-type="bibr">Riehle et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B23" ref-type="bibr">Gunasekera et al. 2008</xref>).</p><p>One possible mechanism for adaptation to stressful conditions is genetic change that produces novel traits or new physiological functions, such as antibiotic resistance or the ability to use new metabolic pathways (<xref rid="msv228-B5" ref-type="bibr">Blount et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B47" ref-type="bibr">Quandt et al. 2014</xref>). Another mechanism is genetic change that confers restoration of cellular functions to a prestressed state. Rather than creating new functions, restorative mutations revert some aspect of the individuals&#x02019; altered physiological state back to an unstressed or &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; state (<xref rid="msv228-B8" ref-type="bibr">Carroll and Marx 2013</xref>). This pattern of restoration has been recently observed during metabolic perturbation and high-temperature adaptation (<xref rid="msv228-B21" ref-type="bibr">Fong et al. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B8" ref-type="bibr">Carroll and Marx 2013</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B55" ref-type="bibr">Sandberg et al. 2014</xref>). Although both novelty and restoration likely drive long-term adaptation, it is not yet clear which is more frequent.</p><p>Another issue that remains largely unexplored is the temporal pace of phenotypic change during adaptation to stress. After an environment becomes stressful, the acclimated state becomes the initial phenotypic state upon which natural selection acts. Thereafter, each adaptive mutation moves the population toward a phenotypic optimum (i.e., to a phenotype that best fits the stressful environment; <xref rid="msv228-B20" ref-type="bibr">Fisher 1930</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B43" ref-type="bibr">Orr 2005</xref>). For historical and methodological reasons (<xref rid="msv228-B43" ref-type="bibr">Orr 2005</xref>), most evolutionary studies have focused on the end product of adaptation, leaving the early and intermediate steps of adaptation largely unexplored.</p><p>Fortunately, studies on experimental evolution may provide insight into the sequential magnitude of fitness changes during adaptation. To date, these studies have shown that the first beneficial mutation, or the &#x0201c;first-step mutation,&#x0201d; generally confers a large fitness advantage, perhaps because early, large-effect mutations outcompete other beneficial mutations in the population. In contrast, subsequent mutations confer more moderate fitness gains (<xref rid="msv228-B10" ref-type="bibr">Chou et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B33" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al. 2011</xref>), in part due to diminishing returns epistasis (<xref rid="msv228-B35" ref-type="bibr">Kryazhimskiy et al. 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although our knowledge about the temporal trajectory of fitness continues to grow, few studies have examined shifts in phenotypes during the adaptive process. One exception is the study of <xref rid="msv228-B21" ref-type="bibr">Fong et al. (2005)</xref>, which used microarrays to follow the phenotype of gene expression (GE) after a shift in growth from glucose to lactate and from glucose to glycerol (<xref rid="msv228-B21" ref-type="bibr">Fong et al. 2005</xref>). <xref rid="msv228-B21" ref-type="bibr">Fong et al. (2005)</xref> observed that 39% of genes were differentially expressed during the process of acclimation to glycerol medium; however, the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) decreased at an intermediate point of adaptation and also at the endpoint of the experiment. Most of the GE changes during adaptation were restorative (<xref rid="msv228-B21" ref-type="bibr">Fong et al. 2005</xref>), that is, they restored GE to normal, prestress levels. Unfortunately, however, the genetic bases of these phenotypic changes were not resolved; it was unclear if the changes in GE during the intermediate point of adaptation were caused by an early adaptive mutation or were caused by combinations of mutations that accumulated during the experiment. Thus, many questions regarding phenotypic adaptation remain unresolved, such as the following: What are the molecular effects underlying the large fitness advantage conferred by first-step mutations? And, what is the phenotypic contribution of the first-step mutation compared with later steps in an adaptive walk?</p><p>We have decided to explore these questions based on our recent, large-scale evolution experiment (<xref rid="msv228-B58" ref-type="bibr">Tenaillon et al. 2012</xref>). In this experiment, a strain of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> B was evolved at 42 &#x000b0;C in 114 replicate populations. After 2,000 generations, we isolated single clones from each evolved population and identified the genetic changes that had accumulated during the experiment. Overall, the <italic>rpoB</italic> gene, which encodes the &#x003b2; subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP), accumulated most mutations, with a total of 87 mutations in the 114 genomes. Three <italic>rpoB</italic> mutations were especially interesting because they resulted in amino acid substitutions in the active site of RNAP and conferred rifampicin resistance (<xref rid="msv228-B53" ref-type="bibr">Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Verdugo et al. 2013</xref>). These mutations, all of which are located in codon 572, were driven to high frequency in 12 populations and were also beneficial at high temperature in the low glucose medium (<xref rid="msv228-B53" ref-type="bibr">Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Verdugo et al. 2013</xref>). Furthermore, these mutations typically appeared early in the evolution experiment. In one population, for example, the <italic>rpoB I572L</italic> mutation swept to fixation before 100 generations; it was furthermore shown to confer a large fitness benefit of about 20% (<xref rid="msv228-B53" ref-type="bibr">Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Verdugo et al. 2013</xref>). Because these <italic>rpoB</italic> mutations are located in the contact region between the downstream DNA duplex and RNAP (proximal active site), they could play key roles in modulating the enzyme&#x02019;s activity in all three stages of transcription: Initiation, elongation, and termination (<xref rid="msv228-B17" ref-type="bibr">Ederth et al. 2006</xref>).</p><p>Yet, some questions remain. First, we have not identified the mechanistic bases of their fitness advantage. Second, although we know that these parallel mutations converge on having a fitness advantage at 42 &#x000b0;C (<xref rid="msv228-B53" ref-type="bibr">Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Verdugo et al. 2013</xref>), with disadvantages at low temperatures (<xref rid="msv228-B52" ref-type="bibr">Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Verdugo et al. 2014</xref>), we have yet to explore if they converged on other phenotypes. That is, it is still unclear if these mutations confer the same phenotypic effects as <italic>rpoB</italic> mutations found in other regions of RNAP that were also selected in some lineages during the thermal adaptation experiment. In this study, we address all these questions. Solving these questions is relevant for understanding the adaptive mechanisms prevalent in our experimental conditions and also in other evolutionary experiments, because mutations that affect transcriptional regulators (such as RNAP and the Rho termination factor) typically appear in the early stages of stress adaptation (<xref rid="msv228-B2" ref-type="bibr">Applebee et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B22" ref-type="bibr">Goodarzi et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B34" ref-type="bibr">Kishimoto et al. 2010</xref>). Numerous observations point to the possibility that highly pleiotropic mutations in transcriptional regulators could be the first step of a general mechanism of adaptation (<xref rid="msv228-B21" ref-type="bibr">Fong et al. 2005</xref>).</p><p>With these considerations in mind, we have investigated the timeline of adaptive change during our evolution experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv228-F1">fig. 1</xref>). To do so, we first describe growth characteristics and GE during acclimation to thermal stress at 42 &#x000b0;C. We then explore first-step mutations in terms of their effect on growth and GE relative to the ancestral strain. More specifically, we explore whether three amino acid substitutions in the RNAP active site converge on the same expression phenotype and also whether their effects are similar to another <italic>rpoB</italic> mutation that affects an amino acid substitution far from the RNAP active site. Finally, we evaluated the phenotypic contribution of one of these first-step mutations relative to the end product of adaptation, as represented by two clones from the end of the 2,000 generation experiment.

To be sure that this GE profile did not result from sampling at the wrong phase of the growth curve, we repeated the experiment. We again sampled three replicates at midexponential, repeated RNA sampling, and transcriptome analyses. The results were qualitatively similar between experiments, implying both that the ancestor at 42 &#x000b0;C cannot unleash full growth and that the population expands at a low rate in this stressed physiological state.</p></sec><sec><title>First-Step Adaptive Mutations Changed GE at 42 &#x000b0;C Dramatically</title><p>Given insights into the acclimation response at 42 &#x000b0;C, we then investigated the effect of three potential first-step mutations&#x02014;<italic>rpoB I572F</italic>, <italic>I572L,</italic> and <italic>I572N</italic>&#x02014;on cell growth and GE. Previous estimates of relative fitness indicated that these mutations are advantageous at 42 &#x000b0;C (<xref rid="msv228-B53" ref-type="bibr">Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Verdugo et al. 2013</xref>). We complemented this observation by estimating two components of fitness&#x02014;the duration of the lag phase and the maximum growth rate. We also calculated the final yield, which is not a component of fitness (<xref rid="msv228-B59" ref-type="bibr">Vasi et al. 1994</xref>). These life-history traits were estimated from the mutant&#x02019;s growth curves at both 42 &#x000b0;C and 37 &#x000b0;C. The mutants had a significantly longer effective lag phase (&#x003c4;) and lower final yield at 42 &#x000b0;C compared with their growth at 37 &#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="msv228-T1">table 1</xref>). We note, however, that an alternative definition of lag phase, which was interpolated from the maximum growth rate (see Materials and Methods), reflects a shorter but not significantly different lag phase in the mutants (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv228/-/DC1">supplementary table S3</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv228/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). Nevertheless, the mutants had a significantly higher maximum growth rate compared with the ancestor grown at 42 &#x000b0;C, reflecting improved fitness under thermal stress (<xref ref-type="table" rid="msv228-T1">table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv228-F3">fig. 3</xref>).

Our first hypothesis was the mutants grew better at 42 &#x000b0;C, because the mutated RNAP was more efficient than the ancestral RNAP at transcribing DNA to RNA (<xref rid="msv228-B28" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al. 1992</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B49" ref-type="bibr">Reynolds 2000</xref>). Our second, nonexclusive hypothesis was that the mutated RNAP led directly or indirectly to altered transcription of a set of genes and this differential expression underlies growth improvement (<xref rid="msv228-B12" ref-type="bibr">Conrad et al. 2010</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the first hypothesis, we predicted that the <italic>rpoB</italic> mutations slowed the RNAP complex (<xref rid="msv228-B52" ref-type="bibr">Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Verdugo et al. 2014</xref>), which is otherwise accelerated at high temperatures (<xref rid="msv228-B54" ref-type="bibr">Ryals et al. 1982</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B40" ref-type="bibr">Mejia et al. 2008</xref>). In turn, we reasoned that the reduced speed of RNAP increases both transcription fidelity and termination efficiency (<xref rid="msv228-B30" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al. 1988</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B64" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al. 2013</xref>), resulting in an overall higher transcription efficiency (<xref rid="msv228-B28" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al. 1992</xref>). We measured the transcription efficiency of the mutants and the ancestor at 42 &#x000b0;C. In our experiment, transcription efficiency captures both the speed and accuracy of all events during transcription, including initiation, elongation, and termination (<xref rid="msv228-B49" ref-type="bibr">Reynolds 2000</xref>). To measure the transcription efficiency we measured the relative abundance of an inducible fluorescent gene (<italic>YFP</italic>) inserted in our strains, at different points post induction (see Materials and Methods). Using this method (<xref rid="msv228-B49" ref-type="bibr">Reynolds 2000</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B6" ref-type="bibr">Brandis et al. 2012</xref>), we found that two of the three mutants (<italic>I572L</italic> and <italic>I572F</italic>) yielded higher slopes than the ancestor at 42 &#x000b0;C, consistent with our hypothesis of higher efficiency. However, the assay has wide confidence intervals, and there were therefore no statistical differences in the transcription efficiency of the mutants relative to the ancestor at 42 &#x000b0;C (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv228/-/DC1">supplementary fig.

Within the limits of our experiment, we cannot conclude that the growth improvement of the mutants at 42 &#x000b0;C is caused by higher RNAP efficiency.</p><p>We also addressed our second hypothesis that the <italic>rpoB</italic> mutations lead to changes in GE with consequent growth improvements at 42 &#x000b0;C. To test this hypothesis, we obtained RNAseq data from each mutant, based on two replicates per mutant at midexponential growth at 42 &#x000b0;C. We then contrasted the GE profile from each mutant against that of the ancestor grown at 42 &#x000b0;C.</p><p>All three mutations displayed hundreds to thousands of DEGs (<italic>q</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv228-F3">fig. 3</xref>). The mutant <italic>I572F</italic> had 1,332 DEGs at 42 &#x000b0;C with 195 highly downregulated (log<sub>2</sub>-fold change&#x0003c;&#x02212;2) and 182 highly upregulated (log<sub>2</sub>-fold change &#x0003e; 2) genes relative to the 42 &#x000b0;C ancestor.

Finally, the mutant <italic>I572N</italic> had 1,360 DEGs with 233 highly downregulated and 164 highly upregulated genes. Within the confines of this experiment, we cannot differentiate as to whether these changes in GE were caused by direct effects, such as modified binding of the RNAP, or indirect, downstream effects.

The first was Principal Component Analysis, which simultaneously considered the expression of all genes and all clones. The resultant plot of the first and second components exhibited differences among clones and also clearly indicated that the clones with first-step mutations shifted their GE profiles toward the 37 &#x000b0;C ancestor (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv228/-/DC1">supplementary fig.

If there were no relationship between shifts in GE during acclimation and during the adaptive response, we expected a regression slope of 0; alternatively, if all the genes of a mutant were restored by an adaptive mutation&#x02014;such that the expression of each genes changed from a stressed state back to a prestressed state&#x02014;the slope of the fitted regression would approach &#x02212;1.0. For the three mutants we observed a highly significant negative correlation, with slopes of &#x02212;0.738 for <italic>I572F</italic>, &#x02212;0.639 for <italic>I572L,</italic> and &#x02212;0.731 for <italic>I572N</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv228-F4">fig. 4</xref><italic>A</italic><italic>&#x02013;</italic><italic>C</italic>). All three slopes were highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) based on permutation tests (see Material and Methods), indicating that the main phenotypic effect of the first-step mutations was to restore global GE toward the prestressed state.

First, the expression of an individual gene could be &#x0201c;restored&#x0201d; back toward the prestressed state. Second, the expression of a gene could be &#x0201c;reinforced&#x0201d; into an exaggeration of the acclimated state, such that the mutated RNAP produced more transcripts (in the case of upregulated genes) or fewer transcripts (in the case of downregulated genes) than the acclimated state. Third, a gene was &#x0201c;unrestored&#x0201d; if the mutated RNAP did not change GE significantly relative to the ancestral RNAP at 42 &#x000b0;C. Finally, GE was &#x0201c;novel&#x0201d; if it was not differentially expressed during the acclimation response, but was expressed significantly differently during the adaptive response. For these definitions, we investigated genes that differed in expression either during acclimation or between acclimation and first-mutation clones (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv228/-/DC1">supplementary table S4</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv228/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online); as a result, we categorized directional shifts of roughly half of 4,202 <italic>E. coli</italic> genes.</p><p>Following this categorization, we observed that most (63%) of the genes that were differentially expressed during acclimation were restored by mutant <italic>I572F</italic> (blue dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv228-F4">fig. 4</xref><italic>A</italic>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="msv228-T2">table 2</xref>), as expected from the strong overall negative correlation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv228-F4">figure 4</xref><italic>A.</italic> The same was true for mutant <italic>I572N</italic>, for which most (67%) genes were restored (<xref ref-type="table" rid="msv228-T2">table 2</xref>).

Accordingly, we combined the six replicates (two from each of the three single mutations) and reran GE analyses to examine the effect of increased sampling. Using all 6 replicates, we identified 867 genes that were differentially expressed relative to the 42 &#x000b0;C ancestor (<italic>q</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), which is within the range of 598 to 1,360 genes based on analyses of separate mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv228-F3">fig. 3</xref>). Importantly, the directional information from this combined analysis was similar to the analyses based on single mutants, because we estimated that 45% of genes that were differentially expressed during acclimation had restored GE.

A third of the restored genes were shared between the four mutants, and 86% of the genes were share by at least two mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv228-F5">fig. 5</xref>), indicating a high level of expression convergence. This high level of phenotypic convergence was also highlighted by the pairwise comparisons of differential expression between the mutants (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv228/-/DC1">supplementary fig.

We performed an enrichment analysis of GO assignments for the 490 restored genes that were shared among the 4 mutants. Not surprisingly, given the overall pattern of restoration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv228-F4">fig. 4</xref>), the restored genes represented the same sets of genes that were enriched for the acclimation response. For example, significantly downregulated genes during the acclimation response, such as the genes involved in translation (<italic>rpl</italic>, <italic>rpm,</italic> and <italic>rps</italic>), were significantly upregulated in the four mutants.

To emphasize this point, we plotted the log<sub>2</sub>-fold expression change during the first-step adaptive response (mutant <italic>I572L</italic> grown at 42 &#x000b0;C vs. ancestor grown at 42 &#x000b0;C; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv228/-/DC1">supplementary fig.

Therefore, the GE profiles for the two high-temperature adapted clones were nearly identical within the limitations of our experiment, despite their differences in genetic background. These observations confirm that the first-step mutation <italic>I572L</italic> contributed to most of the changes in GE during high-temperature adaptation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Two aspects of adaptation that have been largely unexplored are the temporal change of phenotypes during the adaptive process and the genetic changes underlying these changes. Here we have focused on the phenotypic effects of first-step mutations during adaptation of <italic>E. coli</italic> to high temperature (42 &#x000b0;C). A significant finding of our study is that single mutations in RNAP led to either the direct or indirect alteration of GE for thousands of genes&#x02014;most of which were differentially expressed during acclimation to 42 &#x000b0;C&#x02014;and conferred large fitness advantages. A major phenotypic effect of these first-step mutations was to restore global GE back toward the prestressed state. The GE profile of the ancestor at 42 &#x000b0;C revealed that the cells were physiologically stressed, but the first-step mutations restored GE toward an efficient growth profile. Subsequent mutations also increased fitness but did not substantially change GE.</p><sec><title>Heat Stress Acclimation Involves a Balance between Energy Conservation and Stress Resistance</title><p>The acute response to thermal stress, known as the heat shock response, occurs in diverse organisms (<xref rid="msv228-B50" ref-type="bibr">Richter et al. 2010</xref>).

Previous studies on <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> have reported a decrease in the expression of molecular chaperones after &#x0223c;15 min of heat stress induction (<xref rid="msv228-B18" ref-type="bibr">Eisen et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B63" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B31" ref-type="bibr">Jozefczuk et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B50" ref-type="bibr">Richter et al. 2010</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the heat shock genes were initially expressed during our experiment, immediately after transfer to 42 &#x000b0;C, but were subsequently downregulated.</p><p>Nevertheless, two previous studies have explored the physiological acclimation of <italic>E. coli</italic> to high temperature and reported upregulation of heat shock genes (<xref rid="msv228-B23" ref-type="bibr">Gunasekera et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B55" ref-type="bibr">Sandberg et al. 2014</xref>). The discrepancy among studies may be explained by differences in genetic backgrounds (<italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 strain vs. <italic>E. coli</italic> B strain), by differences in temperature (42 &#x000b0;C vs. 43 &#x000b0;C in <xref rid="msv228-B23" ref-type="bibr">Gunasekera et al. 2008</xref>), by differences in culture conditions (ours favor microaerophiles), and by differences in sampling. For example, in our study bacterial clones were allowed to acclimate at 42 &#x000b0;C for 1 day before being sampled the next day during midexponential phase at 42 &#x000b0;C. Thus, the bacteria spent one complete cycle of growth (lag, exponential, and stationary phase) at 42 &#x000b0;C, in addition to the approximately half cycle of growth (lag and half exponential phase) at 42 &#x000b0;C (in total &#x0223c;1.5 days). For other studies, the time that the bacteria spent at high temperature before the RNA extraction is unclear (<xref rid="msv228-B55" ref-type="bibr">Sandberg et al. 2014</xref>). Similarly, we have carefully documented the growth curve of the ancestor at 42 &#x000b0;C to help ensure that our RNAseq samples originated from the exponential growth phase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv228/-/DC1">supplementary fig.

Other studies report to have sampled during midexponential phase but have not reported growth curves. Under normal conditions growth curves may not be necessary, but the exponential phase can be very short under extreme stress. It is thus possible that previous studies have reported GE on slightly different phases of the growth cycle.</p><p>Micro-organisms often resist stressful conditions by modulating GE to limit growth (<xref rid="msv228-B39" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f3;pez-Maury et al. 2008</xref>). As a consequence, genes with growth-related functions, which are energy demanding, are downregulated, allowing a redistribution of resources and energy to the expression of genes related to stress resistance (<xref rid="msv228-B39" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f3;pez-Maury et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B31" ref-type="bibr">Jozefczuk et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B29" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al. 2012</xref>). Surprisingly, we have observed a downregulation of genes encoding different subunits of RNAP during the acclimation response. Assuming that lower expression also reflects protein abundance, this observation implies that the ancestor contains fewer RNAP molecules when grown at 42 &#x000b0;C than when grown at 37 &#x000b0;C.</p><p>The reduction of RNAP molecules can have important physiological consequences, given that RNAP is limiting for genome-wide transcription (<xref rid="msv228-B27" ref-type="bibr">Ishihama 2000</xref>).

Accordingly, we have examined RNAP efficiency and found a slight trend toward higher rates of transcriptional efficiency for two of the three mutations in codon 572 of <italic>rpoB.</italic> However, none of these differences were supported statistically (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv228/-/DC1">supplementary fig.

A limitation in RNAP molecules could also indirectly affect bacterial growth (<xref rid="msv228-B29" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al. 2012</xref>). For example, when growth conditions are unfavorable, RNAP molecules are released from the rRNA operons, thereby reducing rRNA synthesis (i.e., reducing growth) so that more RNAP molecules become free and available for genome-wide transcription (<xref rid="msv228-B29" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al. 2012</xref>). Therefore, the reduction in growth at 42 &#x000b0;C may be explained in part by the downregulation of genes involved in translation and ribosome biogenesis but also by a potential limitation of RNAP.</p><p>Other downregulated genes involved in energy demanding processes include genes associated with the biosynthesis of amino acids, nucleotides, ribonucleotides and constituents of the flagella (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv228/-/DC1">supplementary table S1</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv228/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). A similar pattern of expression has been observed during acute exposure to thermal stress (<xref rid="msv228-B31" ref-type="bibr">Jozefczuk et al. 2010</xref>).

Therefore, our study suggests that the pattern of energy conservation mediated through downregulation of energy demanding processes not only occurs during the acute response to stress but also occurs during the acclimation response.</p><p>We hypothesize that some of the resources and energy are redistributed to express genes controlled by the sigma S factor or &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup>, the master regulator of the stress response (<xref rid="msv228-B4" ref-type="bibr">Battesti et al. 2011</xref>). Using previous observations (<xref rid="msv228-B60" ref-type="bibr">Weber et al. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B32" ref-type="bibr">Keseler et al. 2013</xref>), we generated a list of 66 genes expressed under several stress conditions (including high temperature) and under regulation of &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup>. Of these, 62 genes (94%) were significantly upregulated during acclimation to 42 &#x000b0;C (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv228/-/DC1">supplementary table S2</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv228/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> induced genes were related to: 1) The synthesis molecules responsible to deal with the detrimental effects of stress, 2) transport systems, and 3) the production of metabolic enzymes, mostly involved in the central energy metabolism (<xref rid="msv228-B60" ref-type="bibr">Weber et al. 2005</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the ancestor acclimates to thermal stress by launching alternative GE programs (<xref rid="msv228-B39" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f3;pez-Maury et al. 2008</xref>).

The other involves the upregulation of stress genes that are involved in repair and metabolic adjustments to high temperature.</p></sec><sec><title>Restoration of the Ancestral Physiological State Is Advantageous</title><p>This study has shown that first-step mutations dramatically altered GE from the acclimated state and acted primarily to restore GE toward the prestressed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv228-F3">fig. 3</xref>). Previous studies have reported that small deletions in RNAP (<xref rid="msv228-B12" ref-type="bibr">Conrad et al. 2010</xref>) and mutations in other RNAP subunits (<xref rid="msv228-B7" ref-type="bibr">Carroll et al. 2015</xref>) change GE of hundreds of genes. Taken together, these observations suggest that <italic>rpoB</italic> mutations have important downstream effects that affect complex networks of interacting genes and their products (i.e., global regulators of GE or &#x0201c;hubs&#x0201d;; <xref rid="msv228-B3" ref-type="bibr">Barabasi and Oltvai 2004</xref>). Our study also adds to previous observations that global regulators are a primary target of natural selection in microbial evolution experiments (<xref rid="msv228-B45" ref-type="bibr">Philippe et al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B25" ref-type="bibr">Hindre et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B7" ref-type="bibr">Carroll et al. 2015</xref>).</p><p>At least two pieces of evidence suggest that the restoration of GE was advantageous in our experiment, leading to the rapid fixation of <italic>rpoB</italic> mutations in evolved populations (<xref rid="msv228-B53" ref-type="bibr">Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Verdugo et al. 2013</xref>). First, restoration in GE may be advantageous because it &#x0201c;reactivates&#x0201d; some of the growth-related functions that were downregulated during the acclimation response. The GO categories related to growth, such as translation and ribosomal biogenesis, were significantly enriched in the four mutants relative to the acclimated state. The upregulation of growth-related genes may explain why the mutants have higher maximum growth rates and higher final yields than the ancestor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv228-F3">fig. 3</xref>), as well as higher relative fitness values (<xref rid="msv228-B53" ref-type="bibr">Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Verdugo et al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="msv228-B52" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Second, the general trend of restoration occurred in parallel in all four <italic>rpo</italic>B mutants (<italic>I572F</italic>, <italic>I572L</italic>, <italic>I572N,</italic> and <italic>I966S</italic>); such phenotypic convergence is commonly interpreted as a sign of adaptive evolution (<xref rid="msv228-B11" ref-type="bibr">Christin et al. 2010</xref>).</p><p>Not only did we observe convergence in global GE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv228-F4">fig. 4</xref>), but we also observed substantial overlap of genes with restored expression: 86% of the affected genes were shared by at least two mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv228-F5">fig. 5</xref>). Surprisingly, these observations extend not only to three different mutations in the <italic>rpoB</italic> codon (572) but also to a mutation (<italic>I966S</italic>) that is not in the RNAP active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv228-F4">figs. 4</xref><italic>D</italic> and 5). It is somewhat surprising to us that the <italic>I966S</italic> mutation produces similar effects as those in codon 572. We note, however, that our RNAP mutations differ from those found in other evolution experiments, such as the <italic>rpoB R562V</italic> mutation found in adaptation to glycerol (<xref rid="msv228-B24" ref-type="bibr">Herring et al. 2006</xref>), <italic>rpoA</italic> mutations found in adaptation to methanol (<xref rid="msv228-B7" ref-type="bibr">Carroll et al. 2015</xref>), and <italic>rpoC</italic> mutations uncovered during evolution to heat stress (<xref rid="msv228-B58" ref-type="bibr">Tenaillon et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B55" ref-type="bibr">Sandberg et al 2014</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that RNAP can be fine-tuned by mutations in a number of different subunits and residues (<xref rid="msv228-B58" ref-type="bibr">Tenaillon et al. 2012</xref>). We conjecture that many of these changes may be nearly equivalent with respect to their tendency to move GE toward restoration (<xref rid="msv228-B7" ref-type="bibr">Carroll et al. 2015</xref>).</p><p>It is unclear whether the effects of these RNAP mutants are direct or indirect. For a direct effect, the mutated RNAPs would have had new intrinsic binding affinities for promoters throughout the genome. Alternatively, because RNAP is a sensor of the physiological state of the cell (<xref rid="msv228-B27" ref-type="bibr">Ishihama 2000</xref>), it may induce different GE programs. For example, under amino acid starvation RNAP modifies recruitment of sigma factors through its interaction with the alarmone ppGpp, and it consequently induces the stringent response program (<xref rid="msv228-B9" ref-type="bibr">Chatterji and Ojha 2001</xref>). The fact that mutations with similar effects are not limited to the active site of the RNAP favors the possibility of indirect effects, but further experiments are needed to test this hypothesis.</p><p>It is worth noting that restoration to the nonstress phenotype is not complete, because first-step mutations differ markedly from the 37 &#x000b0;C ancestor in GE dynamics. For example, each of the 4 <italic>rpoB</italic> mutations differ from the ancestor in the expression of a minimum of 392 genes (<italic>I572L</italic>) and as many as 688 genes (<italic>I572N</italic>). The important point is that first-step mutations restore hundreds of genes toward nonstress expression dynamics but substantial differences remain relative to the wild-type phenotype. These differences may explain, in part, differences in growth characteristics between first-step mutations and the ancestor at 37 &#x000b0;C (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv228/-/DC1">supplementary fig.

Previous studies have shown that mutations in global regulators often have maladaptive side effects (<xref rid="msv228-B25" ref-type="bibr">Hindre et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B7" ref-type="bibr">Carroll et al. 2015</xref>). We hypothesized, therefore, that later adaptive mutations compensate for maladaptive side effects of highly pleiotropic first-step mutations (<xref rid="msv228-B25" ref-type="bibr">Hindre et al. 2012</xref>).</p><p>To contrast first-step mutations to the end products of our adaptation experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv228-F1">fig. 1</xref>), we compared the <italic>I572L rpoB</italic> mutation with two clones (97 and 27) that included the <italic>I572L</italic> mutation. Each of the two clones differed from the single-mutant background by &#x0223c;10 mutations; these mutations included both point mutations and more complex genetic changes, such as a large deletion. Based on these contrasts, we have found that the first-step mutation <italic>I572L</italic> contributed most of the GE variation during thermal stress adaptation (987 DEGs), while later mutations contributed fewer changes in GE (63 and 16 DEGs in clones 27 and 97, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv228-F6">fig. 6</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv228/-/DC1">supplementary fig.

Interestingly, these few changes in GE may contribute to significant changes in growth parameters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="msv228-T3">table 3</xref>). Therefore, the number of DEGs was not proportional to fitness gains.</p><p>This &#x0201c;disconnect&#x0201d; between the number of genes differentially expressed and the magnitude of the fitness advantage might be caused by compensatory changes to the pleiotropic side effects of mutation <italic>I572L.</italic> Under this model, we presume that some of the hundreds of DEGs in <italic>I572L</italic> have beneficial effects, while others have deleterious effects, netting an overall beneficial change in GE. If true, it is likely that subsequent mutations change the expression of only few genes, but most of these changes are beneficial. For example, the large deletion in clone 27 contained genes involved in iron acquisition (<italic>fep</italic> and <italic>ent</italic> operons; <xref rid="msv228-B15" ref-type="bibr">Crosa and Walsh 2002</xref>), and copper and silver efflux system (<italic>cus</italic> operons; <xref rid="msv228-B38" ref-type="bibr">Long et al. 2010</xref>). Costly, nonfunctional pathways are often downregulated in order to save energy that would be otherwise used to produce unnecessary proteins and metabolisms (<xref rid="msv228-B14" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B36" ref-type="bibr">Lewis et al. 2010</xref>). Therefore the large deletion of 71 kb in length may be an energetic benefit of large phenotypic effect (<xref rid="msv228-B26" ref-type="bibr">Hug and Gaut 2015</xref>), explaining its occurrence in 35 high-temperature adapted clones (<xref rid="msv228-B58" ref-type="bibr">Tenaillon et al. 2012</xref>).</p><p>Clone 97, which lacked the large deletions of clone 27, displayed fewer changes in GE than clone 27. In this clone, one of the significantly downregulated genes (<italic>q</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) was the <italic>rmf</italic> gene, which encodes the ribosome modulation factor (RMF). RMF has been associated with decreased translation activity and is expressed during slow growth conditions, such as stationary phase (<xref rid="msv228-B46" ref-type="bibr">Polikanov et al. 2012</xref>). Therefore, the downregulation of <italic>rmf</italic>, occurring in parallel in clone 27 and 97, might increase protein synthesis and thus growth.</p><p>Finally, we observed that the genes involved in flagellum-dependent cell motility (e.g., <italic>flg</italic> genes) were highly downregulated during the acclimation response (log<sub>2</sub>-fold &#x0003c;&#x02212;3 and <italic>q</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) but were again upregulated in the single mutants <italic>I572F</italic> and <italic>I572L</italic> (<italic>q</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv228/-/DC1">supplementary data set S1</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv228/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). In the conditions of our evolution experiment&#x02014;a well-mixed environment lacking physical structure&#x02014;motility seems unnecessary. Given that the biosynthesis of flagella is costly (<xref rid="msv228-B56" ref-type="bibr">Soutourina and Bertin 2003</xref>), reducing the expression of <italic>flg</italic> genes might be beneficial (<xref rid="msv228-B13" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B21" ref-type="bibr">Fong et al. 2005</xref>). We therefore posit that the restoration in GE of <italic>flg</italic> genes might be costly and have deleterious effects. Interestingly, some of the <italic>flg</italic> genes were downregulated (<italic>q</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in clone 97 when compared with the first-step mutant <italic>I572L</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv228/-/DC1">supplementary table S8</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv228/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). Therefore, later adaptive mutations might contribute to the fine-tuning of GE by compensating the side effects of restoration. We note, however, that we have not yet identified the mutation that causes the downregulation of <italic>flg</italic> genes in clone 97. That being said, the upregulation of flagellar genes after restorative shifts in GE and the fixation of subsequent mutations that downregulate them has been observed previously (<xref rid="msv228-B55" ref-type="bibr">Sandberg et al. 2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Concluding Remarks</title><p>Mutations in global regulators of GE are observed recurrently in laboratory evolution experiments (<xref rid="msv228-B2" ref-type="bibr">Applebee et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B22" ref-type="bibr">Goodarzi et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B34" ref-type="bibr">Kishimoto et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B7" ref-type="bibr">Carroll et al. 2015</xref>). It is not always clear if these mutations represent the first step of an adaptive walk or a later step, but at least in the case of <italic>rpoB</italic> and <italic>rpoC</italic> mutations it seems they are often first-step mutations (<xref rid="msv228-B24" ref-type="bibr">Herring et al. 2006</xref>). Therefore, the pattern that we have observed in our study may not be specific to our system but instead a more general phenomenon. Moreover, these results tend to support the view that evolution to stressful environments is driven, at least initially, by shifts in regulatory proteins (<xref rid="msv228-B61" ref-type="bibr">Wilson 1976</xref>).</p><p>Based on our results, we propose a general, two-step adaptive process. First, a mutation affecting global transcriptional regulator appears in the population and changes global GE. This expression change is mostly restorative, so that the stressed state moves toward a prestressed (ancestral) state. These changes in GE confer a high advantage, promoting the rapid fixation of the mutation in the population. Once the cell recovers its normal homeostatic state, other mutations accumulate and contribute to novel functions (fine-tuning of adaptive traits) or/and compensate for the side effects of the first-step pleiotropic mutation. Future directions to confirm this general pattern may require time course studies of GE (including heat shock and acclimation response, as well as all the intermediate steps of adaptation) coupled with genomic data across a diverse set of environmental treatments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Growth Conditions</title><p>Unless otherwise noted, the culture conditions used for the physiological assays (growth curves, transcription efficiency, and RNA-seq assays) were the same used during the high-temperature evolution experiment (<xref rid="msv228-B58" ref-type="bibr">Tenaillon et al. 2012</xref>).

The purified PCR product was integrated into the ancestral strain REL1206 carrying the pKD46 recombineering plasmid as previously described by <xref rid="msv228-B16" ref-type="bibr">Datsenko and Wanner (2000)</xref>. Briefly, the ancestral strain carrying the pKD46 plasmid was grown overnight at 30 &#x000b0;C in 5 ml of LB with 100 &#x000b5;g/ml of ampicillin. The overnight culture was 100-fold diluted in 100 ml of LB with ampicillin and 1 mM <sc>l</sc>-arabinose (Sigma) and grown at 30 &#x000b0;C to an optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) of 0.6. Electrocompetent cells were made by washing the culture five times with ice-cold water. Approximately 200 ng of linear DNA was electroporated into 25 &#x000b5;l of cells. After electroporation, 1 ml of LB was added, and the cells were incubated at 30 &#x000b0;C for 2 h with shaking, then plated 100 &#x000b5;l on LB agar plates with chloramphenicol (20 &#x000b5;g/ml). We selected a single colony and purified it in LB agar plate containing chloramphenicol. Correct integration was verified by PCR using primers ARV34 and ARV35 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv228/-/DC1">supplementary table S10</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv228/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online).</p></sec><sec><title>Transcription Efficiency Assay</title><p>To measure the transcription efficiency of the ancestor and the mutants, we performed a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay (<xref rid="msv228-B49" ref-type="bibr">Reynolds 2000</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B6" ref-type="bibr">Brandis et al. 2012</xref>). In brief, we grew the fluorescently labeled strains in the same culture conditions previously described except that we supplemented the DM medium with 100 &#x000b5;g/ml glucose (DM100). We confirmed the advantage of these mutations to high temperature despite the higher amount of glucose based on growth curves of the ancestor and the mutants at 42 &#x000b0;C in DM100. Acclimated cultures were grown at 42.2 &#x000b0;C until they reached midexponential phase. We took 1 ml of uninduced cells (sample T<sub>0</sub>) and stabilized them in RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent (Qiagen). Immediately after, we induced cells by adding 10 &#x000b5;l of anhydotetracycline (66 &#x000b5;g/ml) to the medium. Samples of 1 ml of culture were taken at 1, 2, 3, and 4 min after induction (samples T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, T<sub>3,</sub> and T<sub>4</sub>) and stabilized with RNA protect Bacteria Reagent and pelleted for storage at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C prior to RNA extraction. Total RNA was prepared using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA was DNase treated using Turbo DNA-free kit (Ambion). We used 300 ng of DNA-free RNA to produce cDNA with the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). From each reverse transcribed product, we quantified the abundance of cDNA of the gene reference <italic>gst</italic> (Gst, glutathione transferase; Pfaffl 2001) and the target gene YFP (Yellow fluorescent protein) using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) quantified on a Stratagene MX3005P QPCR System (Agilent Technologies). For each PCR reaction, we used 0.625 &#x000b5;M forward primer (ARV48 for <italic>gst</italic> or ARV50 for YFP; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv228/-/DC1">supplementary table S10</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv228/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online), 0.625 &#x000b5;M reverse primer (ARV49 for <italic>gst</italic> or ARV51 for YFP; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv228/-/DC1">supplementary table S10</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv228/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online), 3 &#x000b5;l cDNA template, 4.5 &#x000b5;l RNase-free water, and 10 &#x000b5;l of Fast SYBR Green Master Mix to have a final reaction volume of 20 &#x000b5;l. To control for the intra-assay variation (repeatability), we prepared three replicates of each reaction. The PCR thermal cycling conditions were 95 &#x000b0;C for 20 s followed by 40 cycles of 95 &#x000b0;C for 3 s and 60 &#x000b0;C for 30 s.</p><p>The efficiency of the amplifications for each pair of primers was determined from a standard curve using the formula <italic>E</italic> = 10<sup>[&#x02212;</sup><sup>1/</sup><italic><sup>s</sup></italic><sup>]</sup>, where <italic>s</italic> is the slope of the standard curve (<xref rid="msv228-B44" ref-type="bibr">Pfaffl 2001</xref>). To calculate the &#x0201c;relative expression ratio (i.e., the relative change in GE of the target gene YFP normalized to the reference gene <italic>gst</italic> and relative to the uninduced control sample T<sub>0</sub>), we used the mathematical model for relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR developed by Pfaffl (<xref rid="msv228-B44" ref-type="bibr">Pfaffl 2001</xref>; <xref rid="msv228-B6" ref-type="bibr">Brandis et al. 2012</xref>).
