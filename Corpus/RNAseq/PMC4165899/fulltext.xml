PTEN dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>), thereby opposing the activity of class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) that mediate growth and survival factors signaling through PI3K effectors such as AKT and mTOR<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. To determine whether continued PTEN inactivation is required to maintain malignancy, we generated an RNAi-based transgenic mouse model that allows tetracycline-dependent regulation of PTEN in a time- and tissue-specific manner. Postnatal PTEN knockdown in the hematopoietic compartment produced highly disseminated T-cell leukemia (T-ALL). Surprisingly, reactivation of PTEN mainly reduced T-ALL dissemination but had little effect on tumor load in hematopoietic organs. Leukemia infiltration into the intestine was dependent on CCR9 G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, which was amplified by PTEN loss. Our results suggest that in the absence of PTEN, GPCRs may play an unanticipated role in driving tumor growth and invasion in an unsupportive environment. They further reveal that the role of PTEN loss in tumor maintenance is not invariant and can be influenced by the tissue microenvironment, thereby producing a form of intratumoral heterogeneity that is independent of cancer genotype.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Stable RNA interference using short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) provides a powerful approach for studying tumor suppressor gene activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.

Thus, although all the T-cell leukemias were initiated by a <italic>Pten</italic> shRNA, they acquire molecular features reminiscent of the human disease<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">The leukemia arising in <italic>shPten</italic> mice was highly malignant, and rapidly produced disease when transplanted into recipient mice (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>). Of note, since the <italic>Vav-tTA;shPten</italic> transgenics were of a mixed genetic background, <italic>Rag1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> recipients were used to avoid graft rejection. These recipients succumbed to a highly disseminated form of T-ALL consisting of CD4/CD8 DP cells that rapidly took over the hematopoietic organs, accumulated to high levels in the peripheral blood (PB), and spread to the liver, kidney and intestine (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6b</xref>). Remarkably, decreased PTEN levels were associated with disease dissemination and lower survival in T-ALL patients (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref> and <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6c</xref>), and were also linked with intestinal infiltration in patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6d+e</xref>). The association between PTEN loss and disease dissemination in murine and human T cell malignancies underscores the relevance of the model to human disease.</p><p id="P6">We reasoned that the transplanted leukemias described above would be ideal for our experiments as they are highly malignant such that individual primary isolates can be studied for their response to different perturbations in multiple secondary recipients. Recipients were monitored for disease development by weekly analysis of peripheral blood (PB) for the presence of EGFP<sup>+</sup> (<italic>shPten</italic> expressing) cells. Upon disease manifestation, a cohort of mice was given Dox to silence the shRNA and reactivate PTEN. Strikingly, Dox treatment almost tripled the survival time of mice harboring <italic>Vav-tTA;shPten</italic> leukemia (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) but had no effect on mice harboring <italic>Pten<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> leukemia (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6f</xref>). Immunoblotting of leukemic cells harvested from mice indicated that the system worked as expected: hence, Dox addition led to upregulation of <italic>Pten</italic> mRNA (data not shown), silenced EGFP and reestablished PTEN to endogenous levels (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7d</xref>). Therefore, PTEN reactivation had a marked anticancer effect but was by no means curative.</p><p id="P7">Leukemia-bearing mice showed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals in multiple hematopoietic compartments, the liver, and intestine (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6h+i</xref> and data not shown).

These findings were corroborated by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometric quantification of CD4<sup>+</sup> leukemic cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e,f</xref>). Notably, Dox treatment had a minimal impact on the proliferation or apoptosis of leukemic cells residing in the lymph nodes and spleen, but triggered apoptosis in leukemic cells that had disseminated into the intestine (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref> and <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7e&#x02013;g</xref>). Thus, the impact of Pten expression on disease progression is dictated by the anatomical location of the leukemic cell.</p><p id="P8">We next assessed the phosphorylation state of key PI3K effectors in tissue sections by IHC and pathway functionality by positron emission tomography (PET) of <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxy glucose (FDG) uptake into leukemia cells<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. The heterogeneous responses correlated with the ability of PTEN to effectively suppress aberrant PI3K signaling: whereas S6 and AKT phosphorylation were reduced in disseminated leukemic cells obtained from the intestine, it persisted in the leukemic cells harvested from the spleen of the same animal (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>). Similarly, mice displayed a marked reduction in FDG signal stemming from the liver and intestine within 2 days of PTEN reactivation, an effect that could not simply be accounted for by loss of leukemia burden (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b+c</xref>). Conversely, the FDG signal emanating from the spleen and bone marrow (BM) remained strong (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b,d</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Suppl.

The divergent responses to PTEN activation in a clonal leukemia imply that the control of the PI3K pathway can be dramatically affected by microenvironmental factors.</p><p id="P9">Surprisingly, untreated NCR nude (NCR) mice transplanted with the same number of <italic>shPten</italic> tumor cells survived as long as <italic>Rag1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> recipient mice treated with Dox, and did not show a survival advantage following Dox addition (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>).

Notably, CCR9 expression was not affected by PTEN reactivation as determined by FACS and RNAseq analysis (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9i</xref> and data not shown).</p><p id="P11">To test if PTEN influences T-ALL homing and survival in the intestine by modulating CCL25 signaling, <italic>shPten</italic> T-cell leukemia isolates were treated with CCL25 (&#x000b1; Dox to modulate PTEN), and cell signaling and motility was assessed in short-term culture. Whereas CCL25 stimulation had little impact on PI3K signaling in the presence of PTEN, PTEN knockdown sensitized cells to CCL25 induced AKT phosphorylation and, to a lesser extent, S6 phosphorylation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>).

Hence, in the intestine, PTEN suppression promotes leukemic cell dissemination and maintenance by modulating CCL25-CCR9 signaling.</p><p id="P13">In human cancers, <italic>PTEN</italic> deletions often coincide with tumor expansion, metastasis, and a generally worse prognosis<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, results confirmed and extended for T cell disease in this report. Using a powerful new mouse model enabling reversible suppression of endogenous PTEN expression, we show that PTEN loss can promote tumor cell survival at distant sites by amplifying weak environmental cues that enable tumor cells to survive in an otherwise non-supportive microenvironment. Accordingly, the promiscuous yet passive ability of PTEN to attenuate PI3K signaling<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> may be influenced by the nature and intensity of PIP<sub>3</sub> generating signals in different microenvironments, and targeting such tissue specific signals might present a valid strategy to treat cancer spread. Still, the requirement for PTEN loss in tumor maintenance is not absolute and can be influenced by genetic context<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> and, as shown here, the tumor microenvironment. These observations paint a more complex picture of how PTEN inactivation drives tumor maintenance, and reveal an interplay between tumor and microenvironment that would not be predicted from studies on cultured cells. Nonetheless, this interplay produces a form of intratumoral heterogeneity that is independent of genotype but can impact disease progression and perhaps the clinical response to molecularly targeted therapies.</p><sec id="S4" specific-use="web-only"><title>Additional Methods</title><sec id="S5"><title>Constructs and shRNAs</title><p id="P15">To identify potent shRNAs targeting murine and human <italic>Pten</italic>, various 97bp oligonucleotides predicted from sensor-based and other shRNA design algorithms (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 4c</xref> and data not shown)<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> were XhoI-EcoRI cloned into the miR30 cassette of the MLP vector and tested as described previously (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>.
