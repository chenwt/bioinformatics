However, separating individual genomes from a mixed community has often relied on the differential-coverage analysis of multiple, deeply sequenced samples. In the metagenomic investigation of the marine bryozoan <italic>Bugula neritina</italic>, we uncovered seven bacterial genomes associated with a single <italic>B. neritina</italic> individual that appeared to be transient associates, two of which were unique to one individual and undetectable using certain &#x0201c;universal&#x0201d; 16S rRNA primers and probes. We recovered high quality genome assemblies for several rare instances of &#x0201c;microbial dark matter,&#x0201d; or phylogenetically divergent bacteria lacking genomes in reference databases, from a single tissue sample that was not subjected to any physical or chemical pre-treatment. One of these rare, divergent organisms has a small (593&#x02009;kbp), poorly annotated genome with low GC content (20.9%) and a 16S rRNA gene with just 65% sequence similarity to the closest reference sequence.

Although the inherent biases in such an approach have long been known<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, it was recently demonstrated by the Banfield group that a previously unknown region of the tree of life, the &#x0201c;candidate phyla radiation&#x0201d; (CPR), largely consists of bacteria that are inaccessible to standard 16S rRNA amplification protocols<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. This phenomenon is due to primer mismatches and widespread intervening sequences that lead to non-canonical amplicon lengths<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.

Newly sequenced microbial dark matter genomes are typically very divergent from known species, which leads to difficulties in functional annotation approaches that rely on sequence similarity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Because there are no reference sequences available for microbial dark matter, sequence similarity and reference-guided assembly cannot be used for these divergent organisms. Therefore, metagenomic sequencing efforts to date have often relied on extensive chemical or physical pre-treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> of samples prior to sequencing, and comparison of relative microbial abundance between multiple datasets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> to enable genome binning from <italic>de novo</italic> metagenomic assemblies. Assembly and binning by differential coverage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, requires multiple samples that have very similar genomic composition of dark matter organisms. Rare, novel genomes can also be assembled if many closely related metagenomes are available<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. However, these methods are inadequate for observing high-resolution fluctuations in microbial dark matter among a small number of mass-limited samples that have a low amount of species overlap. Thus, the functional study of microbial dark matter transiently associated with mass-limited, rare or small hosts, such as marine invertebrates, could be improved if high quality genomes were attainable from individual samples with approaches that rely solely on information obtained from single samples, such as nucleotide composition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p><p>Here, we took a <italic>de novo</italic> shotgun metagenomic assembly approach to investigate bacteria associated with the marine bryozoan <italic>Bugula neritina</italic>. This sessile, colonial filter-feeding animal consists of individual zooids specialized for feeding, substrate attachment or reproduction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Feeding zooids capture phytoplankton with a lophophore, and the digested material is distributed throughout the colony via funicular cords. <italic>Candidatus</italic> Endobugula sertula &#x02013; a vertically transmitted<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, uncultured bacterial symbiont of <italic>B. neritina</italic> &#x02013; is found in the funicular cords and larvae, which are chemically defended by symbiont-produced small molecules called bryostatins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Sections of the biosynthetic pathway for the bryostatins have been sequenced through clone library methods<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, but the full genome sequence of <italic>Ca</italic>. E. sertula has not been determined.</p><p>Our original objective was to assemble the genome of <italic>Ca</italic>. E. sertula and recover missing pieces of the <italic>bry</italic> pathway. Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and <italic>de novo</italic> assembly we were able to recover the genome of this symbiont, which will be the subject of a separate report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Because <italic>Ca</italic>. E. sertula was previously described as an almost complete monoculture in <italic>B. neritina</italic> larvae<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, we were surprised to find evidence of seven additional bacteria associated with the brood chambers and adjacent autozoids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> of one individual host. Some of these genomes were remarkably divergent from known sequences and, collectively, could represent founding members of one new phylum, one new class, one new family and one new genus, many of which are not detectable with certain &#x0201c;universal&#x0201d; bacterial primers. The presence of these divergent genomes was sporadic among <italic>B. neritina</italic> individuals, or entirely unique to the sequenced sample, indicating that the bryozoan experiences dynamic shifts in the composition of its microbial associates. The assembly of multiple complete or near-complete microbial dark matter genomes from a single bryozoan illustrates the potential importance of single-sample resolution in future metagenomic studies.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Investigation of the <italic>Bugula neritina</italic> metagenome</title><p>We sequenced DNA from two different samples of <italic>B. neritina</italic> tissue &#x02013; mature larval brooding chambers (ovicells and their adjacent feeding zooids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>)) from a single adult colony, termed AB1_ovicells, and pooled free-swimming larvae released from a collection of adults, termed MHD_larvae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Raw, unfiltered reads were first assembled into contigs using SPAdes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. The resulting metagenomic assembly was complicated by the presence of the eukaryotic host genome (~135&#x02009;Mbp) and many short contigs (N50 2.6 and 1.6&#x02009;kbp for AB1_ovicells and MHD_larvae, respectively, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Reconstruction of 16S rRNA gene sequences from AB1_ovicells sequence reads using EMIRGE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, however, revealed evidence of multiple bacteria in addition to <italic>Ca</italic>. E. sertula (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). These additional genomes were found in AB1_ovicells, but not MHD_larvae, meaning that we could not use differential coverage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> to assemble them from shotgun sequence, although both metagenomes appeared to contain <italic>Ca</italic>. E. sertula, allowing us to identify and separate shared contigs belonging to this symbiont.</p><p>In order to effectively deconvolute bacterial genomes from AB1_ovicells, we took a sequential approach to simplifying the metagenome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). Contigs were first classified taxonomically based on BLASTP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> searches of their translated predicted open reading frames (ORFs) against the non-redundant (nr) NCBI database. ORF taxonomic classifications were generated with MEGAN<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, and contig taxonomies were decided through majority vote of the constituent ORF classifications using a custom Perl script, to reduce the influence of horizontal gene transfer (see Materials and Methods, SI Appendix). An initial simplification of the metagenome was achieved by removing all contigs classified as Eukaryota or unclassified at the kingdom level. This simplification left a set of predominantly bacterial contigs that appeared to form distinct groupings when GC% was plotted against coverage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). Serendipitously, this set of contigs seemed to consist of well-separated groups that were taxonomically distinct, that could represent individual bacterial genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>).</p><p>A second simplification step was achieved by identifying contigs shared between the AB1_ovicells and MHD_larvae metagenomes, which should include any host genome contigs misclassified as bacteria and contigs belonging to <italic>Ca</italic>. E. sertula. Contigs in the ovicells tissue (AB1_ovicells) that also had read coverage in the larval tissue (MHD_larvae) formed two clusters based on GC% and coverage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). These clusters were automatically separated using normal mixture modeling, a technique where data are fit to models of a varying number of groups with discrete distribution patterns<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. The validity of this cluster-separation procedure was assessed by examining the assigned taxonomy of ORFs within each group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). One of the groups shared between AB1_ovicells and MHD_larvae (clusters 1&#x02013;2) was predominantly classified as the &#x003b3;-proteobacterium IMCC1989<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, as well as related bacteria such as <italic>Teredinibacter turnerae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. This taxonomy was consistent with previously reported phylogenies inferred from the <italic>Ca</italic>. E. sertula 16S rRNA sequence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. The other contig group in the shared contig pool appeared to be of mixed taxonomy including a large number of ORFs classified as Eukaryota, which likely represent host contigs misclassified as bacteria.</p><p>We then turned our attention to the remaining bacterial contigs unique to the AB1_ovicells assembly. Contigs were identified that contained a set of bacterial single-copy marker genes previously established by Rinke <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> to assess genome assembly completeness and contamination. This subset of contigs was clustered automatically with normal mixture modeling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> to give several additional clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>). Contig groups derived from this method showed a low level of single copy marker redundancy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The tetranucleotide frequencies of (clustered) contigs containing markers and other bacterial contigs were then analyzed with ESOM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, both to confirm the validity of automatically generated clusters, and to assign non-marker contigs to clusters with congruent tetranucleotide composition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>). Analysis of the resulting bacterial genome bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>), which were ultimately constructed using a combination of sequence homology and nucleotide composition, shows a varying level of estimated genome completeness by single-copy marker analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> and a low level of marker redundancy compared to what we could achieve with pre-established, fully automated binning algorithms, such as MaxBin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Analysis of the previously assigned ORF taxonomy in these respective bins showed that while four bins had fairly consistent taxonomic classifications (AB1_endozoicomonas, AB1_phaeo, AB1_flavo and AB1_chromatiales), three bins showed mixed ORF taxonomy even at the phylum level (AB1_lowgc, AB1_rickettsiales and AB1_div, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S8</xref>). The latter bins may represent highly divergent genomes that provide unreliable taxonomic classifications based on sequence similarity. Translated predicted ORFs in these bins were found to have very low identity to sequences within the nr database (the modal identities for AB1_lowgc, AB1_rickettsiales and AB1_div were 30.0%, 35.2% and 43.1%, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). AB1_lowgc was resolved to a single contig in the overall assembly, which we determined to be a circular chromosome by PCR and Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S9</xref>). Two divergent bins (AB1_lowgc and AB1_div) contained fully assembled 16S rRNA genes, which were found to not be amplifiable by certain universal bacterial primers, undetectable by eubacterial probe EUB338 and unassembled by EMIRGE, perhaps because of very low sequence similarity to reference sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). These divergent bins, therefore, represent underexplored branches of the bacterial tree of life, or &#x0201c;microbial dark matter&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, that would be undetectable without shotgun metagenomic methods.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Phylogenetic analysis of the divergent bacterial genomes in the <italic>B. neritina</italic> metagenome</title><p>Where possible, taxonomies were assigned to each genome bin based on 16S rRNA gene sequence, using identity cutoffs recently suggested for high level taxa<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> when comparing to the closest database sequence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). However, most genome bins did not contain assembled 16S rRNA genes, and so their phylogeny was initially investigated by constructing trees from alignments of concatenated marker protein sequences<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs S10&#x02013;S15</xref>). These phylogenies suggested specific 16S rRNA gene sequences that had been directly reconstructed from paired reads using EMIRGE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2, Figs S16&#x02013;S20</xref>), and it was possible for all bins except for AB1_flavo and AB1_chromatiales to join 16S rRNA sequences to contigs that contained fragments of an rRNA operon by PCR and Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>).</p><p>Based on 16S rRNA sequence, AB1_div is most closely related to a known sequence (DQ395794), which is unclassified in the SILVA database beyond &#x0201c;Candidate division NPL-UPA2&#x0201d; (90%). In our 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree, this candidate division did not form a monophyletic group, but their sequences and the AB1_div sequence aligned with the Planctomycetes-Verrucomicrobia-Chlamydiae (PVC) superphylum, in agreement with the placement of AB1_div in the marker tree (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S12</xref>). However, while the 16S tree (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S16</xref>) placed AB1_div in a clade with Lentisphaerae and Chlamydiae, the protein marker tree placed AB1_div between Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia. Consistent with the placement of AB1_div in the PVC superphylum, we found a protein homologous to the PVC &#x0201c;Signature Protein&#x0201d; found by Lagkouvardos <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. As with many species in the PVC superphylum, we were not able to find the cell division protein FtsZ in AB1_div, but unlike many Planctomycetes and Chlamydiae species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, AB1_div contains the complement of genes enabling peptidoglycan synthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S21</xref>). Analysis of other diagnostic insertions, deletions and signature proteins suggests that AB1_div has a common ancestor with all Planctomycetes, but represents a basal branch from this group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S22</xref>).</p><p>Although an initial assembly of AB1_rickettsiales lacked a 16S rRNA gene, we noticed a low-coverage (2.4&#x000d7;), low-GC (28.6%) contig (&#x0201c;NODE_4002&#x0201d;) containing a full rRNA operon consistent with a divergent relative of &#x003b1;-proteobacteria in the order Rickettsiales, which was taxonomically congruent with the genome tree of AB1_rickettsiales (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S14</xref>). We used an iterative assembly algorithm in a custom Perl script (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Information, Material and Methods</xref>), where reads are aligned to select contigs and re-assembled<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, to improve the AB1_rickettsiales assembly and reveal where the contig &#x0201c;NODE_4002&#x0201d; joins previously assigned sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S6</xref>). The joins suggested by this process were confirmed with PCR and Sanger sequencing. The original fragmented contig (&#x0201c;NODE_4002&#x0201d;) was 13.6 kbp in length, and was classified as order Rickettsiales based on ORF homology, but it was likely not grouped with the other AB1_rickettsiales contigs through ESOM because of high GC content skewed by the GC-rich rRNA operon on a relatively short contig (28.6% GC versus an average of 21.4% for assigned AB1_rickettsiales contigs).</p><p>AB1_rickettsiales appeared to be a divergent member of the order Rickettsiales in the genome tree (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S14</xref>); however, it has a contiguous rRNA region, in contrast to most of the Rickettsiales, in which the 16S rRNA gene is found in a different chromosomal region from the 23S and 5S rRNA genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. This fragmentation is thought to have occurred in a common ancestor of the Rickettsiales, some time after the divergence of the mitochondrial line<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. In a 16S rRNA-based tree, we found that AB1_rickettsiales forms a basal branch of the Rickettsiales, close to some members of &#x0201c;Rickettsiales genera incertae sedis&#x0201d; and the SAR11 clade (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S18</xref>). We found that, as in AB1_rickettsiales, the complete genomes available in the SAR11 group, as well as &#x0201c;incertae sedis&#x0201d; members <italic>Ca</italic>. Caedibacter acantamoebae (CP008936.1) and <italic>Ca</italic>. Paracaedibacter acanthamoaebae (CP008941.1) have contiguous 16S-23S-5S loci.</p><p>Rickettsiales are intracellular bacteria, either pathogens or symbionts capable of manipulating host cell reproduction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. They are common in insects and arachnids, which can act as vectors for other hosts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>.

Information from this genome bin suggests that it shares a number of features with currently available genomes in the order Rickettsiales. For instance, AB1_rickettsiales has a genome size of 436&#x02009;kbp and the ADP/ATP carrier protein TlcA, a signature protein of intracellular bacteria enabling the leaching of host energy by the exchange of ADP for host ATP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>, suggesting an intracellular and perhaps parasitic lifestyle for this organism.

Functional categories were assigned to predicted proteins using MEGAN<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, and in order to assess the functions represented in each genome bin&#x02019;s transcriptome, we assigned an &#x0201c;RPKMO share&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>) to each category by calculating the total RPKMO of all genes in that category as a proportion of total RPKMO for all ORFs.</p><p>AB1_lowgc is the bin most divergent from known taxa, with a 16S rRNA gene showing just 65% identity to <italic>Ca</italic>. Phytoplasma americanum (Phylum Tenericutes), which is below the phylum identity cutoff (75.0%) suggested by Yarza <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, and unassembled by the reference-guided program, EMIRGE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. AB1_lowgc has an unusual rRNA operon structure that was poorly annotated with automatic pipelines. Structural alignment of the 16S rRNA region with a rRNA model revealed an unaligned central 500&#x02009;bp sequence inserted into the V4 region<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S23</xref>), which does not have homology with any sequence in the NCBI database. This is an example of an &#x0201c;intervening sequence&#x0201d; in the 16S rRNA gene, which has been observed in various Archaea<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref> and Bacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>. A recent study has found that insertions in ribosomal RNA genes may be common in previously undetected bacteria in the &#x0201c;candidate phyla radiation&#x0201d; (CPR)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. We found evidence that this insertion is an intronic region, as alignments of RNAseq reads were consistent with the excision of the intervening sequence from the mature rRNA transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p><p>Although the phylum of AB1_lowgc is uncertain, its genome shares features with its closest relatives in the Tenericutes phylum, the Mycoplasmas and <italic>Candidatus</italic> Phytoplasma spp., such as small size (593&#x02009;kbp) and low GC content (20.9%). The Tenericutes phylum has an average GC content of 29.3% versus a bacterial average of 50.8%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>. We did not find evidence of codon reassignment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S7</xref>), and therefore AB1_lowgc may be more closely related to the Phytoplasmas (which use the normal bacterial genetic code) than the Mycoplasmas (which have reassigned the UGA stop codon to tryptophan)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>. Further consistent with Phytoplasma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>, we did not find many components of amino acid, nucleotide and fatty acid biosynthetic pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S21</xref>), and perhaps more characteristically<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>, basic phosphotransferases associated with sugar import also appeared to be missing. This finding could suggest a similar level of genome reduction in AB1_lowgc (compared to <italic>Candidatus</italic> Phytoplasma spp.). However, as only ~20% of its protein-coding genes have any homologs in NCBI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S9</xref>), we cannot determine the functions of the cryptic 80% of genes and therefore from comparison to available genomes it is difficult to judge the true extent of genome reduction. Only 129 out of 610 predicted protein-coding genes (21.1%) are functionally annotated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S9</xref>), a much lower portion than some other founding representatives of candidate phyla considered to be microbial dark matter. By comparison, 56% of ORFs were functionally annotated when the first genome of the SR1 clade was sequenced<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref> and 43.1% of ORFs were functionally annotated for the first sequenced genome of the candidate phylum TM6<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Intriguingly, despite a general lack of annotated function, many of the &#x0201c;hypothetical&#x0201d; genes were highly expressed. For instance, seven of the top ten most highly expressed proteins by RPKMO in the AB1_lowgc transcriptome were unannotated beyond &#x0201c;hypothetical proteins&#x0201d; and 60.7% of RNAseq reads aligned to ORFs in the AB1_lowGC with unassigned function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p>Among the genes that were functionally annotated, those related to translation as well as protein folding, sorting and degradation were highly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). This finding is consistent with previous studies of intracellular insect symbionts that have undergone significant genome reduction associated with an obligate intracellular lifestyle. In these systems, it is believed that folding and chaperone proteins are highly expressed in order to compensate for deleterious mutations accumulated through repeated replication bottlenecks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>. One hallmark of genome reduction in obligate symbiosis is the loss of general transcriptional regulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>. However, differential levels of other annotated fractions, such as nucleotide metabolism (10.0%) cell growth and death (4.95%) and energy metabolism (3.45%), perhaps indicate that AB1_lowgc still maintains some element of transcriptional regulation. Yet based on limited functional annotation of its metabolic potential, AB1_lowgc seems to be lacking most mainstream metabolic pathways, including glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Its expressed metabolic functions are limited to ATP synthase, ribonucleotide reductase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase activities. Despite being highly expressed, only 3 components of an F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-type ATP synthase were functionally annotated, apparently suggesting that AB1_lowGC is missing portions of the complex in both the F<sub>o</sub> and F<sub>1</sub> domain or that the protein sequence for these domains is highly divergent from those in reference databases. We were unable to identify any signs of the subunit a or b of the F<sub>0</sub>, as well the <italic>&#x003b5;</italic>-, <bold><italic>&#x003b3;</italic></bold>-, and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-subunits of the F<sub>1</sub> domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>. AB1_lowgc&#x02019;s sole annotated means of electron transport is limited to a thioredoxin reductase and in conjunction with some components of ATP synthase, it may be capable of energy generation via oxidative phosphorylation. However, it appears to lack any genes associated with fermentative metabolism and storage of complex carbon forms (e.g., polysaccharides).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Dynamics of the <italic>B. neritina</italic> metagenome</title><p>Among the genome bins we detected in AB1_ovicells, only <italic>Ca</italic>. E. sertula has previously been described as a stable symbiont of <italic>B. neritina</italic>. We therefore sought to determine whether the other bacterial species we detected were found in other individual bryozoans. We subjected DNA extracted from additional reproductive animals to 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>), and also carried out PCR studies with specific primers, since the 16S rRNA sequence of AB1_lowgc is not detectable with the amplicon primers used for high-throughput sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). Using a species cutoff of 98.7% identity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, amplicon detection of both AB1_endobugula and AB1_endozoicomonas largely agreed with PCR detection, except that specific primers did not detect AB1_endozoicomonas in some larval samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). This result may reflect an imperfect specificity of the ~430&#x02009;bp amplicon used for high throughput sequencing, leading to potential false-positive detection in the amplicon data where closely-related species are present.</p><p>AB1_endozoicomonas was either not present or at low levels in larvae, but appeared to have a wide distribution in <italic>B. neritina</italic> adults. It also was potentially present at low levels in a co-occurring bryozoan (<italic>B. stolonifera</italic>) and seawater, perhaps indicating that it is a pervasive, free-living local strain that frequently associates with multiple bryozoan species. AB1_phaeo was sporadically detected in <italic>B. neritina</italic> and <italic>B. stolonifera</italic> and there was some evidence of AB1_div in multiple <italic>B. neritina</italic> samples; however, both of these are found at the highest levels in AB1_ovicells. By contrast, both AB1_rickettsiales and AB1_lowgc, which required screening based on custom primers, were found only in AB1_ovicells.</p><p>The AB1_ovicells metagenome, at least in terms of its most abundant OTUs detected by amplicon primers (&#x0003e;1% relative abundance), was distinct in its composition compared to all of the other samples we subjected to 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). All abundant AB1_ovicells OTUs for which we constructed high quality genomes &#x02013; except for AB1_flavo and AB1_chromatiales, as their genome assemblies lacked a 16S rRNA gene &#x02013; were not detectable or were only minor components of other bryozoan samples. In fact, 44.2% of the amplicon reads representing abundant bacteria in AB1_ovicells were present in only that sample and by the same measure 91.3% of reads were found only in MHD_larvae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S25</xref>). These results further suggest that the majority of bacterial associates in our two deeply sequenced datasets (AB1_ovicells and MHD_larvae) are only found in one bryozoan sample.</p><p>As a whole our data suggest that the population of bacteria associated with <italic>B. neritina</italic> is spatially dynamic, as the majority of bacteria in AB1_ovicells apart from <italic>Ca</italic>. E. sertula were not conserved among a sample of <italic>B. neritina</italic> individuals collected at the same location. This shift in composition would complicate efforts of bacterial contig binning based on differential coverage analysis, because the most divergent bacteria in AB1_ovicells were simply not present in all of the other samples. These genomes were also impossible to separate on the basis of sequence homology because of their extreme divergence from known sequences. The functional consequences of such transient associations with <italic>B. neritina</italic>, however, are as yet unknown.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Summary</title><p>The larvae of marine bryozoan <italic>B. neritina</italic> were previously described as harboring a bacterial monoculture<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> and the presence of other bacterial associates had not previously been investigated in adult animals. We found that several other bacterial genomes were major components of the AB1_ovicells metagenome, and were present in other animals to a varying degree. For instance, while AB1_endozoicomonas was pervasive in the samples examined, AB1_rickettsiales and AB1_lowgc were unique to AB1_ovicells.</p><p>Because of the predominantly non-overlapping composition of their bacterial associates, the two <italic>B. neritina</italic> shotgun metagenomes in this study were not amenable to deconvolution through differential coverage analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, a method devised for the reference-free assembly of multiple genomes from metagenomes. This approach would not have been able to deconvolute the multiple genomes unique to the AB1_ovicells metagenome, which included several novel bacteria we only observed once. Instead, we were successful with a hybrid approach using both nucleotide composition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> and homology-based simplification. It must be noted, however, that there are some limitations to our approach. As homology is used for the first round of simplification (separating bacterial from eukaryotic and unclassified contigs), it is conceivable that highly divergent microbes could be erroneously included in the &#x0201c;unclassified&#x0201d; bin. Only ~20% of genes in AB1_lowgc had any blast hits, and of those 92% were classified as Bacteria. As this genome contained long stretches of unclassifiable genes, we were only successful in capturing it because the chromosome was assembled in a single contig. A lower quality assembly would potentially lead to loss of some sections from the bin. Likewise, we are fundamentally limited by sequence coverage. For example, we reconstructed nine bacterial 16S rRNA genes with EMIRGE, and only recovered eight genomes, of which two contained 16S rRNA genes too divergent for EMIRGE to reconstruct. The extra 16S rRNA sequences reconstructed from reads are likely to belong to genomes that were at too low abundance to be assembled but nevertheless carried multiple 16S rRNA copies.</p><p>Fortunately, in this case the component genomes in the AB1_ovicells metagenome were sufficiently distinct in coverage and GC content to allow separation by normal mixture modeling from a single sample that was not subjected to any physical or chemical pre-treatment, ultimately allowing us to assemble high quality genomes and capture a functional snapshot of several divergent and rare instances of &#x0201c;microbial dark matter.&#x0201d; This term has been used to describe regions of the bacterial tree of life for which 16S rRNA sequences have been determined, but little other information is available. This sentiment, however, does not acknowledge the presence of bacterial groups whose 16S rRNA sequences have never been detected. This distinction has important implications for biology, as although there may be over 1,000 bacterial phyla, the rate at which novel 16S rRNA sequences are discovered has been steadily decreasing despite an exponential increase in sequences being deposited to public databases, leading to a prediction that &#x0201c;the rate of detection of new genera and new species [of bacteria and archaea] may be close to zero by the end of 2015 and 2017, respectively&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. However, this decrease is likely due to inherent limitations of &#x0201c;universal&#x0201d; 16S rRNA primers, whose design is restricted by the corpus of known sequences. In support of this notion, based on a study of Colorado groundwater, Banfield and colleagues recently found that a large and previously unidentified portion of the bacterial tree of life had 16S rRNA genes not amplifiable with standard primers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p><p>Our results here further suggest that we cannot currently know the full extent of bacterial diversity, as in one single sample we were able to find three genomes containing 16S rRNA sequences not amplifiable by the commonly used primer set 27F/1492R or detectable by the eubacterial probe EUB338, and one of these sequences was also not amplifiable by a primer set recently designed for metagenomic sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). Based on the similarity of the 16S rRNA genes of our assembled genomes to known sequences, the genomes found in AB1_ovicells could, collectively, represent founding members of one new phylum, one new class, one new family and one new genus. The extent to which the bacterial tree of life is extended from this one sample illustrates the likely extent of biodiversity yet to be found, and the need for approaches that can assemble rare, divergent bacteria unique to single samples.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Collection of biological material and preservation</title><p>Adult individual <italic>B. neritina</italic> animals were collected by hand from the sides of floating docks at three sites in November 2013 and April 2014 near Morehead City, NC, and maintained in flow-through seawater tanks until processing.
