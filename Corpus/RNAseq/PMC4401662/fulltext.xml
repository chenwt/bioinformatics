Although this pathway has been evolved to help cells adapt in the presence of challenging conditions, it is co-opted in cancer to support malignancy. However, the mechanisms that regulate HSF1 and thus cellular stress response are poorly understood. Here we show that the ubiquitin ligase FBXW7 &#x003b1; interacts with HSF1 through a conserved motif phosphorylated by GSK3&#x003b2; and ERK1. FBXW7&#x003b1; ubiquitylates HSF1 and loss of FBXW7&#x003b1; results in impaired degradation of nuclear HSF1 and defective heat-shock response attenuation. FBXW7&#x003b1; is either mutated or transcriptionally downregulated in melanoma and HSF1 nuclear stabilization correlates with increased metastatic potential and disease progression. FBXW7&#x003b1; deficiency and subsequent HSF1 accumulation activates an invasion-supportive transcriptional program and enhances the metastatic potential of human melanoma cells. These findings identify a post-translational mechanism of regulation of the HSF1 transcriptional program both in the presence of exogenous stress and in cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Organisms respond to stressors by activating adaptive mechanisms to restore homeostasis. Environmental and intrinsic factors elicit the highly conserved heat-shock response, orchestrated by the transcription factor HSF1. Upon stress, HSF1 induces gene expression of heat-shock proteins (HSPs), which act as molecular chaperones and restore protein homeostasis<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. It has long been noted that cancer cells bolster their chaperone system to cope with stress caused by increased protein production due to aneuploidy, increased protein folding requirements and proteasome overwhelming<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. HSF1 deficiency protects against tumorigenesis driven by different oncogenic stimuli<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. In addition, depletion of HSF1, which itself is not a <italic>bona fide</italic> oncogene, decreases the viability of multiple cancer cell lines, a phenomenon coined as &#x0201c;non-oncogene addiction&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Apart from its classic role as a major activator of chaperone-encoding genes, HSF1 also regulates a malignant-specific transcriptional program, critical for cancer cells and tumor microenvironment<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. However, the signaling pathways modulating the HSF1 cancer-specific activity remain unknown.</p><p id="P3">Heat-shock response activation-attenuation is an intricate process as the HSF1 protein undergoes extensive post-translational modifications<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Protein stability controlled by the ubiquitinproteasome pathway is an emerging theme in human cancer. FBXW7, a substrate-targeting subunit of the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F box) ubiquitin ligase complex<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> targets several key regulators of proliferation, growth and apoptosis for proteasomal degradation<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. <italic>FBXW7</italic> is mutated in a significant portion of diverse human cancers<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. We investigate here the mode of post-translational regulation of HSF1 and demonstrate an interaction between FBXW7 and HSF1. We show that FBXW7&#x003b1; controls the stability of nuclear HSF1 and modulates the attenuation phase of the heat-shock response. Moreover, FBXW7 deficiency enhances the metastatic ability of melanoma via HSF1 stabilization and alteration of the HSF1 malignant transcriptional program. Altogether, our data suggest that a tumor suppressor, FBXW7, regulates heat-shock response and cancer cell stress response and metastatic potential via modification of HSF1.</p><sec id="S1"><title>HSF1 is a substrate of the FBXW7&#x003b1; ligase</title><p id="P4">To identify substrates of the ubiquitin ligase FBXW7&#x003b1;, we performed tandem affinity purification of FBXW7&#x003b1; and identified its interacting proteins by 2D LC-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, HSF1, similar to MYC, was detected in FBXW7&#x003b1; immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). However, the HSF1 interaction with a WD40 domain mutant FBXW7&#x003b1;, that lacks the ability to bind protein substrates but binds the Cullin 1 complex, was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In addition, endogenous FBXW7 and HSF1 were found to interact (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Analysis of HSF1 protein sequence revealed the presence of two conserved amino-acid sequences resembling the canonical FBXW7 degradation motif (degron) S/TPPXS/T<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, one of which (SPPQS), contains evolutionary conserved phosphoamino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P5">We next mapped the FBXW7&#x003b1; -binding motif of human HSF1. To investigate which amino acids participate in the interaction of HSF1 with FBXW7&#x003b1;, we mutated the two putative FBXW7&#x003b1; degrons (amino acid positions 303-307 and 363-367). We found that an HSF1 mutant containing alanine substitutions at both Ser303 and Ser307 [HSF1(Ser303/307Ala)] failed to bind FBXW7&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Further mutational analysis revealed both Ser303 and Ser307 as necessary residues contributing to its interaction with FBXW7&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Notably, phosphorylation of HSF1 on Ser303/307 by GSK3&#x003b2; and ERK1 respectively, has been suggested to play a role in down-modulating HSF1's activity during recovery from stress<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>-<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. Treatment of cells with a GSK3 inhibitor (GSK3i IX and XVI) or a MEK inhibitor (U0126) markedly decreased the affinity of FBXW7&#x003b1; for HSF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c, d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). This is consistent with the notion of a priming role for the Ser307 phosphorylation for subsequent phosphorylation on Ser303<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Moreover, depletion of <italic>FBXW7</italic> increased the half-life of nuclear HSF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Finally, we tested the ubiquitylation status of HSF1. Upon heat stress, HSF1 poly-ubiquitylation was markedly increased, suggesting a tagging mechanism for rapid proteasomal degradation upon stress removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). In sharp contrast, induced HSF1 polyubiquitylation was significantly reduced upon <italic>FBXW7</italic> silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>), suggesting that FBXW7 binds and directly controls HSF1 ubiquitylation.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Loss of <italic>FBXW7</italic> leads to defective nuclear HSF1 clearance and prolonged heat-shock response</title><p id="P7">To determine whether FBXW7 affects HSF1 protein turnover, we utilized the human colorectal cancer cell line HCT116, an isogenic cell line containing a homozygous deletion (KO) of the <italic>FBXW7</italic> gene and its wild type (WT), <italic>FBXW7</italic>-expressing counterpart<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. HSF1 shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, but upon stress it accumulates in the nucleus<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. Subcellular fractionation analysis of HSF1 revealed identical cytoplasmic HSF1 protein levels in WT and <italic>FBXW7</italic> KO cells under basal conditions (37&#x000b0;C; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). Strikingly, increased baseline HSF1 nuclear levels were observed in <italic>FBXW7</italic> KO cells, compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), in agreement with the nuclear localization of FBXW7&#x003b1; protein. Next, we exposed both cell lines to heat shock and noticed a marked increase of nuclear HSF1 levels. We also observed a rapid reduction of nuclear HSF1 during the recovery period, in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). In contrast, we noted a prolonged stabilization of nuclear HSF1 in <italic>FBXW7</italic> KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). HSF1 mRNA levels did not change during heat shock or recovery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). Subsequently, we asked whether loss of <italic>FBXW7</italic> affects the clearance of nuclear HSF1, accumulated upon exposure to MG132, a known proteotoxic stressor. We observed reduced degradation of HSF1 in <italic>FBXW7</italic> KO cells, compared to WT cells, upon MG132 removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). However, we could not detect any significant difference in the cytoplasmic fraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). Thus, FBXW7 deficiency results in defective clearance of nuclear HSF1 upon exogenous stress removal.</p><p id="P8">We then hypothesized that stabilization of nuclear HSF1 in <italic>FBXW7</italic> deficient cells might affect HSF1 target gene expression upon stress removal. We heat shocked the HCT116 WT and <italic>FBXW7</italic> KO cells (42&#x000b0;C for 1 hour) and monitored the expression of the heat-shock-inducible <italic>HSPA6</italic> gene after 2 hours of recovery at 37&#x000b0;C. In WT cells, <italic>HSPA6</italic> expression was diminished during the recovery period. Strikingly, in the <italic>FBXW7</italic> KO cells, <italic>HSPA6</italic> expression was higher after recovery, compared to heat shock (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). Identical results were obtained in HEK293T cells upon <italic>FBXW7</italic> silencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). To assess the change of HSF1 targets expression after heat shock and recovery, in a high throughput approach, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed in HCT116 WT and <italic>FBXW7</italic> KO cells. To identify direct HSF1 targets, we first performed chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) for HSF1 after heat-shock treatment of HCT116 (WT and KO) cells. We focused on high-confidence HSF1 targets and monitored their expression during heat shock and recovery in the two cell lines. In contrast to WT cells, the expression of positively regulated HSF1 targets, such as <italic>HSPH1</italic>, <italic>HSPB1</italic> and <italic>HSPE1</italic>, continued to increase in <italic>FBXW7</italic> KO cells during recovery from heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Notably, the majority of common HSF1 heat-shock response targets (both positively and negatively regulated) in HCT116 WT and <italic>FBXW7</italic> KO cells displayed opposite expression pattern during recovery from heat-shock treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). However, <italic>HSF1</italic> was expressed at similar basal levels in the two cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>). Thus, <italic>FBXW7</italic> loss results in defective attenuation of the heat-shock response.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Loss of <italic>FBXW7</italic> leads to aberrant HSF1 genome occupancy and protects cells from proteotoxic stress</title><p id="P9">To determine whether altered HSF1 stability can control genome occupancy by this transcription factor and subsequently alter HSF1 regulated transcriptional profiles, we performed ChIP-Seq analysis in WT and <italic>FBXW7</italic> KO HCT116 cells under basal conditions. A small (52) number of gene loci were bound by HSF1 in HCT116 WT cells. In contrast, in the <italic>FBXW7</italic> KO cells we identified a much larger number (485) of genes bound by HSF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>), suggesting that HSF1 protein increased stability leads to new binding sites on the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, <italic>EIF4A2</italic>, <italic>CCT6A</italic>). The vast majority of genes bound by HSF1 in WT cells were also bound in <italic>FBXW7</italic> KO cells. Notably, however, for many of the genes bound in both cell lines, promoter HSF1 binding (as defined by the peak density) was significantly stronger in the <italic>FBXW7</italic> KO cells compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, <italic>HSPD1/E1</italic>, <italic>HSP90AB1</italic>; 3f).

We monitored cell survival over 3 days in the presence of sublethal concentrations of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and the HSP90 inhibitor Radicicol. <italic>FBXW7</italic> KO cells were significantly more resistant to both proteotoxic stressors, compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). To test the FBXW7-HSF1 interplay in a non-cancer context, we examined mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from <italic>Fbxw7</italic> conditional knockout mice<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>.

Notably, the survival advantage was abolished upon downregulation of HSF1, indicating a stringent HSF1 requirement for protection against proteotoxicity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>HSF1 protein levels and gene target expression are associated with metastasis in melanoma</title><p id="P11">To further investigate the role of FBXW7-HSF1 interplay in human cancer progression and metastasis, we focused on melanoma, a solid tumor in which <italic>FBXW7</italic> is frequently mutated and inactivated<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. We tested HSF1 protein expression using immunohistochemistry in human specimens. We found that HSF1 protein levels were significantly increased as melanoma progressed to metastatic disease (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001 for metastatic versus primary or nevi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). To assess the functional significance of HSF1 accumulation in melanoma, we asked whether HSF1 gene targets were upregulated during disease progression. Previously characterized HSF1 targets, including <italic>HSPD1</italic>, <italic>HSPE1</italic>, <italic>HSPH1</italic> and <italic>CKS2</italic> were expressed in significantly higher levels in metastatic melanoma compared to primary melanoma and normal skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>).

In agreement with this model, we found that FBXW7 protein expression shows opposite pattern to HSF1 expression during disease progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>). To further investigate the hypothesis that HSF1 activation is associated with poor disease outcome, we expanded the primary human melanoma specimens cohort. These tumors were scored for levels of HSF1 and survival outcomes were investigated.

HSF1 transcription factor exerts both positive and negative role on the regulation of its targets and mRNAs positively correlated with HSF1 expression comprised the &#x0201c;positive signature&#x0201d; while mRNAs negatively correlated with HSF1 expression comprised the &#x0201c;negative signature&#x0201d;.

Moreover, it illustrates that FBXW7 modulates the malignant transcriptome via stabilization of HSF1. Since HSF1 provides critical stress relief and metastatic advantage in cancer, it is tempting to speculate that HSF1 stabilization is an important arm of the FBXW7 tumor suppressor activity in all tumors where <italic>FBXW7</italic> mutations and genomic loses are reported. Also, given that <italic>FBXW7</italic> function is frequently impaired in cancer by mechanisms other than mutations and allelic loss<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>, we propose that the impact of HSF1 stabilization on cancer progression is broad.</p><p id="P22">Despite decades of study, HSF1 regulation during classic heat-shock response is not fully understood. The extensive array of post-translational modifications of HSF1 during the activation/attenuation cycle adds complexity. In the light of current knowledge, attenuation of the heat-shock response pathway involves weak interactions of HSF1 with HSPs and SIRT1-dependent control of HSF1 DNA binding activity<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>-<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. Recently, a genome-wide RNAi screen suggested that the nuclear proteasome has a pivotal role in the regulation of the heat-shock response<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup>. However, no specific ubiquitin complex was previously connected to HSF1 ubiquitylation. We were able to show here that FBXW7 links the activated HSF1 to the degradation machinery and FBXW7 activity affects both the classical role of HSF1 in the heat-shock response and its role in the orchestration of the cancer-supportive transcriptome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 7f</xref>).

Our study shows that these amino acids mediate the interaction of HSF1 with the CUL1:FBXW7 ubiquitylation complex.

Since HSF1 is a powerful modifier of tumorigenesis<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>, it remains to be seen whether altered function of these kinases in different cancers converges on HSF1 stability.</p><p id="P23">Previous studies have suggested that HSF1 activation is associated with poor outcome in breast cancer<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>.

Outlier points in the two distributions (for example, matches with very low Xcorr but very high DeltaCN) were discarded. Full separation of the direct and decoy subsets is not generally possible; therefore, the discriminant score was set such that a false positive rate of 1% was determined based on the number of accepted decoy database peptides. This procedure was independently performed on each data subset, resulting in a false positive rate independent of tryptic status or charge state.

No statistic method was used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized. No samples were excluded from the analysis. In vivo experiments were performed in compliance with a referenced protocol (120405-03) approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). When tumors were palpable (15 days), length and width measurements were made with calipers 3 times weekly until the animals were sacrificed. Tumor volume was calculated by the following formula: a<sup>2</sup>*b/2, where a is the width and b is the length. 40 days after subcutaneous injection, all animals were sacrificed to assess tumor mass and quantify lung metastasis. Tumors were extracted, weighed, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. Lungs, liver, spleen, and kidney were removed for analysis of metastasis. Ventral and dorsal macroscopic images of metastasis-bearing lungs were taken with a fluorescent dissecting microscope equipped with a black and white camera. Pictures of the same lung were stitched and macroscopic metastases were quantified by counting lesions in both sides of lung per mouse. Representative images from tumors from 5 mice per condition are included.

To enforce more stringent criteria for significant differential expression, we ran DEGseq on each matched heat shock-recovery pair of biological replicates, and filtered out genes with inconsistent changes between replicates.
