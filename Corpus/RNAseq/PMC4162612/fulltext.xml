Genome organization in these organisms is unusual for a eukaryote, as open reading frames are organized in long polycistronic transcription units (TUs) that are transcribed by RNA polymerase II from only a few initiation sites in the chromosome <xref rid="pone.0107608-MartnezCalvillo1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Individual mRNAs are co-transcriptionally processed from polycistronic precursors by coupled <italic>trans</italic>-splicing at the 5&#x02032;-end and polyadenylation at the 3&#x02032;-end <xref rid="pone.0107608-Liang1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Adjacent TUs are often convergent or divergent, and are separated by strand switch regions (SSRs). RNA polymerase II transcription usually begins at divergent SSRs and ends at convergent SSRs <xref rid="pone.0107608-MartnezCalvillo1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107608-MartnezCalvillo2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Histone variants present in convergent SSRs are distinct from other variants associated with divergent SSRs, and it is assumed that the limits of polycistronic TUs are defined by distinct chromatin conformations <xref rid="pone.0107608-Siegel1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Therefore, RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription initiation and termination seems to be regulated simply by histone modifications and chromatin structure, but the mechanism is currently unknown. In addition, chromatin conformation could be important in insulating RNA polymerase II TUs from RNA polymerase I and III expression sites <xref rid="pone.0107608-Siegel1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, .</p><p>There are numerous repetitive sequences within the <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> genome, including retroposons INGI/RIME and SLACs, and satellite-like repeats such as CIR147 <xref rid="pone.0107608-Patrick1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Transcripts derived from these elements are selectively degraded by the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway <xref rid="pone.0107608-Patrick1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. It is currently unknown whether chromatin structure also plays a role in the transcriptional silencing of retroposons and repeats. That could well be the case, since some histone variants that are known to be involved in heterochromatin-dependent silencing in other organisms, such as H2AZ, are associated with repetitive DNA in <italic>T. brucei</italic><xref rid="pone.0107608-Lowell1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>In other eukaryotes, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are emerging as important factors regulating gene silencing and chromatin structure through RNAi-dependent and independent mechanisms. Examples include RNAi-mediated formation of heterochromatin at non-coding and repeated DNA in <italic>Saccharomyces pombe</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0107608-Creamer1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, or transcriptional silencing promoted by the association of chromatin-remodeling complexes with ncRNA-binding proteins such as IDN2 in <italic>Arabidospsis thaliana</italic>

<xref rid="pone.0107608-Estevez1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. RBP33 depletion results in the accumulation of transcripts derived from silenced regions, such as SSRs and retroposon genes, and thus it could have a role in regulating gene silencing in trypanosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>RBP33 is an essential nuclear protein in trypanosomes</title><p>The <italic>T. brucei</italic> RNA-binding protein RBP33 (Tb927.8.990) is 317 amino acids long, and contains an RNA-recognition motif, a putative nuclear localization signal and two intrinsically disordered regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107608-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).

Indeed, 90% of the RBP33-associated RNAs annotated as coding for &#x02018;hypothetical proteins&#x02019; or &#x02018;hypothetical proteins, unlikely&#x02019; were not detected by ribosome profiling <xref rid="pone.0107608-Vasquez1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and 75% were not detected in a global transcriptome survey <xref rid="pone.0107608-Kolev1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107608.s006">Table S1</xref>). Moreover, over one-third of the corresponding genes are located next to SSRs, close to the ends of chromosomes or have an antisense orientation within a transcription unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107608-g003">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107608.s006">Table S1</xref>). Interestingly, depletion of RBP33 results in an accumulation of SSR-derived transcripts. In the related parasite <italic>Leishmania tarentolae</italic>, it has been shown that base J (&#x000df;-D-glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil) prevents read-through at RNA polymerase II termination sites <xref rid="pone.0107608-vanLuenen1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. <italic>L. tarentolae</italic> cells seem to require base J for viability <xref rid="pone.0107608-Genest1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, but <italic>T. brucei</italic> can survive without J <xref rid="pone.0107608-Cliffe1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Two thymidine hydrolases are involved in the synthesis of J <xref rid="pone.0107608-Cliffe1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, but none is encoded by RBP33-bound mRNAs. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of a regulatory protein that has a role in silencing gene expression at RNA polymerase II termination regions. In addition, RBP33 silencing promotes the accumulation of retroposon and repeat-derived RNAs. This phenomenon has been also observed upon disruption of the RNAi machinery in <italic>T. brucei</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0107608-Patrick1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, raising the question of whether RBP33 could have a role in the regulation of the RNAi pathway in trypanosomes. In fact, convergent SSRs have been shown to produce small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in <italic>T. brucei</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0107608-Tschudi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, the molecular phenotype observed upon depletion of RBP33 presents some differences with that observed in trypanosomes lacking a functional RNAi pathway. Thus, deletion of the genes encoding the dicer-like protein TbDCL2 or the argonaute protein TbAGO1 results in the accumulation of full-length INGI transcripts which are &#x0223c;6 kb long and CIR147-derived transcripts of &#x0223c;10 kb <xref rid="pone.0107608-Patrick1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, whereas the transcripts observed upon RBP33 silencing were smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107608-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). We did, however, detect full-length transcripts corresponding to SLACs retroposons. Second, the accumulation of retroposon and repeat transcripts is stage-dependent, being almost undetected in procyclic trypanosomes. And third, deletion of TbDCL2 did not result in the accumulation of convergent SSR-derived transcripts, whereas this sort of RNAs was readily visible upon RBP33 ablation. For instance, we could detect transcripts derived from the SSR located in between genes Tb927.10.2390 and Tb927.10.2400 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107608.s003">Figure S3B</xref>), whereas no accumulation of RNAs transcribed from this region was observed when TbDCL2 was deleted <xref rid="pone.0107608-Tschudi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>SSRs are enriched in specific histone variants in trypanosomes <xref rid="pone.0107608-Siegel1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> but whether these variants promote heterochromatin assembly and thus transcription silencing is not known at present. Likewise, it is unknown whether the silent transcriptional status of CIR147 repeats and retroposon genes is due to heterochromatinization, although some histone variants that are known to be involved in heterochromatin-dependent silencing, such as H2AZ, have been found associated to repetitive DNA <xref rid="pone.0107608-Lowell1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In other organisms, heterochromatin formation depends on both RNAi-dependent and RNAi-independent mechanisms. Among the latter, the yeast RNA-binding protein Nrd1 has been shown to bind to unstable non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), and to promote heterochromatin assembly and transcriptional silencing, thus providing a failsafe termination mechanism in case of read through transcription <xref rid="pone.0107608-Webb1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107608-Marina1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. RBP33 could perform a similar function in trypanosomes by binding to non-coding RNAs and promoting gene silencing <italic>via</italic> chromatin conformation. The source of ncRNAs could be SSRs, genes whose products are annotated as &#x02018;hypothetical proteins (unlikely)&#x02019; or even transcripts coding for known proteins. In this regard, we have shown that although RBP33 binds to translatable transcripts, its depletion has no apparent effect on the levels of target mRNAs or in the protein product. However, RBP33 could be involved in the processing of cryptic ncRNAs located within the untranslated regions of a defined set of mRNAs. Alternatively, RBP33 could be part of a surveillance mechanism that selectively degrades RNAs transcribed from silenced regions in the genome. Another plausible interpretation is that RBP33 depletion results in an increased maturation or alternative processing of transcripts derived from SSR and retroposons, which is supported by the observation that slower-migrating INGI/RIME and CIR147 repeats transcripts decrease in abundance upon RBP33 silencing in bloodstream forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107608-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). The actual mechanism remains to be determined. Our findings support the hypothesis that gene silencing is, at least in part, controlled at the RNA level in trypanosomes, and uncovers an unprecedented role for RNA-binding proteins in this process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Trypanosome culture and RNA interference</title><p><italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> 449 procyclic cells <xref rid="pone.0107608-Biebinger1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> were grown at 27&#x000b0;C in SDM-79 medium <xref rid="pone.0107608-Brun1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> containing 10% fetal bovine serum. &#x02018;Single marker&#x02019; <italic>T. brucei</italic> Lister 427 bloodstream cell line S16 <xref rid="pone.0107608-Wirtz1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> were maintained in HMI-9 medium <xref rid="pone.0107608-Hirumi1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.
