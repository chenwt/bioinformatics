of monozygotic twins (i.e. fetuses derived from the same egg) discordant for
trisomy 21 (Down syndrome; DS), Letourneau <italic>et al.,</italic>
<sup>&#x000a0;</sup>reported the presence of a defined pattern of dysregulation within
specific genomic domains they referred to as <underline>G</underline>ene
<underline>E</underline>xpression <underline>D</underline>ysregulated
<underline>D</underline>omains (GEDDs). GEDDs were described as alternating
segments of increased or decreased gene expression affecting all chromosomes.
Strikingly, GEDDs in fibroblasts were largely conserved in induced pluripotent
cells (iPSCs) generated from the twin&#x02019;s fibroblasts as well as in fibroblasts
from the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS. Our recent analysis failed to find GEDDs. We
reexamined the human iPSCs RNAseq data from Letourneau <italic>et al.</italic>,
and data from this same research group published earlier examining iPSCs from
the same monozygotic twins. An independent analysis of RNAseq data from Ts65Dn
fibroblasts also failed to confirm presence of GEDDs. Our analysis questions the
validity of GEDDs in DS.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Gene expression</kwd><kwd>Down syndrome</kwd><kwd>iPSC</kwd><kwd>RNAseq</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1"><funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source><award-id>NS055371</award-id><award-id>NS24054</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>NIH grants NS055371 and NS24054, Larry L.

transcriptome data for the developing and mature hippocampus in an attempt to
identify GEDDs. Our data provided no evidence for the pattern reported in Letourneau
<italic>et al.</italic>&#x02019;s work. We first entertained the possibility that GEDDs
were not present in post mitotic cells or cells undergoing neural differentiation.
However, to ensure that we fully understood the published GEDD data, we examined the
entire RNAseq dataset from the Letourneau manuscript, as provided publicly via the
Gene Expression Omnibus. </p><p>Principal component analysis (PCA) of RNAseq replicates from the twin&#x02019;s fibroblast
(T1DS: twin with DS; T2N: disomic twin) revealed a great deal of variability ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1a">Figure 1A</xref>). When the datasets from Letourneau
<italic>et al.</italic>, are compared, in two of four cases, a closer
relationship exists between the DS and disomic twin fibroblasts than for replicates
from the same individual. [The datasets from Letourneau <italic>et al.</italic> are
denoted by &#x02013;L]. For example, one of the 2N-hFibro-L replicates clustered more
tightly with a DS-hFibro-L replicate than with any of its own replicate (2N)
samples.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="f1a" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1A. </label><caption><title>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of global gene expression (RNAseq)

hiPSCs-H.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="f1000research-4-7234-g0000"/></fig><p>We next checked the variability of the twin&#x02019;s iPSCs RNAseq data. We found an
additional three RNASeq replicates (hiPSCs-H) performed by the same research group
and published earlier using fibroblasts from the same monozygotic twins <sup><xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. PCA analysis of these data revealed that replicates of hiPSCs-H (H for
Hibaoui) clustered well together; however, they did not cluster well with the data
for hiPSCs-L ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1a">Figure 1A</xref>). Altogether, PCA
analysis indicated marked variability between datasets, raising the possibility that
technical issues in the RNAseq samples or in their analysis compromised the
Letourneau study.</p><p>To further explore the additional three hiPSCs-H RNAseq replicates, we searched for
GEDDs using methods similar to those utilized by Letourneau and colleagues. Our
analysis of the hiPSCs-H did not find conserved patterns indicative of GEDDs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1b">Figure 1B</xref> shows the results for two chromosomes,
as examples. The authors reported high global gene fold-change correlations between
the twin&#x02019;s fibroblasts and derived iPSCs. Our re-analysis found a similar high
correlation value of &#x003c1; = 0.82 between the hiPSCs-L and hFibro-L. However, we found
the hiPSCs-H poorly correlated with the original datasets; &#x003c1; = 0.31 between hiPSCs-L
and hiPSCs-H; &#x003c1; = 0.07 between hiPSCs-H and hFibro-L ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1c">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="sf1">Supplementary

Ts65Dn mouse is segmentally trisomic (34Mb) for a portion of mouse chromosome 16
(MMU16); the segment contains about 88 mouse homologues to human genes on the long
arm of HSA21; it also carries an extra copy of the approximately 10Mb centromeric
segment of MMU17 that is not syntenic to any region on human chromosome 21 <sup><xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013; <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. To further explore the possibility of GEDDs, RNAseq data was obtained from
three replicates each from Ts65Dn and wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs-D)
(D for Do denotes MEFs in the current study). PCA revealed tight clustering between
our replicates ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1d">Figure 1D</xref>), but not those for
the MEFs-L samples. While we found expected changes in gene expression in MEFs-D,
analysis of MEFs-L and MEFs-D found a poor global correlation (&#x003c1; = -0.31) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1e">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="sf1">Supplementary figure 1B</xref>); this was also the case across all mouse
chromosomes (for examples see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1f">Figure 1F</xref> and

findings raise serious concerns regarding the validity of GEDDs. We find no evidence
for such domains in the studies on DS referenced herein or in cells from the Ts65Dn

been established for well over a decade (and seems a self-evident outcome of a
trisomy such as that of Hsa21 which includes eight transcription factors, 29
microRNAs and a large number of lncRNAs among other key regulators). Recently, a
pattern of chromosome regions showing up- or down- regulation of transcription in
the trisomic genome based on RNAseq and substantiated with correlated regional
changes in chromosome architecture was reported by Letourneau et al. ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24740065">Letourneau et al., 2014</ext-link>). They referred to these regions as &#x0201c;gene
expression dysregulated domains&#x0201d; or GEDDs. While the original analysis was carried
out in fibroblast and iPS lines derived from a co-isogenic pair of monozygotic
fetuses, one of which was euploid and the other of which had trisomy 21, Letourneau
et al. report that the pattern of GEDDs is conserved in fibroblasts from the
<italic>outbred</italic> Ts65Dn trisomic mouse model of Down syndrome (DS),
i.e., the same blocks of disomic genes are up- or down-regulated in a mouse trisomic
for orthologs of about half of the genes on Hsa21. These same effects are reported
to be undetectable in a pooled comparison of 8 trisomic and 8 euploid cell lines,
where they are hypothesized to be masked by normal variability in gene expression
expected in individuals who are (obviously) not co-isogenic.</p><p>In this report, Do et al. were unable to reproduce these GEDD patterns in an analysis
of Ts65Dn mice similar to that which formed a part of the Letourneau evidence. Do et
al. then proceeded to compare the Letourneau RNAseq results in this paper to RNAseq
results generated previously by this group from cell lines of this same twin pair (
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24375627">Hibaoui et al.,
2014</ext-link>) and found substantial variability in the results obtained in
these independently done experiments. Based on several such comparisons in addition
to the absence of GEDDS in their independent experiments, Do et al. conclude that
there is not clear evidence for the existence of GEDDs.</p><p>The comments by Pierce-Shimomura and Nordquist provide an excellent summary of
several statistical issues in the analyses. They suggest possible clarifications to
the Do study and conclude, with Do, that the existence of GEDDs is not proven. I
would note only two additional two points. <list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The PCA analysis in Do et al. comparing datasets from Letourneau and
Hibaoui appears to show very strong batch effects, which is in fact the
expected outcome for this type of comparison of two studies on different
RNA sets prepared and run at different times, probably on different
sequencers with different lots of reagents, without reference to
placement in sequencing cells, etc. Statistical methods have been
developed to clean data for this type of comparison (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioconductor.jp/packages/3.2/bioc/html/sva.html">Leek JT, Johnson WE, Parker HS, Fertig EJ, Jaffe AE and Storey JD.

in the Do analysis.</p></list-item><list-item><p>As in all analyses of large platform datasets, it is impossible to
determine from the published and supplemental methods what has actually
been done at a level of detail required to reproduce it independently &#x02013;
this applies to both studies. (For the exception proving this rule,

the statistical comparisons used to identify GEDDs &#x02013; a <italic>biological</italic>
phenomenon - as they have no biological replicates, only technical ones. It was not
clear to this reviewer whether Letourneau established four fibroblast clones and/or
iPS lines from each twin (and if so, in how many independent transformation
experiments) but this would only be a technical replicate for the artifact of that
transformation process, not for the biology of GEDDs in trisomy, and therefore it is
not the appropriate basis for the statistically-based conclusions that they make
about the <italic>biology</italic> of the effects of trisomy 21 on transcription.
For biological conclusions, there is an N of one euploid and one trisomic individual
&#x02013; statistical assessments are not possible with a single comparison.</p><p>Letourneau et al. argue that genetic variability affecting gene expression levels
does not allow detection of GEDDs in any but co-isogenic conditions. However, if
GEDDs exist and are so highly conserved in evolution that the same genes are
mis-regulated in the same way in outbred* trisomic mice, it is difficult to
understand why they are not evident in any comparison of humans with two vs. three
copies of Hsa21; if GEDDs only occur in vanishingly rare, coisogenic monozygotic
human twin sets discordant for a specific trisomy, the phenomenon would hardly seem
worthy of the attention it has received. An explanation for the conservation of this
phenomenon in outbred individuals of another species but not between human pairs
would strengthen the understanding of this phenomenon. An adequately described
experiment comparing multiple individuals with two vs. three copies of Hsa21
including euploid and trisomic sib pairs, in addition to the statistical
clarifications suggested by Pierce-Shimomura, would help to establish the existence
or not of GEDDs and provide some indication of their relevance to the goal of
ameliorating effects of gene dosage in DS.</p><p>*Ts65Dn mice are maintained as an advanced intercross between any of several C57BL6
and C3H strains. Thus, individual mice and their sibs are not genetically identical
and are heterozygous at ~50% of all loci - a different 50 % for each individual.
SNPs occur about every 3000 bp between B6 and C3H, while SNPs for a given segment of
a human chromosome pair might be on the order of one per 1000 bp. It might be
important to consider variability in chr21 alleles in each twin. Assuming the
original conceptus was trisomic, if trisomy resulted from a meiosis I error, the
trisomic line will carry three sets of Hsa21 alleles while the euploid twin will
lack one of the three sets. If the trisomy resulted from a meiosis II error, the
euploid twin could be isodisomic for Chr21 and carry only a single set of alleles.
One could speculate about the possible impact of isodisomy on genome-wide expression
patterns.</p><p>I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise

and intriguing new hypothesis that trisomy 21 may cause up and down regulation of
groups of genes associated with specific physical domains on different human
chromosomes (Letourneau <italic>et al</italic>., 2014). These were called gene
expression dysregulation domains (GEDDs). Additional evidence suggested that GEDDs
may be conserved across human cell types, and surprisingly, may relate to equivalent
syntenic domains in the mouse genome after analysis of the Ts65Dn mouse model of
Down syndrome (DS) (Letourneau <italic>et al</italic>., 2014).</p><p>Here, Do <italic>et al</italic>., first report that replicates from the Letourneau
<italic>et al</italic>. (2014) dataset are more variable than one would expect
as determined by principle component analysis (PCA). This is an important finding
because identification of the purported GEDDs and their extrapolated conservation
across tissue types and species depends on minimal variation across datasets. To
better understand the significance of the apparent variation in replicate datasets
(Figure 1A), it would be useful if Do <italic>et al</italic>. could also plot the
percent variance aside each dot accounted for the first principal component. The
procedure for data normalization should also be explained more thoroughly in the
results section as this may significantly alter the apparent variance by PCA. Do
<italic>et al</italic>. also find that data from the Letourneau <italic>et
al</italic>., 2014 study varies significantly from data from a previous study by
the same lab that used human cells derived from the same source in ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24375627">Hibaoui <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</ext-link>).</p><p>Do <italic>et al. </italic>then analyze how gene expression changes across physical
locations on human chromosomes. They replicate the original finding by Letourneau
<italic>et al. </italic>(2014) showing that there are domains of up and down
regulated genes from human iPSCS and fibroblasts derived from the same source.
However, they also find that these domains fail to correlate with data derived from
the same source but published in an earlier study from the same group (Hibaoui
<italic>et al</italic>., 2014). This finding raises significant doubt about the
concept of conserved GEDDs if they cannot be replicated from tissue derived from the
same individual and collected by the same research group. Do <italic>et
al</italic>., might do well to suggest explanations for the lack of correlation
including specific analysis techniques and methodologies.</p><p>Lastly, Do <italic>et al</italic>. find that RNAseq datasets from wild-type and the
Ts65Dn mouse model published in the (Letourneau <italic>et al</italic>., 2014) paper
show considerable variation from their new set of mouse data as determined by PCA.
They also show a lack of correlation between fold-change gene expression for both
datasets across chromosomes.</p><p>Together, this new analysis suggests a re-evaluation of the GEDDs concept related DS.
Specific groups of physically-linked genes (domains) may indeed be up and down
regulated in DS across individuals and perhaps in mouse models of DS. However,
variation within and across RNAseq datasets appears to prevent defining these
domains and generalizing them to other individuals and species with current methods
of analysis.</p><p>We have read this submission. We believe that we have an appropriate level of
