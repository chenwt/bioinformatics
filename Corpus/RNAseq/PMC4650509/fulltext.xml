Each population was evaluated as either phosphine-exposed or no phosphine (untreated controls) in triplicate biological replicates (12 samples total). Pairwise analysis indicated there were eight genes differentially expressed between susceptible and resistant insects not exposed to phosphine (i.e., basal expression) or those exposed to phopshine (&#x0003e;8-fold expression and 90&#x000a0;% C.I.). However, 214 genes were differentially expressed among all four treatment groups at a statistically significant level (ANOVA, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Increased expression of 44 cytochrome P450 genes was found in resistant vs. susceptible insects, and phosphine exposure resulted in additional increases of 21 of these genes, five of which were significant among all treatment groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Expression of two genes encoding anti-diruetic peptide was 2- to 8-fold reduced in phosphine-resistant insects, and when exposed to phosphine, expression was further reduced 36- to 500-fold compared to susceptible. Phosphine-resistant insects also displayed differential expression of cuticle, carbohydrate, protease, transporter, and many mitochondrial genes, among others. Gene ontology terms associated with mitochondrial functions (oxidation biological processes, monooxygenase and catalytic molecular functions, and iron, heme, and tetrapyyrole binding) were enriched in the significantly differentially expressed dataset. Sequence polymorphism was found in transcripts encoding a known phosphine resistance gene, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, in both susceptible and resistant insects.

Phosphine kills insects rapidly at a relatively low cost, leaving minimal residues on treated products. The continued use of phosphine is of critical importance due to the regulated phase-out of the ozone-depleting fumigant methyl bromide. Phosphine is toxic to all animals, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] has established guidelines with recommended times and doses for treatment of stored product pests, depending on environmental conditions. Phosphine is a strong reducing agent, and biological redox systems, particularly the mitochondrial electron transport chain, are likely targets in insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Phosphine is not absorbed (i.e., not toxic) under anoxic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and carbon dioxide can potentiate its toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], which implies that phosphine targets respiration in insects.</p><p>Most bulk grain in the United States is fumigated with phosphine because it is more economical than sampling and monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, selection pressure for resistance to phosphine is strong in stored product pests. Recent studies indicated a substantial increase in phosphine resistance over the past 21&#x000a0;years in major stored-wheat pests in the United States, with levels of resistance approaching those reported for stored-grain pest species in other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The first report of phosphine resistance in the red flour beetle, <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>, was more than 40&#x000a0;years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In that study, it was demonstrated that 10-fold resistance to phosphine could be selected in six generations from a population of <italic>T. castaneum.</italic> Other studies have suggested that insects (including <italic>T. castaneum</italic>) with low carbon dioxide production display higher resistance to phosphine, suggesting that lower respiration rates reduce fumigant uptake in resistant insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A major phosphine resistance gene, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD), was found to be mutated in phosphine-resistant <italic>T. castaneum</italic> and another stored product beetle, the lesser grain borer (<italic>Rhyzopertha dominica</italic>), as well as phosphine-resistant nematodes <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]<italic>.</italic> DLD is a mitochondrial homodimer enzyme and participates in a number of key energy complexes, and thus is highly conserved among organisms.</p><p>In this study, we compared a phosphine-resistant and -susceptible population of <italic>T. castaneum</italic>, exposed or not to phosphine, by the differential transcript expression method RNA-Seq, using the sequenced genome of <italic>T. castaneum</italic> to facilitate data analysis. Phosphine-resistant insects also were evaluated for resistance to another insecticide, deltamethrin. We found many statistically-significant differences in gene expression in resistant insects that suggest major changes in the mitochondria. The data indicate that RNA-Seq can be used to identify differential expression patterns in insecticide resistant insects associated with biological mechanisms, as well as individual variation in potential resistance genes within a population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>RNA-Seq analysis</title><p>To examine differential gene expression associated with phosphine-resistance in <italic>T. castaneum</italic>, we compared expression levels in a phosphine-resistant population from Brazil, reported to have 164-fold resistance to phosphine and a lower respiration rate than susceptible insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Interestingly, we found that resistance to phosphine in the Brazilian strain had increased nearly 3-fold (to 475-fold) since the previous bioassays were performed (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), possibly due to a genetic bottleneck during subculturing for this study. RNA-Seq was used to compare gene expression in this phosphine-resistant strain and a laboratory strain that was susceptible to phosphine, before and after exposure to sublethal phosphine doses/exposure times (for the susceptible insects, the dose was 0.65&#x000a0;ppm for 8&#x000a0;h; for the resistant insects, the dose was 200&#x000a0;ppm for 20&#x000a0;h).</p><p>Pairwise analysis was used to construct scatter plots demonstrating the relative expression of genes in untreated susceptible and resistant <italic>T. castaneum</italic> adults (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>A) and phosphine-treated susceptible and resistant adults (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>B). Gene expression was also compared in phosphine-treated and untreated resistant insects (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>C), and phosphine-treated and untreated susceptible insects (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>D). Plots of relative transcript expression were linear (R<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.95 to 0.97), and included genes that were statistically significant in the pairwise analysis (&#x0003e;90&#x000a0;% C.I.), although many were below the cutoff threshold of RPKM&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1 (log<sub>2</sub>). Differences greater than 8-fold were indicated by white dots in the scatter graphs.</p><p>In the comparison of resistant to susceptible insects not exposed to phosphine (i.e. basal gene expression, &#x0003e;90&#x000a0;% C.I.), a gene encoding a hypothetical protein was significantly increased in expression (2,630-fold) in resistant compared to susceptible insects (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Increased expression also was associated with genes encoding cytochrome P450 (CYP) 9e2 (8.84-fold). A gene encoding a glycine-rich protein was decreased in resistant insects 15.6-fold compared to susceptible insects.</p><p>When resistant and susceptible insects were exposed to sublethal doses of phosphine, two additional CYP genes (CYP6a14 and 346B-1) were significantly increased in expression in resistant insects compared to susceptible (51.4- and 9.89-fold, respectively;&#x000a0;Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Decreased expression in phosphine-exposed resistant insects was found in genes encoding an uncharacterized protein, pox-neuro, and anti-diruetic peptide (ADF; 27.0- to 35.7-fold).</p><p>In the comparisons of phosphine-exposed/not exposed for either resistant or susceptible insects, while there were significant differences in gene expression, all RPKM values were less than 1.0 (data not shown).</p><p>ANOVA of differences in gene expression among all four treatment groups yielded 214 genes that were significant in the differentially-expressed (DE) dataset (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S1).

<sup>b</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>Unfortunately, the most highly upregulated gene among all groups in the DE dataset was the uncharacterized protein (LOC103314140) found in the pairwise analysis (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S1); this gene was 2,600-fold increased in resistant compared to susceptible insects but decreased to 833-fold when exposed to phosphine, and contained a motif similar to DUF753 Transglycosylase (data not shown). A gene encoding an alanine and glycine-rich protein was up-regulated mostly in phosphine-exposed resistant insects; these proteins are found in mammals and plants but their function is unknown. There were twelve significantly up-regulated CYP genes in phosphine-resistant insects, and phosphine exposure resulted in further increases in the expression of nine CYP genes (CYP genes will be discussed in a separate section below). Several genes encoding UGT were significantly up-regulated in resistant insects, although one encoding UGT-2B7 had low RPKM values (data not shown). UGTs serve a major role in the conjugation and subsequent elimination of potentially toxic xenobiotics and endogenous compounds, and UGT-2B7 is the isoform most responsible for glucuronidation of clinical drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. UGT enzymes are found in a number of metabolic pathways in <italic>T. castaneum</italic>, including cytochrome P450 systems involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics. Some genes encoding enzymes active in mitochondria were increased in expression in resistant insects, and further increased when insects were exposed to phosphine, including one encoding peroxiredoxin-6, which protects against mitochondrial dysfunction in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and dihydrolipoyllysine-residue succinyltransferase (DLST) and associated enzyme dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, another name for the major phosphine resistance gene DLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Up-regulated genes in resistant insects also were associated with the cuticle, including one encoding a gene similar to keratin-associated protein 19-3-like, which in arthropods promotes immobilization of invading microbes at injury sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Genes encoding solute transporters were both up- and down-regulated in resistant insects (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S1 and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S2).</p><p>Several severely down-regulated genes in resistant insects encoded ADFs, and while phosphine exposure increased ADF expression in susceptible insects, expression was decreased further in resistant insects, suggesting increased water secretion (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S2). Another gene, venom allergen 3, was decreased in resistant insects regardless of phosphine exposure. The down-regulated group also included genes encoding proteins that function in cuticle, sugar transport, and mitochondria. A cathepsin B was downregulated in resistant insects, and this gene is expressed at low levels throughout the life stages of <italic>T. castaneum</italic> (Perkin et al., unpublished) and is likely a lysosomal enzyme that may activate caspase during mitochondrial stress. A gene encoding enolase, an enzyme involved in the penultimate step of glycolysis, was severely down-regulated in resistant insects. There were a number of genes with uncharacterized functions and without chromosome placement in the latest genome assembly (ie, &#x0201c;un&#x0201d; indicating unplaced scaffold) in the down-regulated group.</p><p>Enrichment analysis indicated that GO terms associated with metabolism (GO:0044710, Biological Process&#x02014;BP) were significantly enriched in the DE dataset (FDR&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.2e<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">2 </xref>). Others that suggest association with mitochondrial functions, such as oxidation-reduction process (GO:0055114, BP), and oxidoreductase activity (GO:0016491 and GO:0016705, Molecular Function&#x02014;MF), were significantly enriched in the DE dataset (FDR&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;1.5e<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>). In conjunction with oxidation/reduction reactions, genes encoding proteins that have iron binding (GO:005506, MF, FDR&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.0e<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>), heme binding (GO:0020037, MF, FDR&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.2e<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>), and tetrapyrrole binding (GO:0046906, MF, FDR&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.2e<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>) properties also were enriched. As noted earlier, CYP genes were included in the enriched monooxygenase activity (GO:0004497, MF, FDR&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.2e<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>) category. Genes encoding enzymes were also enriched (catalytic activity, MF, FDR&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.3e<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>). All GO terms were over-represented in the dataset, and support the differential expression of genes involved in metabolic and respiration functions among resistant and susceptible insects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Dihydrolipoamide Dehydrogenase (DLD) as a resistance gene</title><p>Since DLD is a phosphine resistance gene in <italic>T. castaneum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and was increased in expression in resistant insects, we used RNASeq data to examine sequences for DLD from phosphine-susceptible and -resistant insects. There was relatively good coverage of reads aligning to DLD from QTC4 (a susceptible <italic>T. castaneum</italic> population, accession JX434604) in all four treatment groups (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>), although depth of coverage was better in transcripts from the resistant insects in some regions. There have been multiple mutations noted in DLD genes in phosphine-resistant insects and nematodes, but the only mutation that has been identified in a phosphine-resistant population of <italic>T. castaneum</italic> was G131S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

Because of the increase in CYP transcripts in the Brazilian phosphine-resistant strain, we predicted that this strain also would be resistant to deltamethrin, especially since this pyrethroid historically has been used heavily in stored grains in Brazil. Therefore, we exposed adults of QTC279 and the phosphine-susceptible and Brazilian phosphine-resistant populations to concrete surfaces treated with deltamethrin at the equivalent of the highest label rate 0.156&#x000a0;mg AI/cm<sup>2</sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

It is critical to understand the molecular differences in resistant insect populations so that we can develop effective resistance management strategies. This study represents the first to examine phosphine resistance by gene expression analysis. Unfortunately, many insect genes still have undiscovered functions, including some identified in this study as associated with phosphine exposure or resistance. While this limits our interpretation of the results, associations of these genes with phosphine response can help to further delineate their function in future studies.</p><p>Regardless, we demonstrated significant changes in the expression of genes in a Brazilian phosphine-resistant population of <italic>T. castaneum</italic>, either exposed or not to phosphine, compared to a phosphine-susceptible population. Most notably, genes encoding CYPs were increased and those encoding anti-diuretics peptides were decreased substantially in the phosphine resistant population, and in most cases the difference was enhanced with phosphine exposure. In addition, many genes associated with mitochondrial functions were differentially expressed, correlated with the likely mode of action of phosphine in insects.</p><p>While CYPs are involved in many cases of insecticide resistance, they have not been associated with phosphine resistance. Cyp6BQ9, located on the same linkage group as the most highly upregulated CYP6A1-like in our study (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, but also called CYPBQ7, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>), is expressed in the adult brain of <italic>T. castaneum</italic> and is responsible for deltamethrin resistance in <italic>T. castaneum</italic> strain QTC279 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Phosphine-stimulated expression of CYP genes has not been documented in other insects, and the functional relevance at this point can only be speculated. Increased CYP activity in phosphine environments may be contributing to the detoxification of secondary metabolites due to phosphine exposure (indirect detoxification), or may be a result of uncoupling oxidase and monooxygenase reactions under increased levels of activated oxygen species.</p><p>Several genes associated with anti-diuresis functions (ADFs) were down-regulated in phosphine-resistant insects. ADF proteins are anti-diuretic factors involved in osmoregulation; in beetles one ADF is extremely potent at nanomolar concentrations and severely inhibits Malphigian tubule secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The data suggest that resistant insects have significantly decreased expression of anti-diuretic peptides compared to susceptible insects, especially when under phosphine stress. Decreased expression of ADFs when resistant insects are exposed to phosphine suggests that insects are decreasing water absorption. In fact, although controversial, forced diuresis has been indicated in mammals in response to complications associated with phosphine intoxication. It is intriguing to speculate that a similar process may be occurring in phosphine-resistant insects.</p><p>Based on current information, phosphine likely directly affects the mitochondria and respiration in insects, and genes associated with the mitochondria were both increased and decreased in expression in phosphine-resistant insects. The resistant insect strain in this study has demonstrated a lower respiration rate based on reduced CO<sub>2</sub> production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Reduced energy metabolism was supported by the fact that the gene encoding enolase, the last enzyme in glycolysis, was severely repressed in resistant insects. The increased expression of UGT, CYPs, and peroxiredoxin-6 in phosphine-exposed resistant insects may be responding to phosphine damage to the mitochondria through the elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The down-regulation of lysosomal cathepsin B in resistant insects may be reducing an apoptotic response to mitochondrial damage through caspases.</p><p>DLST binds tightly to DLD in the mitochondria, and both were increased in resistant insects, but slightly decreased in response to phosphine. Examination of transcripts encoding DLD from <italic>T. castaneum</italic> individuals suggested that SNPs and/or indels may contribute to mutations that result in phosphine resistance, with the P45S mutation in the N-terminal FAD binding region likely linked to phosphine resistance in <italic>T. castaneum</italic>. DLD is thus far the only major phosphine resistance gene reported in insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], but it is unknown whether mutations can result in increased expression of the gene and/or other genes in resistant insects, such as observed in this study. Good coverage of the DLD sequences from transcripts in all four treatment groups suggested additional SNPs that could be useful in diagnostic assays.</p><p>Consistent with the increase in CYP expression in the resistant insects, the Brazilian phosphine-resistant insects were also resistant to deltamethrin. Therefore, caution is warranted in modifying resistance management strategies to control insects in this region. Importantly, these data suggest that <italic>T. castaneum</italic> populations likely have acquired multiple resistance genes in response to field applications of phosphine and pyrethroid insecticide treatments in the past.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The use of RNA-Seq is an effective tool to evaluate differences in gene expression in different populations.
