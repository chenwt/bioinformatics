Mapping these signaling and response pathways is especially challenging in sequence data sets from environmental sequencing projects where uncharacterized organisms often represent a high proportion of the sequence data.

To facilitate the process for acquisition of function from complex sequence data sets, we have developed methods to utilize RNA-seq data to detect and correct errors in the structural annotation. Software tools have been developed that perform spliced alignments of EST sequences to DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009780-Haas1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009780-Huang1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> or map RNA-Seq reads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009780-Trapnell1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> to recover splice junctions. Our approach delineates the exon/intron structure necessary to extract the protein coding sequence for experimental and homology based approaches for functional interrogation. We also evaluated methods to extend the boundaries of current gene models using assembly approaches applied to the RNA-seq data. Both of these approaches support accurate structural annotation which is a requirement for experimental approaches for functional characterization and also provides validated sequence to utilize tools that enable identification cellular localization signals, domains. Structural annotation of genes in sequenced genomes from basidiomycetes is a challenge due to the high intron density and the frequent presence of small exons coding for less than 10 amino acids. The process developed for validation and improvement of the structural annotation can be applied on a genome scale to support experimental studies of the molecular events associated with mycorrhizal symbiosis as well as facilitate better comparative genomics and evolutionary analyses of gene families and their functions.</p><p>To validate our proposed system, we used a transcriptomic data set derived from the fungus <italic>Laccaria bicolor</italic>.

The initial process uses Bowtie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009780-Langmead1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> to align RNA-seq reads to the set of gene models (BestModels v1.0 available for download at the Joint Genome Institute &#x0005b;JGI&#x0005d;, denoted as BestModelsv1 in the text) and the genome (laccarria.allmasked available for download at the JGI). The outcome of this process for the set of transcript sequences which aligned to both the scaffold and the gene models is the generation of a graphical representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009780-g001">Figure 1, A</xref>) and the identification of regions where expressed RNA sequence does not match predicted gene model. The algorithm described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> Section enables analysis of the aligned reads and the identification of sequence incongruities between the predicted gene models and the observed transcriptomic data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009780-g001">Figure 1, B</xref>). These sequence discrepancies are saved as <underline>F</underline>lagged <underline>D</underline>eviations from the <underline>M</underline>odel (FDM) sequences and provide sufficient information for sequence reconstruction using the transcriptomic reads. Sequence discrepancies internal to the gene model are corrected by identification of bridging sequences that span introns or contiguous reads that eliminate inserted introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009780-g001">Figure 1, C</xref>). A slight modification of this approach addresses FDM at the beginning or end of the gene model and enables extension of the sequence upstream or downstream or the original gene model termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009780-g001">Figure 1, D</xref>). The outcome of these successive processes is a contiguous Bridged and Extended Sequence (BES) which is validated by alignment to the genome scaffold sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009780-g001">Figure 1, E</xref>).and used to generate the gene model's corrected structural annotation. The gene structure with the correctly identified splice regions is derived from the scaffold alignment and saved in a General Feature Format (gff) file. Revised gene models and modified transcript sequences derived from this study are provided as supporting data in gff format (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009780.s001">Text S1</xref>) and fasta format (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009780.s002">Text S2</xref>), respectively. It should be noted that our method to utilize RNA-seq data to correct errors in the structural annotation and extend the boundaries of current gene models does not require specification of splice donor or acceptor sites. A consequence of this approach is increased ambiguity of the exact genome location of the splice site in the alignments of the transcript-derived models to the genome. This process can lead to the improper placement of the final coding nucleotide associated with the beginning or end of an exon. This can be resolved by manual inspection of the gene of interest or the output of this method can also be used in conjunction with other splice assembly programs.

A) Bowtie is used to align RNA-seq reads and identify regions where expressed RNA sequence does not match predicted gene model. B) Errors in the gene model are identified where there is a predicted intron (i&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;predicted expressed gene sequence) but no spanning expressed sequence (&#x0201c;1&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;2&#x0201d; in example above) or where there is predicted gene but no sequence alignments (&#x0201c;3&#x0201d; in above example). The resulting flagged deviation from the model (FDM) is tagged with &#x02018;X&#x02019; to indicate the presence of an internal error in the gene model or and an &#x02018;E&#x02019; to indicate an error at the beginning or end of the gene model as illustrated by the expressed sequence string in Dii. C) For each internal error (red X) in FDM, such as error &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; in (A), an 18-mer &#x02018;probe&#x02019; sequence is generated up and downstream of error (underlined and bold sequence in (Ci). This intron-spanning sequence was used to search the set of RNA-seq reads. for contiguous expressed sequence between selected probes (Green sequence in (Cii).) D) Error from beginning and end of FDM (such as Error &#x0201c;3&#x0201d; in above example) are removed by probes sequences generated from beginning and ends of expressed gene sequence (Bold and underlined sequence in example Di). These probes are used to search for expressed contiguous sequences to extend the gene model up and downstream (Grey sequence in Dii). The merged identified expressed sequence with correctly ascribed splice sites is the Bridged and Extended Sequence expressed (BES).

These discrepancies are noted as flagged deviations from the BestModelsv1 (FDM) sequence and can either represent regions of the predicted model sequence with no transcriptomic sequence coverage or actual errors in the structural annotation. To select a useful minimum expression threshold for validation of this method and confidant correction of gene models, we evaluated the number of FDM sequences for all gene models expressed in our data set at a range of expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009780-g002">Figure 2</xref>). 7023 gene models or 34&#x00025; of all best gene models were expressed at a reads per Kb of gene sequence (RPK) of 60 or greater in the transcriptomic data set. A RPK of 60 represents an average sequence depth of 3; the human genome sequence standard for 99&#x00025; accuracy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.gov/10000923">http://www.genome.gov/10000923</ext-link>). This set of 7023 expressed genes was used to identify FDM sequences and contiguous expressed sequence spanning the internal flags was generated. The analysis was restricted to the sequence coverage of the original gene models and flags at the termini of gene models were not considered in this analysis. This restriction was imposed to avoid erroneous interpretations that arise by failure to extend a model beyond its predicted termini. For example, identification of expressed sequence that bridges two probe sequences can be judged a success. However the failure to detect expressed extended sequence may result from an appropriate truncation of the predicted model or may simply arise as a consequence of insufficient transcript coverage.</p><fig id="pone-0009780-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0009780.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Relationship between the RPK expression levels and gene model characteristics.</title><p>The traces represent the total number of gene models expressed (blue line) at or above some minimum RPK (log scale), the number of models in the subset of expressed genes that have at least one detectable internal sequence deviation (red line), and total number of expressed models that still contain at least one detectable internal sequence deviation after attempts were made to bridge those flags with the set of expressed RNAseq data (green line).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0009780.g002"/></fig><p>At an RPK of 60, no sequence deviations were detected for 3188 or 53&#x00025; of the expressed gene models. As expected, the number of gene models with no detectable sequence deviations shows an inverse relationship to the depth of transcript sequence coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009780-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The use of the transcript data to identify and correct FDM sequences result in a substantial increase in the total number of the models without flags (indicated by the green trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009780-g002">Figure 2</xref>). At the same RPK, the difference between the numerical values of the green and red traces represents the number of corrected models. It should be noted that this represents a significant under-representation of the efficacy of our proposed method, as only models with zero flags after correction are considered a success. For example the gene model encoding protein ID 322344 expressed at an RPK of 111, contained 9 flags in its FDM sequence of which 8 flags were successfully bridged. While correcting 89&#x00025; of a gene model's detected deviations may be considered significant progress towards correctly determining a gene model's structure, the result is still considered a failure for the purpose of method validation. The over all frequency of deviations is also under-represented in this analysis as only internal flags in the FDM sequence were considered.</p><p>This analysis illustrates that at all expression levels considered, many observed deviations between expressed sequence and predicted model can be corrected by this method. Some of those deviations in expression from the model can be attributed to low or uneven depth of coverage, while other deviations might be attributable to errors in the gene model. Deviations due to low sequence coverage will not be corrected by this method. At higher expression levels, the number of zero-flag FDM sequences after correction approaches 100&#x00025; of the expressed models, presumably in part because at higher expression deviations due to poor sequence coverage occur more infrequently and the majority of observed deviations are due to correctable errors in the predicted gene models. The number of expressed genes however also drops considerably with increasing expression thresholds.</p><p>For method validation, a conservative threshold of 500 RPK (an average depth of coverage of about 23) was selected. This threshold is considerably higher than the standard required for genomic sequencing but provides reasonable sequence coverage for gene with nonuniform transcript coverage, In addition, the alignment parameters for Bowtie resulted high confidence alignments and minimize alignments containing insertions or deletion. As will be illustrated, the stringent alignment parameters and high redundancy are essential for identification of sequence deviations and sequence reconstruction. At this expression level, over 95&#x00025; of bridged FDMs were without internal flags and about 10&#x00025; of total predicted best gene models are expressed in our RNAseq data set. Even at an average depth of coverage of 3 however, 70&#x00025; of expressed gene models could be successfully validated or corrected by our proposed method, indicating utility even at relatively low levels of gene expression. If the principle restriction on applicability of this method is depth of coverage, then additionally collected expression data is all that is required to validate and correct larger proportions of the expressed gene models.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Structural Annotation of Differential Expressed Mycorrhizal Genes</title><p>To validate the methods proposed here, we selected a dataset that fit three criteria: 1) the set must be sufficiently large to provide reasonable assurance of method validation; 2) the selected set must be small enough that a researcher could usefully consider each individual result; and 3) the selected set must be composed to be of general, biological interest. We validated our tools for evaluation and improvement of structural annotation using set of gene models significantly differentially expressed mycorrhizal relative to the free-living mycelial fungus, previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009780-Martin1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. We identified 1501 gene models from the differentially expressed set with a transcriptomic sequence coverage of 23 or higher. To verify the biological relevance of this mycorrhizal subset (Myc-BestModel), we evaluated the GO-assigned functional annotation of the statistically enriched expressed gene set (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0009780-t001">Table 1</xref>). The Myc-BestModel gene set is enriched for the GO-functional annotations of carbohydrate metabolism (GO:0005975) indicative of the shift in global metabolism. This transition is consistent a shift from environment-derived nutrients to a symbiotic state in which the fungus utilizes simple sugars provided by the plant symbiont. The enriched annotations for membrane (GO:0016020), electron transport (GO:0006118), H(&#x0002b;)-transporting two-sector ATPase, and ATP synthesis coupled proton transport (GO:0015986) are consistent with the changes occurring in transport across the membrane between a free living state drawing all of it required nutrients from its environment to a symbiotic state. The highly enriched annotations associated with protein biosynthesis (GO:0006412, GO:0003735, 0006511, and GO:0005839) are consistent with the significant shift in protein expression between the free living mycelial and mycorrhizal states.

The initial phase of the process identifies regions where the transcriptomic sequence deviates from the gene model and also validates intron exon boundaries incorporated in the gene models. For the Myc-BestModel subset of 1501 genes, application of the analysis method resulted in the validation of &#x0223c;80&#x00025; of all intron-exon boundaries (&#x0003e;6000) within the limits of the gene models. The transcriptomic sequence depth of 23 provides a high level of confidence for the quality of these models. This level of validation for the original gene models is notable in view of the complexity of the fungal genome (<italic>L. bicolor</italic> genes contain an average of 5.4 introns) and the annotation limitations arising from the relatively small number of sequenced fungal genomes, especially basidiomycetes. However, the combination of the error rate and intron density means that 42&#x00025; of the gene models in the mycorrhizal set contain sequence deviations that largely represent intron/exon boundaries that do not map to the mRNA sequence data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009780-g003">Figure 3</xref>). For 465 (31&#x00025;) of the Myc-BestModels in the original best gene model set, we did not detect any inconsistencies and therefore have independently confirmed the previously published BestModelv1 annotation.</p><fig id="pone-0009780-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0009780.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Summary of structural annotation outcome for the Myc-BestModel set.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0009780.g003"/></fig><p>Additional analysis scripts enable delineation of the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; boundaries sequences as defined by the transcriptomic data. The impact of changes at the gene model sequence boundaries is qualitatively assessed by analysis of the change in the size of the gene models. For this analysis, we considered only those models where the sequence length of transcript-derived model differed by greater than 10&#x00025; (plus or minus) from the initial Myc-BestModel. These criteria result in an observed absolute change in expressed gene size for &#x0223c;62&#x00025; of the Myc-BestModel gene model set. This observation demonstrates that delineation of the boundary sequences results in modification of a significant number of the Myc-BestModel sequences.</p><p>To improve the experimental utility of the gene model set, we developed algorithms that use the RNA-seq data to extend the boundaries of the current gene model set where appropriate, identify those intron-exon boundaries that can be validated by the transcriptomic data, and generate novel intron-exon boundaries to bridge those regions of the gene models that are not supported by RNA-seq data. The BES sequences represent the complete, expressed gene sequence but do not themselves have the structural annotation of the gene. This extended and bridged contiguous expressed sequence was then aligned to the genome using a modified Smith-Waterman algorithm to recover gene model's structural annotation. Of the set of 1501 gene models, 1439 (96&#x00025;) generated modified gene models from BES's in which all error flags were successfully spanned and sequences aligned to genomic sequence. The remaining 62 (4&#x00025;) of gene models either had error flags that could not be spanned or generated BES's that did not align to genomic sequence. If we consider a gene model significantly changed if it had at least one flag in the FDM sequence that was successfully bridged and aligned to scaffold, a change in the total number of exons, and/or an absolute change in expressed gene size of more than 10&#x00025;, then of the set of 1439 aligned BESs, 974 (69&#x00025;) of gene models required changes to match gene expression. 465 (31&#x00025;) of BESs were not significantly changed, confirming the previously published BestModelv1 annotation.</p><p>For the 974 significantly modified gene models, it is useful to look more closely at the nature of the modifications made. Considering the FDMs and counting the number of deviations in expression from the model, 228 (23&#x00025;) of the 974 significantly modified models had at least one error flag not at the ends of the sequence and 62 (6&#x00025;) had more than one error flag. 247 (25&#x00025;) of gene models had error flags at one end of the sequence or both. 582 (40&#x00025;) of gene models had at least one error flag, either at a terminus or in the middle of sequence. Overall, the average change in gene model size was 27.9&#x00025;, a substantial general increase in the sequence length of the Myc-GeneModel set, although not necessarily a change in the translated sequence. 594 (61&#x00025;) of gene models showed a more than 10&#x00025; increase in gene size while only 28 (3&#x00025;) of validated gene models showed a more than &#x02212;10&#x00025; change in gene size.</p><p>Overall, there was an average increase of 0.5 exons added per gene model. Within the initial boundaries of the BestModelv1 genes, however, there was an average &#x02212;0.1 changes to the number of exons, indicating that most of the increase in number of exons derived from the up and downstream sequence added to the gene model. 339 (35&#x00025;) of modified gene models showed a net increase in total exons while 126 (13&#x00025;) showed a net decrease. It is important to note that comparing the number of exons in the BestModelv1 set and in the aligned BESs may be a significant underestimation of the changes made to the BestModelv1. It is possible, for example, that an exon is removed from the model and a new exon added, making the net change in number of exons zero, in spite of the fact that significant changes to the gene model's structure were made. A case in point is the gene model encoding Protein ID 294735. Transcriptomic sequence supports a single intron while the original gene model contained three introns. Similarly, the gene model encoding Protein ID 294625 contained seven introns while the transcriptomic sequence supports a model with 12 introns.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Deep RNA sequencing of the <italic>L. bicolor</italic> transcriptome provides a resource for validation and improvement of structural gene models. This approach is an extension of the classical approach to utilize EST libraries to seed and define gene models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009780-Haas1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, . The two approaches are complementary and there is a general consensus for structural annotation derived using the EST or RNA-seq data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009780-ThierryMieg1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. However, transcriptomics using next generation sequence technology provide superior coverage and redundancy of the transcriptome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009780-Wang1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009780-Wilhelm1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the available EST libraries for <italic>L. bicolor</italic> contain approximately 20K clones, the amount of sequence data from the single transcriptomic data set generates 30-times more sequence data than the combined EST reads. The combination of reads derived from a single set of transcriptomic data (30 million reads) enables comprehensive examination of &#x0223c;3000 of the gene models in the Bestmodelv1 set using a transcript sequence coverage depth of 23. The sequence coverage depth of 23 was empirically selected to enhance gene coverage and thereby maximize the number of gene with corrected deviation. At this coverage depth, a large fraction of the models are improved by application of algorithms and using the transcriptomic sequence. Even minor changes in the intron/exon boundaries can be resolved by analysis of aligned sequences. A large fraction of sequence discrepancies can be resolved by adjustment of the requirement for transcript sequence coverage depth and inclusion of additional gene models from the BestModelv1 set. Decreasing the sequence coverage depth will expand the number of Bestmodelv1 gene model sequences included in the analysis set and lead to the identification of additional deviations from the model sequence. However, nonuniform transcript distribution will results in coverage gaps for comparison of the gene models with the transcriptomic sequence. A qualitative assessment of relative variability in transcript coverage can be obtained by inspection of transcript coverage for gene models from the corrected set (e.g. Gene model 143003, accessible via the URL provided in the data resources file provided in Supporting Data).</p><p>Comparison of the transcript and Myc-BestModel subset sequences led to changes in 974 (69&#x00025;) of gene models. The large fraction of gene models with revised structural annotation is not perhaps surprising in view of the relative complexity of the target set. The set of best models used for analysis was generated primarily by an automated annotation process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009780-Martin1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. This process effectively identified gene candidates and requires little manual input. However, this homology-based process often results in unresolved structural features and a limited ability to associate relevant biological information with the sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009780-Brent1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009780-Jones1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Current approaches for structural annotation are unable to accurately define exon content or location <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009780-Guigo1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009780-Guigo2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> for many genes. Analysis of internal sequence deviations in gene model sets from different annotation methods indicates a variance in the frequency of internal sequence deviation in gene model sets derived by different annotation methods (Supplemental Data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009780.s004">Table S1</xref>). In general, EST-based prediction methods tend to have a lower percentage of models with internal FDMs. However, there is a wide variance in the number of models derived by the methods. The presence of a significant number of short exon segments in basidiomycetes further increases the complexity of the structural annotation process for <italic>L. bicolor</italic>. In spite of these impediments, the sequence depth and ease of data generation indicate RNA sequencing provides a reliable resource for validation and improvement of structural gene models.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Corrections to the Gene Models</title><p>The transcriptomic sequence provides the opportunity for accurate identification and localization of exons and enables the verification or correction of the structural annotation. Our targeted approached leverages previously collected information to find splice sites that match observed data and focuses computational effort only on those splice sites that are not supported by RNAseq data. Analysis of internal gene model deviations suggest 42&#x00025; of the expressed and selected set of <italic>L. bicolor</italic> gene models contain sequence deviations that largely represent intron/exon boundaries that do not map to the mRNA sequence data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009780-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Our method has no restrictions on intron lengths and can identify exons as short at 9 bp. The method also places no expectations on splice donor and acceptor sites. Unlike other published methods, our method has an advantage for identification of splice sites even if they are not a previously reported or observed. This strategy reasonable at high sequence coverage depth and enable identification of the maximum number of exons. A drawback of this approach is increased ambiguity of the exact genome location of the splice site. Our alignments of the transcript-derived models to the genome can lead to the improper placement of the final coding nucleotide associated with the beginning or end of an exon. This can be resolved by manual inspection of the gene of interest or the output of this method can also be used in conjunction with other splice assembly programs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009780-Haas1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>One additional interesting category of modified gene models are those which contain no deviations from observed expression data within the boundaries of the BestModelv1 gene models, but nonetheless showed significant changes to gene structure by addition of up and/or downstream expressed sequence. A case in point is the gene model encoding protein ID 163800. The initial model consisted of two exons and did not contain an appropriate start methionine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009780-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The revised model is more than doubled in size, contains four exons, and candidate start codons. Of the 974 modified gene models, 453 (30&#x00025;) had no error flags within their FDM sequences, but showed a more that 10&#x00025; increase in gene size. Of these 453 expanded genes, 193 (43&#x00025;) also showed in increase in the total number of exons. Changes that enabled definition or extension of the N- or C-termini are especially informative to enable expression and provide clues for function. Modification of the N- or C-terminus can result in the identification of additional sequence features such as signal peptides, regions with membrane spanning helices or pfam domains. This information is useful for functional annotation and is often essential to enable <italic>in vitro</italic> protein expression and future biochemical characterization. Substantial changes to predicted UTRs also affect the ability to predict the regulatory mechanisms of mycorrhizae-specific genes.</p><fig id="pone-0009780-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0009780.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Comparison of the original and revised gene models encoding protein 163800 on genome sequence scaffold 19.</title><p>Location on scaffold is on x-axis and numbers of read alignments at each bp is on the y axis.

The remaining 62 (4&#x00025;) of gene models either had error flags that could not be spanned or generated BES's that did not align to genomic sequence. The quality of the genome scaffold contributes in part to the inability to reconcile these gene models is attributable to genome correct some of this sequence lies in the incomplete nature of the genomic sequence. The genome is currently contained in 1178 scaffolds with some unresolved nucleotide regions. Several gene models contain regions of unresolved sequence (e.g. N nucleotide designations) in middle of gene sequence (e.g. gene models coding for the 293291 or 298293 proteins) and/or unusually long introns regions (e.g. the model coding for the 298293 protein). For several genes, the presence of alternative transcripts resulted in an uncorrected model (e.g. the model coding for the 247279 protein) indicating the method may not identify multiple splice variants when more than one variant is simultaneously present in dataset. For this study, we restricted the RNA-seq data set to a single biological condition to minimize the contribution of alternative transcripts and facilitate the methods development and evaluation process. The current method will generate a corrected gene model if one of the variant represents &#x0003e;50&#x00025; of all transcript sequences at the site of the alternative splice. The gene model encoding the 308888 protein contains five exons with clearly identified bridging sequences spanning each of the introns (accessible via the URL provided in the data resources file provided in Supporting Data). However, inspection of the transcript map reveals the presence of transcripts that likely span this intron and likely represent a read through intron variant. The identification of splice variants associated with the free living, interaction, and mycorrhizal states may have implications for the regulation of metabolic, functional, and metabolic capabilities. In view of the biological relevance of these genes, we are developing methods for identification of splice variants using RNA-seq data. For several uncorrected models, reasons for failure were not immediately obvious and will likely require extensive biological confirmations to resolve which is beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>High-throughput transcriptomic data was found to provide far greater resolution for resolving gene structure than a previously collected data set of ESTs. The outcome of this process is a set of high confidence gene models that can be reliably used for experimental characterization of protein function. The corrected gene structures improve capabilities for the prediction of protein function and are required for <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches to characterize the function of these proteins. The method described here can be applied to improve gene structural annotation in other species, provided that there is a sequenced genome and a set of gene models. This improved annotation process can be extended to other important gene families and will facilitate the process to identify the molecular mechanisms leading to the development of the mycorrhizal symbiosis and its implications in improving carbon sequestration by poplar.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Laccaria bicolor culture, <italic>In vitro</italic> interaction setup and RNA extraction</title><p><italic>L. bicolor</italic> (Maire) Orton (strain S238N) culture was maintained on Modified Melin Norkan's media as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009780-Kim1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> at 20&#x000b0;C.

The contig is identified, assembled between the upstream and downstream probes using the method described below, and the transcript derived sequence is used to replace the error flag.</p><p>Error flags at the beginning and end of the FDM are noted, but removed from the sequence. Being at the ends of the sequence, probes up and downstream from the expressed portions of the gene model cannot be generated. Using a slight modification of the method used to bridge error flags, the FDM is extended upstream and downstream of its initial boundaries if possible. The computational method for bridging and extending gene models, &#x0201c;Bridge&#x0201d; is described in detail below. The result of the FDM with bridged error flags and extensions up and down stream of the initial gene model boundaries is new sequence saved as a Bridged and Extended Sequence (BES).</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Identify Bridging Contigs between probe sequences</title><p>RNA-seq data was used to extend and bridge errors in gene models with the following procedure, &#x0201c;Bridge&#x0201d;. Bridge accepts two probe sequences as input and searches the set of RNA-seq data for a continuously expressed spanning sequence, if any, that connects the two probe sequences.<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0009780.e004"/></disp-formula><italic>StartProbe</italic> and <italic>EndProbe</italic> are the probes upstream and downstream of a flagged deviation from model respectively. <italic>Bridge</italic> is the variable, initialized to an empty string, that stores the identified expressed contiguous sequence between <italic>StartProbe</italic> and <italic>EndProbe</italic>. <italic>MaxLook</italic> is the maximum number of iterations allowed and <italic>MaxN</italic> is the maximum number of unknown &#x02018;N&#x02019; base calls in the assembled bridge permitted before the procedure terminates. The function <bold>FindNextProbe</bold> is described below. This function returns the identified and expressed consensus sequence that bridges the <italic>StartProbe</italic> and <italic>EndProbe</italic> sequences. As it is possible the procedure may not identify a bridging sequence, the procedure also returns a message describing why the search for the bridge sequence was terminated. In this study, to bridge probes that spanned errors in FDMs, <italic>maxLook</italic> was set equal to 27 and <italic>maxN</italic> equal to 6. To extend the gene sequences past its initial borders, Bridge is called without a value for <italic>EndProbe</italic>, and <italic>maxN</italic> equal to 1.</p><p>The procedure &#x0201c;FindNextProbe&#x0201d; used in &#x0201c;Bridge&#x0201d; is used to search the set of collected RNAseq reads for consensus sequence and finds the next probe in a growing contig sequence.<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0009780.e005"/></disp-formula>Where <italic>probe</italic> is the sequence of length <italic>probeLen</italic>, and <italic>RNAseq_Data</italic> is the set of all sequence reads. <italic>SeqLen</italic> is the length in base pairs of the RNA-seq reads used in the analysis. Arrays <italic>A</italic>, <italic>G</italic>, <italic>C</italic>, and <italic>T</italic> store the number of instances of each base at each position in the consensus sequence being constructed and all arrays are initially populated with zeros. The function returns the next <italic>probeLen</italic>-sized sequence from the assembled consensus sequence. For spanning a flagged region of the FDM, the first probes are selected starting 6 bp up and downstream of the flag. If these probes do not identify a spanning sequence, then new probes 15 bp up and downstream of the flag are used. If these probes fail, probes 21 bp up and downstream of the flag are used. If these return no spanning sequence, then the error is flagged as unidentified. Although a perfect match is required for finding up and downstream probes, this step-wise procedure will identify spanning sequence even if there are mismatches in one of the possible probes. Also, this procedure can accommodate for possible misalignments at the intron-exon border where some alignments occur that crosses by a few base pairs the intron-exon boundary. When extending the FDM up and downstream, the first and last 18 bp of the FDM are used as the initial probes.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Align BESs to scaffolds</title><p>The BESs, constructed from RNA-seq data corrected FDM's represent the expressed gene sequence as transcribed under specific biological conditions, but they do not contain information regarding the gene structure. Assembled sequence that bridges an identified error in a BES might contain only corrected intron boundaries, or might introduce a number of previously unreported exons. In order to recover gene structure information, it is necessary to align the BES back to the <italic>L. bicolor</italic> chromosome. This was accomplished using the Smith-Waterman algorithm with a few minor modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009780-Smith2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. The <italic>L. bicolor</italic> scaffold sequences were taken from &#x0201c;Laccaria.alllasked&#x0201d; from JGI.</p><p>The penalty for inserting a gap into the chromosomal sequence is &#x02212;24 while the gap penalty for inserting a gap into the BES gene sequence is &#x02212;1. The penalty for inserting a gap at the beginning or end of the BES is 0. This fits our expectations for the alignment. Gaps in the chromosome are unlikely, but not impossible, suggesting that some erroneous deletion from the assembled scaffold has been made. Gaps in the BES sequence, representing introns, are expected and so the penalty is less than for the scaffold sequence. Match-Mismatch scores were set to 8 for a match, &#x02212;12 for a mismatch, and 4 for any nucleotide matching with an &#x02018;N&#x02019;. &#x02018;N&#x02019; nucleotides can be present both in the published genomic sequence and as a consequence of the bridging contig method described below. A score of 4 for an &#x02018;N&#x02019; prevents inserting spurious gaps in the contig sequence without over-fitting contiguous &#x02018;N&#x02019;s into the alignment. Though <italic>L. bicolor</italic> exons can be short, isolated alignments of small sets of nucleotides bracketed by spaces in the BES should be discouraged. In our modified Smith-Waterman algorithm, alignments of less than 4 contiguous nucleotides in the BES, allowing an &#x02018;N&#x02019; to match any nucleotide, are not permitted.</p><p>Before alignment, 5&#x00025; off the end of any sequence added from the gene model extension, upstream or downstream, was trimmed. The sequence of the scaffold selected for alignment is the region within the original BestModelv1 boundaries plus three times the size of the up and downstream sequence added. If the first attempt to align the BES to the genomic sequence failed, the sequences were reversed and complimented and a second attempt to realign was made. From the alignment, the gene model's structural annotation can be generated and was saved in GFF format. The final output of this method is the set of expressed BES gene models in FASTA format, the structural annotation of the gene models in GFF format, and a new set of FDMs sequences resulting from the re-alignment RNA-seq data to the modified gene models using &#x02018;Bowtie&#x02019;.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0009780.s001"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>A gff format text file containing all revised gene models for the Myc-BestModel gene model set.</p><p>(0.74 MB TXT)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0009780.s001.txt" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="plain"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0009780.s002"><label>Text S2</label><caption><p>A fasta format text file containing the modified transcript sequences for the Myc-BestModel gene model set.</p><p>(1.85 MB TXT)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0009780.s002.txt" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="plain"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0009780.s003"><label>Text S3</label><caption><p>A text file listing project data files and resources available for viewing and download.
