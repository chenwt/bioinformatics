Thinning of the RNFL generally is associated with loss of axons in the optic nerve, but thinning also could result from a decrease in axon diameter or changes in surrounding retinal glia. A detailed study of the histopathology of the retina in 82 MS patients showed substantial loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) associated with perivascular inflammation and gliosis, suggesting that a primary loss of RGCs also may result in axon loss and RNFL atrophy.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-11-4859-b08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> While studies in experimental glaucoma have correlated optic nerve axon loss with RNFL atrophy measured by OCT,<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-11-4859-b09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-57-11-4859-b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> this information is lacking in MS or its experimental models where myelin sheath loss or absence is the primary defect.</p><p>A complete understanding of the significance of RNFL thinning as a surrogate marker of axon loss in MS is a high research priority,<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-11-4859-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-57-11-4859-b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and a critical issue for the use of OCT as a putative surrogate marker of axon loss in MS and other degenerative CNS disorders. In 2007, an expert panel consensus report proposed that an animal model might answer the other question as to whether there is a direct correlation between axon loss in the CNS and RNFL atrophy.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-11-4859-b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Mouse<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-11-4859-b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and rat<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-11-4859-b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models showed that inflammation in the optic nerve could lead to RGC death but no OCT nor RNFL measurements were performed in either study.

We also recorded visual evoked cortical potentials (VEPs) and electroretinograms (ERGs). These data then were compared to histomorphometric measurements of the RNFL thickness and axon density.

Each scan was evaluated for accuracy of segmentation and measurements verified using software calipers. Measures of neuroretinal rim thickness (NRT), disk area, average cup-to-disc (C/D) ratio, and cup volume were obtained from the scans. Measures of the optic nerve head were obtained using Cirrus software, which defined the inner cup as the termination of Bruch's membrane within the 6 &#x000d7; 6 mm cube scan and then finds the shortest distance vertically to the inner limiting membrane (ILM).<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-11-4859-b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> This allowed consistent centering of the 3.4-mm circle used for RNFL measurement and the edge of the neural rim. Specific parameters calculated by the Cirrus SD-OCT were used in the analysis and include neural rim area, optic disc area, average C/D ratio (average of 180 radial line measurements around the optic nerve cup), and optic cup volume. Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was measured as the distance between the ILM and the border of the RNFL with the ganglion cell layer.

Indeed, it may be some time before sufficient postmortem samples with recent high resolution OCTs become available. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/OCT study of the optic nerve and RNFL in MS perhaps is the closest to establishing this correlation, yet it was acknowledged that demyelination and axon loss could have been the substrate for the MRI evidence of optic nerve atrophy.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-11-4859-b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> It is clear that optic neuritis (ON) is a key event that precedes RNFL atrophy in many MS cases.

Gelfand et al.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-11-4859-b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> noted that affected areas of the retina in MS contained axons derived from small parvocellular neurons that have small diameter axons.

It has been postulated that it could result from direct loss of the neuronal cell body (RGCs), from retrograde degeneration of axons following their loss in the optic nerve, or from the subsequent atrophy of the proximal optic nerve axons in the RNFL following focal optic nerve axon loss.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-11-4859-b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> In our model, it appears that the thinning of the RNFL relates solely to loss of axons in the optic nerve, which results in retrograde degeneration. There was no quantitative evidence of atrophy of axons in the RNFL but there was a clear ultrastructural difference in the mutant compared to control dogs as seen on TEM and in the percentage of area of the RNFL occupied by axons. Retinal ganglion cells were clearly seen in 1 &#x003bc;m sections and present in normal numbers with no evidence of chromatolysis or apoptosis. In contrast, in MS there frequently but not always is a loss of RGCs and potentially other retinal neurons.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-11-4859-b08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Recent studies have demonstrated thinning of OCT-derived measurements of the RGCL on the macular and peripapillary regions of MS patients.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-11-4859-b43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Indeed, a subset of MS patients have been shown to have primary retinal pathology leading to RNFL thinning and not resulting from retrograde degeneration in the optic nerve.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-11-4859-b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> While the lack of a decrease in the RGC numbers observed here might be surprising, it may be due to retinal tissue sampling restrictions and to differences in the topographic distribution of RGCs in the dog retina. The dog retina presents a fovea-like area (area centralis) in a topographic area comparable to the human macula that has an increase in RGC and cone photoreceptor density.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-11-4859-b45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Despite these similarities the RGC concentration and total size of the area centralis are significantly smaller than the human fovea centralis,<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-11-4859-b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-57-11-4859-b47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> making it hard to adequately sample both histologically and by OCT.

A recent study on the retina of a murine model of PMD (the <italic>jimpy</italic> mouse) showed that the structure of the retina is normal at 22 days of age despite severe dysmyelination of the optic nerve though no loss of axons.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-11-4859-b55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> The optic nerves in the <italic>shp</italic> show a clear loss of axons that appears to increase in time. The earliest evidence of axon degeneration was noted at 4 months, though notable areas of axon loss and gliosis were not apparent until much later (two or more years). We propose that this chronic loss of axons may resemble what happens in progressive MS, either primary or secondary, at least in a background of unensheathed axons with no or minimal inflammation.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-11-4859-b56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> There is no evidence of inflammation in the <italic>shp</italic> optic nerves, brain, and spinal cord<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-11-4859-b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and, more recently, an exploration of differential gene expression in the spinal cord using RNAseq has shown no evidence of an increase in expression of inflammatory molecules (Duncan and Svaren, unpublished data).

Certainly, there are clear axon&#x02013;glial&#x02013;myelin sheath interactions that are required for long-term axon survival.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-11-4859-b58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-11-4859-b59" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="i1552-5783-57-11-4859-b60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> Despite the fact that the relationship between optic nerve damage and RNFL thinning has been demonstrated in animal models of experimental glaucoma,<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-11-4859-b09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-57-11-4859-b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> the cellular mechanisms involved in this process are poorly understood. The <italic>shp</italic> model replicates what occurs following chronic myelin loss or absence and, hence, better matches what happens in MS.</p><p>It is clear that in future clinical trials of neuroprotection in MS, the ability to accurately monitor axon loss and survival is essential. Optical coherence tomography as a surrogate marker of axon loss in the optic nerve would appear, from the data presented here, to have a solid scientific basis. However, in the future, as a method of quantifying neuroprotection of optic nerve axons, it may be necessary to discern between those cases where the loss of axons in the RNFL with its subsequent atrophy is due to focal lesions in the optic nerve or a primary loss of RGCs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Carol Rasmussen for her skilled technical support with the SD-OCT.</p><p>Supported partially by National Institutes of Health, P30 EY016665, NMSS PP1880, the Boespflug Foundation, and the Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease (PMD) Foundation.</p><p>Disclosure: <bold>L.B.C.
