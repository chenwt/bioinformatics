The wing dimorphic cricket species, <italic>Gryllus firmus</italic>, consists of a long-winged morph with functional flight muscles that is capable of flight, and two flightless morphs. One (obligately) flightless morph emerges as an adult with vestigial wings and vestigial flight muscles. The other (plastic) flightless morph emerges with fully-developed wings but later in adulthood histolyzes its flight muscles. Importantly both flightless morphs have substantially increased reproductive output relative to the flight-capable morph. Much is known about the physiological and biochemical differences between the morphs with respect to adaptations for flight versus reproduction. In contrast, little is known about the molecular genetic basis of these morph-specific adaptations. To address this issue, we assembled a <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome of <italic>G. firmus</italic> using 141.5 million Illumina reads generated from flight muscles and fat body, two organs that play key roles in flight and reproduction. We used the resulting 34,411 transcripts as a reference transcriptome for differential gene expression analyses. A comparison of gene expression profiles from functional flight muscles in the flight-capable morph versus histolyzed flight muscles in the plastic flight incapable morph identified a suite of genes involved in respiration that were highly expressed in pink (functional) flight muscles and genes involved in proteolysis highly expressed in the white (histolyzed) flight muscles. A comparison of fat body transcripts from the obligately flightless versus the flight-capable morphs revealed differential expression of genes involved in triglyceride biosynthesis, lipid transport, immune function and reproduction. These data provide a valuable resource for future molecular genetics research in this and related species and provide insight on the role of gene expression in morph-specific adaptations for flight versus reproduction.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Financial support for this study was provided by start up funds to JAB from the School of Biological Sciences, UNL, and NSF grant IOS-1121960 to AJZ.

The polymorphism consists of a flight-capable phenotype (morph) that has fully developed wings and flight muscles, and one or more flightless morphs that have reduced wings and/or flight muscles. Importantly, loss of flight ability is correlated with substantially increased egg production, especially during early adulthood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Harrison1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Roff1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Zera2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Guerra1">[5]</xref>. Thus, wing polymorphism is a classic example of an adaptive trade-off in which enhancement of one function (e.g. egg production) has evolved at the expense of another function (e.g. flight ability) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Harrison1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Roff1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Zera3">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Zera5">[8]</xref>. The polymorphism occurs commonly in many insect groups such as aphids, beetles, crickets, grasshoppers, and true bugs where it often plays a key role in adaptation to temporally or spatially varying demands for dispersal versus reproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Roff1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Guerra1">[5]</xref>.

Thus far, such studies have been reported only for two wing-polymorphic species of aphids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Ghanim1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Brisson1">[12]</xref>. Obtaining data on morph-specific transcriptome abundance for physiologically well-studied species would provide key information on the molecular mechanisms underlying physiological differences between morphs, in addition to providing a wealth of gene sequences that could be used for future molecular studies of adaptation. The advent of cost-effective next-generation sequencing has opened up new avenues for global, whole-genome analyses of gene expression in ecologically interesting non-model organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Chen1">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Vera1">[15]</xref>.

We use this <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome to compare morph-specific differences in transcript abundance in the context of adaptations for flight versus reproduction. As is typical for wing-polymorphic species, <italic>G. firmus</italic> produces a flight-capable morph that has fully-developed and functional wings and flight muscles during adulthood (designated LW(f)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;longed winged with functional flight muscles) and which delays egg production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Zera1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Zera3">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Zera5">[8]</xref>. The species also has two types of flightless morphs that differ in the timing of attainment of flightlessness, but each of which exhibits four-fold greater fecundity than the flight-capable morph by the end of the first week of adulthood. One flightless morph emerges as an adult with shortened wings and vestigial, non-functional flight muscles (designated as SW), and is obligately flightless throughout adulthood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Zera6">[18]</xref>. A second flightless morph initially has fully-developed wings, functional flight muscles and can fly. During mid-adulthood this plastic, flightless morph (designated as LW(h)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;long-winged with histolyzed muscles) degenerates its flight muscles, loses the ability to fly, and increases egg production to levels seen in the obligately flightless morph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Zera6">[18]</xref>. Thus, in the laboratory or field, populations can consist of LW(f), LW(h) or SW morphs of the same age.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0082129-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id

Most previous studies of the physiological underpinnings of wing-polymorphism in <italic>Gryllus</italic> have been conducted on genetic stocks artificially-selected for wing morph, and raised under constant environmental conditions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0082129-t001">Table 1</xref>), and thus have focused on the physiological-genetics of wing polymorphism. These same stocks have been used in the transcriptome studies described below.</p><p>In the present study we focused on morph-specific differences in transcript abundance in flight muscle and fat body of <italic>G. firmus</italic>, two key organs involved in morph specialization for flight or egg production. We sequenced and assembled a <italic>de novo</italic> reference transcriptome using mRNA collected from these two organs. We then identified differentially expressed transcripts between the functional and histolyzed flight muscles of the LW(f) and LW(h) morphs, respectively, to discover genes involved in the degeneration of flight muscles of the plastic, flightless morph, as well as functional differences between flight muscles of these two morphs important in the flight/fecundity trade-off. For example, previous studies demonstrated that reduced respiration of histolyzed flight muscle appears to be an important factor which frees nutrients for the increased ovarian growth of the LW(h) morph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Zera6">[18]</xref>. Yet, little is known about the biochemical or molecular basis of either muscle histolysis or reduced respiration. Flight muscles of the SW morph were not characterized, because, during the molt to adulthood, the flight muscles are already substantially reduced, sometimes only consisting of the sheath surrounding the muscle. We also compared the transcriptome profiles between fat body of the flight-capable LW(f) and flight-incapable SW morphs and identified genes that were differentially expressed. Fat body is the major organ of intermediary metabolism, and has been extensively studied in regard to differences in lipid and protein metabolism between adult LW(f) and SW morphs important for production of lipid flight fuel or ovarian protein by focusing on key candidate proteins and pathways, but no previous transcriptome-wide analysis has been performed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0082129-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Insect stocks</title><p><italic>Gryllus firmus</italic> used in the present study were females taken from artificially selected, outbred populations that are nearly pure-breeding for the long-winged (LW) or short-winged (SW) morph (Block-2 lines; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Zera9">[22]</xref> for details of artificial selection).

Organs were sampled during two times of the photophase to determine if morph differences are contingent upon time-of-day, as is the case for the hemolymph juvenile hormone level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Zhao2">[29]</xref>. Within and between morph comparisons of data from different times of the day are the subject of a future study; the present study focuses on differences that were consistently different between morphs regardless of the time of day. Pieces of fat body were removed from individual female crickets with forceps and were placed on a piece of parafilm on ice until sufficient amount of material was obtained (about three minutes). Tissue from each individual cricket was then dropped into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and flash frozen with liquid nitrogen.

Poly(A) RNA was extracted directly from the tissues with the Micro-Poly(A)-Purist Kit (Ambion). mRNA was fragmented with fragmentation reagents (Ambion) at 70&#x000b0;C for 3 min 50 sec, column purified (RNA Clean &#x00026; Concentrate kit-5, Zymo Research) and then subjected to first strand cDNA synthesis using oligo-dT, random hexamer primers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc). Second strand cDNA was synthesized using RNaseH and DNA polymerse I (Epicentre). These cDNA fragments were column purified (DNA Clean &#x00026; Concentrate Kit-5, Zymo Research) end-repaired (End-It DNA End Repair kit, Epicentre) and A-tailed using Klenow enzyme (NEB). An index adapter was ligated to the cDNA using Fast-Link DNA ligation kit (Epicentre). The library was size selected for 200&#x02013;250 bp, enriched by PCR (Phusion DNA polymerase, Finnzymes), and purified using a PCR purification kit (Zymo Research) to create the final cDNA library. Tagged libraries were pooled in equal amounts and sequenced on an Illumina Genome analyzer II flow cell.

We tried a range of k-mer values from 13 to 57 and settled on 57 since it gave us, on average, longer contigs (data not shown). Velvet is specifically for genomic assembly, however it was a necessary first step since Oases takes the preliminary assembly results from Velvet and clusters the contigs into mRNA loci and, where possible, also delineates isoforms. For the initial Velvet step we used automatic determination of expected coverage and cutoffs (<monospace>-exp_cov auto</monospace>) as these were very similar to manual cutoffs determined by visual inspection (expected coverage 10.3, cutoff 5.1).

And finally, mitochondria numbers are significantly lower in the SW morph (the LW(h) morph was not examined in this report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Jiang1">[44]</xref>) relative to the LW(f) morph of <italic>G. firmus</italic>. Our gene expression profiling results are consistent with the idea that it is a decrease in the number of mitochondria that reduces thoracic muscle metabolism in the LW(h) morph relative to the LW(f) morph. Further precedent supporting such a scenario is provided by studies in muscle polymorphisms that exist in <italic>Hydrophilus</italic> and <italic>Dytiscus</italic> beetles where mitochondrial density is significantly reduced in the less active, white leg muscles when compared to flight musculature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Edwards1">[45]</xref>.</p><p>Our results also indicated that juvenile hormone diol kinase (Locus_141) was highly expressed in the white flight muscles when compared to the pink flight muscles. This gene encodes an enzyme that degrades juvenile hormone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Maxwell1">[46]</xref>, suggesting that this hormone might be involved in morph-specific muscle histolysis.</p><p>LW(h) flight muscles are characterized by a 5&#x02013;8 fold reduction in fiber area and a 40&#x02013;50% reduction in fiber number <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Zera6">[18]</xref>. Thus, one could reasonably expect to find higher expression of genes encoding proteins making up the sarcomere and/or associated structures (e.g. sarcoplasmatic reticulum, extra-cellular matrix, etc.) in the LW(f) when compared to LW(h) morph. However, we did not observe any enrichment for the category of genes encoding sarcomere proteins. This lack of enrichment may indicate that flight muscle histolysis in the LW(f) morph is a highly controlled process, with certain muscle fibers being selectively (and functionally) retained in the LW(h) morph flight muscles and little change to overall relative sarcomere gene expression (i.e. there is less muscle mass but it is maintained by the same relative gene expression pattern).</p><p>Even more surprising, we find that all but one transcript in a set of 20 sarcomere gene transcripts show higher expression in the LW(h) flight muscles. These transcripts, including key sarcomere genes such as myosin heavy chain, myosin light chain and troponin C, were likely insufficient in number to result in significant enrichment. This higher expression of sarcomere gene transcripts in LW(h) morphs could be because the histolysis of flight muscle is accompanied by a switch to different gene copies or alternative splice transcripts of the genes encoding myosin heavy chain and troponin C. Alternatively, the results could be due to changes in the alternative splicing patterns of these genes. Another interpretation is that the proteins encoded by these genes are more &#x0201c;sensitive&#x0201d; to the extensive proteolysis process that occur in LW(h) muscle and that our results are indicative of post-histolysis repair to the sarcomere to optimize remaining functionality.</p><p>In support of the first scenario, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscles myosin heavy chain is encoded by a single gene but is alternatively spliced to produce at least 20 isoforms [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0264695.html">http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0264695.html</ext-link>], while troponin C is encoded by (at least) four gene copies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Fyrberg1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Herranz1">[48]</xref>. Furthermore, our results indicate that four different transcripts annotated as troponin C exist in the <italic>G. firmus de novo</italic> transcriptome (Locus 26, 29, 1344 and 7475) and gene expression differences between the two morphs are seen in both directions. Loci 26, 29 and 1344 were highly expressed in LW(h) flight muscle, whereas Locus 7475 was highly expressed in LW(f) flight muscle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082129.s011">Tables S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082129.s012">S6</xref>). These four transcripts code for different protein sequences (but the nucleotide differences between theses four predicted transcripts have not yet been confirmed by Sanger sequencing) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082129.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p><p>Thus, a troponin C gene expression shift appears to occur during the transition from LW(f) to LW(h), with a transition from higher expression for one of the transcripts in LW(f) functional, pink muscle to higher expression of the three others in LW(h) histolyzed, white muscle. Such a transition may be similar to the transition observed for troponin T in <italic>L. pulchella</italic> dragonflies, which have muscles that become more active as they mature. Flight muscles in this species show a maturational (during the teneral to adult transition) shift in troponin T protein isoform expression that affects flight muscle calcium sensitivity and performance, while expression of other sarcomere proteins remains stable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Fitzhugh1">[49]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>SW and LW(f) fat body exhibit transcriptional differences related to lipid biosynthesis and transport, immune function, and reproduction</title><p>Fat body is the major organ of intermediary metabolism in insects, and this organ differs between LW(f) and SW morphs in several important metabolic aspects related to the production of triglyceride flight fuel and eggs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Zera1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Zera9">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Zera13">[28]</xref>.

Three of the most important classes of transcript abundance differences and their associated genes are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0082129-t004">Table 4</xref>. The first relates to differences in genes involved in lipid biosynthesis. Note that some of these genes have FDR-corrected p-values&#x0003e;0.05 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0082129-t004">Table 4</xref>). We chose to include them because of our <italic>a prior</italic> interest in lipid biosynthesis and transport genes and because our qRT-PCR results indicated that some genes with FDR-corrected p-values&#x0003e;0.05 may be false negatives. Previous studies have demonstrated a substantially greater amount of total lipid and triglyceride in the LW(f) morph relative to the SW morph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Zera8">[21]</xref>. This is a key biochemical difference between the morphs: elevated lipid is required to fuel flight in the LW(f) morph, which, in turn, reduces allocation of nutrients to egg production, thus accounting for the reduced fecundity of the LW(f) morph. Elevated whole-body triglyceride is produced by elevated overall flux through the triglyceride biosynthetic pathway in the LW(f) morph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Zhao3">[50]</xref>. This pathway is comprised of two components, the <italic>de novo</italic> fatty acid pathway, which produces fatty acids from the precursor acetyl CoA, and the glyceride pathway which links three fatty acids to a glycerol phosphate molecule. A number of transcripts involved in lipid biosynthesis and transport were elevated in LW(f) compared to SW females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082129-g002">Figure 2</xref>). For example, three enzymes of glyceride metabolism [glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 1-acyl-3-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (two loci), and phosphatidate phosphatase, (two loci)], were elevated in LW(f) females. Several of these enzymes, such as phosphatidate phosphatase and 1-acyl-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, are membrane-bound proteins that are difficult to assay for activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Coleman1">[51]</xref>, and activities have not previously been compared between the morphs. The present study has thus identified a key portion of the triglyceride biosynthetic pathway whose elevation likely accounts for the greater production of flight fuel in LW(f) females. Further, the availability of transcript sequences for these enzymes will be very useful for future studies of morph-specific triglyceride regulation, a major adaptive difference between the morphs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Zera9">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082129-Zhao1">[23]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0082129-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0082129.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>The major components of the fatty acid metabolism pathway.</title><p>Fold changes of genes coding for the enzymes in this pathway in fat body of the SW and LW(f) morphs along with their locus ID are indicated.
