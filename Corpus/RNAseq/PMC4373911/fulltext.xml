Early season flooding reduces germination, survival and growth rate of maize seedlings. We aimed to discover genetic variation for submergence tolerance in maize and elucidate the genetic basis of submergence tolerance through transcriptional profiling and linkage analysis of contrasting genotypes. A diverse set of maize nested association mapping (NAM) founder lines were screened, and two highly tolerant (Mo18W and M162W) and sensitive (B97 and B73) genotypes were identified. Tolerant lines exhibited delayed senescence and lower oxidative stress levels compared to sensitive lines. Transcriptome analysis was performed on these inbreds to provide genome level insights into the molecular responses to submergence. Tolerant lines had higher transcript abundance of several fermentation-related genes and an unannotated <italic>Pyrophosphate-Dependent Fructose-6-Phosphate 1-Phosphotransferase</italic> gene during submergence. A coexpression network enriched for <italic>CBF</italic> (<italic>C-REPEAT/DRE BINDING FACTOR</italic>: <italic>C-REPEAT/DRE BINDING FACTOR</italic>) genes, was induced by submergence in all four inbreds, but was more activated in the tolerant Mo18W. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from Mo18W and B73 was screened for submergence tolerance. A major QTL named <italic>Subtol6</italic> was mapped to chromosome 6 that explains 22% of the phenotypic variation within the RIL population. We identified two candidate genes (<italic>HEMOGLOBIN2</italic> and <italic>RAV1</italic>) underlying <italic>Subtol6</italic> based on contrasting expression patterns observed in B73 and Mo18W.

These changes in precipitation patterns will impact many maize-producing regions of the world, which receive considerable rainfall during early growing season [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120385.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Maize is highly sensitive to waterlogging and submergence (complete inundation) during germination and seedling stages and leads to poor seedling establishment, stunted growth, and delayed development. Most of the previous research has focused on waterlogging, while submergence tolerance remains less characterized in maize [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>At a cellular level, hypoxic conditions during submergence reduce protein translation and induce selectively translated proteins involved in glycolysis and the fermentative pathways [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

As part of a metabolic adaptation to hypoxia, several ATP consuming biochemical pathways are inhibited [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, survival through prolonged inundation hypoxia also involves the use of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) as an alternative energy source and induction of enzymes that reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) or cytoplasmic acidosis [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120385.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120385.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The molecular and physiological mechanisms involved in the submergence responses in plants have largely been characterized in two tolerant species, rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) and <italic>Rumex palustris</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. One of the early responses to submergence involves the differential regulation of a suite of transcription factors belonging to the ethylene response factor (ERFs) gene family [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120385.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120385.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

The extent of genetic variation for submergence tolerance in maize is largely unexplored. Utilizing the natural variation in maize for submergence tolerance studies has become more tractable due to availability of genetic resources such the Nested Association Mapping (NAM) populations and high-density marker information [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The aims of this study were to (i) assess the natural variation for submergence tolerance in maize germplasm by screening the diverse maize founder lines, (ii) examine the molecular responses to submergence through transcriptional profiling of a subset of tolerant and sensitive inbreds, and (iii) elucidate the genetic basis of submergence tolerance through QTL analysis. We show that substantial variation for submergence tolerance exists in maize NAM population germplasm, and identify a major QTL associated with submergence tolerance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Maize inbreds exhibit significant phenotypic diversity for submergence tolerance</title><p>A panel of 23 genetically diverse maize Nested Association Mapping (NAM) parental lines, representing five subpopulations, and B73 were screened for submergence tolerance for a period of 48 h or 96 h.

Interestingly, the RILs harboring the B73 allele at <italic>Subtol6</italic>, were considerably more sensitive to submergence than those with the Mo18W allele. Since B73 is widely used in many U.S. breeding programs, this suggests that there is a need for improving submergence tolerance in lines that have retained alleles associated with B73 submergence sensitivity.</p><p>The submergence tolerant lines identified from our experiments displayed delayed senescence in response to complete submergence. Lower ROS levels were observed in the tolerant lines during submergence. An increase in ROS has been reported in plants exposed to submergence and hypoxic conditions [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120385.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. One of the likely candidate genes that we propose for <italic>Subtol6</italic> is <italic>HB2</italic>. This is based on the expression differences between the parent inbreds (Mo18W and B73) and previously reported role of <italic>HB2</italic> in plant survival in low oxygen or low ATP conditions [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].

Our observations that the tolerant Mo18W has higher <italic>HB2</italic> transcript abundance, lower ROS levels and minimal senescence after submergence stress present <italic>HB2</italic> as an attractive candidate for <italic>Subtol6</italic>.</p><p>The second candidate gene underlying the <italic>Subtol6</italic> that we propose is the maize ortholog of <italic>AtRAV1</italic>, a member of the ERF gene family. Maize <italic>RAV1</italic> transcript abundance was lower in Mo18W relative to B73 under control and submerged conditions. Although, <italic>RAV1</italic> expression is induced in both Mo18W and B73, the up-regulation in B73 is higher than Mo18W in response to submergence. The differential expression pattern of <italic>RAV1</italic> between Mo18W and B73 is noteworthy because overexpression of <italic>RAV1</italic> in Arabidopsis is known to lead to early senescence. In wildtype Arabidopsis plants, <italic>RAV1</italic> expression is induced during onset of senescence [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This is consistent with the increased senescence observed in B73 relative to Mo18W after submergence stress. Although our selection of candidates for <italic>Subtol6</italic> is based on gene expression level differences, it is possible that the genetic basis of the <italic>Subtol6</italic> gene(s) could be due to sequence polymorphism in the underlying gene that has comparable transcript abundance during submergence and in control conditions. It is also possible that Mo18W may have additional gene(s) not present in the reference genome based on B73 as was the case with the rice <italic>Sub1</italic> locus.

This response was only observed in maize and is missing in rice and Arabidopsis. <italic>CBF</italic> genes act together in a transcriptional network and are expressed in response to a variety of conditions such as low temperature, dehydration, mechanical agitation, and senescence [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Notably, the induction of the CBF transcriptional network was stronger in the tolerant Mo18W, indicating that a <italic>CBF</italic>-mediated response may be more active in this line. In our study, submergence-induced senescence was delayed considerably in Mo18W compared to B73 and B97. Studies by Sharabi-Schwager et al. have shown that the ectopic expression of <italic>CBF</italic> genes negatively regulates senescence in Arabidopsis [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120385.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Although further studies are needed to determine the underlying cause of delayed senescence in Mo18W, the higher expression of the <italic>CBF</italic> transcriptional network highlights an interesting feature of the submergence response of this inbred and merits further exploration.</p><p>Although the tolerant lines have very different genetic backgrounds, at the molecular level, several interesting features were shared. Both tolerant inbreds had higher transcript abundance of ethanol fermentation related genes, specifically <italic>PDC3</italic> and <italic>ADH1</italic> compared to sensitive inbreds. In hypoxic conditions, PDC catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetaldehyde, which is then converted to ethanol by ADH providing NAD<sup>+</sup> for glycolysis [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. An unannotated transcript showing homology to the alpha subunit of <italic>PYROPHOSPHATE-DEPENDENT FRUCTOSE-6-PHOSPHATE 1-PHOSPHOTRANSFERASE (PFP)</italic> protein in maize was relatively less repressed in both tolerant lines compared to sensitive lines during submergence. During anoxic conditions the levels of ATP declines dramatically, and pathways that consume ATP are replaced by those that utilize PPi [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120385.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120385.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120385.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In rice seedlings, the activity of PFP increased during prolonged oxygen deprivation, and the activity of <italic>PFP</italic> was dependent on protein levels rather than protein kinetics [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, higher glycolytic rates, and higher protein levels and activity of <italic>PFP</italic> were reported in anoxia tolerant rice [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Although the exact function of <italic>PFP</italic> in plants is not entirely clear, it is thought that fructose-6-phosphate could be phosphorylated by <italic>PFP</italic> rather than phosphofructose kinase during anoxia. This mechanism could increase the ATP yield of glycolysis by as much as 50% during anaerobiosis [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. To date no studies have explored the importance of <italic>PFP</italic> in hypoxia/submergence tolerance in maize, however the expression pattern of <italic>PFP</italic> in tolerant genotypes in our study presents an intriguing possibility for a role in submergence tolerance in maize.</p><p>Complete submergence of maize during an early vegetative stage is an event that could contribute to substantial seedling leaf senescence with resultant yield losses. Precipitation events leading to maize submergence are likely to increase in frequency with the predicted climatic shifts in precipitation patterns. Despite the economic implications of this situation, very few studies have explored submergence tolerance in maize [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120385.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Here, we have identified a major QTL for submergence tolerance and characterized the molecular responses of a diverse set of maize inbreds to submergence.

Uniform seedlings (3 seedlings per inbred) were transferred to 416 L tubs at the V2 stage (three leaf stage) for submergence treatment. The water in the tubs was allowed to reach near ambient room temperatures (24&#x02013;27&#x000b0;C) 24 to 48 h prior to submerging the plants. Plants were arranged in a complete randomized design, and were arranged towards the center to avoid shading by the walls of the tub. Plants were scored using a visual scoring system for the duration of one week post-submergence (<xref rid="pone.0120385.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).

Supplemental lighting was supplied by 1000-watt metal halide bulbs (Philips Lighting Co., Somerset, NJ, USA) from 0700 to 1800 hrs. The duration of submergence was 48 or 96 h. Each leaf was scored visually on a 0 to 10 scale with 0 being completely healthy and 10 indicating complete senescence. Three independent biological replicates of the submergence experiments were conducted during May and August. Samples were collected from three biological replicates for each genotype for scoring and RNA extraction. For QTL mapping, a single RIL family (Mo18w x B73) consisting of 180 lines from the NAM population was selected for phenotypic screening. Four independent biological replicates of the submergence experiments described above were conducted in the months of November, December, May, and June. Pots were submerged for 48 h and arranged in an alpha lattice design with two adjacent tubs comprising one replication. Phenotypic screening of RILs was performed at 48 h rather than 96 h due to the high sensitivity to submergence observed in many lines. A large portion of the RIL population experienced complete senescence when seedlings were submerged for longer than 48 h.
