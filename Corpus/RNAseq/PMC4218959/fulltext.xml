Natural populations under strong selection may be especially useful in deciphering the genetic variants underpinning these evolutionary responses. Yet, few systems possess dramatic phenotypic changes that can be definitively attributed to selection pressures of a new environment. Even fewer species can be used to understand how evolution proceeds when repeated in separate populations.</p><p>Cave animals offer one of the most exciting systems in which to study these questions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Specifically, surface forms of the Mexican tetra, <italic>Astyanax mexicanus</italic>, colonized multiple caves in northeastern Mexico and evolved extreme cave-associated traits at least four independent times over the past 2&#x02013;3&#x02009;Myr (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Cavefish populations exhibit repeated morphological evolution for a variety of traits including eye degeneration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, pigment loss<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, increased size and number of specialized mechanosensory organs called neuromasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> and increased numbers of taste buds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Cavefish have also evolved behavioural differences relative to their surface-dwelling counterparts including increased attraction to vibrations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, increased olfactory capabilities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, altered feeding angles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> and loss of schooling and aggression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Further, cavefish lose body weight less quickly than surface morphs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> and show dramatic sleep reductions compared to surface fish<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. The polarity of these trait changes is known (derived in cavefish). Therefore, these natural replicates offer a unique opportunity to study the genetic bases of parallel and convergent evolutionary changes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.</p><p>Further, <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> is amenable to molecular genetic manipulation in the lab<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, and prior QTL (quantitative trait locus) analyses of surface and cavefish crosses identified genomic regions regulating numerous behavioural and morphological traits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. In this work, we present the first <italic>de novo</italic> genome assembly for <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> cavefish to allow for more precise identification of candidate genes underlying QTL than was previously possible with syntenic comparisons to zebrafish<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by identifying candidate genes for eye development and other cave-derived traits. We further analyze RNAseq data to survey these candidate genes for potential coding and expression level differences between the surface and cave populations. For many traits, we expect that the cavefish genome will provide a tool for discovery of the role of individual genes and pathways.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Sequencing and annotation</title><p>The sequenced cavefish individual was the first-generation offspring of two wild-caught parents, which originated from Pach&#x000f3;n cave, Tamaulipas, Mexico. While there are at least 29 caves that contain <italic>Astyanax</italic> cavefish, the Pach&#x000f3;n cavefish are the most studied and exhibit the most extreme troglomorphic phenotypes relative to the other caves<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. This genome draft was assembled to a size of 964&#x02009;Mb, which is similar in size to a congeneric in Brazil<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. The draft genome contains 10,735 scaffolds (N50 contig=14.7&#x02009;kb; N50 scaffold=1.775&#x02009;Mb), and the longest scaffold size was 9.823&#x02009;Mb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Using the Ensembl annotation pipeline<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> and RNAseq transcript evidence (eight unique tissues; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>), we predicted a total of 23,042 protein-coding genes, similar to other sequenced teleost fishes. Zebrafish is the closest sequenced relative to cavefish (diverged approximately 250&#x02009;Myr)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, and we annotated 16,480 one-to-one orthologs with zebrafish.</p><p>To estimate gene representation in the draft genome, we used assembled cavefish transcripts and evolutionarily conserved gene models. Alignment of the <italic>Astyanax</italic> best open reading frames (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>) to the genome scaffolds found that across tissue-specific transcriptomes, a median of 81% of transcripts align over at least 75% of their length with at least 90% identity. Further, CEGMA analyses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> indicated that 95% of the 248 ultra-conserved core eukaryotic genes are present in the genome assembly, and 69% of the 248 ultra-conserved core eukaryotic genes were considered complete genes. Collectively, this suggests that the assembly has captured much of the protein-coding sequence in the cavefish genome.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Transposable element annotation</title><p>One-third of the cavefish genome is composed of transposable elements (TEs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 3 and 4</xref>). This repetitive content is comparable to most published fish genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 3</xref>), with the exceptions of zebrafish (52.2% TEs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> and <italic>Fugu</italic> (2.8%) (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). In the cavefish, DNA transposons are more abundant and diversified than retrotransposons, as there are at least 12 different superfamilies of DNA transposons representing 12.7% of the genome. In contrast, retrotransposons comprise only 2.3% of the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4</xref>).</p><p>It appears that a recent wave of transposition occurred in the cavefish genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>) and was composed mostly of Tc-Mariner and hAT superfamilies, which currently comprise approximately 9.5% of the cavefish genome. Similarly, zebrafish experienced a recent large expansion of repeat families, including Tc-Mariner and hAT superfamilies, whereas another common model, stickleback, has not (RepeatMasker Genomic Datasets). We estimated the potential age of the different of copies for each TE-related superfamilies by calculating Kimura distances assuming that most of the mutations in TE copies are neutral. The rates of transversions (<italic>q</italic>) and transitions (<italic>p</italic>) were transformed in Kimura distances using [<italic>K</italic>=&#x02212;&#x000bd; ln(<italic>1</italic>&#x02212;<italic>2p</italic>&#x02212;<italic>q</italic>)&#x02212;<italic>&#x000bc;</italic> ln(<italic>1</italic>&#x02212;<italic>2q</italic>)]. The cavefish genome differs in comparison with zebrafish in that it appears to lack very young elements (as indicated by the Kimura distance from the consensus, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, RepeatMasker Genomic Datasets). Given the caveats of possible assembly artefacts, lack of very young elements indicates that it is unlikely that many copies of Tc-Mariner and hAT superfamilies are still active in the cavefish genome (confirmed by analyses of transcriptomes, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 5&#x02013;9</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification of candidate genes under QTL</title><p>Perhaps the most distinct trait in cavefish is the reduced, nearly absent eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>), which is independently derived in multiple, independent cave invasions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. In cavefish, early eye development is largely similar to the eye development in surface fish in that lens vesicles and optic cups form, albeit, they are smaller in cavefish even at very early stages (14&#x02009;h.p.f., hours post fertilization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). The lens apoptosis begins after 25&#x02009;h.p.f. (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), and the retina undergoes significant apoptosis at about 35&#x02009;h.p.f. (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). This apoptosis continues for days to weeks, and leads to an arrest of eye development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. We examine the genome for genes under QTL for eye size from Pach&#x000f3;n cavefish &#x000d7; surface fish crosses from various studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p><p>Across studies, we count a total of 15 non-overlapping QTL for eye-related phenotypes discovered in the Pach&#x000f3;n population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Scaffolds often did not span the entire critical region comprising a QTL; thus, each QTL critical region may be distributed across several scaffolds. All genes on a scaffold containing a marker linked to the QTL were included. In total, 2,408 genes out of the 23,042 genes annotated in this draft of the genome were associated with these genomic regions. It is likely that a significant portion of these genes that are physically linked to the causal variant are not responsible for the phenotype.</p><p>To narrow the list of candidate genes, we examined the gene expression in surface and cave populations with a developmental time course taken at 10&#x02009;h.p.f., 24&#x02009;h.p.f., 1.5 days post fertilization (d.p.f.), and 3&#x02009;d.p.f. RNA from each time period was extracted from 50 whole, pooled individuals and Illumina reads were generated for cavefish and surface fish pools separately. An important caveat to interpreting the gene expression data is that even early in development, cavefish eyes are smaller than surface fish eyes, and lower numbers of transcripts may reflect smaller eyes and not necessarily downregulation. The transcript sequences were also used for obtaining coding variant differences between surface fish and cavefish. Due to the enormity of defining gene to QTL associations for many troglomorphic traits, we primarily focused on the eye phenotype.</p><p>Here we used expression data and integrated pathway analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> to predict likely phenotypes and the genes potentially underlying those phenotypes. Utilizing prior knowledge of predicted outcome between transcriptional regulators and their target genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, we implicate 30 genes under the QTL to result in congenital eye anomalies. The direction of gene expression change between surface fish and cavefish supports an increased likelihood of eye anomalies in cavefish relative to surface fish at 10&#x02009;h.p.f., 24&#x02009;h.p.f., and 1.5&#x02009;d.p.f. (for example, 12/27, 12/19, 11/30 genes have expression direction consistent with increased congenital anomaly of the eye, respectively; biased-corrected <italic>z</italic> score &#x02265;2.266, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001 in all cases, see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> for details of <italic>z</italic> score calculation). At the last sampled time point (3&#x02009;d.p.f.), the expression data are consistent with increased cavefish eye anomalies, but interestingly, the <italic>z</italic> scores become smaller with the progression of development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 10&#x02013;16</xref>) and are not significant at 3&#x02009;d.p.f.</p><p>We performed an enrichment test with data combined across time points and found that the QTL were enriched for genes involved in congenital anomaly of the eye, (30/1,560 relative to 159/12,040 in the total expression data set; <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup>-test with Yates correction <italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c;0.034, <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup>=4.48, odds ratio=1.57, 95% confidence interval of odds ratio=1.05&#x02013;2.35). Additional genes involved in eye development, function and disease were enriched in the QTL set, though not significantly so (129/1,560 relative to 921/12,040 in total data set; <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup>-test with Yates correction <italic>P</italic> value=0.35, <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup>=0.88, odds ratio=1.10, 95% confidence interval of odds ratio=0.91&#x02013;1.34). Therefore, we contend that the eye-related QTL are qualitatively enriched for eye-related genes relative to the rest of the genome, but the eye-related QTL are quantitatively more likely to contain genes associated with congenital eye defects.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Specific candidate genes under eye-related QTL</title><p>Several genes found under the QTL are classic candidates for eye development, and we highlight several, which may be particularly promising. We narrowed down the list of candidate genes under the QTL by focusing on those with expression differences between cavefish and surface fish. Statistical comparisons of gene expression levels were performed using the measure of log fold change performed in Cuffdiff 2.1.0 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) (see Cuffdiff 2.1.0 documentation for additional details of test). Unless otherwise noted, all <italic>P</italic> values given below for differential expression between cave and surface fish were generated by this test.

One of these QTL is involved in vibration attraction behaviour, eye size and superficial neuromast number at the orbit on LG2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). This same QTL for eye size has been identified in multiple studies (LG7 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>), LG8 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) and LG1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>)) and a QTL for the thickness of the inner nuclear layer of the retina on LG2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). These LGs from various studies all correspond to the same genomic region, and here we count this region as a single QTL.

Cavefish expression of <italic>shisa2</italic> is qualitatively higher than surface fish at all time points (significantly so at 10&#x02009;h.p.f., 24&#x02009;h.p.f. and 1.5&#x02009;d.p.f., <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.005), but <italic>shisa2</italic> contains only a single synonymous change between cave and surface fish.

For both genes, qPCR experiments did not detect significant differences at 36&#x02009;h.p.f. between the two morphs, suggesting an expression difference of less than twofold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>; Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05). At this stage, <italic>shisa2</italic>-LG2 was expressed throughout the epidermis as well as in the olfactory epithelium and the lens in surface fish, but lens expression was notably missing in cavefish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). <italic>Shisa2</italic>-LG6 had a more complex expression pattern, reminiscent of what was described in <italic>Xenopus</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> and zebrafish<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, and included expression in the branchial arches, cranial ganglia, epidermis, olfactory epithelium (like <italic>shisa2</italic>-LG2), retina and lens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). No obvious difference was observed between surface fish and cavefish embryos concerning <italic>shisa2</italic>-LG6 expression pattern.

The knockdown of <italic>prox1</italic> results in the disruption of the lens-specific &#x003b3;-crystallin expression and subsequent lens apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>.

Significantly lower expression of <italic>prox1</italic> during these developmental time points is consistent with increased lens apoptosis in cavefish. Therefore, a re-examination of the contribution of <italic>prox1</italic>, in light of its location under this QTL for suborbital neuromast cell number, VAB and eye size<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> and its quantitative expression differences, may be warranted.</p><p><italic>AIFM1</italic> is implicated in significant and progressive optic atrophy in mutant Harlequin mice, and this mutant phenotype can be rescued by injection of an expression vector containing <italic>AIFM1</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). Cavefish exhibit significantly lower expression of <italic>AIFM1</italic> at 24&#x02009;h.p.f.

While these results are very preliminary, potential candidates for gene loss include members of gene families involved in vision such as retinol dehydrogenases, crystallins, sine oculis homeoboxes, opsins/rhodopsins (including melanopsin whose truncating mutation is implicated in the loss of a light-entrainable clock in Somalian cavefish<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>), development, regulation of sleep and circadian clocks (including fibroblast growth factors, gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptors, and dopamine receptors).

By leveraging these past studies, we demonstrate the utility of the genome for candidate gene discovery, and highlight several potential regulators of eye development that were previously not implicated in cavefish eye degeneration. We also analysed RNAseq data to identify coding variants between cavefish and surface fish and narrow the list of candidate genes that potentially impact degeneration of the eye. Identification of candidate genes from past QTL work is especially exciting in <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> because cavefish are amenable to a host of molecular genetic techniques that can be used to validate allelic effects (for example, injection of messenger RNA into developing embryo<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, meganuclease- and transposase-based transgenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) and additional experimental techniques can be accomplished using the close relative and laboratory model zebrafish<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> (for example, gene editing technologies such as TALENs). Thus, cavefish represent a powerful system for examining the genetic bases of evolutionary change, and we expect progress in candidate gene identification will be more efficient with the addition of the genome.</p><p>While a candidate gene approach has strong potential in the cavefish system, our expression analyses highlight the discoveries enabled by a pathway approach. In one example, our analysis predicted the reduced-eye phenotype in cavefish relative to surface fish by utilizing the direction of expression within eye development pathways. Notably, this result was one of the most significant phenotypes predicted as a downstream phenotypic effect from our developmental gene expression time course of whole embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 13&#x02013;16</xref>). Nonetheless, many databases, including the ones used in this study (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)), contain only orthologues from human, mouse and rat, and approximately 89% of the genes (2013/2408) in our QTL data set contained matches in the IPA database. This underscores the need for future iterations of these databases to include nonmammalian model species (for example, zebrafish, <italic>Drosophila</italic>) to increase homology matches and, therefore, enable pathway analysis for a large swath of organisms.</p><p>We anticipate that this genomic resource will be coupled with one of the largest strengths of the system, the repeated evolution of similar cave-associated traits in independently derived cave populations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Crosses between fish from different caves complement and restore certain cave-derived phenotypes (for example, rudimentary eyes)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>; thus, at least some of the genetic changes accounting for cave-associated traits are unique to each cave lineage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. In addition, surface populations provide a pool of standing genetic variation for the caves<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>, and the cavefish system offers an interesting system for studying adaptation in the face of gene flow<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. To investigate these questions, ongoing work that is beyond the scope of this paper includes a population genomic effort from several cave and surface localities. To enhance these efforts, the cavefish genome will need to be anchored to a physical, chromosome-scale map. Work to produce a higher-quality draft using long-read technology and a genotyping-by-sequencing linkage map is currently underway.

Transcriptomes were masked using RepeatMasker 3.3.0 using the specific cavefish repeat library, as was done for the genomic analyses. The proportion of the various classes (for example, DNA, LINE, SINE, LTR and unknown elements) were compared with their respective proportions in the genome (camembert graphs). We assayed for over- and under-representation of TE superfamilies by comparing the respective proportion of each family and superfamily in the genome and in the transcriptomes. The following equation was used: (percentage of the TE family in the genome [or transcriptome] * 100)/Total repeat content in the genome [or transcriptome]).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Gene prediction and annotation</title><p>Iterative steps that rely on similarity evidence from prior teleost gene models and <italic>ab initio</italic> gene prediction algorithms were followed to build gene models according to established methods at Ensembl<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.
