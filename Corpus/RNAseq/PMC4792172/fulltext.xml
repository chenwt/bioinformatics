While endoparasites play key roles in controlling nematode populations in nature, their application for integrated pest management is hindered by the limited understanding of their biology. We present a comparative analysis of a high quality finished genome assembly of <italic>Drechmeria coniospora</italic>, a model endoparasitic nematophagous fungus, integrated with a transcriptomic study. Adaptation of <italic>D. coniospora</italic> to its almost completely obligate endoparasitic lifestyle led to the simplification of many orthologous gene families involved in the saprophytic trophic mode, while maintaining orthologs of most known fungal pathogen-host interaction proteins, stress response circuits and putative effectors of the small secreted protein type. The need to adhere to and penetrate the host cuticle led to a selective radiation of surface proteins and hydrolytic enzymes. Although the endoparasite has a simplified secondary metabolome, it produces a novel peptaibiotic family that shows antibacterial, antifungal and nematicidal activities. Our analyses emphasize the basic malleability of the <italic>D. coniospora</italic> genome: loss of genes advantageous for the saprophytic lifestyle; modulation of elements that its cohort species utilize for entomopathogenesis; and expansion of protein families necessary for the nematode endoparasitic lifestyle.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Although annual crop losses to plant-parasitic nematodes are estimated at a staggering $157 billion worldwide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, options for nematode pest management are very limited due to environmental safety concerns<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. This situation demands further research to discover effective but environmentally responsible alternatives to replace legislatively withdrawn nematicides. Biological control agents, such as nematophagous fungi, may be part of the answer when applied in the context of integrated pest management systems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Thus, understanding the mechanisms governing the interactions between nematophagous fungi and their nematode prey, and biocontrol strategies based on these interactions are key issues for crop protection.</p><p>Nematophagous fungi comprise over 200 species from all major fungal taxa<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Most of these fungi are facultative parasites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, with the nematode prey serving as a supplementary nitrogen and lipid source for a basically saprophytic lifestyle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Nematophagous fungi produce various infection structures, and follow three main strategies to parasitize and kill their prey. First, nematode-trapping fungi capture their prey using various trapping devices with mechanical or adhesive functions. Next, female and egg parasites utilize appressoria to penetrate the eggshell or the cyst wall. Finally, endoparasites infect juvenile or adult nematodes using conidia that are ingested by their host, e.g. <italic>Harposporium</italic> spp., or by spores that adhere to the cuticle of the host, e.g. <italic>Drechmeria coniospora</italic> and <italic>Hirsutella minnesotensis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. The majority of the endoparasites has a low saprotrophic capacity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> and develops more intimate relationships with their hosts, approaching obligate parasitism. Although these fungi may play key roles in controlling the populations of certain nematodes in nature, most research efforts have concentrated on the nematode-trapping fungi and the female and egg parasites.</p><p>The ascomycete <italic>D. coniospora</italic> is the sole formally recognized species in the <italic>Drechmeria</italic> genus. It infects a variety of nematode species, including important plant pathogens such as the potato rot nematode (<italic>Ditylenchus destructor</italic>) and the root-knot nematodes (<italic>Meloidogyne</italic> spp.)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. The infection complex of <italic>D. coniospora</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has also served as a model to examine innate immunity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. <italic>D. coniospora</italic> is almost exclusively reliant on its nematode host for survival, and its very poor growth and sporulation on common laboratory media significantly hindered microbiological and genetic research on this organism, as compared to other endoparasites such as <italic>H. minnesotensis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.

The current study adds to this picture by investigating endoparasitism, the third major nematophagous strategy. Thus, we analyze the completed genome sequence of the near-obligate nematode endoparasite <italic>D. coniospora</italic>, and compare it to the recently published genome sequence of the facultative nematode endoparasite <italic>H. minnesotensis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Our results shed light on the adaptations brought about by the near-obligate endoparasitic lifestyle of <italic>D. coniospora</italic>, and also highlight dynamic adaptations of the transcriptome to different developmental stages in the fungal life cycle.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Finished sequence assembly reveals chromosome structure</title><p>The 32.5&#x02009;Mb finished genome assembly of the nematophagous endoparasitic fungus, <italic>D. coniospora</italic> ARSEF 6962, was constructed using a combination of whole-genome shotgun approaches on Solexa, Roche 454 and PacBio RS II platforms, followed by optical mapping (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref>). Sequence coverage reached 457.9-fold, with a long-contig continuity (N50: 4.14&#x02009;Mb) that is amongst the highest in published fungal genomic studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S2</xref>). Optical mapping anchored and oriented all contigs within three inferred chromosomes, measuring 12.5&#x02009;Mb, 10.2&#x02009;Mb and 9.8&#x02009;Mb, respectively. These inferred chromosomes feature acrocentric regional centromeres marked by high repeat content, reduced gene density and low GC content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). Chromosome III also contains an additional, shorter and less well-defined centromere-like region. Such dicentric chromosomes are presumed to result from chromosome fusions, with the activity of one centromere suppressed during cell division<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Chromosome fusion might also account for the unusually low number of inferred chromosomes in <italic>D. coniospora</italic>. Each chromosome is flanked by large regions (approximately 0.5&#x02009;Mb each) containing species-specific repeats, including the telomere regions. Sequencing of such dense repeats is considered to be extremely challenging, thus the successful mapping of these regions reflects the high quality of our genome assembly. Chromosome III also includes a &#x0003e;500&#x02009;kb region consisting of tandem repeats of rDNA gene clusters (6-7&#x02009;kb each), detected by optical mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). Similar assemblages have also been found in the genomes of plants and the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.</p><p>Long-range synteny is evident between the genome sequences of <italic>D. coniospora</italic> and the closely related insect pathogen, <italic>Tolypocladium inflatum</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>). 646 large syntenic blocks were detected, comprising 28.6&#x02009;Mb (87.2%) of the <italic>D. coniospora</italic> genome, and the large majority of the 194 contigs of the <italic>T. inflatum</italic> genome assembly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> may be oriented using the chromosomes of <italic>D. coniospora</italic> as a reference. This high level of synteny may indicate that the evolutionary divergence of <italic>D. coniospora</italic> and <italic>T. inflatum</italic> involved the adaptation of common, ancestral pathogenicity processes and mechanisms to their respective nematophagous or entomopathogenic lifestyles.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Genome dynamics</title><p>The completed genome assembly of <italic>D. coniospora</italic> features a repeat sequence content of 12.5% (4.11&#x02009;Mb), 74% of which is specific to this fungus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S3, Supplementary Results</xref>). Transposons comprise 2.2% of the genome, with Type I retrotransposons dominating over Type II DNA transposons (618 vs. 113, respectively, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S3</xref>). Retrotransposons are enriched in the centromeres and the terminal regions of the chromosomes, while DNA transposons appear scattered along the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S2</xref>). Similar trends were also observed in <italic>H. minnesotensis</italic>, although with a much higher overall transposon content (32% of the genome)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p><p>The completed genome of <italic>D. coniospora</italic> shows clear evidence for an active repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figs S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S4, Supplementary Results</xref>). RIP may be important to limit the activity of transposons in <italic>D. coniospora</italic>, given the frequent co-localization of RIP signals with transposons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Results</xref>). RIP only operates during sexual reproduction; its existence together with an active late sexual development protein (DCS 00280) suggests a possible cryptic sexual cycle in <italic>D. coniospora</italic>. The <italic>D. coniospora</italic> genome also encodes a well-conserved MAT1-1-1 ortholog (DCS 00888) while missing a <italic>MAT1-2</italic> idiomorph, suggesting that <italic>D. coniospora</italic> may be heterothallic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Results</xref>). This is in contrast to <italic>Ophiocordiceps sinensis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> which is homothallic, but in accord with most closely related insect pathogens such as <italic>T. inflatum</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, <italic>Metarhizium spp.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, and <italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, and perhaps <italic>H. minnesotensis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Nevertheless, a sexual cycle has never been observed for <italic>D. coniospora</italic> in nature or in the laboratory, nor has a teleomorph been linked to this fungus. This may simply be due to the slow growth rate of the fungus that might preclude easy detection of a sexual stage. Interestingly, the genome of <italic>D. coniospora</italic> encodes only three heterokaryon incompatibility proteins, as opposed to more than 21 present in the facultative insect pathogens <italic>Metarhizium</italic> spp. and <italic>B. bassiana</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, and 17 in the facultative nematode endoparasite <italic>H. minnesotensis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Heterokaryon incompatibility proteins are barriers against vegetative fusions between genetically distinct individuals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. The limited diversity of these proteins, as well as the lack of an observed sexual stage suggests that encounters between different fungal individuals are rare for <italic>D. coniospora</italic> (and <italic>O. sinensis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) due to their adaptation to a more specialized, near-obligate endoparasitic lifestyle, and this might also result in a gradual loss of sexual reproduction.</p><p>On the other hand, copious production of asexual spores is crucial for the pathogenic cycle of <italic>D. coniospora</italic>. Exhaustive searches for conidiogenesis-related genes in the genome of <italic>D. coniospora</italic> reaffirm the phenotypic observation that the development of conidiferous pegs and those for the formation, maturation and release of conidia in <italic>D. coniospora</italic> is similar to those by the fusaria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, but quite different from the complex phialide-bearing structures typically observed in the aspergilli (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S5, Supplementary Results</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Transcriptome</title><p>Since the growth of <italic>D. coniospora</italic> is exceedingly slow on standard media (several months on MEA or CMA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, we used a specialized agar medium rich in proteins and lipids (liver and kidney medium, see Materials and Methods) to provide sufficient quantities of viable material for transcriptomic analyses, conducted with combined triplicate samples each for the mycelial, early conidiogenesis, and conidia growth phases. A nematode infection transcriptome was also recorded on <italic>C. elegans</italic> as a host by combining daily samples over eight days post-infection, since the low conidial production of <italic>D. coniospora</italic> on lab media precluded more extensive time-scape sampling. Gene expression trends observed in RNAseq for select test genes were validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and the transcriptomic data were used to complement and curate gene predictions in the genome. Although proper comparison of infective growth on a host vs. saprophytic growth on artificial media was difficult for <italic>D. coniospora</italic> due to its near-obligate endoparasitic lifestyle, the transcriptome datasets still showed that expression of the <italic>D. coniospora</italic> genome is highly dynamic and reflects the constraints and demands of the given life stage, as discussed in the following sections. Approximately 9% of the genes (862) were differentially expressed (defined as larger than four-fold change in expression between at least two of the three <italic>in vitro</italic> growth stages and p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), with genes involved in carbohydrate, lipid and amino acid transport/metabolism, defense mechanisms, secondary metabolism, and translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis showing the largest plasticity in the different life stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S6</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Global evolutionary and functional analysis of predicted genes</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Phylogeny</title><p>We compared the predicted proteome of <italic>D. coniospora</italic> with those of 23 fungi representing various life-strategies: saprophytes and mycoparisites, plant pathogens or symbionts, entomopathogens, and nematode pathogens. From the resulting 19,426 orthologous groups, 285 that consisted of one-to-one orthologs in all 24 species were used to reconstruct phylogenies. The resulting phylogenomic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>) is generally consistent with previously published standard multigene or whole genome phylogenetic analyses of Hypocreales and other model ascomycetes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. The analyses assign <italic>D. coniospora</italic> to Ophiocordycipitaceae, and reveal that this lineage shared an entomopathogenic ancestor. The topology of the phylogenetic tree shows that the three main nematophagous lifestyles (endoparasitism as in <italic>D. coniospora</italic> and <italic>H. minnesotensis,</italic> female and egg parasitism as in <italic>P. chlamydosporia,</italic> and nematode trapping as with <italic>A. oligospora</italic> and <italic>Mo. haptotylum</italic>) are polyphyletic in origin.

This analysis shows that diversification and specialization during repeated lifestyle switches in this group involved mainly gene losses, with a more limited evolution of new gene inventions. Notably, losses are over-represented, while duplications and new inventions are strongly under-represented in the common ancestor of <italic>D. coniospora</italic> and <italic>T. inflatum</italic>, suggesting that genome simplification, perhaps supported by active RIP, is the dominant dynamics in this lineage.

Strikingly, the number of orthologous groups shared with the entomopathogens outside the &#x0201c;core genome&#x0201d; is also higher than the one that is common with the representative nematophagous fungi (entomopathogens: 336 <italic>vs</italic>. nematophagous fungi: 297, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). This suggests that <italic>D. coniospora</italic> inherited its infection apparatus from its entomopathogenic ancestors and tuned these mechanisms to adapt to its new host. Nevertheless, the common genes present in these four nematode parasites, and especially those that are missing from the selected representatives of the other life-strategy groups, may provide a list of host-specific genes for nematode recognition, adhesion and/or digestion. Surprisingly, there are only a very limited number of genes that are present exclusively in the nematophagous fungi but not in the other three groups (56 <italic>D. coniospora</italic> proteins in 54 orthologous groups, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S7D</xref>). 33 of these proteins do not have an identifiable Pfam domain.

While most of the <italic>D. coniospora</italic>-specific proteins were found to be expressed at low levels, three proteins were substantially upregulated during nematode infection, including a surface protein (DCS_00041, GLEYA-domain containing protein), a protein without a Pfam domain (DCS_05566) and a protein with a glycine-rich domain (DCS_06014) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S7E</xref>).</p><p>To further dissect genomic adaptations to nematophagy, we compared the predicted proteomes of <italic>D. coniospora</italic> (a near-obligate endoparasite that is also able to infect nematode eggs in experimental settings)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, <italic>H. minnesotensis</italic> (a facultative endoparasite of nematode juveniles), <italic>P. chlamydosporia</italic> (a female and egg parasite that may also infect L2 juveniles)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, and <italic>A. oligospora</italic> (a nematode trapping fungus that can degrade plant material and may also colonize roots).

Genes clustered with DcNRPS1 also encode further enzymes for the biosynthesis, transport and transcriptional regulation of this predicted peptaibiotic. The DcNRPS1 cluster shows a lower GC content compared to flanking genomic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>). While these flanking sequences exhibit synteni with the <italic>M. acridum</italic> and <italic>M. robertsii</italic> genomes, the DcNRPS1 cluster itself is missing from those entomopathogens. The DcNRPS1 locus and its flanking sequences also lack synteny with the <italic>H. minnesotensis</italic> genome, and DcNRPS1 itself has no ortholog in the facultative endoparasite<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. These analyses suggest a heterologous origin for this cluster. <italic>D. coniospora</italic> fermentations yielded a series of &#x0003e;20 closely related linear non-ribosomal peptide analogues which we named &#x0201c;drechmerins&#x0201d;. The structures of the dominant drechmerin analogues were determined by mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Results, Fig. S14</xref>), and shown to contain the non-canonical amino acid analogues AIB (&#x003b1;-aminoisobutyric acid), AHMOD ([2<italic>S</italic>,4<italic>S</italic>]-2-amino-6-hydroxy-4-methyl-8-oxodecanoic acid) and AMD (2-amino-4-methyldecanoic acid).

Considering that the drechmerin biosynthetic cluster is highly transcribed during mycelial growth while repressed in other growth stages, this peptaibiotic may serve as an aggressive virulence factor contributing to the killing of the nematode prey, and/or may defend the nematode carcass from invading fungi or bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Destruxins and other toxins from closely related Hypocrealean entomopathogens have also been postulated to serve similar roles, providing yet another example of evolutionary convergence for a requisite biological need<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The <italic>D. coniospora</italic> genome complements our understanding of fungal nematophagy by revealing genomic adaptations to endoparasitism, the third major nematode parasitic strategy in fungi in addition to female and egg parasitism (<italic>P. chlamydosporia</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) and nematode trapping (<italic>A. oligospora</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). A high quality finished assembly revealed a 32.5 Mb genome organized in only three inferred chromosomes, at least one of which is a result of a chromosomal fusion. Global syntheny with the closely related insect pathogen <italic>T. inflatum</italic> was detected. Phylogenomic analyses assign <italic>D. coniospora</italic> to Ophiocordycipitaceae, and reveal that this lineage shared an entomopathogenic ancestor. The <italic>D. coniospora</italic> genome features a relatively high repeat content including regional centromeres, telomeres, an rDNA island, and a large number of species-specific repeat regions. The genome is molded by transposable elements and an active repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) genome defense system. While a teleomorph has not been identified for <italic>D. coniospora</italic>, genomic evidence suggests the existence of a cryptic sexual cycle with heterotallic mycelia.</p><p>Comparison with the facultative nematode endoparasite <italic>H. minnesotensis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> reveals that adaptation of <italic>D. coniospora</italic> to the near-obligate nematode endoparasitic trophic mode of this fungus involved both genome contraction and limited new gene inventions. The <italic>D. coniospora</italic> genome features only 8,281 protein-encoding genes as a result of significant reduction of many gene families, including cytochrome P450s, hydrolytic enzymes, and regulators. While central elements of stress signaling pathways are well conserved in <italic>D. coniospora</italic>, stress sensors and transcriptional regulators underwent category-specific simplifications. These losses led to the degeneration of the saprophytic fitness of this organism. On the other hand, orthologs of pathogen-host interaction proteins are easily identifiable in <italic>D. coniospora</italic>, and the genome also contains a large number of putative small secreted proteins, many of which appear species-specific. While hydrolytic enzyme families are generally contracted in <italic>D. coniospora</italic>, some subfamilies of these enzymes underwent expansions. These enzymes may be involved in host penetration, and together with a significantly expanded repertoire of transporters, may contribute to the utilization of the nematode prey as a nutrient source. <italic>D. coniospora</italic> acquires iron from its host by producing hexadentate siderophores, but may also utilize reductive iron assimilation. In addition, genomic evidence for the utilization of heme (but not heme-proteins) was also obtained. The secondary metabolome of the near-obligate endoparasite is also simplified, but still includes 17 gene clusters organized around PKS, NRPS and NRPS-PKS genes. One of these clusters is responsible for the biosynthesis of drechmerins, novel peptaibiotics that show antibiotic, antifungal and nematicidal activities. Transcriptomic analyses comparing the mycelial, condiogenesis, conidial, and nematode infection stages of <italic>D. coniospora</italic> provided support for a dynamically adapting transcriptome and highlighted genes preferentially expressed in these different life stages. Thus, our data emphasize the basic malleability of the Hypocrealean genome, with <italic>D. coniospora</italic> eliminating genes advantageous for saprophytic lifestyle, modulating and adapting elements that its cohort species utilize for entomopathogenesis, and expanding protein families necessary for its nematode endoparasitic lifestyle.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Fungal strain and growth conditions</title><p>An axenic culture of <italic>Panagrellis redivivus</italic> was infected with spores of <italic>D. coniospora</italic> ARSEF 2468 (equivalent to CBS 615.82).

All predicted gene models were functionally annotated based on their sequence similarities to genes and proteins in the NCBI nucleotide (nt), non-redundant (nr), UniProt/Swiss-Prot protein databases, and the conserved protein domain database InterProScan. All genes were classified using the Gene Ontology (GO), eukaryotic orthologous groups (KOG) and KEGG metabolic pathways. Repeat sequences were masked throughout the genome using Repeat Masker (version 3.2.9) and the RepBase library (version 16.08). Selected gene family members were identified using the following criteria: coverage and identity both above 50%, and E score &#x0003c;10-5.
