To better understand Aire&#x02019;s specificity, we performed single-cell RNAseq and DNA methylation analysis in <italic>Aire</italic>-sufficient and -deficient medullary epithelial cells (mTECs). Each of Aire&#x02019;s target genes was induced in only a minority of mTECs, independently of DNA methylation patterns, as small inter-chromosomal gene clusters activated in concert in a proportion of mTECs. These microclusters differed between individual mice, and thus suggest an organization of the DNA or of the epigenome that results from stochastic determinism, but is bookmarked and stable through mTEC divisions, ensuring more effective presentation of self-antigens, and favoring diversity of self-tolerance between individuals.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Aire is a fascinating transcription factor, with a unique function in promoting immunological tolerance of differentiating thymocytes<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. First, it induces ectopic expression in medullary epithelial cells (mTECs) of a large set of genes whose products are typically associated with fully differentiated parenchymal cells (so-called peripheral-tissue antigens, PTAs)<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. In addition, Aire controls factors that modulate the presentation of peptides derived from these PTAs by MHC molecules at the mTEC surface, or their cross-presentation by dendritic cells<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. These peptides mold the T cell repertoire by inducing negative selection of self-reactive specificities<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> or by promoting positive selection of regulatory T cells<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. The physiological consequences of Aire&#x02019;s activity are profound, as humans and mice with loss-of-function mutations in <italic>AIRE/Aire</italic> loci develop multi-organ autoimmunity<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Even if its structural domains are shared with conventional motif-specific transcription factors, Aire is a very unusual transcription factor. It impacts a large number of genes, generally allowing transcription of genes that would not be expected to be expressed in a given cell-type. Aire contains a SAND domain typically involved in DNA binding, but it does not have a clear DNA-binding motif, although it has been suggested to recognize methylated CpG residues in association with the meCpG-binding factor MBD1<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Rather, its transcriptional activity seems to depend on the recognition of non-specific markers of low-activity chromatin, such as hypomethylated amino-terminal tail of histone H3<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> or transcriptional start sites (TSS) with a surfeit of paused polymerases<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Aire also interacts with a variety of non-specific elements of the transcriptional and splicing machinery<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Indeed, recent data derived from a variety of experimental approaches argue that Aire&#x02019;s major <italic>modus operandi</italic> is to release promoter-proximal RNA polymerase-II (Pol-II) pausing<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Aire&#x02019;s action has an element of stochasticity. Single-cell PCR analysis suggested that individual mTECs, otherwise indistinguishable, express distinct patterns of PTAs<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Gene-expression profiling of mTECs from individual mice also suggested that inter-individual &#x0201c;noise&#x0201d; in gene expression between genetically identical mice was higher for Aire target genes than for the bulk of transcripts<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. In spite of these clues, a coherent framework that explains Aire&#x02019;s action in individual cells has remained elusive.</p><p id="P5">Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) opens completely new vistas on the analysis of gene expression<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> by combining the globality of genome-wide transcriptome profiling with the unique granularity brought by single-cell technologies like flow cytometry. It can reveal unrecognized subpopulation structure and avoid erroneous averaging, and can provide information on the fluctuations (&#x0201c;noise&#x0201d;) in gene expression<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> in an otherwise homogeneous population of cells<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Some of this noise can result from transcriptional bursting<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, but it may also reveal coordinated activation of specific transcriptional programs that can be important in determining cellular differentiation or responses. Recent technical innovations make scRNAseq more performant and robust, with cell multiplexing, molecular barcoding and microfluidic devices<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. scRNAseq data analysis remains challenging, however. First, with efficacies of molecular conversion of 20% at best, the low-expressed portion of the transcriptome is unreliably assessed in any one cell. Second, because real replicates are innately impossible with single-cell analysis, estimation of technical variance remains uncertain. Finally, the data must be interpreted in the context of sampling statistics, which makes analysis less intuitive than conventional profiling data, and necessitates complex statistical models<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">scRNAseq seemed to provide an attractive opportunity to explore the distribution of PTA expression in individual mTECs. This perspective, much broader than was achieved earlier by PCR<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, allowed us to ask how frequently individual Aire target genes are expressed in mTECs, and whether Aire changes the frequency of cells expressing particular transcripts or instead boosts the intensity of transcript expression in cells in which they are already present. Although Aire-induced gene expression proved to be very noisy, affecting genes with low frequency of expression, we uncovered unexpected order in this chaos detecting a number of Aire-induced transcripts whose expression clustered in small groups of mTECs, with no apparent logic, and varied between individual mice. These observations have direct implications for the efficiency of tolerance induction, and individual susceptibility to autoimmune deviation.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="S1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S2"><title>Range of Aire-induced gene expression</title><p id="P7">As a prelude to single-cell analysis, we performed standard RNA-seq on bulk-sorted mTECs. CD45<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Ly51<sup>lo</sup>MHCII<sup>hi</sup>GFP<sup>hi</sup> cells were prepared in duplicate from <italic>Aire-gfp</italic> transgenic mice<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>, which were crossed with mice carrying the <italic>Aire</italic>-knockout mutation<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> to generate wild-type (wildtype) and deficient (hereafter KO) littermates. In the TruSeq libraries generated (11.8 to 31.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> mapped reads per sample), we observed a biased and very deep impact of Aire: of the 19,772 genes expressed (at a threshold of 1 Fragments Per Kilobase of exon per Million; FPKM) in these datasets, 2995 were &#x0201c;Aire-induced&#x0201d; and 766 &#x0201c;Aire-repressed&#x0201d; genes (at an arbitrary FoldChange &#x0003e;2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). These results are consistent with prior microarray analyses<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and more recent RNA-seq data<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> showing that Aire regulates a large fraction of the transcriptome. The sets of Aire-induced and -neutral genes defined here will be those tracked in the scRNAseq analyses below.</p><p id="P8">In addition to these consequences on entire transcripts, these RNAseq data showed that Aire further exerts more subtle effects on the usage of individual exons within genes. Several transcripts whose overall levels were little affected in mTECs by the absence of Aire showed Aire-dependent inclusion of particular exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). A more complete analysis of this phenomenon revealed 3,219 such exons with Aire-dependent expression, in contrast to the majority of exons whose representation correlated with that of the gene as a whole (175,216 exons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Alternative splicing has long been known to affect tolerance, as initially recognized for autoimmune responses to the <italic>Plp1</italic> gene product<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. As also speculated by Keane et al<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, Aire may help maximize exposure to genome-encoded peptides by enhancing exon inclusion, a property consistent with the splicing factors with which it interacts<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Conversely, this analysis also revealed the presence of a set of exons whose abundance remained invariant in the presence or absence of Aire, while the whole transcript was induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). These exons were particularly prevalent at the beginning of the transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), which is consistent with our earlier demonstration that the representation of the first exon shows comparatively little change in the absence of Aire<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, reflecting polymerases that transcribe a short portion of the gene before stalling in Aire&#x02019;s absence. The match between the degree of induction of genes and exons by Aire increased progressively along the transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), suggesting that this effect may actually extend quite some distance from the TSS.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Overall diversity in transcriptomes of individual mTECs</title><p id="P9">With these reference data in hand, we proceeded with analyzing Aire-controlled gene expression in individual mTECs through scRNAseq. Index sorting of single cells into wells of microtiter plates was used, such that we could relate the RNAseq profiles to the marker characteristics of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). We generated sequencing libraries from 360 single mTECs from two pairs of wildtype and KO mice, using a protocol modified from the original CEL-Seq technique<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. This protocol includes oligo-dT priming with barcodes to allow attribution of each sequence read to its cell of origin, as well as Unique Molecular Identifiers for tagging each original molecule, in order to avoid artefacts from over-amplification of small numbers of initial molecules<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Although most single-cell libraries yielded high-quality data, for robustness we restricted our further analysis to 201 cells that generated at least 10<sup>4</sup> unique mappable reads per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Several findings validated these single-cell data. First, there was good representation of the MHC-II and housekeeping transcripts expected in mTECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Second, the intensity of the Aire-GFP fluorescence as detected by flow cytometry matched the <italic>GFP</italic> and <italic>Aire</italic> transcript counts in each cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>; note that the Aire-KO mutation abolishes function, but not the transcript). Third, the total number of reads per gene, obtained by aggregating all the scRNAseq datasets, recapitulated well the data at the population level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>, Pearson r=0.72).</p><p id="P10">We then analyzed computationally the expression of Aire targets in these scRNAseq data. Examination of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, which depicts the presence or absence of individual transcripts in each cell, reveals each of the points that will be substantiated and validated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>: (i) Aire mainly targets transcripts expressed at a low frequency (Aire-induced more sparse than Aire-neutral transcripts).

(iv) Accordingly, there are groups of mTECs with comparable expression of small gene clusters. (v) mTEC clusters are different in individual mice.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Aire mainly targets transcripts expressed at low frequency</title><p id="P11">Density plots of the frequency of mTECs expressing individual genes were generated for Aire-induced, -neutral or -repressed mRNAs (transcripts matched for expression in bulk RNA-seq). This analysis showed that most Aire-induced genes were active in only 5&#x02013;20% of the sampled <italic>Aire-KO</italic> mTECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Aire-neutral and -repressed genes were more frequently expressed in these mTECs, and the difference was significant across the three expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Two points argued that this low frequency of Aire-induced transcripts was not merely a consequence of statistical sampling, which can be a concern for scRNAseq. First the frequency of false-negatives (dropouts) from sampling is directly related to the intensity of expression, and these dropouts would be expected at the same frequency for expression-matched Aire-induced or -neutral transcripts, which is clearly not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Second, we plotted the probability that cells with no reads for a given gene were statistical dropouts. Most Aire-induced transcripts had very low probabilities of being false-negatives (68.1% with nominal p&#x0003c;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Aire mainly increases the level of target-gene expression</title><p id="P12">The increase observed in wild-type mTEC in comparison to KO mTECs for a given Aire-induced gene in bulk population profiling could result from increases in either the amount of transcript per cell, or in the proportion of cells expressing the transcript. When we compared the wildtype/KO changes in mean expression intensity in mTECs positive for a given transcript, as well as the changes in the frequency of cells expressing this transcript, we found that Aire expression appeared to increase both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>, chisq.test p &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;15</sup>). Curiously, a limited but significant shift was also observed between KO and wildtype mTECs for transcripts in the Aire-neutral category (chisq.test p&#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>), indicating that Aire subtly activates the majority of genes in the cell. A potential confounder of this analysis is that higher read number per cell lead to more frequent detection of positive cells, simply because higher intensities favor lower dropout rates. To test for such bias we plotted the frequency of cells expressing Aire-induced or &#x02013;neutral genes vs the mean intensity of expression in mTECs that do express them, in wildtype and KO mTECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). This analysis showed that the presence of Aire resulted in a predominant shift in the distribution towards higher per-cell intensities, a shift that did not merely follow the main intensity-frequency relation. Indeed, we found that the shift in expression intensity in Aire&#x02019;s presence led to less increase in the expression frequency of its targets than predicted from the dropout distribution of gene pairs randomly drawn from the Aire-neutral distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Thus, Aire target genes remained less frequently expressed than the genome-wide norm, even after transcriptional activation by Aire.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Discrete clusters of Aire-induced genes show coordinated expression</title><p id="P13">The short vertical streaks in the checkerboard plot of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> suggested that subsets of genes are expressed in concert. To better evidence such structures in the data, we computed gene-by-gene correlations for all Aire-induced genes (on the basis of weighted expression matrix<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>), and performed a partition clustering using an affinity propagation (AP) algorithm<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. We found a high degree of structure in the scRNAseq datasets from wild-type mTECs, as 51% of Aire-induced transcripts grouped into 19 clusters with an internal mean correlation &#x0003e;0.75 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>); these clusters were small (33 to 114 transcripts; median 57) and largely distinct from each other. The significance of these clusters was verified by permutation (randomly shuffling the expression levels per gene between cells), which did not reproduce the same degree of cluster structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>); comparable cluster sizes and internal correlations were not achieved in 1000 random permutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>, Wilcoxon p=0.001). Fewer such clusters were detected with the scRNAseq datasets from KO mTECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>, Wilcoxon p=0.002), or when computed from expression-matched Aire-neutral genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>, Wilcoxon p=8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>), further substantiating their significance, and indicating that Aire is required for the appearance of these co-expressed clusters.</p><p id="P14">It was previously reported that Aire-induced PTAs tend to fall in local gene clusters<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. We observed such co-regulated activity of local segments, as illustrated for the <italic>Sprr</italic> and <italic>Mup</italic> loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). On the other hand, these localized coregulation events contributed little to the overall gene clusters, most of which rested on correlations across chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Therefore, mTECs co-express discrete, interchromosomal gene networks. We searched for commonalities between the transcripts that form these small clusters. GeneOntology or pathway analysis (MSigDB, PANTHER) failed to reveal any gene function or pathway shared by members of any of these clusters; nor did cluster members share specificity of expression when analyzed across the GNF compendium of gene expression<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>; nor did the promoter regions of cluster members show enrichment for binding motifs for a particular transcription factor (data not shown). Therefore, these co-expressed gene clusters seem unrelated in terms of genomic position, biological function, or transcriptional regulation.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Aire-induced gene networks define distinct mTEC subgroups</title><p id="P15">Given these small clusters of Aire-induced genes, we asked how their expression demarcates individual mTECs. Correlation analysis based on probability values for Aire-induced genes showed that wild-type mTECs partitioned into discrete groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). These groupings were based on inter-chromosomal gene networks, because the cell-to-cell correlation maps computed on the basis of transcripts from one chromosome were reproduced, for the most part, when computed with transcripts from other chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>, right panels). For a broader perspective on mTEC heterogeneity in wildtype and KO thymi, we analyzed the cell-to-cell correlation matrix with t-SNE<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>, a dimensionality reduction algorithm that computes the probability for two cells to be neighbors, and displays the best fit in 2D space. Aire-deficient mTECs tended to group close together at the center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Wild-type mTECs, although distributed around the same center, radiated further (Wilcoxon p&#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> in repeated runs), and were more distant from each other than were KO mTECs (p&#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;60</sup>). Predictably, these small t-SNE groups coincided with the cell clusters of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>. Thus, Aire diversifies gene expression, not in a completely random fashion, but with some degree of coordination between cells.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>mTEC clusters are different in individual mice</title><p id="P16">It was already apparent from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> that the small gene clusters expressed in mTECs were not shared between mice. Indeed, when gene-gene correlations were computed independently from scRNAseq mTEC datasets from each wildtype mouse, correlations within a cluster applied for mTECs of only one mouse, but not in the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>). Thus, these gene networks are most likely established by stochastic events, and not by hardwired molecular cues.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>DNA methylation in mTECs does not account for Aire specificity</title><p id="P17">Epigenetic regulatory mechanisms make attractive candidates to explain two prominent characteristics of Aire transcriptional specificity, the predilection to activate infrequently expressed genes, and the interchromosomal clusters that are coordinately expressed in small groups of mTECs. DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides is one such candidate, as variable but heritable methylation patterns could be at root. Indeed, Waterfield <italic>et al</italic>. have proposed that Aire associates with the methyl-CpG binding protein MBD1 and uses this factor&#x02019;s ability to preferentially recognize methylation at the TCGCA motif for preferential PTA targeting<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. In addition, analysis of DNA methylation by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) is inherently a single-cell methodology that measures the frequency of DNA methylation marks at specific locations, and was thus a good complement to the single-cell analyses above.</p><p id="P18">To determine their DNA methylation status, mTECs were sorted as described above, and their DNA was processed for RRBS<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. The distribution of CpG methylation at different positions did not differ markedly between mTECs from wild-type and KO mice, for Aire-induced and -neutral loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>). CpG positions in upstream enhancer elements were similarly represented in both sets of genes, and the region surrounding the TSS was uniformly unmethylated in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>). This observation held for MBD1 sites in particular, which were uniformly unmethylated in all loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). In fact, the frequency of TCGCA sites in Aire target genes was the same in Aire-induced TSS and Aire-neutral TSS, and reanalysis of the published expression data<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> showed that MBD1 has a limited transcriptional impact in mTECs, which overlaps very little with Aire&#x02019;s transcriptional signature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>), indicating that MBD1 plays little or no role in Aire-dependent PTA expression.</p><p id="P19">CpG methylation increases in frequency at intragenic positions<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>, and this trend was slightly less pronounced for Aire-induced loci than for expression-matched neutral loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>). We asked whether the intragenic CpG methylation frequency might relate to the frequency of expression of corresponding Aire-induced genes in wild-type mTECs. The majority of intragenic CpGs were either not methylated or highly methylated, and both of these methylation statuses were associated with a range of expression frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>). Finally these methylation profiles, including the sites of variable methylation, were not Aire-dependent, as evidenced by the high correlation between wild-type and KO MECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>). Therefore, Aire itself does not alter the DNA methylation profiles in mTECs, and methylation patterns do not provide any obvious clue as to the frequency distribution of Aire target genes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S10"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P20">This study has revealed several novel aspects of Aire&#x02019;s function as a transcription factor, which likely have direct consequences on its function in central tolerance induction.</p><p id="P21">First, Aire increased mTEC transcriptome diversity by inducing thousands of Aire-dependent transcripts, as well as Aire-dependent exons in otherwise Aire-neutral genes.

Alternative splicing is known to have important consequences on autoimmune responses (e.g.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>), but Aire&#x02019;s role in this process had not been recognized. It seems likely that Aire&#x02019;s impact on differential exon inclusion is tied to its close interactions with splicing factors of the transcriptional machinery and its preferential effect on spliced transcripts in cultured cells<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. This broad effect on the mTEC transcriptome maximizes the representation of peptides presented to developing thymocytes.</p><p id="P22">Second, Aire seems to preferentially target genes that are expressed in a minority of cells, and increases the intensity of expression of its target genes. This is consistent with the notion that Aire recognizes generic features of gene and chromatin organization, such as unmethylated H3K4 or promoters with a surfeit of paused polymerases<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. Thus, it isn&#x02019;t as if Aire had any particular specificity for PTAs, but rather that it keys on these generic features of poorly expressed genes. But, with regards to regulation of gene expression, what does an &#x0201c;infrequently expressed&#x0201d; gene really mean, for a rather homogenous primary cell population like the Aire<sup>+</sup> mTECs analyzed here? It is a notion far removed from the deterministic gene expression programs usually envisaged for lineage differentiation, but rather related to notions of &#x0201c;noisy&#x0201d; gene expression. There are several sources of noise in gene expression that can be important in allowing progression through differentiation or cellular adaptation processes<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. Infrequent gene expression can correspond to a &#x0201c;burst&#x0201d; of transcription, where any given gene is actively transcribed only a small fraction of the time<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> and produces relatively short-lived transcripts. Then, a low frequency of positive cells can simply denote the odds of catching a cell during such a transcriptional burst. Alternatively, low-frequency expression can result from a particular organization of the DNA or epigenetic modifications, which are set stochastically in every cell, but are then stable for some period of time. Aire is predominantly found in tight nuclear &#x0201c;speckles&#x0201d; <sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>, thought to be sites of active transcription, and one might speculate that the set of genes ectopically expressed by a mTEC are those which have been threaded into these Aire-containing speckles.</p><p id="P23">Clues to the basis of low expression frequency of Aire-controlled genes may be found in the small clusters of co-regulated genes whose expression is shared by discrete groups of mTECs. The existence of these discrete microclusters of expression is not easily compatible with a burst model, because it is unlikely that genes would burst at the same time in different cells, but rather with a model where infrequent expression results from stable organization of the genome or epigenome. Because the genes within these expression clusters do not share discernable sequence motifs or chromosomal locations that might explain their coordinated transcription, their co-expression in a fraction of the mTECs is perhaps most easily interpreted in terms of clonal relationship. mTEC that share PTA clusters could plausibly be daughters of the same epithelial cell progenitor<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>, implying that Aire-target selection within a mTEC clone is &#x0201c;bookmarked&#x0201d; across cell division. Bookmarking (the recovery of gene expression programs after mitosis <sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>) can be explained for conventional transcription by the persistence of networks of specific transcription factors, but is puzzling for a mode of regulation that does not depend on the transcription factors that normally activate specific PTAs <sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Epigenetic cues such as DNA modifications, albeit probably not methylation, or remanent histone marking might be involved in bookmarking PTA expression. Of note, Brd4, which binds acetylated histones and promotes the release of PolII stalled at the promoter, is involved in trans-mitotic bookmarking<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> and is an essential Aire cofactor (Yoshida et al, in press), and one might imagine that Brd4, together with Aire and other cofactors, forms trans-mitotically stable complexes with fixed DNA regions. Thus, one might propose that an inherently stochastic mechanism initially selects and marks groups of loci, whose coexpression is then bookmarked and transmissible. A parallel could be made to the stochastically determined repertoire of activating and inhibitory receptors in NK cells.</p><p id="P24">In terms of tolerance induction, the low expression frequency of Aire-target genes and the existence of expression microclusters implies that mTECs are &#x0201c;splitting the burden&#x0201d; of PTA expression, and that there is a higher local concentration of any gene product than if all PTAs were uniformly expressed in all mTECs. Since immature thymocytes scan the thymic medulla and negative selection is effective with small pockets of antigen-positive presenting cells <sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>, negative selection should be more effective than with lower but widespread amounts of PTA expression in mTECs.</p><p id="P25">Importantly, these co-expressed gene clusters were not the same in the two genetically identical wild-type mice whose mTECs we analyzed by scRNAseq, which has important implications for the inter-individual variation in tolerance within a species. We had previously reported, on the basis of microarray profiling data, that Aire-induced transcripts show significantly greater inter-individual variability than do Aire-independent transcripts<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. The present data now provide a cellular explanation for this observation. One caveat of the present study, however, is that we cannot formally know if these co-regulated clusters persist and reflect constant inter-individual differences, or fluctuate and represent the state of the mTEC pool at the time of cell preparation for scRNAseq. However, since the expressed clusters of Aire-induced genes were not shared at the time of the experiment, the two analyzed mice exposed their immature thymocytes to slightly different sets of self-peptides, thereby generating T cell repertoires with slightly different autoreactivities to peripheral tissues. Such diversity may be favorable at the level of the species in ensuring a diversity of potential responses to pathogens without uniform holes in the repertoire, albeit at the price of susceptibility to autoimmune diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S11"><title>ONLINE METHODS</title><sec id="S12"><title>Mice</title><p id="P26">All mice were housed and bred under specific-pathogen&#x02013;free conditions at the Harvard Medical School Center for Animal Resources and Comparative Medicine (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol 2954). <italic>Aire</italic>-driven Igrp-GFP (<italic>Adig</italic>) mice <sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> were generously provided by Dr. Mark Anderson.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Thymic Epithelial Cell Isolation</title><p id="P27">Thymus tissue was dissociated in RPMI and digested with 0.5mg/mL collagenase/dispase (Roche) and 0.2mg/mL DNase (Sigma) in RPMI for 30 min with agitation every 10 minutes.

We shuffled the data and ran apcluster as before for 1000 permutations, storing cluster size and mean correlation per cluster for all permutations, using a custom script.</p><p id="P47">For cell clusters, affinity propagation using apcluster was used to determine cell groups based on the expression of Aire-induced genes located on chromosome 1. To determine whether the same cell groups were still highly similar based on the expression of Aire-induced genes from other chromosomes, we maintained the same order determined by our initial analysis using chromosome 1 genes and calculated cell-cell Pearson correlations based on Aire-induced genes from chromosomes 2 and 7.</p><p id="P48">We utilized t-SNE computation to visualize the cell-cell heterogeneity we observed in our <italic>Aire</italic> WT and KO MECs as a simple 2D representation. We calculated t-SNE components based on Pearson correlations of Aire-induced gene confidence probabilities using the tsne package <sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Gene cluster chromosomal distances</title><p id="P49">To determine what genomic distances the components of the gene clusters spanned, we matched each gene per cluster with its most highly correlated partner (using cor function in R). Based on the TSS positions of the genes, each gene was designated as interchromosomal (located on different chromosomes), intrachromosomal (same chromosome, but &#x0003e;1Mb away), or local (same chromosome and &#x0003c;1Mb away) based on the distance to that gene&#x02019;s most highly correlated partner.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS707171-supplement-1.doc" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e856" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="conflict"><p id="P50">The authors have no conflicting financial interests.</p></fn></fn-group><ack id="S22"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p id="P51">We thank Drs S.
