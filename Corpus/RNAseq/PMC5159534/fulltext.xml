The trypanosomatid coiled-coil NUP-1 protein is a lamina component functionally analogous to lamins, the major lamina proteins of metazoa. There is little evidence for shared ancestry, suggesting the presence of a distinct lamina system in trypanosomes. To find additional trypanosomatid lamina components we identified NUP-1 interacting proteins by affinity capture and mass-spectrometry. Multiple components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and a second coiled-coil protein, which we termed NUP-2, were found. NUP-2 has a punctate distribution at the nuclear periphery throughout the cell cycle and is in close proximity to NUP-1, the NPCs and telomeric chromosomal regions. RNAi-mediated silencing of NUP-2 leads to severe proliferation defects, gross alterations to nuclear structure, chromosomal organization and nuclear envelope architecture. Further, transcription is altered at telomere-proximal variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) expression sites (ESs), suggesting a role in controlling ES expression, although NUP-2 silencing does not increase VSG switching. Transcriptome analysis suggests specific alterations to Pol I-dependent transcription. NUP-1 is mislocalized in NUP-2 knockdown cells and <italic>vice versa</italic>, implying that NUP-1 and NUP-2 form a co-dependent network and identifying NUP-2 as a second trypanosomatid nuclear lamina component.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>15 December 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In metazoan cells the structural organization of the nucleus is maintained, at least in part, by the nuclear lamina, a stable protein meshwork at the inner face of the nuclear envelope (NE), comprised of a small family of coiled-coil intermediate filament lamins (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Mutation or alterations in lamin expression causes abnormalities to nuclear architecture, including irregular protrusions into the cytoplasm, termed nuclear blebs (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Lamins are required for nuclear pore complex (NPC) positioning, with defects leading to NPC clustering (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and/or the absence of NPCs from nuclear blebs (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The lamina also interacts with the cytoskeleton through the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton complex (LINC) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and is essential for mechano-signal transduction (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Lamins are also required for organization of the genome into transcriptionally active euchromatin and repressed heterochromatin (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), and influence transcriptional activity (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), interacting with a huge range of transcription factors (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). DNA replication is abolished at the initiation and elongation phases when the lamin network is disrupted (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), while lamin mutations lead to increased DNA damage (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). For these and other reasons, hereditary mutations in lamin genes that cause laminopathies (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) are of significant clinical interest.</p><p>Lamin orthologs are widely distributed across <italic>Metazoa</italic> and social amoeba, and recently have been described as having broad presence, as well as, being absent from several major lineages (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Yeast, which are evolutionarily closely related to animals, lack lamins and no lamina structure has been observed by electron microscopy (EM) (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Instead, several proteins appear to have assumed nucleoskeletal functions, e.g. Mlp 1 and 2, large (&#x0223c;200 kDa) coiled-coil nuclear basket proteins orthologous to the mammalian nuclear basket protein Tpr. Mlp1 and 2 maintain nuclear architecture and NPC organization and interact with Esc1 (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), which itself has roles in telomeric silencing (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), chromatin tethering (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and organizing the NPC basket (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). For example, over-expressing Esc1 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> leads to nuclear blebbing, suggesting a structural system is present in yeasts (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>In plants a nucleoskeletal structure is also present, but the molecular identity is incompletely defined (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Nuclear intermediate filament proteins are immunologically identified candidates that form 6&#x02013;12 nm, lamin-like filaments <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Another group of candidates are the nuclear matrix constituent proteins at the nuclear periphery. These disassemble and reassemble during mitosis similarly to lamins, affect nuclear size and shape and play a role in heterochromatin organization (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). These examples from yeast and plants suggest that alternative, non-lamin, molecular systems can construct a nuclear lamina.</p><p>A functional lamin analog, NUP-1, has been identified in the highly divergent trypanosomatids, which reside within the Excavata supergroup. NUP-1 is a large coiled-coil protein that forms a stable, fenestrated lattice at the edge of the nucleoplasm and expression of NUP-1 is essential for correct nuclear architecture, NPC arrangement, heterochromatin organization and the epigenetic regulation of gene expression (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). A high molecular weight and extended conformation within a relatively small nucleus means that NUP-1 may have roles entirely distinct from lamins, including chromosomal segregation (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). As trypanosomes branched early during eukaryotic evolution (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), they are especially valuable for comparative studies.</p><p>Many features are conserved between metazoan and trypanosome nuclei, including the NPC transport system (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and peripheral heterochromatin as a transcriptionally repressed portion of the genome (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The trypanosome nuclear genome is physically segregated into eleven pairs of conventional megabase chromosomes (MBCs) that harbor the majority of protein coding genes, up to five intermediate sized chromosomes (ICs) plus about 100 repetitive lower molecular weight minichromosomes (MCs). MBCs and MCs segregate during mitosis with differential kinetics, locations and possibly mechanisms (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Transcription of housekeeping genes is polycistronic, with directional gene clusters consisting of functionally unrelated genes (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), while mRNA levels are chiefly regulated post-transcriptionally.</p><p>A sophisticated mechanism for immune evasion operates in mammalian infective trypanosomes, involving expression of the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). VSG expression is monoallelic and exclusively <italic>via</italic> RNA Pol I transcription from telomere-proximal expression sites (ESs), present at both MBC and IC telomeric regions (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The surface coat is also developmentally regulated and, in early insect stages VSG is replaced by procyclin, another superabundant surface protein. Several proteins mediate repression of inactive VSG genes, including RAP1 (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), DAC3 (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) and NUP-1 (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), while the single active VSG gene is transcribed exclusively at the expression site body, an RNA polymerase I-rich nuclear subdomain distinct from the nucleolus (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p><p>To further characterize the trypanosome lamina, we investigated the NUP-1 interactome. Amongst many putative interactions, we identified the protein product of Tb927.9.6460, a large, substantially coiled-coil protein essential in the bloodstream form (BSF) (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). We designated Tb927.9.6460 as NUP-2 for <underline>nu</underline>clear <underline>p</underline>eripheral protein-2 and found that it is widely distributed amongst kinetoplastids but restricted to this lineage. NUP-2 has functions analogous to metazoan lamins, including maintenance of nuclear architecture, chromatin organization and regulation of gene expression and exhibits functional interactions with NUP-1. We therefore define NUP-2 as a second component of the trypanosomatid lamina.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Bioinformatics</title><p>BLAST searches were used to identify candidate orthologs in the following predicted proteomes: <italic>T. congolense, T. vivax, T. brucei gambiense, T.grayii, T. cruzi, L. major, L. braziliensis, L. mexicana, L. infantum</italic> and <italic>Bodo saltans</italic> were from geneDB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genedb.org/Homepage">www.genedb.org/Homepage</ext-link>) and TriTrypDB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tritrypdb.org/tritrypdb/">http://tritrypdb.org/tritrypdb/</ext-link>) while <italic>Phytomonas serpens</italic> data were from (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).

The extent of this alteration was revealed when the RNAseq reads were mapped and plotted onto the relevant region of the genome and were restricted to the procyclin polycistron only; significantly the number of mapped reads increased with duration of NUP-2 knockdown (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>, EP locus). Increased RNA abundance for example did not extend into Tb427.10.10280, a predicted microtubule-binding protein and the coding sequence adjacent to the Pol I-transcribed procyclin locus. At 24 h post-induction, up-regulation was restricted to genes within the procyclin locus as well as a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-finger protein ZC3H45 and a few hypothetical proteins. Whilst Zn finger proteins are important for control of RNA levels and potentially in differentiation, no connection between ZC3H45 and procyclin expression has been previously reported. The more extensive downregulated cohort contains a large number of ribosomal proteins, and significantly two nuclear proteins: Tb427.08.760 (Nopp44/46), and Tb427.08.730, a predicted nucleolar RNA-binding protein upregulated at 24 h. This suggests a possible impact in the nucleolus and/or translational machinery, and which may reflect a rather more extensive loss of nuclear integrity.</p><p>We also analyzed the predicted VSG repertoire by creating a concatenated VSG pseudocontig and mapping unique reads to this sequence subset (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, Supp data archive 1). Of over 2500 predicted VSGs in the 427 genome, very few were altered significantly (using a cutoff read depth of 0.2). TbVSG11 was extremely highly expressed, and represents the active VSG. Most of the affected VSGs also exhibit evidence for low-level transcription in control and parental cells, suggesting they are associated with an expression site, and consistent with a model where NUP-2 knockdown leads to derepression at telomeric sites, allowing increased VSG transcription; moreover, the number of reads mapped to these VSGs also increased with longer silencing times. Significantly, VSGs 397, 531, 653 and 1954 are present at metacyclic expression sites and account for four of the five known mVSGs in 427. Given the low level expression of most of these VSGs in the parental cells, these data suggest that NUP-2 knockdown has relieved the normal silencing associated with all but one of the expression-competent VSG genes and is also consistent with the impact on the VSG reporters detected by qRT-PCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-11"><title>NUP-2 loss does not lead to a detectable increase in VSG switch rate</title><p>The role of NUP-2 in silent <italic>VSG</italic> mRNA repression and impact on NUP-1 location suggested that loss of NUP-2 may also increase the <italic>VSG</italic> switching rate (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).

Lamins are broadly represented across the Eukaryotes but with alternate systems probably present in fungi, plants and trypanosomes (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). We recently described NUP-1, a very large, repetitive coiled-coil protein in trypanosomes, and suggested that NUP-1 acts as a lamin analog, representing the first component of a lamina in this lineage (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>By affinity isolation we identified at least one new lamina component, NUP-2, through its association with NUP-1. Reciprocal affinity isolation using NUP-2 confirmed this interaction together with connections to the NPC. These data also suggest that the interaction is mediated <italic>via</italic> TbNup110, a component of the nuclear basket, and which provides both a plausible anchoring mechanism for the lamina as well as a possible explanation for NPC clustering in NUP-1-depleted cells. NUP-2 is restricted to trypanosomatids and related taxa, with searches failing to identify an ortholog in <italic>N. gruberi</italic>, a member of the heterolobosid sister taxon within the <italic>Excavata</italic> supergroup. The coevolutionary distribution of NUP-1 and NUP-2 suggests that the trypanosome lamina configuration is complex and likely encompasses many proteins, but has origins distinct from lamina systems in non-kinetoplastid organisms. It is however, also an ancient system, being present at the root of the kinetoplastids, and hence is not associated with parasitism, antigenic variation or other specific features of kinetoplastid pathogenesis <italic>per se</italic> (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>).</p><p>Significantly, NUP-2 shares both a high molecular weight and coiled-coil architecture with NUP-1, though there is no evidence for sequence similarity. Unlike NUP-1, NUP-2 has no obvious repeat organization. If fully extended as a helix, the 1520 residue NUP-2 protein would be &#x0223c;230 nm long, more than 10% the diameter of the trypanosome nucleus. As NUP-1 may be &#x0223c;400 nm long (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), NUP-1 and NUP-2 can likely access much of the trypanosome nuclear volume, indicating the potential for long range influence on nuclear functions. The positioning of NUP-2 at the nuclear periphery throughout the cell cycle is reminiscent of the NUP-1 arrangement, but as these are both very large proteins our data do not presently inform on the location of the majority of the entire polypeptide, and hence the precise associations between NUP-1 and NUP-2 and the NPC remains to be characterized.</p><p>Silencing of NUP-2 affected nuclear morphology, faithful arrangement of chromatin at the nuclear periphery and epigenetic regulation. While these are all in common with NUP-1, the details of the phenotypes are quite distinct. Specifically, NUP-2 does not relocate within the nucleus to the same degree as NUP-1 at mitosis, NUP-2 depletion does not elicit a VSG switching event, nor does it result in NPC clustering, indicating that NUP-1 and NUP-2 have distinct roles, presumably the basis for their independent origins and retention throughout the kinetoplastids. The absence of a full VSG switch may, however, reflect a threshold effect, as NUP-2 knockdown does relieve the silencing at silent VSG ESs, and thus switching may be increased but remained below our detection limit. If this is the case, VSG switching is at least an order of magnitude less frequent than for NUP-1 knockdown.</p><p>NUP-1 and NUP-2 are clearly spatially distinct, with disparate localizations during mitosis, reminiscent of the A and B-type lamin networks in vertebrates (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). Significantly, the impact of depletion of NUP-1 or NUP-2 on the localization of the other does not correspond to nuclear deformity in precisely the same way: loss of NUP-1 led to NUP-2 disorganization in some non-blebbing as well as blebbing nuclei, whilst the reverse was not the case. This implies that NUP-1 could be the primary organizing component of the trypanosome nucleoskeleton, and the detection of substantially more NPC proteins in NUP-1 versus NUP-2 pullouts is consistent with this view. However, NUP-2 mis-arrangement was more common in blebbing nuclei in NUP-1 depleted cells, so that in both cases disorganization correlates to some extent with nuclear deformity.</p><p>The data here also further supports multiple levels of <italic>VSG</italic> regulation: NUP-2 is required for an apparently redundant level of regulation, i.e. suppressing RNA production from silent <italic>VSG</italic> ESs. However, loss of NUP-2 does not affect VSG protein switching overall, nor does it result in a transcriptional level for the <italic>VSG</italic> ES that approaches a fully active <italic>VSG</italic>, indicating the presence of additional regulatory mechanisms independent of NUP-2. Transcription of a small cohort of VSGs that are already transcribed at a very low level in uninduced cells suggests that NUP-2 impacts ES-associated VSGs and which is also supported by the presence of metacyclic ES-associated VSGs in this cohort. Significantly, the procyclin locus is also misregulated, with increased RNA levels associated exclusively with the procyclin and procyclin-associated genes. Finally, a role for NUP-2 in preventing DSBs may be linked to its function in <italic>VSG</italic> regulation (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), but this may also be a consequence of the loss of nuclear structural organization and mechanical stability of the envelope.</p><p>The identification of a second trypanosomal nucleoskeletal protein provides further evidence that a structure similar to the nuclear lamina is a common or even near-universal feature of eukaryotic cells, but the absence of detectable sequence similarity of either of the NUPs with lamins suggests that a nucleoskeleton subtending similar functions has arisen by convergent evolution in the highly divergent kinetoplastids and many other eukaryotic lineages (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Resolving the evolutionary history of the lamina is a clearly important aspect of understanding the origins of the nucleus and gene regulation mechanisms and adds further evolutionary divergence to events at the trypanosome nuclear periphery.</p></sec>
