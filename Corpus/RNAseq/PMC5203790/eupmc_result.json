    "Complete mitochondrion-related organelle (MRO) genomes of several subtypes (STs) of the unicellular stramenopile Blastocystis are presented. Complete conservation of gene content and synteny in gene order is observed across all MRO genomes, comprising 27 protein coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, and 16 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes. Despite the synteny, differences in the degree of overlap between genes were observed between subtypes and also between isolates within the same subtype. Other notable features include unusual base-pairing mismatches in the predicted secondary structures of some tRNAs. Intriguingly, the rps4 gene in some MRO genomes is missing a start codon and, based on phylogenetic relationships among STs, this loss has happened twice independently. One unidentified open reading frame (orf160) is present in all MRO genomes. However, with the exception of ST4 where the feature has been lost secondarily, orf160 contains variously one or two in-frame stop codons. The overall evidence suggests that both the orf160 and rps4 genes are functional in all STs, but how they are expressed remains unclear."
