Here we perform exome and transcriptome sequencing and SNP array assays to characterize 51 primary gastric tumours and 32 cell lines. Meta-analysis of exome data and previously published data sets reveals 24 significantly mutated genes in microsatellite stable (MSS) tumours and 16 in microsatellite instable (MSI) tumours. Over half the patients in our collection could potentially benefit from targeted therapies. We identify 55 splice site mutations accompanied by aberrant splicing products, in addition to mutation-independent differential isoform usage in tumours. ZAK kinase isoform TV1 is preferentially upregulated in gastric tumours and cell lines relative to normal samples. This pattern is also observed in colorectal, bladder and breast cancers. Overexpression of this particular isoform activates multiple cancer-related transcription factor reporters, while depletion of ZAK in gastric cell lines inhibits proliferation. These results reveal the spectrum of genomic and transcriptomic alterations in gastric cancer, and identify isoform-specific oncogenic properties of ZAK.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="i1" xlink:href="ncomms4830-i1.jpg"/>The genetic basis of gastric cancer, the fourth most common cancer worldwide, remains poorly understood.

While several chemotherapy options are available for treating gastric cancer patients, the only available targeted therapy choice is trastuzumab for ERBB2-positive patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. The heterogeneous nature of gastric cancer and the lack of targeted therapy options present an urgent need for detailed understanding of genomic alterations in gastric cancer, as such characterization can suggest therapeutic targets and patient stratification strategies. Previous exome sequencing of 15&#x02013;22 gastric tumours identified <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>ARID1A</italic> as frequently mutated genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, but there was only limited overlap of most significantly mutated genes between these studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, suggesting that more in-depth genomic characterization of gastric cancer is needed. In addition, transcriptome sequencing coupled with genomic analysis has not been performed for gastric cancer, thus it has been difficult to investigate how the reported mutations are related to transcriptional changes. Cancer-specific splicing isoforms, in particular, represent an important class of gene product for executing distinct biochemical functions. Cancer-specific splicing products can result from both differential expression and regulation of splicing factors and somatic mutations impacting critical splicing signals, but the prevalence of such events is not known. Regardless of the underlying mechanisms, the identification of cancer-specific splicing products could broaden the search space for cancer-causing proteins. This is especially relevant to gastric cancer, since currently known coding-region mutations can explain the genetic basis in only a small fraction of the patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p><p>Here we apply whole-exome sequencing, RNA sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array technology to characterize 51 human primary gastric tumour and adjacent normal samples, and 32 gastric cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1&#x02013;3</xref>). We examine the somatic mutation spectrum with respect to the microsatellite stability status, and aim to identify mutations or DNA copy number changes that might suggest clinical treatment options. We then focus on combining the RNA- and DNA-level information to identify both mutation-dependent aberrant splicing and mutation-independent splicing isoforms in gastric cancer. We further identify an isoform of the ZAK kinase that is specifically implicated in gastric cancer.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Viral and bacterial pathogens are known to play a role in the development of gastric cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Therefore, we first conducted transcriptome analysis to identify pathogen sequences in gastric samples. Notably, five of the tumours but none of the normal samples had Epstein-Barr virus (<italic>Human herpesvirus 4</italic>) sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 1 and 2</xref>), although the enrichment does not reach statistical significance due to small sample size (<italic>N</italic>=80, <italic>P</italic>=0.06, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test). Sequences of <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, known to be associated with gastritis and gastric cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, were found in most samples and not significantly enriched in tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>We identified a total of 27,732 somatic mutations in our exome data from 48 tumour-normal sample pairs. Forty per cent (11,112) were protein-altering (8,726 missense, 1,661 indels, 494 nonsense, 10 stop loss and 221 essential splice site. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4&#x02013;6</xref>). MSI is an aetiological source of somatic mutations and is observed in 10&#x02013;30% of gastric tumours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Consistent with previous findings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, the 10 MSI tumours in our collection harboured many more protein-altering mutations than the 38 MSS samples (median: 643 for MSI versus 83 for MSS, <italic>N</italic>=48, <italic>P</italic>=2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>, one-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The difference was especially pronounced for insertions and deletions, with MSI samples containing ~90 times more indels than MSS (median: 132 for MSI versus 1.5 for MSS, <italic>N</italic>=48, <italic>P</italic>=6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>, one-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Notably, all five tumour samples with Epstein-Barr virus RNAseq reads were MSS, and those samples had more mutations than other MSS samples (<italic>N</italic>=37, <italic>P</italic>=0.01, one-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test). In our data set, we identified 30 recurrent somatic mutations in tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 7</xref>). In total, 94 (1%) of the protein-altering somatic variations identified in this study have been reported in at least two unique samples in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4</xref>), suggesting that they may be driver mutations.</p><p>Analysis of the base-level mutation spectrum showed that C-to-A transversions were most common in MSS samples (42%), while C-to-T transitions predominated in MSI tumours (51%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). The increase in C-to-T transitions in MSI samples is consistent with the results from a DNA mismatch repair-deficient mouse model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Sequence analysis of the flanking nucleotides revealed an enrichment of G following the C-to-T transitions in both MSS and MSI samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>To identify significantly mutated genes, we combined our data with the previously published gastric exome data sets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, and applied the MuSiC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> algorithm to MSI and MSS samples separately. The meta-analysis of three data sets not only confirmed recurrent mutated genes highlighted in previous gastric exome studies, such as <italic>ARID1A</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> and <italic>FAT4</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>), but also greatly increased our statistical power to detect significantly mutated genes. <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>PIK3CA</italic> were the only genes found to be significant in both MSI and MSS samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 8</xref>). Other significantly mutated genes in MSS samples included some of the known cancer drivers, such as <italic>ARID1A</italic>, <italic>APC</italic>, <italic>CTNNB1</italic>, <italic>CDH1</italic> and <italic>SMAD4</italic>. In addition, we identified a few genes not previously implicated in gastric cancer: putative tumour suppressor proteins <italic>LDOC1</italic> (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) and <italic>PCDH9</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), and cell surface proteins <italic>ELTD1</italic>, <italic>GPC6</italic>, <italic>TLR4</italic> and <italic>PKHD1L1</italic>. In MSI samples, we identified 16 significantly mutated genes, including known oncogenes <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>ERBB2</italic>. Other potential novel driver candidates include <italic>ZBTB1</italic>, <italic>TRAPPC2L</italic>, as well as G protein-coupled receptors <italic>GPR39</italic>, <italic>GPR85</italic> and <italic>CHRM3.</italic> Notably, in our gastric cell line collection we also observed 17 protein-altering point mutations or indels in <italic>TP53</italic>, 14 in <italic>APC</italic>, 12 in <italic>FAT4</italic>, 8 in <italic>CDH1</italic> and 5 in <italic>PIK3CA</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 9 and 10</xref>).</p><p>We further examined genes affected by either protein-altering mutations or substantial copy number alterations in our tumour samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 11 and 12</xref>), and aggregated them into defined and curated pathways that are known to be involved in cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> by constructing a pathway aberration incidence matrix. Among the highly altered pathways were several known cancer pathways such as TP53, RTK, PI3K and cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Notably, alteration of the PI3K pathway is significantly associated with the MSI group (<italic>N</italic>=43, Benjamini&#x02013;Hochberg-adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value=0.007, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test): 9/10 MSI samples have alterations in the pathway, compared with only 8/33 for MSS samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). In addition, very few copy number changes contributed to pathway alterations in the MSI samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>), confirming that point mutations drive oncogenic deregulation in these samples.</p><p>Currently, the only approved targeted therapy for gastric cancer is trastuzumab for <italic>ERBB2</italic>-positive tumours. Several others in clinical trials or approved for other indications include EGFR inhibitors, MEK inhibitors for <italic>KRAS</italic>-mutant tumours, PIK3CA and MET inhibitors (phase III, gastric cancer). When we examined alterations in these genes, we identified six samples with <italic>ERBB2</italic> amplification and five harbouring <italic>MET</italic> amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In addition, we found several known activating mutations, including two <italic>KRAS</italic>-activating mutations, 8 <italic>PIK3CA</italic>-activating mutations and one <italic>EGFR</italic>-activating mutation (out of 4 <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations in our samples). Collectively, more than half of the patients in our sample set harbour activating alterations in targetable genes and would potentially benefit from therapies that are approved or in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Furthermore, we identified six patients with <italic>ERBB2</italic> point mutations including a recurrent R678Q change (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4</xref>). None of these match with the activating ERBB2 point mutations recently identified in breast tumours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, so it remains unclear whether gastric cancer patients with ERBB2 mutations would benefit from the trastuzumab treatment.</p><p>The combined exome and RNAseq data enable global analysis of mutations potentially affecting mRNA splicing. We identified 139 mutations affecting essential splice donor or acceptor sites of genes that have RNA splice junction reads spanning the splice site mutations. Among those mutations, 80 had spanning junctions that were not consistent with annotated exon models. By further excluding junctions present in any normal gastric tissue samples, we obtained a list of 55 mutations that are associated with tumour-specific aberrant splice junctions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 13</xref>). Thus, about 40% (55/139) of essential splice site mutations showed evidence of altered splicing. Since these mutations were heterozygous, we typically observed both known and aberrant splice junctions spanning the same mutation locus; the number of reads supporting normal junctions was much higher than those supporting aberrant junctions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>), possibly due to nonsense-mediated decay of the aberrant transcripts. Several of the 55 genes with evidence of aberrant splicing were known cancer-related genes including <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>MAP2K4 (JNKK) and CHD8</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 13</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Mutations in <italic>MAP2K4</italic> were previously found in a variety of human malignancies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, including gastric cancer cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). We found 4 mutations in <italic>MAP2K4</italic> in our tumour collection, including one missense, two splice site and one frameshift. In tumour sample SAM94128, where we identified a mutation affecting the AG splice acceptor sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>), the RNAseq data showed eight reads supporting the expression of a novel isoform of <italic>MAP2K4</italic> that skips exon 8, leading to an in-frame deletion of 26 residues, thereby disrupting the essential protein kinase domain. The loss-of-function nature of the mutation is consistent with the suggested tumour suppressor role of <italic>MAP2K4</italic> (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>).</p><p>We performed differential expression analysis on the transcriptome sequencing data. The expression level and variability of smoothelin (a smooth muscle expression marker (SMTN)) was significantly higher in our normal gastric tissue samples than gastric tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>, left panel), indicating varying degree of smooth muscle contamination in the normal tissues. After including the SMTN term in our statistical model to account for the contamination effect, we found 165 upregulated and 256 downregulated genes in tumours using a stringent cutoff (fold change &#x0003e;3 and Benjamini&#x02013;Hochberg adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 14</xref>). These include many canonical markers for gastric cancer like serum markers MUC5AC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, Reprimo<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and Pepsinogen C<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. A significant proportion of the 165 genes with higher expression in tumours are involved in cell cycle (<italic>P</italic>=10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>), while digestion, transmembrane transport and ion transport functions were downregulated. We also found 22 gene fusions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 15</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>), but detailed analysis of these fusions did not support a driver role for any of them.</p><p>The transcriptome data also allowed us to identify splice isoforms related to cancer. Isoform usage was quantified by tallying the reads uniquely assignable to a particular isoform, and then comparing those to reads mapped to the entire gene (that is, all known isoforms). The significance of differential isoform usage was assessed by a generalized mixed-effect regression model using negative binomial as the underlying model. After correcting for the smooth muscle contamination, we identified 170 genes with differential isoform usage between tumours and paired normal tissue. These included cancer-related genes such as <italic>ZAK</italic>, <italic>KRAS</italic>, <italic>MCM7</italic>, <italic>ELK4</italic> and <italic>CCND3</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 16</xref>). We focused our attention on <italic>ZAK</italic> (sterile alpha motif and leucine zipper containing kinase AZK, also known as <italic>MLTK</italic>) because it exhibited one of the smallest <italic>P</italic>-values among the cancer-related kinases, a major cancer target class. <italic>ZAK</italic> is a component of stress-activated signal transduction cascade, which has been implicated in several pathways related to cancer, such as apoptosis, cell cycle and neoplastic cell transformation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. <italic>ZAK</italic> has two major transcript variants TV1 and TV2. Protein products of TV1 (MLTK-&#x003b1;) and TV2 (MLTK-&#x003b2;) share the same N terminus that contains a kinase domain. TV1 has a longer C-terminal region containing a sterile alpha motif; while TV2 has a conserved unique C-terminal extension of 124 amino acids including an extended acidic patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Previous studies suggest that the two isoforms of ZAK may have distinct biological functions, with TV1 being specifically implicated in histone phosphorylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> and disruption of actin stress fibres<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>.</p><p>We observed significant increase in the fraction of ZAK TV1, indicating preferential upregulation of TV1 in tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>, left panel, <italic>P</italic>=1.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup>, see Methods for detailed description of statistical analysis). The quantification of isoform fractions from our RNAseq data was supported by quantitative PCR measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). We also used Cufflinks as an alternative method for transcript isoform quantification and confirmed that TV1 expression was higher in the tumours than in the normals, while TV2 expression remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref>). To analyse isoform-specific ZAK expression <italic>in situ</italic>, we performed <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization using probes specific to the different ZAK isoforms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). Consistent with the transcriptomic analysis, ZAK TV1 expression was found upregulated in gastric cancer, while TV2 was more ubiquitously expressed in gastric tumour cells as well as normal mucosa and smooth muscle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). The preferential upregulation of ZAK TV1 is seen in several other cancers. Analysis of colorectal cancer RNAseq data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> showed that the fraction of TV1 increased by about threefold (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;20</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>, right panel), and <italic>ZAK</italic> was reported to be one of the top candidate genes to modulate &#x003b2;-catenin-dependent transcription and regulate colon cancer cell proliferation in two loss-of-function screens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNAseq data also showed significantly higher <italic>ZAK</italic> TV1 usage in bladder and breast cancer relative to corresponding normal samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). We only detected one non-synonymous mutation and one frameshift insertion in ZAK in our tumour samples and one additional point mutation in the cell lines, suggesting that expression of ZAK isoforms in these samples may be regulated by trans-acting splice factors instead of mutations in the <italic>ZAK</italic> gene itself.</p><p>To validate our findings from RNAseq and characterize ZAK activity in gastric cancer, we tested <italic>ZAK</italic> function in gastric cancer cell lines. <italic>ZAK</italic> TV1 protein was upregulated in gastric tumours and cell lines relative to normal stomach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Overexpression of TV1, but not of TV2, induced robust transcriptional activation of several cancer-related signalling genes such as <italic>AP1</italic> and <italic>NFkB</italic>, known to be modulated by <italic>ZAK</italic> activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Depletion of <italic>ZAK</italic> using two independent short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) led to significant growth inhibition in gastric cell lines that express high levels of <italic>ZAK</italic> TV1 and variable levels of TV2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). These observations suggest an important role for ZAK TV1 in activating cancer signalling pathways and gastric cancer growth.</p><p>This study represents the largest integrated genomic and transcriptomic analysis of gastric cancer to date. Our meta-analysis of three gastric exome data sets provides the most comprehensive characterization of the recurrently mutated genes in gastric cancer. We also identified 170 genes with distinct isoform usage patterns between tumour and normal samples. In particular, the <italic>ZAK</italic> TV1 isoform is preferentially upregulated in gastric tumours and cell lines, resulting in significantly higher TV1 fraction. This pattern was seen in several other cancer types, suggesting a widespread association of <italic>ZAK</italic> TV1 with tumorigenesis. Recently, <italic>ZAK</italic> TV1, but not TV2, has been shown to stimulate anchorage-independent colony growth and xenograft tumour formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, further supporting the oncogenic role of this particular isoform. These cancer-specific isoforms can dramatically broaden opportunities in cancer classification and tumour-specific anti-cancer targets.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Sample preparation</title><p>We characterized primary tissue samples from 51 gastric cancer patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>) and 32 gastric cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>).

To more stringently define aberrant splice junctions, we checked the splice junction reads against transcript models from both RefSeq and UCSC, and only those junctions inconsistent with both sources were called aberrant.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Differential isoform usage between cancer and normal samples</title><p>Total read counts for each gene, as well as counts of reads that can be uniquely assigned to a particular isoform, were obtained from the BAM files. Differential isoform usage was assessed on isoforms with sufficiently high number of counts using a negative binomial regression model. Specifically, for each gene we calculated the 75th percentile of gene read counts in tumour samples and, separately, in normal samples. Any gene with the 75th percentile below 20 in either set of samples were excluded from further analysis. Similarly, for each isoform we calculated 75th percentile of isoform-specific read counts in two sets of samples and excluded isoforms with 75th percentile below 10. We then fit a generalized mixed-effect negative binomial regression model to isoform-specific read counts, using tumour/normal status (fixed effect) and patient identifier (random effect) as main covariates and gene-level read counts as offset. Since we observed variable smooth muscle inclusion in our normal tissue samples, we also included the expression of smoothelin (SMTN) in our model to correct for the extent of the smooth muscle inclusion. The model was fit using the &#x02018;glmer.nb&#x02019; function in the &#x02018;lme4&#x02019; R package<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> independently for each isoform as follows: glmer.nb(Isoform.ct~TumorStatus+(1|Patient)+log(SMTN)+offset(log(Gene.ct))). The reported <italic>P</italic>-values corresponding to TumorStatus coefficient estimates for each isoform were adjusted using Bonferroni correction. Transcript isoforms with significantly differential isoform usage (adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c;0.1 and fold change &#x0003e;1.5) were selected for further investigation. To visualize the differential isoform usage, we fit a linear model lm(log2(Isoform.ct/Gene.ct)~log(SMTN)), and used the residuals of the model as the &#x02018;adjusted isoform fraction&#x02019; for individual samples. To further narrow down the list of candidate genes for experimental validation, we focused on cancer-related genes.

ZAK TV1 was detected with Bethyl &#x003b1;-ZAK antibody and TV2 with Sigma &#x003b1;-ZAK antibody (see Methods). (<bold>b</bold>) ZAK TV1, but not TV2, can stimulate multiple transcriptional programs related to cancer pathways. Transcription reporter assay in 293 cells transfected with empty vector, TV1 or TV2 along with the indicated firefly luciferase reporter construct (AP1, NFkB and TCF/LEF). Activity is normalized to cell number using CellTiter-Glo. Immunoblot shows relative <italic>ZAK</italic> isoform expression from 293 cells transfected with the indicated construct. ZAK was detected with Sigma &#x003b1;-ZAK antibody. (<bold>c</bold>) Depletion of <italic>ZAK</italic> from gastric cancer cell lines inhibits cell growth. In cell lines where ZAK knockdown led to reduced viability, there was consistently high TV1 expression, while TV2 expression was marginal and variable (for example, IM-95m cell line, see for example, panel <bold>a</bold>). Cell viability analysis was carried out 6 days after infection of gastric cancer cell lines with independent <italic>ZAK</italic> shRNAs. Cell number is normalized to shNTC-infected cells. Immunoblot indicates the level of ZAK-TV1 depletion 4 days after infection. ZAK was detected with Bethyl &#x003b1;-ZAK antibody.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ncomms4830-f4"/></fig></floats-group></article>
