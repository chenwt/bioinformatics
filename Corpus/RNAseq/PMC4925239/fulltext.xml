Here, we show that constitutively active Shh signaling expanded bRGs and IPCs and induced folding in the otherwise smooth mouse neocortex, whereas the loss of Shh signaling decreased the number of bRGs and IPCs and the size of the neocortex. SHH signaling was strongly active in the human fetal neocortex but not in the mouse embryonic neocortex, and blocking SHH signaling in human cerebral organoids decreased the number of bRGs. Mechanistically, Shh signaling increased the initial generation and self-renewal of bRGs as well as increasing IPC proliferation. Thus, robust SHH signaling in the human fetal neocortex may contribute to bRG and IPC expansion and neocortical growth and folding.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">The neocortex, a six-layered structure covering mammalian brains, computes high-order sensory, motor, and cognitive processes. During evolution, the neocortex has expanded dramatically and folded in certain species. The immense expansion of the neocortex in humans has made possible the complex behavior, cognition, and intellect that are quintessential to humans. Neocortical expansion and folding reflect an increase in the number of neurons, especially upper-layer neurons, and are thus dependent on the number and proliferative capacity of neural progenitors<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. The primary neural progenitors are radial glia (RGs), whose cell bodies reside in the ventricular zone (VZ) at the apical side of the developing brain and are hence called ventricular RGs (vRGs) or apical RGs (aRGs). The aRGs generate neurons directly or via intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) that occupy the subventricular zone (SVZ). Newborn neurons migrate along radial processes of RGs through the intermediate zone (IZ) to the cortical plate (CP) to form neuronal layers.</p><p id="P3">A neurogenic area basal to the archetypal SVZ was recently identified in the brains of monkeys and humans<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. This area is called the outer SVZ (oSVZ) and is thought to be responsible for the expansion of the neocortex, especially the upper-layer neurons, in primates<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. The primary neural progenitors in the oSVZ are outer RGs (oRGs, also called basal RGs [bRGs]) that are detached from the ventricle but maintain some aRG features, including radial processes<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. bRGs are also present in other species including the mouse<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>; however, bRGs are greatly expanded in species with large and folded brains, especially humans, and their expansion is thought to underlie the complexity of the human brain<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Yet, little is known about the molecular pathways that lead to the expansion of bRGs and to neocortical growth and folding.</p><p id="P4">Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling regulates brain development from early patterning to adult neurogenesis. Defective SHH signaling causes holoprosencephaly, a defect in the separation of the brain hemispheres that mostly results from abnormal patterning. Notably, patients with mild holoprosencephaly often have smaller-than-normal brains at birth (microcephaly)<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, suggesting that mechanisms affecting early patterning also affect neurogenesis and brain size.

In mice, defective Shh signaling causes defective proliferation of IPCs and microcephaly<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>; however, the role of SHH signaling in human neocortical development beyond patterning is unknown.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="S1"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Elevated Shh signaling induces cortical growth and folding</title><p id="P5">To study the role of Shh signaling in neocortical development without affecting early patterning, we expressed a constitutively active Smoothened (SmoM2), an activator of Shh signaling, in aRGs and their progenies from embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) by using a <italic>GFAP</italic> promoter&#x02013;driven Cre. <italic>GFAP::Cre; SmoM2<sup>fl/+</sup></italic> mice (<italic>SmoM2</italic> mutants) had cortices larger than those of controls (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).

The density of deep-layer neurons expressing Tbr1 (Tbr1<sup>+</sup>) was slightly decreased in <italic>SmoM2</italic> mutants, but Satb2<sup>+</sup> upper-layer (layer II and III) neurons in the cingulate and medial cortices were denser in <italic>SmoM2</italic> mutants than in controls (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c,e</xref>). Notably, white matter extended into the induced gyri (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), suggesting that the upper-layer neurons in the folded area had axonal projections. The Satb2<sup>+</sup> neuronal density was unchanged in the laterally located sensory cortex (data not shown), which showed no folding. These results suggest that increased Satb2<sup>+</sup> upper-layer neurons induce folding in the cingulate cortex.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Elevated Shh signaling expands bRGs and IPCs</title><p id="P6">To understand upper-layer neuronal expansion, we examined neural progenitors at E16.5, when mostly upper-layer neurons are generated.

In controls, Tbr2<sup>+</sup> cells were spread to the IZ, where newborn neurons maintain Tbr2<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Although the selective expansion of IPCs alone can cause the cortex to grow even larger than in <italic>SmoM2</italic> mutants, such selective expansion does not induce denser upper layers or folding in mice<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, suggesting that additional mechanisms are involved in folding.</p><p id="P7">The density of Pax6<sup>+</sup> Tbr2<sup>&#x02212;</sup> aRGs was unchanged in <italic>SmoM2</italic> mutants; however, Pax6<sup>+</sup> Tbr2<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells were significantly increased outside the VZ in the <italic>SmoM2</italic> cortex (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,b</xref>).

The Pax6<sup>+</sup> Tbr2<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells outside the VZ also expressed Sox2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>), a transcription factor expressed by RGs. The expression pattern (Pax6<sup>+</sup> Sox2<sup>+</sup> Tbr2<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) and location of these cells were reminiscent of those of bRGs. Indeed, most Sox2<sup>+</sup> cells outside the VZ had processes that were positive for the RG markers RC2 and Glast, confirming their bRG identity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). In <italic>SmoM2</italic> mutants, bRGs showed diverse morphology, with basal, apical, or bipolar processes being oriented radially or tangentially, similar to bRGs in monkeys and ferrets<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, and some had a growth cone&#x02013;like structure, as in human and ferret bRGs<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To test whether SmoM2 increased bRGs cell-autonomously, we induced sparse recombination and labeled the recombined cells with tdTomato in <italic>GFAP::CreER; SmoM2<sup>fl/+</sup>; tdTomato<sup>fl/+</sup></italic> mice by injecting tamoxifen at E13.5 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d,e</xref>).

Thus, SmoM2 cell-autonomously increased bRGs that resembled those in gyrencephalic species.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Elevated Shh signaling keeps bRGs and IPCs in the cell cycle</title><p id="P9">Manipulating <italic>Trnp1</italic>, PDGFD signaling, or <italic>ARHGAP11B</italic> increases bRGs in mice via delamination of aRGs<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. However, SmoM2 increased the number of bRGs without decreasing that of aRGs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>), similar to the initial bRG expansion in humans<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Thus, SmoM2 may have expanded bRGs by increasing their self-renewal, production, or both. To test if SmoM2 increased self-renewal, we investigated the fraction of self-renewed bRGs remaining in the cell cycle 24 h after the previous S phase by injecting BrdU at E15.5 and EdU at E16.5 1.5 h before collecting embryos (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). At E16.5, the proliferation of the IPCs (EdU<sup>+</sup>) but not that of the aRGs and bRGs, was increased in <italic>SmoM2</italic> mutants; however, the proportions of bRGs and IPCs remaining in the cell cycle 24 h after the previous S phase (EdU<sup>+</sup> BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells) were significantly higher in <italic>SmoM2</italic> mutants than in controls (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). bRGs migrate basally before dividing; thus the more they divide and self-renew, the further they move from the ventricular surface<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Consistent with the increase in BrdU<sup>+</sup> EdU<sup>+</sup> bRGs, bRGs distributed more basally in <italic>SmoM2</italic> mutants than in controls (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>), indicating increased self-renewal of bRGs in <italic>SmoM2</italic> mutants.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Elevated Shh signaling shifts aRG division to produce bRGs</title><p id="P10">Multiple types of bRGs and IPCs, including apical IPCs, are all descendants of aRGs<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Therefore, we investigated whether aRGs produced more bRGs in <italic>SmoM2</italic> mutants. To compare the direct progenies of aRGs and exclude IPCs and neurons generated from IPCs, we compared cells in the VZ but excluded the SVZ, where IPCs were actively proliferating (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>). At E15.5, RGs constituted 49% of the cells in the control VZs and 64% of the cells in the <italic>SmoM2</italic> VZs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d,e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). The percentage of IPCs (Tbr2<sup>+</sup> Pax6<sup>+ or &#x02212;</sup>) and the number of neurons (TuJ1<sup>+</sup>) were significantly reduced in <italic>SmoM2</italic> VZs. Thus, SmoM2-expressing aRGs produced more RGs at the expense of IPCs and neurons, which may explain the decrease in Tbr1<sup>+</sup> neurons (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Despite this, aRGs were not increased at E16.5 in <italic>SmoM2</italic> mutants, whereas bRGs were markedly increased (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>), suggesting that the additional RGs in the mutant VZ at E15.5 became bRGs.</p><p id="P11">To investigate the mechanism by which the cell composition changed in the <italic>SmoM2</italic> VZ, we investigated the division angles of aRGs. aRGs dividing on an axis horizontal to the ventricular surface (horizontal division) mostly produce neurons or IPCs, whereas those dividing vertically or obliquely produce bRGs<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Vertical and oblique divisions were remarkably increased in <italic>SmoM2</italic> mutants, as compared to controls (42% vs. 15%) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f,g</xref>). Furthermore, RGs dividing in the VZ but away from the ventricular surface were significantly increased in <italic>SmoM2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b&#x02013;d</xref>). RGs dividing non-apically in the VZ produce bRGs<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and may also represent bRGs in transit to the SVZ after generation at the ventricular surface; bRGs are also found in the inner SVZ and VZ<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Thus, SmoM2 increased the number of bRGs by shifting aRG division toward bRG production. SmoM2 also greatly increased the number of proliferating IPCs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b,d</xref>), resulting in their expansion in the SVZ despite their decreased production from aRGs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). These results suggest that the expansion of bRGs through increased production and self-renewal, along with an increased number of IPCs, led to neocortical expansion and folding in <italic>SmoM2</italic> mutants.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Fate analysis of progenies from aRGs expressing SMOM2</title><p id="P12">To confirm that SmoM2 shifted aRG division toward bRG production at the expense of IPCs and neurons, we transduced aRGs sparsely with retroviruses expressing <italic>GFP</italic> either alone or with <italic>SMOM2</italic> (a constitutively active human <italic>SMO</italic>) at E13.5 and examined the fates of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in transduced clones that had at least two cells. At E15, 46% of clones expressing GFP alone contained only IPCs and/or neurons without RGs (IPC/N clones), a further 46% contained one aRG with IPC/N (aRG + IPC/N), and 8% contained two aRGs with or without IPC/N (2aRGs + IPC/N) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Similar to what is observed in <italic>SmoM2</italic> mutants (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>), <italic>SMOM2</italic> transduction increased clones containing aRGs to 67% (56% aRG+IPC/N and 11% 2aRG+IPC/N) at the expense of IPC/N clones (33%). Remarkably, by E16, the proportion of aRG-containing clones decreased to the control level (47%), concomitant with a marked increase in the proportion of bRG-containing clones to 23%, which was much higher than that observed in control clones (5%). At E16, among clones containing IPCs, the number of IPCs per clone was higher in <italic>SMOM2</italic>-transduced clones than in control clones (1.18 vs. 1.36, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0158, by Mann Whitney test, Sum of ranks = 4390, 1938, Mann-Whitney U = 1118). Together with the results of <italic>SmoM2</italic> mutant analyses, these results indicate that elevated Shh signaling shifts aRG division toward bRG production at the expense of IPCs and neurons and increases the proliferative divisions of IPCs.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>SmoM2 induces folding outside the cingulate cortex</title><p id="P13">In <italic>SmoM2</italic> mutants, folding was present in only the cingulate cortex.

Thus, Shh signaling offset the decreased generation of IPCs by promoting their proliferative divisions, leading to their great expansion in the SVZ. Similar to bRG expansion, the proliferative IPC division is characteristic of primates<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>; in rodents, IPCs mainly divide to form two neurons<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>.

Previously, we showed that the loss of primary cilia resulted in no apparent defects in cortical development<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. This seeming discrepancy is probably due to the fact that the loss of cilia results in the loss of both Gli activators and repressors, whereas the loss of Smo causes the loss of Gli activators and an increase in Gli repressors, leading to severer phenotypes than those resulting from the loss of cilia<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. In the developing mouse neocortex, where Shh signaling activity is relatively weak, the loss of Gli activators in cilia mutants may be compensated for by the concomitant loss of Gli repressors. In contrast, the loss of Smo will result in the loss of activators and an increase in repressors, resulting in a pronounced decrease in signaling activity and in defective corticogenesis. We found strong SHH signaling activity in the human fetal cortex; thus, the loss of cilia and the resulting loss of Gli activators may strongly affect human corticogenesis. Notably, many of the genes mutated in congenital microcephaly are essential for the formation and function of centrioles and their associated structures including cilia<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>.

For VZ/SVZ analyses, we only imaged the VZ/SVZs that were (1) not obliquely cut, (2) close to the edges of the organoids to ensure adequate drug access, (3) well separated from the neighboring VZ/SVZ, and (4) medial parts of the VZ/SVZ structures in serial sections.</p><p id="P39">Quantification of spindle orientations: To examine the division angles of vRGs, the cells were stained for P-Vim/PH3/DAPI and examined under 40&#x000d7; or 63&#x000d7; oil objectives. Only cells displaying clear mitotic figures and clear separation of the chromosomes by cytoplasm as revealed by P-Vim staining were included in the analysis. The angles of division were measured using ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title><italic>In utero</italic> intraventricular injection and clonal analysis</title><p id="P40">The plasmid vectors pBABE-GFP (originally a gift from William Hahn [Addgene plasmid # 10668]) and pBABE-SMOM2 were gifts from M.E.

Replication-incompetent retroviruses were produced from 293T packaging cell lines. For <italic>in utero</italic> intraventricular injection, timed pregnant CD1 females (Charles River Laboratories) of gestation stage E13 were used. By using a Nanoject II Auto-Nanoliter injector (Drummond Scientific), approximately 0.5&#x02013;0.7 &#x003bc;L of retroviral solution premixed with 1% Fast Green dye was delivered into the lateral ventricles of the embryonic brains via a glass pipette that was pre-beveled on a microgrinder (EG 401, NARISHIGE Groups) and had an opening of 2 to 3 &#x003bc;m. Glass pipette needles used for microinjection were pulled from glass capillaries (3.5&#x02033; Drummond 3-000-203-G/X, Drummond Scientific) by a P30 micropipette puller (Sutter instrument company). Dams were harvested 48 h (E15) or 72 h (E16) post injection. Coronal sections of 50 &#x003bc;m were collected and stained for GFP, Pax6, and Tbr2. Clones that were clearly separated from each other and were entirely included in the 50-&#x003bc;m thickness were imaged on the confocal microscope using Z-stacks at step-sizes of 1 &#x003bc;m.

Clones with at least 2 cells were used for analyses. The clones were classified as follows: IPC/N clones that contained IPCs and/or neurons but not RGs; aRG+IPC/N clones with one aRG and IPC/N; 2aRG+IPC/N clones with two aRGs with or without IPC/N; and bRG clones with at least one bRG and other cell types.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</title><p id="P41">To measure the volume of the neocortex, MRI was performed using a 7-T ClinScan animal MRI scanner (Bruker BioSpin MRI GmbH) equipped with a BGA-12S gradient insert and a 2-channel phased-array surface coil.

Given the diverse sources, species, and methods of measurement, only the internally controlled relative expression could reasonably be compared.
