When such lineages form discrete hybrid zones, patterns of differential introgression allow direct estimates of which genome regions are likely involved in speciation and local adaptation. Here we use a backcross experimental design to construct a genetic linkage map for the field crickets <italic>Gryllus firmus</italic> and <italic>Gryllus pennsylvanicus</italic>, which interact in a well-characterized hybrid zone in eastern North America. We demonstrate that loci with major allele frequency differences between allopatric populations are not randomly distributed across the genome. Instead, most are either X-linked or map to a few small autosomal regions. Furthermore, the subset of those highly differentiated markers that exhibit restricted introgression across the cricket hybrid zone are also concentrated on the X chromosome (39 of 50 loci) and in a single 7-cM region of one autosome. Although the accumulation on the sex chromosome of genes responsible for postzygotic barriers is a well-known phenomenon, less attention has been given to the genomic distribution of genes responsible for prezygotic barriers. We discuss the implications of our results for speciation, both in the context of the role of sex chromosomes and also with respect to the likely causes of heterogeneous genomic divergence. Although we do not yet have direct evidence for the accumulation of ecological, behavioral, or fertilization prezygotic barrier genes on the X chromosome, faster-X evolution could make these barriers more likely to be X-linked.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>genetic map</kwd><kwd>mapping family</kwd><kwd>backcross</kwd><kwd>sex chromosome</kwd><kwd>speciation</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Characterizing the genomic architecture of barriers to gene exchange is an essential step in understanding speciation. It is well established that because of independent assortment and recombination in sexually reproducing organisms, genome regions will have unique evolutionary histories (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Hudson 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Nichols 2001</xref>). Furthermore, if barriers to gene exchange are a result of evolutionary forces acting on individual genes (genic view of speciation) (<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Wu 2001</xref>), then in species that still exchange genes, alleles that are neutral or globally advantageous will be able to cross species boundaries, whereas alleles in genome regions under divergent selection or responsible for reproductive isolation will not. The result is that species boundaries are semipermeable (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Barton and Hewitt 1981</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Harrison 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Wu 2001</xref>). In some instances only a few loci may be essential for the maintenance of species differences (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Machado and Hey 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Dopman <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Barr and Fishman 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Nosil and Schluter 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Dasmahapatra <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>), and it has been suggested that, in the face of gene flow, these loci might act as &#x0201c;divergence centers&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Charlesworth <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>), leading to the buildup of additional divergence because of reduced local recombination rates (divergence hitchhiking). With time this process is expected to lead to a clustering of loci contributing to differentiation (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Charlesworth <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Strasburg <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>)</p><p>Genome scans have identified divergent genomic regions in many recently diverged, hybridizing species (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Nosil <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Carneiro <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Nadeau <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>), a pattern that has been interpreted as islands of restricted introgression in a background of relatively free gene exchange [&#x0201c;genomic islands of speciation&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Turner <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>) or &#x0201c;genomic islands of differentiation&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Harr 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Nosil <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>)]. Recently, however, this interpretation has been challenged (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Nachman and Payseur 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cruickshank and Hahn 2014</xref>) because the same pattern of heterogeneous genomic divergence could occur in the complete absence of gene flow. In this scenario, many genome regions would be characterized by shared ancestral polymorphism, but other (differentiated) regions would have been subject to local selective sweeps.</p><p>By definition, hybrid zones are regions where hybridization and introgression can occur. Therefore, hybrid zones are natural experiments in which genomes are recombined and subjected to selection over many generations (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hewitt 1988</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Harrison 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Payseur 2010</xref>). Thus, for each gene, the nature and strength of selection, the role in reproductive isolation and local adaptation, and linkage to other genes will determine the extent of introgression. Although variation in the extent of introgression among loci has been well documented (reviewed in <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Harrison and Larson 2014</xref>), patterns of introgression have been placed in the context of a genetic or physical map in relatively few cases (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Rieseberg <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Payseur <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Noor <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Janousek <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Sankararaman <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here we construct a genetic linkage map to provide the framework for evaluating patterns of differential introgression across the hybrid zone between the field crickets <italic>Gryllus firmus</italic> and <italic>Gryllus pennsylvanicus</italic>. This species pair is recently diverged (&#x0223c;200,000 years) (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Broughton and Harrison 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Maroja <italic>et al.</italic> 2009a</xref>), and multiple barriers to gene exchange have been well characterized. These barriers include: (1) habitat isolation (<italic>G. firmus</italic> lives in sandy soils and <italic>G. pennsylvanicus</italic> lives in loamy soils) (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Rand and Harrison 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Ross and Harrison 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Ross and Harrison 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Larson <italic>et al.</italic> 2013b</xref>); (2) temporal isolation (<italic>G. firmus</italic> matures later in the summer in parts of the hybrid zone) (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Harrison 1985</xref>); (3) behavioral and cuticular hydrocarbon differences that result in assortative mating (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Maroja <italic>et al.</italic> 2009b</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>); and (4) a postmating prezygotic barrier in which <italic>G. pennsylvanicus</italic> sperm are unable to fertilize <italic>G. firmus</italic> eggs (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Harrison 1983</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Larson <italic>et al.</italic> 2012b</xref>). The last barrier results in a unidirectional reproductive incompatibility (only <italic>G. pennsylvanicus</italic> females can produce F1 hybrids). Although these barriers substantially reduce gene flow between the two species, hybridization, and introgression are ongoing. F1 hybrids are rare, but many sites within the hybrid zone include crickets that represent multi-generation backcrosses; using crickets from allopatric populations as reference, we have argued that shared ancestral polymorphism cannot explain observed patterns (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Harrison and Bogdanowicz 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Larson <italic>et al.</italic> 2013a</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Two locations within the hybrid zone (Connecticut and Pennsylvania) have been characterized for differential introgression (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Larson <italic>et al.</italic> 2013a</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). A total of 110 SNP markers were analyzed at both locations and an additional 15 were analyzed only in the Pennsylvania hybrid zone. These markers were developed from comparison of male accessory gland transcriptomes (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Andres <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>) and were chosen because they represent SNPs that exhibit nearly fixed differences between allopatric populations of the two cricket species. Patterns of introgression were consistent between locations; 50 of the 110 markers exhibited reduced introgression. The repeatability of this pattern suggests that selection is acting to reduce introgression, and thus these regions are likely to include genes contributing to reproductive isolation or local adaptation. Here we demonstrate that the loci with major allele frequency differences between allopatric populations are not randomly distributed across the genome. Instead, most are either X-linked or map to a few small autosomal regions. Furthermore, the subset of those differentiated markers that exhibit reduced introgression are also concentrated on the X chromosome (39 of the 50 loci) and in a single 7-cM region of one autosome (LG14). We discuss the implications of these results for speciation and divergence in hybridizing species.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Mapping panel</title><p>Because <italic>Gryllus pennsylvanicus</italic> sperm fail to fertilize <italic>Gryllus firmus</italic> eggs, we produced F1 hybrids from a cross of <italic>G. pennsylvanicus</italic> female &#x000d7; <italic>G. firmus</italic> male and then backcrossed an F1 male to a <italic>G. pennsylvanicus</italic> female to obtain a mapping panel of 91 offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

We used the Qiagen Multiplex PCR Kits following manufacturer recommendations, with the following adjustments (recommended for more than 10 PCR products): our primer concentration was decreased to a final concentration of 0.1 &#x003bc;M and the annealing time was increased to 3 min in a total volume of 10 &#x003bc;l. We set up five multiplex PCRs for each individual and then combined the resulting five PCR products. We cleaned up the combined multiplex PCR reactions by precipitation, adding 3 &#x003bc;l of combined PCR reaction to 3 &#x003bc;l of sodium acetate (3 M) and 55 &#x003bc;l of 100% ethanol. We placed the solution at &#x02212;20&#x000b0; for 20 min and then centrifuged the solution at maximum speed for 10 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 14 &#x003bc;l of EB buffer (Qiagen). To ensure ligation of Illumina TruSeq adaptors, we adenylated the cleaned PCR products with Klenow fragment (exo<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) (New England Biolabs), adding 1 &#x003bc;l of NEB #2 buffer, 1 &#x003bc;l of dATP (1 mM), 0.5 &#x003bc;l of enzyme, and 2 &#x003bc;l of PCR product in a total volume of 10 &#x003bc;l.

Of these we were able to place 84 loci on the map, seven of them on the X chromosome. In addition, we could assign an additional 51 loci to the X chromosome (see below), but because of lack of recombination in the F1 male, these markers could not be ordered along the chromosome. The remaining six loci were not mapped either because the whole family was heterozygous (two loci; mother and father homozygous for alternative alleles) or because the locus was completely monomorphic across all genotyped individuals (four loci).</p><p>After separating individuals by barcode and trimming regions with an error probability higher than 5%, the multiplex PCR approach yielded high coverage data with a mean (&#x000b1; SD) of 466,547 &#x000b1; 240,100 paired end reads per individual and mean read length of 84.7 &#x000b1; 10 bp per read. We aligned these data to a reference library of the known sequences from the transcriptome based RNAseq loci (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Andres <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Larson <italic>et al.</italic> 2013a</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The aligned contigs had an average mean coverage of 1578.6 &#x000b1; 1427.8 per contig position. To call SNPs we produced consensus sequences for each locus/individual. We recorded ambiguities (<italic>i.e.</italic>, S, W, Y, R, K, M) at positions with minor allele frequency of at least 25% and a minimum coverage of eight reads (individuals with low coverage were visually inspected and assigned as &#x0201c;missing&#x0201d; if data were not high-quality). We then realigned the consensus sequences to the reference and called SNPs. Most SNPs matched the expected positions (previously characterized), although in a few cases additional SNPs were also segregating. Discounting four loci with too much missing data (complete failure in first or second Illumina lane), there was a total of 3% missing data (with two individuals contributing to most of the missing data).</p><p>Although the backcross offspring could not be sexed directly, we were able to assign sex using segregation patterns at loci where the F1 father and the <italic>G. pennsylvanicus</italic> mother were homozygous for alternative alleles. An autosomal inheritance model would yield only heterozygous offspring, but for some loci we observed that the brood segregated in a nearly 1:1 ratio (heterozygote:homozygote for maternal allele), suggesting that these loci were sex-linked. Assuming X-linkage, all females should be heterozygotes and all males should inherit only the maternal allele. We confirmed sex assignment with multiple X-linked loci. Using these observations, we identified 40 females and 51 males in the mapping family.</p><p>Most X-linked loci were not segregating in the mapping family, because the F1 parent was a hemizygous father carrying a <italic>G. pennsylvanicus</italic> X chromosome. Nonetheless, we were still able to identify which highly differentiated RNAseq loci were X-linked. These loci were nearly fixed for different alleles between species and thus unlikely to be homozygous in an F1 female. Therefore, a pattern in which the F1 male parent of the mapping family appears homozygous, his F1 full sisters are heterozygous, and the <italic>G. pennsylvanicus</italic> allele is fixed in the backcross family is most parsimoniously explained by X-linkage. The only alternative explanation for this pattern would be if autosomal <italic>G. pennsylvanicus</italic> alleles were segregating in the population of the <italic>G. firmus</italic> grandfather, leading to homozygosity for the <italic>G. pennsylvanicus</italic> allele in the F1 male (father) and heterozygosity in the two F1 females (his sisters). This alternative scenario has probabilities ranging from 0% (in the 45% of the postulated X-linked markers for which alternative alleles are fixed between species) to &#x0003c;2.5% for another 45% of the markers (when the two species are nearly fixed for alternative alleles) to a maximum of &#x0003c;6% for a single locus (where <italic>G. pennsylvanicus</italic> is fixed for an allele and that allele is segregating in <italic>G. firmus</italic> populations at a frequency of &#x0223c;0.3). Based on these arguments, we assigned a total of 58 loci to the X chromosome, but 51 could not be ordered on the map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The distribution of the highly differentiated RNAseq loci across the genome was not random.

For the subset of loci analyzed in the Connecticut hybrid zone, all loci with reduced introgression (n = 50) mapped to the X chromosome (39 of 49 X-linked loci), to LG14 (nine out of nine LG14 linked loci), or to LG2 (two out of five LG2 linked loci; the two reduced introgression loci did not show significantly reduced introgression in the Pennsylvania hybrid zone).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s12"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our map data reveal a distinctly nonrandom distribution of markers that exhibit major allele frequency differences between cricket species and/or show significantly reduced introgression across the hybrid zone.

Although coding regions could be nonrandomly distributed across the cricket genome, the extent of clustering both among and within chromosomes suggests that other explanations are more likely. For example, clustering might be better explained if regions of high differentiation experienced recent positive selection in one or both species, leading to decreased diversity and high differentiation (or fixed differences) between species. Genetic hitchhiking would lead to decreased genetic diversity in nearby genes causing the entire region to become highly differentiated. Genes within the high differentiation cluster would then be chosen for study because of their high differentiation or fixed differences (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Larson <italic>et al.</italic> 2013a</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Although the X is the largest cricket chromosome (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Lim <italic>et al.</italic> 1973</xref>), representing approximately 20% of the genome, even after correcting for size the X is still enriched with highly differentiated loci. It is clear that selection acts differently on the X compared to autosomes. X-linked loci may evolve faster than autosomal loci simply due to differences in effective population size (3/4 N<sub>e</sub>). Smaller N<sub>e</sub> may lead to more rapid coalescence and greater exclusivity, thus making it more likely that the highly differentiated loci would be X-linked. If new advantageous loci are on average recessive, then selection may be more effective on the X because recessive alleles are exposed to selection in hemizygous males (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Charlesworth <italic>et al.</italic> 1987</xref>; reviewed in <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Meisel and Connallon 2013</xref>). Thus, faster-X evolution could also lead to the more rapid accumulation of highly differentiated loci between species. Finally, because of its hemizygosity, the X recombines only in females, resulting in tighter linkage compared to autosomes. Thus, even if only a few genes are under selection, many other genes could hitchhike with them. This process would reduce diversity, making the accumulation of X-linked highly differentiated loci more likely (reviewed in <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Qvarnstrom and Bailey 2009</xref>).</p><p>The SNPs we identified from RNAseq data reside in gene regions that were originally isolated from comparison of accessory gland transcriptome libraries (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Andres <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). These libraries were generated using pooled DNA from 15 males of each species. Because males have only one X chromosome, effective sample sizes for X-linked loci would be half that of autosomal loci, potentially leading to an excess of highly differentiated X linked loci in our first screen. The accessory gland in crickets is a tissue unique to males. Genes with sex biased expression are often either overrepresented or underrepresented on the X in a taxon-specific manner (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Meisel <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, genes expressed in reproductive tissues are under-represented on the X (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Wolfner <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Swanson <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Mueller <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>), whereas in mammals such genes are overrepresented on the X (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Lercher <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Khil <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Meisel <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). If crickets have an overrepresentation of male-specific genes on the X, this might also contribute to the observed high proportion of X-linked highly differentiated RNAseq loci.</p></sec><sec id="s14"><title>Restricted introgression of loci on the X and one autosome</title><p>The X chromosome was enriched for highly differentiated markers, and the majority of genes with reduced introgression across the hybrid zone (39 out of 50) (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Larson <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>) were also X-linked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Although most X-linked loci could not be ordered along the X (51 out of 58), the mapped markers on the X did not have a clumped distribution like that observed for autosomes. Even the three ordered genes with reduced introgression were not in close linkage on the X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), suggesting that the entire X chromosome, and not simply a few regions of the X, may be enriched for both high-differentiation loci and for loci with reduced introgression across the hybrid zone.</p><p>The large role of the X in speciation has been well documented for genes contributing to hybrid sterility and inviability (reviewed in <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Presgraves 2008</xref>). In addition to faster-X evolution, the other potential mechanisms behind X-linked sterility are mis-regulation of the X chromosome during spermatogenesis (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Lifschyt and Lindsley 1972</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Masly and Presgraves 2007</xref>), gene movement on and off the X (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Moyle <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>), or dominance (recessive deleterious alleles are exposed in the male&#x02019;s single X) (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Turelli and Orr 1995</xref>). However, we have no evidence of abnormal spermatogenesis in F1 hybrid male crickets; although they cannot fertilize pure <italic>G. firmus</italic> females (one-way incompatibility is maintained in the F1 generation), they exhibit normal fertility when mated to F1 or to G. <italic>pennsylvanicus</italic> females (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Maroja <italic>et al.</italic> 2009b</xref>; L. S. Maroja and E. L. Larson, unpublished data). Given that hybrid males are fertile, and that the unidirectional barrier to gene exchange is likely due to a failure in fertilization (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Larson <italic>et al.</italic> 2012b</xref>), mechanisms contributing to the accumulation of X-linked Dobzhansky-Mueller incompatibilities cannot explain the excess of reduced introgression X-linked loci in field crickets.</p><p>The dynamics of the cricket hybrid zone may contribute to reduced introgression of X-linked loci. Because F1 hybrids can only be produced from <italic>G. pennsylvanicus</italic> females (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Harrison 1983</xref>), the F1 generation will exhibit a 2:1 excess of <italic>G. pennsylvanicus</italic> X chromosomes, whereas the autosomes will be balanced. Furthermore, because male F1 hybrids carry the <italic>G. pennsylvanicus</italic> X chromosome, and because these males cannot backcross to <italic>G. firmus</italic> females (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Maroja <italic>et al.</italic> 2009b</xref>; L. S. Maroja and E. L. Larson, unpublished data), no X introgression from F1 males will be possible. In contrast, <italic>G. firmus</italic> autosomes can introgress into the <italic>G. pennsylvanicus</italic> background through the F1 male hybrids. Although the X chromosome could introgress into either species through F1 females, in the laboratory F1 females mate more promptly with <italic>G. firmus</italic> males (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Maroja <italic>et al.</italic> 2009b</xref>). The reduced mobility of the X chromosome (introgression only possible from female F1s) might explain the steeper X-linked genomic clines observed (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Larson <italic>et al.</italic> 2013a</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Of course this hybridization dynamic does not preclude the existence of barrier genes on the X chromosome. In fact, if such genes are present, then the pattern of reduced introgression observed across the X would be enhanced. As mentioned above, the X has reduced recombination when compared to autosomes, leading to a stronger hitchhiking effect. Thus, if any loci are under selection, then X introgression will be less likely and the entire X might have restricted introgression if enough loci are under selection (C. A. Muirhead, D. C. Presgraves, unpublished data). Many previous studies have identified the X as a hotspot for genetic differentiation between species, as well as a region of the genome that is resistant to introgression (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Saetre <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Payseur <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Carneiro <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Garrigan <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Sankararaman <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>).</p><p>The only other chromosome that showed an excess of reduced introgression loci was LG14. All genes in LG14 showed reduced introgression across the Connecticut hybrid zone (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Larson <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>), and only two did not have reduced introgression in the Pennsylvania hybrid zone (possibly because of lower statistical power) (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Larson <italic>et al.</italic> 2013a</xref>). All of these loci were in close linkage (within 7 cM), suggesting that the region could contain one or more candidate barrier genes. Genomic clines for these loci were remarkably steep and all centered at &#x0223c;310 m along the hybrid zone transect (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Larson <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). Given the dispersal abilities of field crickets (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Harrison 1979</xref>), strong selection and tight linkage across the region are required to maintain the observed steep clines. Although only autosome LG14 had many loci with reduced introgression, autosome LG2 had two genes with reduced introgression observed only in the Connecticut hybrid zone (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Larson <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). These loci did not show reduced introgression in the Pennsylvania hybrid zone (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Larson <italic>et al.</italic> 2013a</xref>) and other loci in close linkage (0 to 1 cM away) did not show reduced introgression in either hybrid zone. It is thus less clear how to interpret these two loci; they do not seem to represent an unambiguous region of reduced introgression.</p><p>The clustered location of highly differentiated, reduced introgression loci is suggestive of islands of restricted introgression in a background of relatively free gene exchange (&#x0201c;genomic islands of speciation&#x0201d;) (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Turner <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). According to this interpretation, the reduced introgression loci, likely involved in reproductive barriers to gene exchange, would be unable to cross the species boundary, whereas the rest of the genome would be free to introgress, resulting in islands of divergence (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Turner <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Harr 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Nosil <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). The two cricket species are thought to have diverged in allopatry during the late Pleistocene, with episodic periods of secondary contact. Allopatric divergence is not expected to produce a pattern of discrete divergence islands within the genome. However, upon secondary contact, ongoing gene flow between recently diverged lineages may lead to such a pattern; the dynamics may be akin to that seen in divergence with gene flow (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Via and West 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Feder and Nosil 2010</xref>). In such a scenario of differential introgression, only genome regions that contribute to reproductive isolation or local adaptation remain differentiated. However, similar patterns can be produced in the absence of gene flow, where a pattern of high relative differentiation (high Fst or fixed differences) could be caused by recent selective sweeps, with genomes regions that have not diverged representing the persistence of shared ancestral polymorphisms (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Nachman and Payseur 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cruickshank and Hahn 2014</xref>). If introgression is what is homogenizing the genomic background, then both absolute (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <italic>Dxy</italic>) and relative (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <italic>Fst</italic>) divergence in the islands should be high (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cruickshank and Hahn 2014</xref>). Our highly differentiated RNAseq loci were selected on the basis of fixed or nearly fixed differences (high <italic>D</italic>) between species, a relative measure of divergence. In the absence of absolute estimates of divergence (not reliably obtained from our data), regions of high differentiation could result from the reduction in genetic diversity that follows a selective event (which would increase the relative but not the absolute measure of divergence).</p><p>Both processes may be operating to produce the observed patterns. Not all loci that exhibit high <italic>D</italic> also exhibit restricted introgression. It is surely possible that there has not been sufficient time since the most recent secondary contact for introgression to homogenize regions across the entire species range. Furthermore, given that prezygotic isolation between these two species is strong (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Harrison 1983</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Maroja <italic>et al.</italic> 2009b</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Larson <italic>et al.</italic> 2013a</xref>,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Maroja <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>), that gene flow is restricted on a fine scale (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Ross and Harrison 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Larson <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>), and that linkage disequilibrium is high even in the center of the hybrid zone (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Harrison and Bogdanowicz 1997</xref>), it is also possible that all markers have restricted introgression to some extent. However, most individuals in the hybrid zone are multi-generation backcrosses and the extent of introgression does vary dramatically among markers (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Larson <italic>et al.</italic> 2013a</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). This suggests that genome regions on LG14 and the X chromosome may indeed be contributing to reproductive isolation.</p></sec><sec id="s15"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Here we demonstrate that highly differentiated RNAseq loci are clustered across the genome and that reduced introgression loci are concentrated on the sex chromosome and in one small region of a single autosome (LG14). Prezygotic barriers to gene exchange, possibly combined with postmating prezygotic barriers are important in the cricket hybrid zone and in many recently diverged species. Although currently we have no evidence for the accumulation of ecological, behavioral, or fertilization prezygotic barrier genes on the X chromosome (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Qvarnstrom and Bailey 2009</xref>), faster-X evolution could make these barriers more likely to be X-linked, perhaps explaining our observation of an accumulation of both high-differentiation loci and low-introgression loci on the X chromosome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s16"><title/></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material">
