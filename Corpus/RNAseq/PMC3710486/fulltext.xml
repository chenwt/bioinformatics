RH, a particular type I strain, is most frequently used to characterize <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> biology. However, compared to other type I strains, RH has unique characteristics such as faster growth, increased extracellular survival rate and inability to form orally infectious cysts. Thus, to identify candidate genes that could account for these parasite phenotypic differences, we determined genetic differences and differential parasite gene expression between RH and another type I strain, GT1. Moreover, as differences in host cell modulation could affect <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> replication in the host, we determined differentially modulated host processes among the type I strains through host transcriptional profiling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Through whole genome sequencing, we identified 1,394 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (indels) between RH and GT1. These SNPs/indels together with parasite gene expression differences between RH and GT1 were used to identify candidate genes that could account for type I phenotypic differences. A polymorphism in dense granule protein, GRA2, determined RH and GT1 differences in the evasion of the interferon gamma response. In addition, host transcriptional profiling identified that genes regulated by NF-&#x00138;B, such as interleukin (IL)-12p40, were differentially modulated by the different type I strains. We subsequently showed that this difference in NF-&#x00138;B activation was due to polymorphisms in GRA15. Furthermore, we observed that RH, but not other type I strains, recruited phosphorylated I&#x00138;B&#x003b1; (a component of the NF-&#x00138;B complex) to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane and this recruitment of p- I&#x00138;B&#x003b1; was partially dependent on GRA2.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We identified candidate parasite genes that could be responsible for phenotypic variation among the type I strains through comparative genomics and transcriptomics.

It usually establishes an asymptomatic, chronic infection, but immunodeficient individuals can develop severe disease such as encephalitis and retinitis. <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> has a relatively complex life cycle, containing both asexual and sexual stages. The sexual cycle occurs in felines, but because a single parasite can give rise to both micro and macro-gametes, usually self fertilization occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Sexual recombination leading to new genotypes can only occur when felines are infected simultaneously with at least two different strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The low occurrence of concurrent infection events, together with horizontal transmission between intermediate hosts through consumption of infectious cysts, likely accounts for the highly clonal population structure observed in North America and Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>In North America, three clonal lineages known as types I, II and III were thought to predominate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, recent SNP analysis at five loci in ~950 strains, representing worldwide diversity, clustered these strains into 15 haplogroups and showed a high prevalence of type 12 strains in North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], while a large number of divergent strains are present in South America. Using genome-wide SNPs, it was shown that even within these haplogroups (except for haplogroups I, II, III and 6), there is often significant diversity and most strains appear to have formed through recent recombination events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Between lineage diversity is estimated to be 1 to 3% while diversity within the type I, II and III clonal lineage is ~0.01% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. There are also strong phenotypic differences between lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], such as acute virulence in mice, with type I strains being uniformly lethal (LD<sub>100</sub> = 1), while types II and III are less virulent, with LD<sub>50</sub> &#x02265; 10<sup>3</sup> and LD<sub>50</sub> &#x02265; 10<sup>5</sup>, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Another phenotype that has been correlated with virulence is <italic>in vitro</italic> growth rate, with type I parasites having a higher growth rate compared to types II and III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>RH is the most commonly used type I strain for characterization of numerous aspects of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> biology, ranging from active invasion, replication, to host cell egress, and it has been used extensively for molecular genetic analyses. RH was initially isolated from a 1939 case of toxoplasmic encephalitis by Albert Sabin and was subsequently cloned by Elmer Pfefferkorn for <italic>in vitro</italic> culture in 1977 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This cloned RH-ERP strain has likely undergone laboratory adaptation due to extensive <italic>in vitro</italic> lab passage, unlike RH-JSR, a non-cloned RH isolate that was propagated in mice and has undergone little serial passage in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. There are several other isolates of the type I lineage defined by PCR-RFLP at multiple marker alleles, such as GT1, an isolate from goat skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], from which the complete genome has been sequenced (ToxoDB.org) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Surprisingly, RH-ERP displays significant parasite phenotypic variation compared to GT1 and RH-JSR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], with RH-ERP having increased extracellular survival times, higher <italic>in vitro</italic> growth rates and loss of ability to form orally infective cysts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Moreover, using <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> microarrays, it was observed that RH-ERP parasite gene expression is significantly different compared to RH-JSR and GT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], with upregulation of certain ABC transporters in RH-ERP compared to RH-JSR or GT1. RH-ERP and GT1 also differ in the modulation of certain host processes; a serum response factor (SRF) reporter cell line is activated more by RH-ERP compared to GT1, and transcript levels of early growth response factor 2 (EGR2), a SRF target gene, are higher upon RH-ERP infection compared to GT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In addition, there is increased immune related GTPase (IRG) coating of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) of GT1 compared to RH-ERP in IFN-&#x003b3; stimulated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and subsequent higher levels of GT1 killing compared to RH-ERP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Differential modulation of host pathways could affect host cell survival or nutritional availability and subsequent <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> replication within the host cell.</p><p>The genetic basis for phenotypic variation between RH-ERP and the other type I strains is currently unknown. Many of these phenotypic differences are important determinants of acute virulence and chronic infection, as increased growth rates can lead to higher parasite burdens <italic>in vivo</italic>, and cyst formation is essential for <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Thus, understanding the genetic basis for the enhanced growth rate of RH-ERP and its inability to form orally infectious cysts could provide important insights into <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> virulence determinants. To examine the potential genetic basis for phenotypic differences between RH-ERP and GT1, we compared the complete genome sequences of RH-ERP and GT1 and identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (indels) across the genome. We also compared differential parasite gene expression between RH-ERP and RH-JSR/GT1 through our own independent transcriptional profiling and previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Using our SNP/indel and differentially expressed gene list, we then identified a number of candidate genes that could be responsible for the phenotypic differences observed between RH-ERP and RH-JSR/GT1, including a dense granule protein, GRA2. We then attributed the differences between RH-ERP and GT1 in evasion of IFN-&#x003b3;-mediated killing in MEFs to GRA2. To identify novel differences in host cell modulation among type I strains, we performed transcriptional profiling of human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) infected with RH-ERP, RH-JSR and GT1. Several host pathways were found to be differentially modulated, such as the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, which is activated by GT1 but not by RH-ERP or RH-JSR. Other host phenotypes that were different across type I strains included IL-12p40 (a NF-&#x003ba;B dependent cytokine) secretion by infected macrophages and recruitment of p-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; to the PVM, which was partially dependent on GRA2. Our results show that genetic mutations accumulated over time due to continuous laboratory passaging, can lead to large phenotypic changes and the candidate genes identified can serve as a guideline for future studies in examining phenotypic differences among type I strains.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Parasites and cells</title><p>Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS (PAA), 50 &#x003bc;g/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, and 20 &#x003bc;g/ml gentamycin.

A second PCR added the attP3 recombination site after the HA tag and the insert was cloned into pDONR 221 P4r-P3r (Invitrogen) using BP recombination (Invitrogen). The GRA2-HA insert was then flanked by the genomic DNA both upstream and downstream of the UPRT locus and inserted into the pTKO2 destination vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] by LR recombination (Invitrogen). pTKO2-GRA2HA was linearized by digestion with HindIII (New England Biolabs, Inc.) which does not cut within GRA2 and pTUB-CAT was digested with NotI (New England Biolabs, Inc.). pTKO2-GRA2HA and pTUB-CAT were co-transfected into RH&#x02206;<italic>gra2</italic> as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].

The intensity of fluorescent p- I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; was measured by drawing two lines at right angles across the long and short axes of the vacuoles, and intensity profiles were obtained for each line. The fold change intensity of each line was taken by dividing the highest peak value where each line crossed the margins of the PVM by the lowest value for each line (taken as background).

TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) was used to isolate total RNA according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions and RNA was cleaned up using MiniElute kit (Qiagen). RNA was labeled and hybridized to human Affymetrix arrays (Human U133A 2.0) according to manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. Probe intensities were measured with the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G and were processed into image analysis (.CEL) files with Expression Console Software (Affymetrix), which can be accessed through GEO (GSE44189). Intensity values were normalized using RMA through Expression Console, and all background values less than 6.5 were set to 6.5.</p><p>GSEA was used to find candidate transcription factors and canonical pathways that were modulated differently between the type I <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Both transcription factor and canonical pathway gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) were used to determine enrichment (c2.cp. symbols, c3.tft. symbols), using default parameters except the range of set size, which was changed to a minimum of 5 and maximum of 3000.

For every gene in a list, DiRE detects regulatory elements throughout the entire gene locus and looks for enrichment of transcription factor binding sites.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Identification of genetic differences between RH-ERP and GT1</title><p>To determine the genetic differences between RH-ERP and GT1, we sequenced RH-ERP using Illumina sequencing and downloaded the complete genome sequence of GT1 (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>A and ToxoDB.org). A list of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (indels) between RH-ERP and GT1 was generated, and a total number of 1,394 SNPs and indels were identified. There were 230 SNPs/indels within predicted coding regions, 484 SNPs/indels within predicted genes but outside coding regions, and 680 SNPs/indels outside predicted genes. From the 230 SNP/indels within predicted coding regions, we further identified 133 SNPs leading to nonsynonymous amino acid changes, 43 SNPs leading to synonymous amino acid substitutions, and 54 indels within predicted coding regions (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>B and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S1).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Genetic differences between RH-ERP and GT1</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><tbody valign="top"><tr><td colspan="7" align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>A.

In addition, a putative pinA gene (TGGT1_021310) with a phenylalanine (GT1) to leucine (RH-ERP) substitution had increased 2.0 fold expression in extracellular tachyzoites compared to intracellular tachyzoites. This parasite gene contains a forkhead associated domain that is involved in binding to phosphopeptides and forkhead-type transcription factors are involved in the regulation of cell cycle stage specific transcription in budding yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Thus, these genes could be involved in the difference in extracellular viability reported between RH-ERP and GT1.</p><p>RH-ERP also exhibits a loss in ability to form orally infective cysts, unlike GT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

Interestingly, TGGT1_020630 was also identified to be consistently more highly expressed in RH-ERP compared to GT1 (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>B). Thus, this gene could potentially be involved in the loss of ability in RH-ERP to form orally infectious cysts, as bradyzoites contain numerous amylopectin granules and the tissue cyst wall consists of lectin binding sugars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Top candidate genes that are differentially expressed between RH-ERP and GT1</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><tbody valign="top"><tr><td colspan="5" align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>A.

Furthermore, previous work on <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> immune evasion mechanisms have shown that RH-ERP infected IFN-&#x003b3; stimulated MEFs had decreased percentage of parasite vacuoles coated with Irgb6, an immunity related GTPase (IRG), compared to GT1 infected MEFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In addition, RH&#x00394;<italic>gra2</italic> infected IFN-&#x003b3; stimulated MEFs had increased percentage of parasite vacuoles coated with Irgb6 compared to RH-ERP infected MEFs.

Both RH-ERP GRA2 and GT1 GRA2 were able to complement Irgb6 coating, as both complemented strains had similar percentage parasite vacuoles coated with Irgb6 compared to RH-ERP. However, some <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> parasites are still able to survive, escape IRG coated vacuoles and invade a new cell, thus Irgb6 coating may not fully measure parasite killing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Therefore, to measure IFN-&#x003b3; mediated killing in MEFs, the relative number of parasite plaques that form 4&#x02013;7 days on IFN-&#x003b3; stimulated MEFs compared to unstimulated MEFs were measured (also referred to as plaque loss).

This differential expression could be due to two main reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Firstly, polymorphisms in the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions, such as the promoter or untranslated regions (UTRs), could lead to differences in transcription initiation, transcript stability or transcript decay. Secondly, polymorphic or differentially expressed transcriptional regulators, such as the Apetala 2 (AP2) transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], could affect the expression levels of non-polymorphic genes. These transcriptional regulators can affect gene expression levels at different levels of RNA metabolism, such as controlling the formation of the exon junction complex, the export of mRNA through the nuclear complex and translation initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>Since sequence variation in promoter regions between strains could lead to differential gene expression, we determined whether any of the 1164 SNPs/indels we identified outside predicted gene coding regions were inside a promoter/5&#x02032; UTR (defined as 1000 bp upstream of predicted ATG start codon) or 3&#x02032; UTR (defined as 1000 bp downstream of predicted end codon). We found 133 SNPs/indels within the 5&#x02032; UTR of 110 genes and 143 SNPs/indels within the 3&#x02032; UTR of 106 genes. Of these 216 genes with 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; UTR SNPs/indels, microarray analyses showed that 43 genes were &#x02265;1.5 fold differentially expressed between RH-ERP and GT1 (p-value = 0.07, hypergeometric test) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S1).</p><p>We identified a putative dihydrolipoamid dehydrogenase (TGGT1_041490) with a 5&#x02032; UTR polymorphism, that was expressed 1.7 fold higher in RH-ERP compared to GT1 using array data, and was also expressed higher than in other canonical strains such as PRU and VEG (ToxoDB.org). Moreover, this same putative dihydrolipoamid dehydrogenase was expressed approximately 11 fold higher in RH-ERP intracellular parasites compared to extracellular parasite (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>A and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S1), which could indicate a possible role in intracellular growth. Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase serves as a component of several multifunctional complexes, such as pyruvate dehydrogenase, the glycine cleavage system and branched chain amino acid dehydrogenase complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Thus, increased expression of this gene in RH-ERP could lead to differences in glycolytic metabolism, or resistance to reactive nitrogen intermediates. Interestingly, deletion of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase in an intracellular bacterial pathogen, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, causes a significant attenuation of virulence in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>].</p><p>Notably, there was a single ABC transporter (TGGT1_025370, also called TgABCG<sub>107</sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]) with a 5&#x02032; UTR polymorphism, though it was only expressed 1.3 fold higher in RH-ERP compared to GT1 using array data.

In addition, we noted an ATP dependent helicase (TGGT1_113930) with a 5&#x02032; UTR polymorphism that was expressed 1.4 fold higher in RH-ERP compared to GT1 using array data (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S1). Thus, overexpression of these ATP dependent candidate genes identified could contribute to the enhanced growth of RH-ERP.</p><p>Interestingly, we identified an AP-2 transcription factor (AP2VIIA2; TGGT1_072850) with a 3&#x02032; UTR polymorphism, and is more highly expressed in M4 <italic>in vitro</italic> bradyzoites and <italic>in vivo</italic> cysts compared to <italic>in vitro</italic> tachyzoites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S1). 24 AP-2 transcription factors have cyclical expression profiles corresponding to the tachyzoite division cycle, whereas 11 AP-2 mRNAs are induced during <italic>in vitro</italic> bradyzoite differentiation (including AP2VIIA2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Therefore, this AP2 transcription factor could be involved in the regulation of genes required for bradyzoite differentiation and cyst formation.</p><p>Another reason for differential parasite gene expression could be polymorphic or differentially expressed trans-regulators, such as the AP2 transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] that could regulate the expression of many non-polymorphic genes. Alternatively, differential expression of genes could be under epigenetic control, such as post translational modification of histone proteins or arginine methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Thus, we investigated genes that were differentially expressed between RH-ERP, RH-JSR and GT1, regardless of SNPs in the coding or regulatory regions (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Table S2). We used expression datasets available from a previous published study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], another independent dataset with parasite gene expression levels comparing RH-ERP and GT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and our own <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> arrays measuring parasite gene expression levels comparing RH-ERP, RH-JSR and GT1 (GSE44191). We analyzed for transcripts that were &#x02265;1.5 fold differentially expressed between RH-ERP and GT1 across these three datasets, to identify genes that were consistently up or downregulated between RH-ERP and GT1. We identified 13 transcripts that had consistently increased and 13 transcripts that had consistently decreased expression in RH-ERP compared to GT1 across all three independent datasets respectively.</p><p>From the 13 consistently upregulated transcripts in RH-ERP compared to GT1 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Table S2), we identified a putative ankyrin repeat containing protein (TGGT1_098460). This gene was highly expressed in RH-ERP in both array and RNA-seq datasets, but not in GT1 (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>B), and had lower expression in canonical strains such as PRU and VEG (ToxoDB.org). Ankyrin repeats mediate molecular recognition via protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], and proteins containing these repeats are involved in a large number of cellular functions, ranging from modulation of the NF-kB response to transcriptional regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Interestingly, TgANK-1, a parasite protein containing ankyrin repeats, is induced upon bradyzoite differentiation using RH parasites, and localizes to the parasite cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Another gene that was consistently upregulated was a GRA12 homologue, and GRA12 co-localizes with GRA2 and interacts with GRA2 or GRA2-associated proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Therefore, this gene could be associated with the increased growth rate of RH-ERP compared to GT1.</p><p>Of the 13 transcripts with increased expression in GT1 compared to RH-ERP, three encode for known rhoptry proteins, ROP8 (TGGT1_126670), ROP29 (TGGT1_047990) and ROP38 (TGGT1_048210) (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>C). ROP29 and ROP38 are part of a repeated gene family, and overexpression studies of ROP38 in the RH-ERP background showed that ROP38 has major effects on host gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Furthermore, as ROP8, ROP29 and ROP38 have predicted signal peptides, these rhoptry proteins might be involved in differential host modulation between RH-ERP and GT1. Several rhoptry proteins are known to be secreted into the host cells, where they play major roles in modulation of the host cell functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Differentially modulated parasite pathways between type I strains</title><p>In addition, we analyzed whether the differentially expressed genes between RH-ERP, RH-JSR and GT1 across the three independent datasets were enriched in annotated biological functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>].

To do this, we infected HFFs with RH-ERP, RH-JSR and GT1 for 24 hours and determined host gene expression profiles using microarrays.

It was noted that high levels of nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-&#x003ba;B were present in host cells infected with several type II strains (ME49, PRU, DAG and Beverly), while host cells infected with RH-ERP and GT1 had much lower levels of p65 translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Our host transcriptional profile analysis across the type I strains indicated that there is an enrichment in NF-&#x003ba;B binding sites in the promoters of host genes that are more highly induced by GT1 infection compared to RH-ERP (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). To validate this analysis, HEK293T NF-&#x003ba;B reporter cells with NF-&#x003ba;B binding sites driving the expression of GFP and luciferase were infected with RH-ERP, RH-JSR and GT1 for 24 hours and assayed for NF-&#x003ba;B dependent luciferase activity (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A).

Moreover, RH-ERP was shown to contain a frameshift deletion compared to GT1, leading to a nonfunctional GRA15 in RH-ERP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Because RH-JSR also does not induce NF-&#x003ba;B activation, we sequenced <italic>GRA15</italic> from RH-JSR and, surprisingly, we found that RH-JSR contains a frameshift insertion at base 734. This mutation is independent from the RH-ERP frameshift deletion at base 872. The RH-JSR insertion causes a mutation of a stretch of 34 amino acids followed by a premature stop codon (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>: Figure S2). Thus, both RH-ERP and RH-JSR contain truncated GRA15 proteins of 312 and 278 amino acids respectively, while GT1 has the full length protein of 635 amino acids. GRA15 was observed to affect parasite growth both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, as RH-ERP expressing GRA15<sub>II</sub> has reduced plaque size in HFFs and reduced parasite burden in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Thus, there could have been a selective pressure for a nonfunctional GRA15 in RH-ERP and RH-JSR, allowing for increased parasite burden in the host or faster replication <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Since RH-ERP provides a null genetic background with respect to GRA15, we generated transgenic RH-ERP parasites overexpressing GRA15 from GT1 and assayed for NF-&#x003ba;B mediated luciferase activity using the same NF-&#x003ba;B reporter cell line described above (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). The NF-&#x003ba;B reporter luciferase activity after infection with RH-ERP+GRA15<sub>GT1</sub> was significantly higher than the activity after infection with RH-ERP (<italic>p</italic>-value = 0.0001, Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test). This data supports the hypothesis that differences in NF-&#x003ba;B activation among type I strains are due to GRA15. In addition, the NF-&#x003ba;B family of transcription factors consist of five members, p65, c-REL, REL-B, p50 and p52 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>], and the NF-&#x003ba;B reporter contains four repeated, canonical NF-&#x003ba;B binding sites which can be bound by the different NF-&#x003ba;B subunits. Previous studies showed p65 nuclear localization in host cells infected with type II strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and we wanted to determine whether p65 nuclear translocation could be responsible for differential NF-&#x003ba;B activation observed in host cells infected by GT1 compared to RH-ERP. HFFs were infected with RH-ERP, RH-JSR, GT1 or transgenic RH-ERP+GRA15<sub>GT1</sub>, and nuclear localization of p65 was examined by immunofluorescence (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). There was significant nuclear translocation of p65 in cells infected with transgenic RH-ERP+GRA15<sub>GT1</sub> parasites compared to uninfected cells (<italic>p</italic>-value = 0.02, Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test), but no significant p65 nuclear translocation was observed in cells infected with RH-ERP and GT1 (<italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003e; 0.05, Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test). It is possible that the GRA15 in GT1 activates a different NF-&#x003ba;B subunit from p65, such as c-REL or p50, but transgenic high overexpression of GRA15<sub>GT1</sub> in RH-ERP activates p65 in addition to other subunits. It is also possible that there are other GT1 genes that could have an inhibitory effect on p65 translocation.</p><p>GRA15 from type II strains (GRA15<sub>II</sub>) was also shown to affect levels of IL-12p40, a NF-&#x003ba;B dependent cytokine, by infected macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and regulation of IL12-p40 production has been linked to NF-&#x003ba;B activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. Thus, we investigated whether type I strains differ in their ability to induce secretion of IL-12p40 and CCL2, another NF-&#x003ba;B dependent cytokine, and examined whether GRA15 from GT1 played a role in these differences. GT1 infection of C57BL/6 bone marrow derived macrophages resulted in secretion of higher levels of both IL-12p40 and CCL2 in culture supernatants compared to RH-ERP infection (Figures&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D, <italic>p</italic>-value = 7.5&#x000d7;10<sup>-5</sup> (IL-12p40) and <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.0003 (CCL2), Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test). This phenotype can be partially attributed to GRA15, as macrophages infected with RH-ERP+GRA15<sub>GT1</sub> induced higher levels of IL-12p40 and CCL2 compared to RH-ERP (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D, <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.0006 (IL-12p40) and <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.003 (CCL2), Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test). However, GRA15<sub>GT1</sub> in the RH+GRA15<sub>GT1</sub> background was not sufficient to increase secretion of IL12-p40 by infected macrophages to levels comparable to those observed in macrophages infected with GT1. Moreover, infection with RH-JSR, which has a nonfunctional GRA15, induced IL12-p40 to levels higher than infection with RH-ERP+GRA15<sub>GT1</sub> (<italic>p</italic>-value = 0.003 (IL12-p40) and <italic>p</italic>-value = 5.9x10<sup>-5</sup> (CCL2), Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test). Therefore, it is likely that other <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> genes contribute to induction of IL-12p40 and CCL2 production by infected macrophages, especially given that the regulation of IL12-p40 is more complex than sole control by NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Localization of p-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; at the PVM is strain specific, independent of NF-kB activation and partially dependent on GRA2</title><p>In the canonical NF-&#x003ba;B activation pathway, I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; normally inhibits NF-&#x003ba;B translocation and sequesters NF-&#x003ba;B in the cytoplasm. However, upon stimulation, I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; is phosphorylated and subsequently targeted for proteasomal degradation via ubiquitination, exposing the nuclear localization signal in NF-&#x003ba;B and allowing nuclear localization to occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. It has been previously reported that phospho-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; (p-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;) is localized to the PVM in RH-ERP infected mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and this has been linked to NF-&#x003ba;B activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>].

In agreement with previous studies, p-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; localized to the PVM of RH-ERP, but there was much less accumulation of p-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; at the PVM in HFFs infected with other type I strains (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A). Quantification of the intensity of p-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; around the PVM confirmed that vacuoles containing RH-ERP recruited significantly more p-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; than vacuoles with RH-JSR or GT1 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B, <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.009 (RH-JSR) and 0.008 (GT1), Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test). It is unlikely that NF-&#x003ba;B activation levels are correlated with the level of p-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; recruitment around the PVM, given previous data that type II strains activate NF-&#x003ba;B in infected host cells but do not induce accumulation of p-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; to the PVM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].
