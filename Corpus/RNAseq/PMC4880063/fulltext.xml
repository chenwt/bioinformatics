This proof-of-principal landmark model opens a new avenue for study of advanced NSCLC biology when tissue biopsies unavailable.</p></abstract><abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Over the past decade, numerous reports describe the generation and increasing utility of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient-derived xenografts (PDX) from tissue biopsies. While PDX have proven useful for genetic profiling and preclinical drug testing, the requirement of a tissue biopsy limits the available patient population, particularly those with advanced oligometastatic disease. Conversely, &#x02018;liquid biopsies&#x02019; such as circulating tumour cells (CTCs) are minimally invasive and easier to obtain. Here, we present a clinical case study of a NSCLC patient with advanced metastatic disease, a never smoker whose primary tumour was EGFR and ALK wild-type. We demonstrate for the first time, tumorigenicity of their CTCs to generate a patient CTC-derived eXplant (CDX).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p>CTCs were enriched at diagnosis and again 2 months later during disease progression from 10 ml blood from a 48-year-old NSCLC patient and implanted into immunocompromised mice. Resultant tumours were morphologically, immunohistochemically, and genetically compared with the donor patient's diagnostic specimen. Mice were treated with cisplatin and pemetrexed to assess preclinical efficacy of the chemotherapy regimen given to the donor patient.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The NSCLC CDX expressed lung lineage markers TTF1 and CK7 and was unresponsive to cisplatin and pemetrexed. Examination of blood samples matched to that used for CDX generation revealed absence of CTCs using the CellSearch EpCAM-dependent platform, whereas size-based CTC enrichment revealed abundant heterogeneous CTCs of which &#x0223c;80% were mesenchymal marker vimentin positive. Molecular analysis of the CDX, mesenchymal and epithelial CTCs revealed a common somatic mutation confirming tumour origin and showed CDX RNA and protein profiles consistent with the predominantly mesenchymal phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study shows that the absence of NSCLC CTCs detected by CellSearch (EpCAM<sup>+</sup>) does not preclude CDX generation, highlighting epithelial to mesenchymal transition and the functional importance of mesenchymal CTCs in dissemination of this disease.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>non-small-cell lung cancer</kwd><kwd>circulating tumour cells</kwd><kwd>patient-derived circulating tumour cells explants (CDX)</kwd><kwd>preclinical therapeutics</kwd><kwd>epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source>British Lung Foundation <named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000351</named-content></funding-source><award-id>R914-6</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-2"><funding-source>Cancer Research UK <named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</named-content></funding-source><award-id>C5759/A12328</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-3"><funding-source>Manchester CRUK Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre</funding-source><award-id>C1467/A15578</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-4"><funding-source>Manchester Cancer Research Centre</funding-source><award-id>A12197</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-5"><funding-source>CRUK Lung Cancer Centre of Excellence</funding-source><award-id>C5759/A20465</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-6"><funding-source>European Union CHEMORES</funding-source><award-id>LSHG-CT-2007-037665</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="mdw122_s1"><title>introduction</title><p>Interest in circulating tumour cells (CTCs) as &#x02018;liquid biopsies&#x02019; has escalated as technical hurdles are overcome [<xref rid="MDW122C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

ISET-filtered CTCs were stained by multi-parameter immunofluorescence using antibodies against CD45 (leukocyte marker), pan-cytokeratins (epithelial cell marker), vimentin (mesenchymal cell marker), and VE-cadherin (CD144, endothelial cell marker). Filters were rehydrated (1 min in PBS + 0.02% Tween-20), permeabilized (0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min), and washed for 1 min in PBS + 0.02% Tween-20. Antibody incubations were as follows: 10% goat serum block (Dako X0907) for 30 min; a cocktail (80 &#x000b5;l) of two primary antibodies, unconjugated anti-CD45 (1:400 of 0.4 mg/ml, Rabbit, Abcam AB10559), and unconjugated anti-VE-cadherin (1:200 of 0.5 mg/ml, Mouse, eBioscience 14-1449-82), for 1 h; a cocktail (80 &#x000b5;l) of two fluorescent secondary antibodies, Goat anti-mouse AF555 (1:500 of 2 mg/ml Invitrogen A21422) and Goat anti-rabbit DY549 (1:500 of 1 mg/ml Thermo Scientific35 558) for 1 h; a cocktail (80 &#x000b5;l) of two conjugated primary antibodies, anti-vimentin 647 (1:50 of 0.05 mg/ml Santa Cruz sc-6260) and anti-CK FITC (1:100 of 3 mg/ml, Sigma F3418, clone C11 against CKs 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, and 18) for 1 h; and 80 &#x000b5;l of DAPI (1:10 000 of 5 mg/ml, Invitrogen D3571) for 5 min. The filters were washed twice in PBST between incubations then twice in double distilled water before mounting with ProLong Gold anti-fade (Invitrogen P36934). Slides were left overnight at room temperature to dry and imaged with a MIRAX automated slide scanner (3DHistech, Budapest, Hungary). Images were reviewed with 3DHistech panoramic viewing software (Version 1.15.1.10). This assay detects CD45 and VE-cadherin positive cells (leucocytes and endothelial cells) with the same fluorescence emission (both labelled with fluorophores with red spectral emission). Therefore, tumour cells in this assay were at the outset of the study defined as having neither marker (i.e. CTCs are defined as cytokeratin and/or vimentin positive and CD45 and VE-cadherin negative). Expression of vimentin and/or cytokeratins on filtered cells was evaluated by analysts with extensive experience in CTC research.</p></sec><sec id="mdw122_s2h"><title>whole-exome sequencing</title><p>The CDX tumours were disaggregated using a sterile scalpel and gDNA isolated using the QiaAmp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen).

Counts were converted into Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped (RPKM), which were then used for expression level quantification of the genes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="mdw122_s3"><title>results</title><p>A 48-year-old male was recruited through an ongoing, ethically approved translational lung cancer research programme. Diagnostic computer tomography identified a T1aN2M1b stage tumour (TNM 7th edition [<xref rid="MDW122C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]) with a 2 cm right lung primary and metastases to brain, bone, kidney, mediastinal, and para-aortic lymph nodes. His diagnostic biopsy (a para-aortic lymph node) contained sheets of polygonal poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cells that were positive for lung markers, thyroid transcription factor (TTF1), and cytokeratin7 (CK7) and negative for p40 (squamous marker), CD56, chromogranin A, synaptophysin (neuroendocrine markers), and CK20 (gastrointestinal marker). Molecular testing demonstrated wild-type EGFR and was negative for ALK gene rearrangement. The patient commenced on chemotherapy with cisplatin and pemetrexed but discontinued after one cycle with deterioration of his general condition due to brain metastases. Despite administration of whole-brain radiotherapy (20 Gy, 5 fractions), the patient continued to deteriorate with progressive neurological symptoms and died 2 months following initial diagnosis. Three blood samples were drawn before chemotherapy (baseline) and after brain radiotherapy. After blood cell depletion from one sample, the CTC-enriched fraction was implanted into an immunocompromised mouse within 2 h of blood draw to attempt CDX generation. The other samples were processed for CTC analysis using CellSearch and ISET filtration.</p><p>No CDX was derived at baseline, but post-radiotherapy CTCs gave rise to a palpable tumour 95 days after implantation; CDX fragments implanted into additional mice resulted in palpable tumours &#x0223c;30 days later (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDW122F1">1</xref>A and B). The CDX resembled a poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma, comprising diffuse sheets of large polygonal cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, vesicular chromatin, and enlarged nucleoli (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDW122F1">1</xref>C). Both biopsy and CDX expressed TTF1. CK7 was expressed in &#x0223c;10% versus 100% CDX cells versus biopsy, suggesting a less epithelial CDX phenotype (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDW122F1">1</xref>C). The CDX, when treated with cisplatin and pemetrexed (the same chemotherapy doublet as the patient), was resistant to treatment (no impact on tumour growth) suggesting that had progressive neurological symptoms not prevented the patient's continuation of chemotherapy, treatment may still not have improved the outcome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDW122F1">1</xref>D).<fig id="MDW122F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>NSCLC CDX growth, histology and response to therapy.

To confirm tumour origin of filtered CTCs, we sought common mutations in tumour biopsy, CDX, and cells designated as CTCs (retrieved by laser capture microdissection for genomic DNA extraction and amplification) not present in leucocytes/endothelial cells. Confirmation of CTC tumour origin (by Sanger sequencing) was demonstrated by the absence of a G340A mutation in PACRG in germline DNA present in primary tumour, CDX, and single epithelial, mesenchymal, and mixed phenotype CTCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDW122F2">2</xref>C). Expression of genes associated with epithelial or mesenchymal phenotypes [<xref rid="MDW122C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="MDW122C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] was evaluated after RNAseq of passage 3 CDX (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDW122F2">2</xref>D, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/annonc/mdw122/-/DC1">supplementary Table 2, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online</ext-link>).

These data highlight the potential for CDX models from metastatic cancers with low prevalence of CellSearch CTCs (e.g. pancreatic cancer) and where biopsy material is often scarce, resulting in insufficient material for comprehensive molecular profiling. Our data also denote the importance of non-epitope-dependent technologies for CTC enrichment [<xref rid="MDW122C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="MDW122C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. While we do not formally distinguish dynamic EMT from epithelial and mesenchymal cell cooperation during haematological dissemination, these data do highlight a functional importance of mesenchymal CTCs and need for treatment strategies that target them (e.g. AXL inhibitors) [<xref rid="MDW122C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The persistent, predominant mesenchymal phenotype of the established CDX may also suggest that mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) [<xref rid="MDW122C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] may not always reverse after NSCLC cell dissemination.</p><p>In this case, the patient died to his disease 1 day after the blood draw that generated the CDX. This exemplifies how CDX can represent end of life disease models and the pressing need to better understand progressive disease biology and therapeutic options for advanced patients. The CDX approach contrasts with the majority of patient-derived xenografts (PDX) generated from resected tissue during surgery with curative intent [<xref rid="MDW122C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. CDX can be generated from patients with little deviation from routine practice and this study demonstrates the potential for this approach to be applied to cancers with few CellSearch detectable CTCs. It remains to be determined how frequently CDX could be generated from NSCLC patients with no/few CellSearch detectable CTCs. At the time of submission, we had implanted 34 samples enriched for CTC from NSCLC patients into mice with no further CDX yet detectable. However, the time from CTC implant to CDX detection can be over 6 months, so this dataset needs to mature before conclusions regarding CDX &#x02018;take rate&#x02019; can be drawn. This time frame precludes the use of NSCLC CDX as &#x02018;avatars&#x02019; in co-clinical trials to direct patient treatment. However, if CDX can be routinely generated from NSCLC patients, they have the potential to provide paired models from the same patient at baseline and at progression to study drug resistance mechanisms. We suggest that CDX would represent optimal preclinical models to test novel therapeutic regimens before commencing early clinical trials, as they can be generated from the cohort of patients better representing those at trial entry.</p></sec><sec id="mdw122_s5"><title>funding</title><p>This research was supported by the <funding-source>British Lung Foundation</funding-source> (<award-id>R914-6</award-id>); <funding-source>Cancer Research UK</funding-source> (<award-id>C5759/A12328</award-id>); the <funding-source>Manchester CRUK Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre</funding-source> (<award-id>C1467/A15578</award-id>); the <funding-source>Manchester Cancer Research Centre</funding-source> (<award-id>A12197</award-id>); <funding-source>CRUK Lung Cancer Centre of Excellence</funding-source> (<award-id>C5759/A20465</award-id>); <funding-source>European Union CHEMORES</funding-source> FP6 (<award-id>LSHG-CT-2007-037665</award-id>); and travel grants to Guilia Bertonlini from Associazione Italiana Ricerca Cancro, Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, and Progetto Professionalit&#x000e0;_Fondazione Banca del Monte della Lombardia.</p></sec><sec id="mdw122_s6"><title>disclosure</title><p>The authors have declared no conflicts of interest.</p></sec>
