However, the fossil resources are diminishing whilst demand for chemicals is ever increasing. The environmental pollution associated with discarding spent chemicals and materials is also gaining focus both on political and consumer levels. To address this issue a lot of effort is going into developing novel biotechnological strategies for producing chemicals from renewable feedstocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], such as sugar cane, starch, biomass hydrolysates, agricultural waste, etc.</p><p>One of the chemicals that have attracted particular interest is 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HP), which can serve as a precursor for acrylic acid and its derivatives. Additionally 3HP can be polymerized alone or in compositions to obtain biodegradable polyesters. The world annual production of acrylic acid and its esters is anticipated to increase to 6 million tons by 2017 (&#x0201c;Acrylic Acid: 2014 World Market Outlook and Forecast up to 2018&#x0201d;, January 2014). Acrylates find application in a wide range of consumer products, e.g. personal care products, adhesives, coatings and paints, and the annual total market size is exceeding USD12 billion. One particularly important application of acrylic acid is for the production of superabsorbent polymers, which constitute a significant part of baby diapers and incontinence products.</p><p>3HP occurs naturally in the metabolism of some thermophilic archaea as an intermediate of 3HP-dependent carbon assimilation cycle. In these organisms, 3HP is synthesized from malonyl-CoA via combined action of malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR, EC 1.2.1.75) and 3-hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.298 or EC 1.1.1.59)/3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.31) or via a bi-functional MCR (EC 1.2.1.75/1.1.1.298) alone. Recombinant production of 3HP in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, expressing MCR from <italic>Chloroflexus aurantiacus</italic>, was first reported by Cargill, Incorporated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and was further developed and demonstrated on a pilot scale by OPX Biotechnologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Production of 3HP by <italic>E. coli</italic> is, however, hampered by the requirement to produce at pH close to neutral, which results in production of dissociated form of 3HP. It is therefore advantageous to use an acid-tolerant host, such as yeast, as it is hereby possible to directly produce the acid form of 3HP. We recently described the application of a synthetic pathway towards 3HP via &#x003b2;-alanine intermediate in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, and the final strain produced 3HP at a titer of 13.7&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.3&#x000a0;g&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> with a 0.14&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.0 C-mol&#x000a0;C-mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> yield on glucose in controlled fed-batch fermentation in defined mineral medium at pH 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Production of 3HP via MCR in baker&#x02019;s yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was also reported. The final strain produced up to 0.5&#x000a0;g&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in shake flask cultivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Our aim was to examine if it was possible to further improve the 3HP production via malonyl-CoA pathway through a rational metabolic engineering approach. In the future the malonyl-CoA and &#x003b2;-alanine routes towards 3HP could be combined in one strain.</p><p>Here we describe the metabolic engineering of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> for high-level production of 3HP via the MCR pathway and characterize the production strain by <sup>13</sup>C flux and transcription analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Production of 3HP in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> by overexpression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and MCR</title><p>For establishing 3HP production via the malonyl-CoA pathway in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, we decided to co-express the gene encoding the bi-functional MCR from <italic>C. aurantiacus</italic> (<italic>CaMCR</italic>) together with the mutated acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc1<sup><italic>S659A,S1157A</italic></sup>). Acc1p is involved in the conversion of acetyl-CoA into malonyl-CoA, and is the rate-limiting step in fatty acid biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The double mutations in Acc1p were shown to enhance the activity and improve the production of malonyl-CoA-derived compounds, such as 3HP and fatty acid ethyl esters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In this study, we over-expressed <italic>CaMCR</italic> and mutated <italic>ACC1</italic><sup><italic>S659A,S1157A</italic></sup> (<italic>ACC1</italic><sup><italic>**</italic></sup>) genes under the control of <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>PGK1</italic></sub> and <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>TEF1</italic></sub> promoters, respectively, in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. We investigated the effect of expression levels of <italic>CaMCR</italic> and <italic>ACC1</italic><sup><italic>**</italic></sup> on 3HP production by introducing these genes into <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> via either a 2&#x003bc;-based episomal plasmid, a single integration plasmid, or a multiple integration plasmid (TY4-plasmid). The TY4-plasmid is designed for integrating in multiple copies at long terminal repeats (LTRs) of retrotransposon of the TY4 family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As the transformants derived from either episomal or multiple integrative plasmids are expected to have different copy numbers of the expression vector, we randomly screened a minimum of 12 clones to test for 3HP production (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The resulting strains were evaluated for 3HP production on defined mineral medium containing glucose as the sole carbon source (imitating a batch process), and on feed-in-time medium for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to simulate 3HP production in a fed-batch process. The feed-in-time medium contains higher polysaccharide and an enzyme, which degrades the polysaccharide and releases glucose. The amount of the enzyme defines the rate of glucose release and was chosen here to obtain a carbon-limited cultivation. Single integration of <italic>CaMCR</italic> and <italic>ACC1</italic><sup><italic>**</italic></sup> into the genome led to improvement of 3HP titer in both defined mineral and feed-in-time media compared to 3HP titer by the strain carrying genes on an episomal plasmid. Furthermore, expression of <italic>CaMCR</italic> and <italic>ACC1</italic><sup><italic>**</italic></sup> in multiple copies via TY4-mediated integration had a further positive effect and led to a threefold improvement of 3HP titer, when compared to a <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain bearing a single integrative vector with the same genes. However, a significant decrease in the maximum specific growth rate (&#x003bc;<sub>max</sub>) was also observed in the strain carrying TY4-<italic>CaMCR</italic>&#x02013;<italic>ACC1</italic><sup><italic>**</italic></sup> compared to the reference strain (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1). We then used qPCR to analyze the copy number of <italic>CaMCR</italic>&#x02013;<italic>ACC1</italic><sup><italic>**</italic></sup> genes in the strains with TY4-integration and found that the inserted genes were present at 3&#x02013;4 copies, whereas only 0.5&#x02013;1 copy of the inserted genes was detected in strains carrying an episomal plasmid (in addition to the inserted <italic>ACC1</italic><sup><italic>**</italic></sup> gene, also the native <italic>ACC1</italic> gene was detected, therefore the total copy number of <italic>ACC1</italic> was always one copy higher than of the <italic>CaMCR</italic>). These results show that the copy number of <italic>CaMCR</italic> and <italic>ACC1</italic><sup><italic>**</italic></sup> had a distinct effect on 3HP production and the cellular growth. The copy number of the genes below one for the episomal plasmid points to strain instability and population heterogeneity. The episomal vector has a large size of 17&#x000a0;kb and may be difficult to maintain in yeast.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Production of 3HP by <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> expressing <italic>CaMCR</italic> and <italic>ACC1</italic>

The strains are more stable and homogenous expression of all genes within the yeast population was observed. Furthermore, optimization of the critical enzymes in the pathway by multiple integration at TY4 elements has been reported to result in fourfold increase 3HP production via the &#x003b2;-alanine pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In this study, the impaired growth in the strain carrying TY4-<italic>CaMCR</italic>&#x02013;<italic>ACC1</italic><sup><italic>**</italic></sup> might be caused by the higher activity of Acc1p and MCR, which likely resulted in high metabolic burden for the cells. Similar effect of high Acc1p activity on the cellular growth has been previously reported in both yeast and bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, the higher activity of MCR could also result in competition with the fatty acid biosynthesis for the substrate, malonyl-CoA. A possible solution to this problem could be dynamic control of expression of the biosynthetic genes, where they are mostly expressed in the production phase, but not in the growth phase.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Improvement of 3HP production by increasing the supply of acetyl-CoA precursor</title><p>It was previously shown that overexpression of acetyl-CoA synthase derived from <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> (<italic>SEacs</italic><sup><italic>L641P</italic></sup>) and of the native aldehyde dehydrogenase (<italic>ALD6</italic>) enhanced the flux towards acetyl-CoA and resulted in higher isoprenoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] or 3HP concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].

Different approaches have previously been reported to improve the supply of NADPH in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Heterologous expression of non-phosphorylating NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPN, EC 1.2.1.9) has been shown to improve bioethanol and 3HP production and minimize glycerol synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

Verho and coworkers reported that <italic>KlGAPDH</italic> has equal kinetics for both NADP and NAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Additionally, we tried to reduce the potential futile cycle between the endogenous GAPDH and the introduced GAPDH by lowering the level of endogenous GAPDH activity.

On the other hand, the change in 3HP/glycerol was less pronounced when the strains were cultivated in feed-in-time medium. This was also expected because under carbon-limited conditions more carbon enters the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway, effectively resulting in higher NADPH production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The best isolates among the strains without cofactor engineering &#x02018;<italic>TDH3</italic>&#x02019; and &#x02018;<italic>tdh3::CaGAPDH</italic>&#x02019; strains were named ST3580 and ST687, respectively. The intracellular concentrations of redox cofactors in ST3580, ST687 and non-producing strain (ST1) were further investigated. The 3HP-producing strain ST3580 strain had slightly lower NADPH/NADP ratio than the non-producing strain. By engineering the NADPH cofactor in strain ST687, the ratio between NADPH and NADP was significantly increased (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S3).

In this study, we performed <sup>13</sup>C metabolic flux analysis on the two <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains, non-producing strain (ST1) and the best 3HP-producing strain (ST687), to gain a better understanding of the influence of 3HP biosynthesis on the flux distribution. Both strains were cultivated in carbon-limited chemostats at 0.04&#x000a0;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> either with 100&#x000a0;% 1-<sup>13</sup>C labeled glucose or a mixture of 20&#x000a0;% U&#x02013;<sup>13</sup>C-labelled and 80&#x000a0;% natural-labelled glucose.

The flux values obtained from <sup>13</sup>C analysis were used as constraints for a genome-scale model, where redox balance was enforced and the residual fluxes were calculated. The fluxes in the central carbon metabolism in the ST687 and ST1 strains are presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S7. Notably, the biomass yield on glucose was significantly lower for the producing strain (0.40&#x000a0;g DW&#x000a0;g glucose<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) in comparison to 0.50 in ST1 strain. The decrease cannot be accounted for by 3HP flux alone (0.02&#x000a0;g 3HP&#x000a0;g glucose<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), and hence there must also be more carbon dioxide produced by the ST687. The flux through the PP pathway and TCA cycle was increased by correspondingly 23 and 12&#x000a0;% in the ST687 strain, which is consistent with transcriptional analysis showing up-regulation of several genes in the PP and TCA pathways in the ST687 strain.</p><p>The flux from acetate into acetyl-CoA was increased in ST687, which might be due to a combination of overexpression of <italic>ACS</italic> and down-regulation of acetate transporter <italic>ADY2</italic>, whereas higher acetate secretion was observed in the ST1 strain. In ST687, most of the acetate was converted into 3HP and biomass. On the other hand, the flux from pyruvate into acetate dropped to nearly half in ST687 even though the corresponding genes were overexpressed.</p><p>The combined data on physiological characterization, transcriptome and flux distribution revealed several unexpected consequences of the undertaken metabolic engineering strategies. Firstly, in spite of our attempts to provide more NADPH by exchanging a native NAD-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase with a heterologous NADP-dependent version, the redox imbalance has not been completely resolved. Strain ST687 continued to produce glycerol in cohort with 3HP production. Even more surprisingly, the two major pathways for NADPH regeneration, PP pathway and isocitrate dehydrogenases, were transcriptionally upregulated and carried higher flux in the engineered strain. The ST687 strain had increased ratios of NADPH/NADP, but also of NADH/NAD. These findings underline the complexity and high connectivity of the redox metabolism and the difficulties associated with engineering of the redox metabolism. Secondly, we found that the flux from pyruvate towards acetate actually dropped 2.5-fold, against expectations. The transcriptome data showed that all the genes in the pyruvate dehydrogenase by-pass pathway were highly upregulated and the flux from acetate to acetyl-CoA increased, but there was obviously a limitation in pyruvate conversion into acetate.</p><p>These findings have implications both on the direction of the next metabolic engineering efforts and on the process considerations. The chosen carbon-limited feeding strategy limits the overflow metabolism and hence leads to very low flux to acetate. If a batch-type fermentation mode is chosen instead, then a significant part of carbon will be lost to ethanol and hence ethanol formation must be prevented. This can be achieved either by deletion of the numerous native alcohol dehydrogenases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] or by deletion of pyruvate decarboxylases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], both very challenging strategies, the latter would also require installing a different pathway for cytosolic acetyl-CoA supply for 3HP, e.g. a recently described cytosolic pyruvate dehydrogenase complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. On the other hand, using batch cultivation would lead to low flux via PP pathway, which may reduce the supply of NADPH cofactor for 3HP production. To avoid glycerol formation, deletion of <italic>GPD2</italic> can be considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], however if the redox imbalance is not restored, the strain will suffer from reduced growth rate and viability and will have decreased tolerance to osmotic stress. For further metabolic engineering, many factors must be taken into consideration and preferably multiple potential strategies should be investigated. Dynamic regulation of 3HP expression and growth-essential genes may allow decoupling the growth and production phases and hence lead to higher product titer, rate and yield.</p><p>Our study yet again demonstrated that in strain engineering it is not sufficient to look at the resulting product titers, but one needs more in-depth characterization of the cellular physiology and cellular components and fluxes in order to follow and push forward the strain development.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Here we engineered and optimized 3HP production in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> via the malonyl-CoA pathway.

To minimize the risk of back-contamination a fused silica capillary (ID 100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m Optronis, Kehl, Germany) was used for feed supply. The harvest pump was connected to a needle (ID 0.8&#x000a0;mm, L 120&#x000a0;mm), which was positioned at the corresponding height of 10&#x000a0;mL to maintain a constant liquid volume.
