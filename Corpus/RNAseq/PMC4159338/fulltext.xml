A growing number of gene variants have been identified which are strongly associated with an altered risk to develop AMD. Nevertheless, gene-based biomarkers which could be dysregulated at defined stages of AMD may point toward key processes in disease mechanism and thus may support efforts to design novel treatment regimens for this blinding disorder. Circulating microRNAs (cmiRNAs) which are carried by nanosized exosomes or microvesicles in blood plasma or serum, have been recognized as valuable indicators for various age-related diseases. We therefore aimed to elucidate the role of cmiRNAs in AMD by genome-wide miRNA expression profiling and replication analyses in 147 controls and 129 neovascular AMD patients. We identified three microRNAs differentially secreted in neovascular (NV) AMD (hsa-mir-301-3p, p<sub>corrected</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5.6*10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>, hsa-mir-361-5p, p<sub>corrected</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8.0*10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> and hsa-mir-424-5p, p<sub>corrected</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;9.6*10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>). A combined profile of the three miRNAs revealed an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.727 and was highly associated with NV AMD (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.2*10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>). To evaluate subtype-specificity, an additional 59 AMD cases with pure unilateral or bilateral geographic atrophy (GA) were analyzed for microRNAs hsa-mir-301-3p, hsa-mir-361-5p, and hsa-mir-424-5p. While we found no significant differences between GA AMD and controls neither individually nor for a combined microRNAs profile, hsa-mir-424-5p levels remained significantly higher in GA AMD when compared to NV (p<sub>corrected</sub>&#x0003c;0.005). Pathway enrichment analysis on genes predicted to be regulated by microRNAs hsa-mir-301-3p, hsa-mir-361-5p, and hsa-mir-424-5p, suggests canonical TGF&#x003b2;, mTOR and related pathways to be involved in NV AMD. In addition, knockdown of hsa-mir-361-5p resulted in increased neovascularization in an <italic>in</italic><italic>vitro</italic> angiogenesis assay.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported in part by grants from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (WE 1259/19-1 to BHFW, FL 658/4-1 to MF), Novartis Pharma (grant #3625340) and the Alcon Research Institute (to BHFW).

It is a degenerative disorder of the central retina involving predominantly the rod photoreceptors, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), Bruchs membrane and the underlying choriocapillaris <xref rid="pone.0107461-Fritsche1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The disease aetiology is complex and is influenced by a combination of multiple genetic susceptibility factors and environmental components.</p><p>An early sign of AMD is the appearance of drusen, yellowish extracellular deposits of protein and lipid material within and beneath the RPE. Advanced AMD manifests essentially as two distinct late-stage lesions &#x02013; geographic atrophy (GA) and neovascular (NV) AMD. GA occurs in up to 50% of cases and is clinically defined as a discrete area of RPE atrophy with visible choroidal vessels in the absence of neovascularization in the same eye <xref rid="pone.0107461-Fritsche1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0107461-VanNewkirk1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. It may or may not involve the fovea. NV AMD describes the development of new blood vessels beneath and within the retina and is characterized by serous or hemorrhagic detachment of either the RPE or the sensory retina, the presence of subretinal fibrous tissue and eventually widespread RPE atrophy. Progression to visual loss can be rapid in NV AMD <xref rid="pone.0107461-Swaroop1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>The precise aetiology of AMD is still not fully understood, although risk factors such as age, smoking, and genetic components are known to strongly contribute to disease development <xref rid="pone.0107461-Fritsche1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In Western societies, AMD reveals an age-dependent prevalence of almost 1 in 5 people aged 85 and above <xref rid="pone.0107461-Jonasson1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0107461-VanNewkirk1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Across a number of epidemiological studies, smoking has consistently been associated with increased risk of developing advanced AMD with an estimated odds ratio of approximately 2 <xref rid="pone.0107461-Tomany1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The exact mechanism, however, by which smoking affects the retina is unknown. Twin studies and familial aggregation studies suggested a significant genetic contribution of up to 70% in disease risk <xref rid="pone.0107461-Seddon1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Subsequently, several genes have been implicated in AMD pathology by candidate gene studies as well as genome wide association studies. Genetic variants in complement factor H (CFH) and ARMS2/HtrA Serine Protease 1 (HTRA1) were found to be strongly associated with odds ratios over 2.5 per risk allele. In addition, multiple medium to low effect size gene variants were discovered in a large number of loci across the genome. A recent meta-analysis of genome wide association studies found a total of 19 independently associated loci by comparing over 17,000 cases and 60,000 controls <xref rid="pone.0107461-Fritsche2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>The combined effect of the major risk variants on AMD was estimated by modelling risk scores <xref rid="pone.0107461-Grassmann1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The multiple logistic regression model was found to have an area under the curve (AUC) of about 82%, which is suitable for classifying individuals in high and low risk groups. Accordingly, roughly 50% of AMD cases and 50% of healthy controls can now reliably be predicted. However, a large proportion of AMD cases do not have the expected genetic risk profile despite their given disease status. Consequently, other components, genetic or environmental, may influence disease development. This makes it crucial to identify these components possibly by defining disease biomarkers correlating with the underlying genetic or environmental factors and eventually reflecting a defined disease stage.</p><p>Recently, circulating microRNAs (cmiRNAs) were found in blood plasma or blood serum where they are carried by nanosized exosomes or microvesicles <xref rid="pone.0107461-Gallo1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107461-Turchinovich1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Origin and effects of these cmiRNAs are unclear although some studies suggested functional involvement in cell-to-cell signalling <xref rid="pone.0107461-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In general, cmiRNAs are potential biomarkers which can be used for diagnostics and prognostics of human diseases <xref rid="pone.0107461-Lsser1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Additionally, synthetic microRNAs in artificial exsosomes could be applicable for therapeutic approaches by modulating cmiRNA levels.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of cmiRNAs in AMD and performed a genome-wide expression profiling in patients affected by late stage neovascular manifestation. Such analyses provide a promising approach to define biomarkers for AMD which could be helpful to identify as of yet unknown gene targets involved in defined aspects of AMD pathology. Such biomarkers could also serve as the long sought-after variable needed to monitor treatment effects in future clinical trials for AMD.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>We applied a three stage design to identify significantly associated cmiRNAs.

We identified three cmiRNAs (hsa-mir-301a-3p, hsa-mir-361-5p, and hsa-mir-424-5p) which were significantly altered in NV AMD patients compared to AMD-free controls. Even when conditioned on covariates such as age, gender, smoking or genetic risk scores computed from known AMD-associated variants, the three cmiRNAs showed little alteration in their association strength, indicating a true association with late stage NV AMD. In contrast, there was no association of cmiRNAs hsa-mir-301a-3p, hsa-mir-361-5p, or hsa-mir-424-5p with GA AMD, suggesting subtype-specific cmiRNA profiles for late stage AMD. A global screening strategy similar to the one applied in this study may be suited to eventually characterize a GA AMD specific cmiRNA profile.</p><p>Our initial discovery study comprised 9 NV AMD cases and 9 matched controls and identified several cmiRNA candidates with altered expression levels although none reached statistical significance after adjustment for multiple testing (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;203 equivalent to the discovery of 203 cmiRNAs). A recent study compared cmiRNA levels in long-surviving versus short-surviving patients with lung cancer and found fold changes of significantly altered cmiRNAs between 1.60 and 7.15 <xref rid="pone.0107461-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and Cohen&#x02019;s effect sizes between 0.92 and 1.54 which are considered to be large <xref rid="pone.0107461-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Given the number of samples in our discovery study, we calculated the power to detect comparable effect sizes after adjustment for multiple testing between 4.2% and 33.2%. This would imply a power to identify between 4 and 33 cmiRNAs out of 100 in our discovery study at the assumed effect size or higher. To compensate for lower effect sizes, we increased our sample size to 276 individuals (129 NV cases and 147 AMD-free controls) in the replication and retested individually the top 10 cmiRNAs hits from discovery. This uncovered a statistically significant association of NV AMD with cmiRNAs hsa-mir-301a-3p, hsa-mir-361-5p, and hsa-mir-424-5p.</p><p>Bioinformatical pathway analysis for genes suggested to be regulated by the NV AMD associated cmiRNAs were performed with two independent programs including the miRSystem and mirPATH v2.0. Both revealed concurring results and implicated the TGF-&#x003b2; and mTOR pathways in neovascular AMD pathology. Interestingly, this is in agreement with a recently published GWAS which also implicated the TGF-&#x003b2; and the mTOR pathways in late stage AMD by identifying risk associated genetic variants near or within the genes encoding the transforming growth factor, beta receptor 1 (<italic>TGFBR1)</italic> and the vascular endothelial growth factor A (<italic>VEGFA)</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0107461-Fritsche2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107461-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The TGF-&#x003b2; as well as the mTOR pathway are involved in cellular responses to stress and injury and also regulate angiogenesis. Consequently, we performed <italic>in</italic>
<italic>vitro</italic> tube formation assays and reduced the levels of hsa-mir-424-5p, hsa-mir-301a-3p, and hsa-mir-361-5p by antisense oligoribonucleotides to evaluate the impact of decreased miRNA levels on angiogenesis. Knockdown efficiency reduced microRNA levels in the test system on average by about two-fold. Antisense treatment of hsa-mir-361-5p lead to a significant increase in tube formation and, thus, angiogenesis in vitro. Results for hsa-mir-424-5p and hsa-mir-301a-3p revealed a similar direction of effect but were not statistically significant due to correction for multiple testing. Together, the data are promising and support our bioinformatical analyses.</p><p>Additionally, pathways closely related to the mTOR pathway were implicated by our analysis including WNT signaling, focal adhesion, neutrophin signaling and the insulin pathway. These pathways are involved in (neural) cell survival and therefore are reasonable candidate pathways for the pathogenesis of AMD. However, so far no genetic association with late stage AMD was observed for any genes associated with these signaling pathways. In this context, it should be noted that until now only few studies evaluated a genetic association for progression and severity of AMD <xref rid="pone.0107461-Leveziel1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107461-Klein1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. These studies mainly focused on strong (and known) signals associated with increased risk for AMD and therefore may have missed possible existing associations. The present study has now identified cmiRNAs hsa-mir-301a-3p, hsa-mir-361-5p, and hsa-mir-424-5p as new biomarkers for late stage neovascular AMD. Furthermore, our data show that these biomarkers are not associated with GA AMD implying that different biomarkers and thus different biological pathways are likely involved in subtype-specific manifestations of late stage AMD. If confirmed, this could have major implications for designing treatment regiments for AMD.</p><p>A recent study investigated a treatment option for patients with stroke by increasing a disease-related reduction in plasma levels of hsa-mir-424-5p <xref rid="pone.0107461-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In an inducible mouse model of acute stroke which also revealed a down-regulation of hsa-mir-424-5p in plasma as well as in brain, lentiviral overexpression of hsa-mir-424-5p in the murine brain prior to induction of ischemic stroke significantly lowered the infarct volume as well as the brain edema levels <xref rid="pone.0107461-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. A similar approach could be envisioned for treating AMD lesions. The identification of cmiRNAs that are dysregulated in NV AMD patients, now offers a number of novel starting points for therapeutic regimens. For example, such targets could be the genes that are regulated by the cmiRNAs or, alternatively, could directly address the dysregulated cmiRNAs itself. Specifically, the latter approach would initially entail prescreening of patients for altered cmiRNAs levels. Reduced expression of a diagnostic cmiRNA (as pre-microRNA or mature microRNA) could be supplemented by lentiviral transduction, nano-particle aided transfection or by delivery of the dysregulated cmiRNA via synthetic microRNAs in artificial exsosomes. Therapies to modify up- or down-regulated genes are also conceivable. This could be done by using small molecules to influence gene activity <xref rid="pone.0107461-Koh1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, protein activity and stability <xref rid="pone.0107461-Hagan1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> or by targeting proteins or interacting proteins with specific antibodies <xref rid="pone.0107461-Scott1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>In summary, this study has identified three cmiRNAs with a significantly altered expression profile in the serum of NV AMD patients when compared to AMD-free control individuals. This finding opens up a number of new avenues in understanding disease mechanisms and designing targeted treatment options. Another important aspect of our finding pertains to monitoring treatment effects in clinical trial settings. Although proof of concept is still waranted, measuring drug responses as a means of measuring changes in the cmiRNA profil from blood samples of AMD patients may proof a direct and little invasive approach in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study followed the tenets of the declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Review Board at the University of Regensburg, Germany (ID: 12-101-0241), University of Bonn, Germany and University of Cologne, Germany.

To isolate RNA, tubes were thawed at room temperature on a rocker and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1500 rcf at 4&#x000b0;C. The RNA isolation was carried out with the mirVANA microRNA isolation kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) as described elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0107461-Kosaka1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Briefly, 300 &#x000b5;l of the supernatant were mixed with 600 &#x000b5;l of binding/lysis buffer. Then, 90&#x000b5;l of microRNA homogenate additive was added, thoroughly mixed for 30s and incubated on ice for 10 minutes. An equal amount of acid/phenol/chloroform (Ambion) was then added to each aliquot and vortexed for 1 minute at maximum setting. The solution was spun for 10 minutes at 10,000 g at room temperature. The resulting aqueous (upper) phase was mixed with 1.25 volumes of 100% ACS grade ethanol and passed through a mirVANA column in sequential 700 &#x000b5;l steps. The columns were then washed according to the manufactures protocol and the RNA was eluted with 50 &#x000b5;l nuclease-free water (preheated to 95&#x000b0;C).</p><p>For the Cologne samples, RNA isolation from blood serum was carried out with the miRNeasy Serum/Plasma kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations.

The resulting cDNA libraries were purified by AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter), and their concentrations and sizes distribution were determined on an Agilent BioAnalyzer DNA high-sensitivity Chip (Agilent Technologies). Emulsion PCR and enrichment of cDNA conjugated particles were performed with an Ion OneTouch 200 Template Kit v2 DL (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The final particles were loaded on an Ion 316 chip and sequenced on a Personal Genome Machine with 200 bp read length (Life Technologies).</p><p>The data obtained were analyzed with the mirDEEP2 package <xref rid="pone.0107461-Friedlaender1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Briefly, all reads were mapped to the human genome. Reads that failed to align were excluded. Remaining reads were then mapped to the pre-microRNA and microRNA sequences obtained from mirbase.org (Release 19, August 2012) and quantified. Reads per microRNA were normalized to the overall number of reads and normalized to 100,000 reads. The data were transformed with the natural logarithm to obtain a normal distribution of expression values. In order to account for batch effects in the data, we employed an empirical Bayesian batch effect correction algorithm known as ComBat <xref rid="pone.0107461-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. For each microRNA, mean values of cases were compared to mean values of controls via t-test.

Briefly, 10 &#x000b5;l of purified cmiRNA solution were modified by <italic>E. coli</italic> Poly (A) Polymerase I (E-PAP) by the addition of a polyA tail (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). Reverse transcription was performed with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen Carlsbad, CA) and a Universal RT oligonucleotide primer, which contains a polyT stretch of DNA that binds to the newly synthesized polyA tail (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107461.s006">Table S3</xref></bold>). The RT solution was diluted 1&#x02236;50, of which 4&#x02236;&#x000b5;l were used per qRT-PCR reaction. Each qRT-PCR master mix was prepared according to the protocol of the Power SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA, USA) and run on an ABI Viia-7 (Applied Biosystems, Paisley, UK). Each microRNA was assayed in triplicates. Primers that performed poorly (&#x0003c;50% qRT-PCR efficiency) were excluded from further analysis. We further excluded measurements with a standard deviation greater than 0.4 Ct values in the triplicates. In order to normalize the Ct-values according to the amount of isolated RNA and reverse transcription efficiency, we used hsa-mir-451-5p as a housekeeping cmiRNA. This microRNA showed the least variance between cases and controls and within each group in our discovery study and was therefore regarded suitable as a housekeeper. The normalized Ct values of each individual were then normalized versus the median of the Ct values of the controls. We considered associated cmiRNAs with an odds ratio greater than 2 or lower than 0.5 for further replication.</p><p>The standard student&#x02019;s t-tests was applied to evaluate a statistically significant association as implemented in R <xref rid="pone.0107461-R1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In the final dataset, we adjusted the observed raw p-values (p<sub>uncorrected</sub>) by a conservative Bonferroni correction (p<sub>corrected</sub>).

We used the default settings in miRSystem to identify target genes and to find canonical KEGG pathways. With mirPATH v2.0, targets predicted by microT-CDS were selected with a threshold of 0.7. The intersection of pathways which showed an involvement of all investigated microRNAs (p-value threshold: 0.005, with Conservative Stats) was considered. We excluded KEGG pathways with more than 200 genes to increase specificity and to exclude pathways considered to be too general. Furthermore, we excluded validated cmiRNA targets as well as cancer pathways such as prostate cancer (hsa05215) or glioma (hsa05214), as the majority of the cmiRNA work has been in the field of oncology and thus cancer pathways are expected by design to be among the top findings.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Classification of cases and controls</title><p>Area under the curve (AUC) measurements were carried out with the function lroc from the package &#x0201c;epicalc&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0107461-Virasakdi1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.
