This is seen clearly in both the viability of plants carrying knockouts for key recombination and DNA repair genes, which are lethal in vertebrates, and in the impact of telomere dysfunction. Telomerase knockout mice show accelerated ageing and severe developmental phenotypes, with effects on both highly proliferative and on more quiescent tissues, while cell death in Arabidopsis <italic>tert</italic> mutants is mostly restricted to actively dividing meristematic cells. Through phenotypic and whole-transcriptome RNAseq studies, we present here an analysis of the response of Arabidopsis plants to the continued presence of telomere damage. Comparison of second-generation and seventh-generation <italic>tert</italic> mutant plants has permitted separation of the effects of the absence of the telomerase enzyme and the ensuing chromosome damage. In addition to identifying a large number of genes affected by telomere damage, many of which are of unknown function, the striking conclusion of this study is the clear difference observed at both cellular and transcriptome levels between the ways in which mammals and plants respond to chronic telomeric damage.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was partly financed by a European Union research grant (LSHG-CT-2005-018785), a French Government ANR grant (ANR-07-BLAN- 0068), the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, the Universit&#x000e9; Blaise Pascal, the Universit&#x000e9; d&#x02019;Auvergne, and the Institut National de la Sant&#x000e9; et la Recherche Medicale.

Studies of the DDR in animals are however complicated by the lethality of knockouts of many of the key genes. In striking contrast, Arabidopsis (and presumably other plants) is able to develop, grow and differentiate in presence of significant genome damage. This difference is both surprising and of real biological interest.</p><p>The genomes of the majority of studied eukaryotic organisms consist of linear chromosomes, and each chromosome thus has two ends. The proper replication and protection of these chromosome-ends poses particular problems to the cell and these have been solved by the evolution of a specialised nucleoprotein structure, the telomere. A number of telomeric proteins have been identified and these act to &#x0201c;cap&#x0201d; the telomere and to &#x0201c;hide&#x0201d; it from the cellular DNA repair and recombination machinery. Vertebrate telomeres are protected principally by Shelterin, a complex of six telomeric proteins (TRF1, TRF2, POT1, TIN2, TPP1 and RAP1). These prevent inappropriate recombination and fusion between telomeres, and also play roles in telomere replication and regulation of telomere length <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-Palm1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-Martnez1">[2]</xref>. Although its telomeric DNA is similar to that of mammals, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> has a somewhat simpler protection complex consisting principally of the Cdc13, Stn1 and Ten1 proteins (referred to as the CST complex) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-Garvik1">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-Shore1">[5]</xref>.</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and in plants in general, only a subset of the vertebrate shelterin components has been identified (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-Amiard1">[6]</xref>). The implication of CST in telomere maintenance (either by direct protection or help in replication) is however clearly established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-Miyake1">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-Leehy1">[9]</xref>. Plant telomeres thus seem to be at the crossroads between <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, which has only CST as a capping complex, and vertebrates, which use both Shelterin and the CST complex for telomere capping and correct telomeric replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-GiraudPanis1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-Price1">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Unprotected telomeres are recognised by the cell as DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and lead to the activation of the DNA-damage response (DDR), chromosome fusions, rearranged chromosomes and cell death. In mammals, this signalling is carried out by three protein kinases belonging to the PI3K-like protein kinases (PIKK) family: ATM, ATR and DNA-PKcs. Activated PIKK phosphorylate many targets, activating pathways for the maintenance of genome integrity and the elimination of genetically unstable cells, mainly through the activation of the p53 transcription factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-Matsuoka1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-Rozan1">[13]</xref>. This role is fulfilled by the SOG1 transcription factor in Arabidopsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-Yoshiyama1">[14]</xref>. ATM and ATR have been characterized in Arabidopsis, but no DNA-PKcs gene has been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-Templeton1">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-Culligan1">[17]</xref>. Studies of the roles of ATM and ATR in H2AX phosphorylation show that one or both of these are necessary and sufficient for activation of the DDR in Arabidopsis, confirming the absence of a third kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-Amiard2">[18]</xref>. Only ATR is required for signalling of deprotected telomeres in Arabidopsis <italic>cst</italic> mutants, while principally ATM, but also ATR, is activated by eroded telomeres in <italic>tert</italic> mutant plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-Amiard3">[19]</xref>. ATR is required for the induction of programmed cell death allowing the maintenance of genomic integrity through elimination of genetically unstable cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-Amiard3">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-Boltz1">[20]</xref>.</p><p>The specialised telomere structure also acts to counteract DNA erosion arising from the inability of DNA polymerases to fully replicate the ends of linear chromosomes. This is compensated for by the telomerase, a specialised reverse transcriptase that extends chromosome 3&#x02032; DNA ends by adding repeats of telomeric DNA using its RNA subunit as template. In the absence of telomerase, telomere erosion acts as a biological &#x0201c;clock&#x0201d;, limiting the proliferative potential of cells and playing a major role in cellular ageing and protection against cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-Shay1">[21]</xref>. Absence of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) in Arabidopsis leads to the progressive erosion of telomeric DNA sequences, which, in turn, results in telomere uncapping and increasingly severe genetic instability accompanied by visible developmental defects and reduced fertility in the fourth or fifth mutant generations. These become progressively more severe in succeeding generations, resulting in problems in growth and development and in complete sterility by the tenth or eleventh generation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-Riha1">[22]</xref>. The effects of telomere erosion in mammals are also dramatic. Mice deficient for TERT exhibit reduced fertility and progressive defects in highly proliferative organs in the 3<sup>rd</sup> generation and embryonic developmental defects and sterility in the 6<sup>th</sup> generation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-Blasco1">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-Herrera1">[26]</xref>. The most striking difference is that plants harbouring short telomeres have an extended life span and remain metabolically active while telomere dysfunction in mice induces metabolic and mitochondrial compromise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-Sahin1">[27]</xref>.</p><p>To date, the specific plant mechanisms involved in this response are not known. Taking advantage of the progressive appearance of the phenotypic effects in succeeding generations of Arabidopsis <italic>tert</italic> mutants, we present here phenotypic and whole-transcriptome RNAseq analyses separating the effects of the absence of telomerase (in both early- and late-generation <italic>tert</italic> mutants) and the resulting genome damage (only in late-generations).

Poly(A) transcripts were purified, and double-stranded cDNA synthesis was performed using oligo(dT) priming for first-strand synthesis. cDNA was fragmented into 50- to 200-bp fragments through nebulization, followed by end repair, addition of 3&#x02032; adenine nucleotides, ligation of adapters, gel purification to isolate fragments of 150 to 500 bp, and PCR amplification. For quality control analysis, an aliquot of each CTL was cloned into the TOPO plasmid, and 5 to 10 clones were sequenced using capillary sequencing. The CTLs were sequenced on the Illumina Genome Analyzer, generating 18 to 20 million reads of 100 bases in length per sample.

As underlined by the authors of the mouse study, this occurs not only in proliferative tissues, where roles of p53 in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis are well established, but also in more quiescent organs such as heart and brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-Sahin1">[27]</xref>.

One possibility comes from the differences in regulation of telomerase expression, limited to dividing cells in plants, but not in mice. We note however, that in the context of our results and those of the mouse study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-Sahin1">[27]</xref>, telomerase is not expressed in any cells of the <italic>tert</italic> mutants. Thus in late generation mutants (G4 in mice and G7 in plants), the analysis is of the consequences of the absence of telomerase, not absence of the enzyme itself. Further studies of specific cell types in early generation plants (G2 plants) will be needed to respond to the question of differing effects of the absence of telomerase in dividing versus non-dividing cells of the plant. We suggest that the explanation of these strikingly different effects of telomere damage seems more likely to come from differences between plants and animals in the linkage between the surveillance of genome integrity and the apoptotic response. In mammals, the response to DNA damage is almost exclusively governed by p53, which regulates the critical choice between apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest and cell cycle progression. Notwithstanding the apparent absence of a plant p53 orthologue, the existence of DNA damage-induced, programmed cell death in plants has been well established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-Amiard3">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-Fulcher1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086220-Furukawa1">[48]</xref>, This response is dependant on the ATM and/or ATR kinases and recent work has shown the SOG1 transcription factor to be required downstream for induction of cell death.
