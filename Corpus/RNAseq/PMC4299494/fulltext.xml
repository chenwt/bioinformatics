advances in high-throughput data generation have transformed biology, the core of our biological
understanding, and hence data interpretation, is still predicated on human-defined pathways. Here,
we introduce an unbiased, pathway structure for genome-scale metabolic networks defined based on
principles of parsimony that do not mimic canonical human-defined textbook pathways. Instead, these
minimal pathways better describe multiple independent pathway-associated biomolecular interaction
datasets suggesting a functional organization for metabolism based on parsimonious use of cellular
components. We use the inherent predictive capability of these pathways to experimentally discover
novel transcriptional regulatory interactions in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> metabolism for
three transcription factors, effectively doubling the known regulatory roles for Nac and MntR. This
study suggests an underlying and fundamental principle in the evolutionary selection of pathway
structures; namely, that pathways may be minimal, independent, and segregated.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>constraint-based modeling</kwd><kwd>genetic interactions</kwd><kwd>pathway analysis</kwd><kwd>protein-protein interactions</kwd><kwd>transcriptional regulatory networks</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Historically, biochemical experimentation has defined pathways or functional groupings of
biomolecular interactions. Such pathways are foundational to human-curated databases, such as KEGG
(Kanehisa <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), BioCyc (Caspi
<italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), and Gene Ontology (Ashburner
<italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), are the basis for education in
biochemistry, and are broadly deployed for analyzing and conceptualizing complex biological datasets
(Khatri <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). However, the order of
discovery and perceived importance of cellular components has unavoidably introduced a man-made
bias. Pathway organization is thus often defined in a universal (rather than organism-specific)
manner, missing potential organism-specific physiology. It is unclear whether the currently used
pathway structures correctly account for observed interactions between the macromolecules needed to
carry out their function.</p><p>Systems biology has led to the elucidation and analysis of multiple cellular networks,
representing metabolism (Mo <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>;
Orth <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), transcriptional
regulation (Gama-Castro <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>),
protein-protein interactions (Han <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), and genetic interactions (Costanzo <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). These networks provide the opportunity to build unbiased pathway structures
using statistical or mechanistic algorithms. Statistical approaches have been employed to
high-throughput data and interaction networks to reconstruct the cellular component ontology of Gene
Ontology (Dutkowski <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). However,
such approaches were not meant to reconstruct the Biological Processes ontology and build pathways
(Dolinski &#x00026; Botstein, <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Mechanistic approaches include utilizing convex analysis with metabolic networks to automatically
define pathways. Genome-scale metabolic networks contain curated and systematized information about
all known biochemical moieties (metabolites) and transformations (reactions) of a particular
cell's metabolism encoded on its genome and described in experimental literature (Feist
<italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The stoichiometric matrix
(<bold>S</bold>) is a mathematical description of a genome-scale metabolic network, which can be
queried by many available modeling methods (Lewis <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). These models and the calculated reaction fluxes are typically studied under
a steady-state assumption (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>A). Thus, the full set of
potential steady-state reaction fluxes of a metabolic network is contained in the associated null
space of <bold>S</bold> (Palsson, <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). The basis vectors of
the null space have been previously shown to correspond to biochemical pathways providing a
fundamental connection between mathematical and biological concepts (Papin <italic>et al</italic>,
<xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). This connection has generated many attempts to
characterize the null space's contents using convex analysis (Clarke, <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>). Though readily applicable to small networks, it has been recognized for some
time that convex pathway definitions (e.g., extreme pathways (Schilling <italic>et al</italic>,
<xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) and elementary flux modes (Stelling <italic>et
al</italic>, <xref rid="b51" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>)) cannot be globally applied to
genome-scale networks as the enumeration of all such pathway vectors is not computationally feasible
(Yeung <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b59" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). More recently,
approaches have been developed to define subsets of metabolic pathways (de Figueiredo <italic>et
al</italic>, <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Kaleta <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Kelk <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), though these pathways do not describe the totality of phenotypic states.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Overview of the MinSpan algorithm</title><p><list list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p>A metabolic network is mathematically represented as a stoichiometric matrix (<bold>S</bold>).

the first time define the shortest, functional pathways for metabolism at the genome scale using
metabolic networks thereby describing the totality of steady-state phenotypes. We find that (1) the
minimal pathways are biologically supported by independent biomolecular interaction networks, (2)
the minimal pathways have stronger biological support than traditional human-defined metabolic
pathways, and (3) the minimal pathways guided experimental discovery of novel regulatory roles for
<italic>E. coli</italic> transcription factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Defining a minimal network pathway structure for metabolism</title><p>In this study, we introduce a network-based pathway framework called MinSpan that calculates the
set of shortest pathways (based on reaction number) that are linearly independent from each other
(Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>). The MinSpan pathways are the sparsest linear basis
of the null space of <bold>S</bold> that maintains the biological and thermodynamic constraints of
the network. The MinSpan pathways have a couple notable properties. First, unlike convex analysis
approaches (Llaneras &#x00026; Pico, <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), MinSpan pathways
can be computed for genome-scale metabolic networks. Second, the sparsest basis (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>B) maximally segregates the network into clusters of reactions,
genes, and proteins that function together. This property allows for an unbiased functional
segregation of cellular metabolism into biologically meaningful pathways.</p><p>The mathematical derivation of MinSpan is provided in the Materials and Methods. Here, we begin
with an illustrative example of MinSpan for a metabolic model that contains a simplified
representation of glycolysis and the TCA cycle (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>C). In
this example, <bold>S</bold> has dimensions (<italic>m</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>n</italic>) where
<italic>m</italic> = 14 metabolites and <italic>n</italic> = 18 reactions. The linear
basis for the null space (<bold>N</bold>) has dimensions (<italic>n</italic> &#x000d7;
<italic>n</italic> &#x02212; <italic>r</italic>) where <italic>r</italic> is the rank of
<bold>S</bold>. This <bold>S</bold> has rank (<italic>r</italic> = 14), meaning that the null
space is four dimensional (e.g., =18&#x02013;14). Thus, a set of four linearly independent
pathways through the network represents a linear basis for the null space of <bold>S</bold>. There
are numerous potential sets of linearly independent pathways for a metabolic network as the linear
basis of the null space is not unique. MinSpan chooses a set representing the shortest independent
pathways, and we later show that this linear basis is more biologically relevant than other linear
bases.</p><p>Running MinSpan on the simplified model converts the linear basis matrix (<bold>N</bold>) to a
MinSpan pathway matrix (<bold>P</bold>) that contains the four shortest, linearly independent
reaction pathways (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>B). The resulting pathways are
presented on the network map (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>D). MinSpan pathways #1
and #3 are similar to traditional metabolic pathways (e.g., pathways that look like glycolysis and
TCA cycle in this simplified network), while the last two MinSpan pathways do not mimic traditional
pathways. In the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Information</xref>,
we contrast MinSpan with past convex analysis methods (e.g., Extreme Pathways and Elementary Flux
Modes) and also present another illustrative but more complex example for <italic>E. coli</italic>
core metabolism.</p></sec><sec><title>MinSpan pathways are supported by independent biological datasets</title><p>MinSpan pathways are a fundamental and unbiased attempt to define pathways for metabolism. We
next determined whether MinSpan pathways have biological relevance. By definition, pathways
represent a grouping of biochemical transformations that can concurrently function. The biomolecular
machinery (e.g., genes and proteins) of metabolic pathways has been previously shown to
preferentially share interactions compared to components outside of pathways. Thus, the genes within
pathways preferentially contain positive genetic interactions (Kelley &#x00026; Ideker, <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) and are co-regulated (Wessely <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b57" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Furthermore, the proteins within pathways preferentially
contain protein-protein interactions (see Supplementary Information). Thus, we compared calculated
MinSpan pathways of genome-scale metabolic networks to the independent genome-scale networks of
protein-protein interactions (PPI) (Stark <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), genetic interactions (Costanzo <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), and transcriptional regulation (TRN) (Gama-Castro <italic>et al</italic>,
<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>We computed MinSpan pathways for the genome-scale metabolic networks of <italic>Escherichia
coli</italic> (Orth <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and
<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (Mo <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). They contain 750 and 332 pathways, respectively, representing the dimensions
of the two null spaces (see Supplementary Dataset S1). For each calculated MinSpan pathway, we
grouped the &#x0201c;gene-protein-reaction&#x0201d; (GPR) associations (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>A) of the metabolic reactions within that pathway (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>B). The GPR association is a set of Boolean rules describing the required genes,
transcripts, and proteins required to catalyze a metabolic reaction.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Correlation analysis shows MinSpan pathways are biologically relevant</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>A &#x0201c;Gene-protein-reaction&#x0201d; (GPR) associations describe the necessary genes and

more consistent with data-driven protein interaction, genetic interaction, and transcriptional
regulatory networks than human-defined pathways (KEGG, BioCyc, and GO), a least sparse null space
(MaxSpan), and randomly generated null spaces (RandSpan). Accuracy (<italic>y</italic>-axis) is
determined by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.

the MinSpan protein sets of a particular organism was an indication that the proteins share a PPI
and that a co-occurrence or co-absence of two genes implies that the genes positively interact or
that they are co-regulated by the same transcription factor (TF). We compared MinSpan pathways to
PPI and genetic interactions in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and the TRN of <italic>E.
coli</italic> as the datasets are most complete for those particular organisms (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>C).</p><p>By testing for significant Spearman correlation coefficients of co-occurrence or co-absence of
two proteins across the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> MinSpan pathway protein sets, 80% of
known yeast two-hybrid PPIs in metabolism (Stark <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) were found within MinSpan pathways (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>D). Similarly, MinSpan pathways were representative of positive genetic interactions
(Costanzo <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) in metabolism based
on significant correlations of genes across the <italic>S. cereivisae</italic> MinSpan pathway gene
sets (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>E).</p><p>We also used correlation analysis with <italic>E. coli</italic> pathway gene sets to assess
consistency with co-regulation by the same TF (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>F). The
pathways share over 6,700 co-regulated gene pairs within <italic>E. coli</italic> metabolism. Our
analysis quantitatively revealed two levels of regulation. First, local regulation (by TFs
regulating at most 30 metabolic genes, which accounts for 90% of <italic>E. coli</italic> TFs
regulating metabolism) is pathway based with TFs acting directly on linearly independent, minimal
pathways (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>F). Second, global regulation (TFs with more
than 30 regulated metabolic genes) involves many simultaneous cellular functions that are not just
metabolic and does not necessarily mimic the metabolic scaffold. Hence, MinSpan pathways
recapitulate local and intermediate regulatory mechanisms, but do not capture the less specific
roles of global regulators.</p></sec><sec><title>MinSpan pathways are more biologically supported than human-defined pathways</title><p>MinSpan pathways are highly consistent with PPI, positive genetic interactions, and local
transcriptional regulation implying their biological relevance. However, a key question arises: Are
there other pathway structures (human or network-defined) that are equally or better suited at
representing pathway-associated biomolecular data types?</p><p>To answer this question, we compared the biological relevance of MinSpan pathways to other
network pathway structures derived from the null space of the stoichiometric matrix. We calculated
the &#x0201c;MaxSpan&#x0201d; or a null space basis matrix with the least number of non-zero entries
(e.g., the longest pathways) and generated &#x0201c;RandSpan&#x0201d; or randomly generated null space
bases (<italic>n</italic> = 100) that had random criteria for the sparsity of the matrix. We
also compared MinSpan to commonly used human-defined pathway databases including: KEGG Modules
(Kanehisa <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), BioCyc (EcoCyc
(Keseler <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) for <italic>E.
coli</italic> and YeastCyc (Cherry <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>), and the Biological Processes ontology of Gene
Ontology (Ashburner <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) for both
organisms.</p><p>Surprisingly, repeating the correlation analysis for these alternative network and human-defined
pathways, we found that MinSpan pathways were generally more consistent with recapitulating
biomolecular interactions (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>D, E, &#x00026; F). For PPIs,
MinSpan was marginally, but not statistically, more consistent than other methods
(<italic>P</italic> = 0.0780 versus KEGG, <italic>P</italic> = 0.168 versus EcoCyc,
<italic>P</italic> = 0.901 versus Gene Ontology, two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test). As most
PPIs occur between proteins within the same metabolic complex or adjacent metabolic reactions, most
metabolic pathway structures should conserve PPIs. However, for positive genetic interactions
(<italic>P</italic> = 3.16e-3 versus KEGG, <italic>P</italic> = 0.133 versus YeastCyc,
<italic>P</italic> = 1.47e-3 versus Gene Ontology), local transcriptional regulation
(<italic>P</italic> = 2.79e-4 versus KEGG, <italic>P</italic> = 0.181 versus EcoCyc,
<italic>P</italic> = 2.35e-4 versus Gene Ontology), and intermediate transcriptional
regulation (<italic>P</italic> = 3.38e-3 versus KEGG, <italic>P</italic> = 3.97e-6
versus EcoCyc, <italic>P</italic> = 3.30e-18 versus Gene Ontology), MinSpan pathways were
statistically more representative of the interactions. None of the pathway structures were highly
consistent with global regulation.</p><p>These finding have two important implications. First, MinSpan pathways have more underlying
support from biomolecular data types than human-defined pathways suggesting an alternative and
fundamental modular organization of cellular metabolism. Defining pathways by human intuition and
interpretation is less representative of the biomolecular interactions. Second, a minimal pathway
structure is more biologically relevant than other potential linear bases of the null space
confirming the principle underlying its use. The specific values in Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref> are available in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Information</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Global comparison of MinSpan and human-derived pathways</title><p>How different are the MinSpan pathways from other sources of pathway definitions?

there are none as Gene Ontology captures all the pathways from the metabolic model.</p></list-item></list></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="msb0010-0737-f3"/></fig><p>Second, we calculated pairwise connection specificity indices (CSI) (Green <italic>et
al</italic>, <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Bass <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) for pathways across all databases (MinSpan and human-defined)
based on their gene products and hierarchically clustered them (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>A). The CSI provides both a metric of how similar two pathways are, and how specific their
similarity is compared to the rest of the available pathways. For each pathway definition (MinSpan,
KEGG, BioCyc, and GO), we determined how many of their pathways are captured in other pathway
definitions by whether or not they shared a high CSI value (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>B). As the number of MinSpan pathways is much larger than the number of pathways for other
databases for <italic>E. coli</italic>, MinSpan captures most of their information, while KEGG,
EcoCyc, and GO capture much less of MinSpan. For <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Gene Ontology has
the highest coverage. It has two fewer pathways than MinSpan (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>), but fully captures MinSpan pathways.</p><p>Third, we used a K-nearest neighbor search to assign the individual pathways of one pathway
definition into the other three pathway definitions (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>C)
to determine whether certain pathway definitions are more similar than others. The number of
pathways that were similar between KEGG and BioCyc pathways and BioCyc and GO was statistically
significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, binomial distribution, Bonferroni correction) for
both organisms. The number of pathways that shared similarities with MinSpan was significantly
depleted (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, binomial distribution, Bonferroni correction), or
dissimilar, from most pathway definitions in both organisms. This suggests that KEGG and BioCyc have
the most similar pathways, followed with Gene Ontology, which has more similarities with BioCyc than
KEGG. MinSpan pathways are significantly different from human-defined pathway databases and for
<italic>E. coli</italic> contain many unique pathways (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>D).</p><p>Fourth, we determined what caused the significant difference in MinSpan and human-defined
databases by looking at the individual pathways that were similar or dissimilar between the pathway
definitions (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>D). For both <italic>E. coli</italic> and
<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, MinSpan captured traditional pathways in carbon metabolism (e.g.,
glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle), amino acid metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism.
However, 26 of the 56 pathways missed by MinSpan for <italic>E. coli</italic> were related to fatty
acid metabolism. A MinSpan pathway operates under the steady-state assumption, leading to full flux
balance of the metabolic network (e.g., all metabolites and cofactors in the pathway must be
produced, consumed, and/or recycled). Traditional fatty acid pathway representations do not include
all necessary components, and fatty acid pathways typically require the most precursors and
cofactors. Conversely, 99 of the 204 MinSpan pathways missed by traditional pathways dealt with
pathways that contained the necessary cofactors and precursors, mainly for fatty acid metabolism.
The second representative difference was that a few traditional pathways (representing
gluconeogenesis and deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis) were broken up into smaller MinSpan pathways.
Third, MinSpan pathways for <italic>E. coli</italic> contained 54 novel pathways related to ion
transport, alternate carbon metabolism, and electron transfer.</p><p>For <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Gene Ontology has a larger coverage of metabolism than
MinSpan. This difference is due to two reasons: (1) the metabolic model of <italic>S.
cerevisiae</italic> is not as comprehensive as the model for <italic>E. coli</italic> and (2) the
Gene Ontology for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is relatively more comprehensive than the one for
<italic>E. coli</italic>. There were 32 pathways missed by MinSpan due to differing representations
than traditional pathway databases. Seven missed pathways dealt with fatty acid metabolism, and
their MinSpan counterparts took cofactors and precursors into account. Five traditional pathways for
tyrosine biosynthesis and triglyceride biosynthesis were broken up into smaller pathways by the
MinSpan algorithm. The specific pathways that are missed by the MinSpan algorithm are provided in
the Supplementary Dataset S2.</p></sec><sec><title>Key examples of MinSpan differences</title><p>From a global perspective, there are three representative differences between MinSpan and
traditional pathways (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>). First, MinSpan enumerates
pathways not already described in databases. We found 54 metabolic pathways in <italic>E.
coli</italic> that were not described in KEGG, Gene Ontology, or EcoCyc. For example, one such
pathway involves the degradation of shikimate, an aromatic compound, to <sc>l</sc>-tryptophan
(Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>A). The pathway consists of eight metabolic reactions,
six of which are co-regulated by TrpR in <italic>E. coli,</italic> lending support to the
pathway's biological relevance.</p><fig id="fig04" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>The three differences between MinSpan and human-defined pathways</title><p><list list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p>MinSpan automates the enumeration of biologically relevant pathways.</p></list-item><list-item><p>MinSpan includes all required components of a pathway to be independent. The additional pathway
components not found in human-defined pathways, such as THF recycling, are often co-regulated and
thus a part of a coherent pathway functioning as a &#x0201c;module&#x0201d; in a network.</p></list-item><list-item><p>MinSpan decomposes complex topology into the simplest representation. For example, there is a
shorter route to <sc>l</sc>-methionine production through <sc>l</sc>-threonine than from
<sc>l</sc>-aspartate. Note: For MinSpan pathways, only the representative genes of the pathway are
shown. 10fthf: 10-formyltetrahydrofolate; 2obut: 2-oxobutanoate; gar: glycinamide ribonucleotide;
<sc>l</sc>-cysta: <sc>l</sc>-cystathionine; methf: 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate; mlthf:
5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate; prpp: phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate; skm: shikimate; thf:
tetrahydrofolate.</p></list-item></list></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="msb0010-0737-f4"/></fig><p>Second, MinSpan pathways are mass-balanced and are functionally independent units that take into
account systemic requirements. For example, the traditional human-defined pathway for purine
biosynthesis starts from phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (prpp) and <sc>l</sc>-glutamine. Purine
biosynthesis consists of 11 metabolic reactions that lead to IMP (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>B), which is further modified to other purines. This traditional pathway exists
in KEGG, Gene Ontology, and EcoCyc and is biologically relevant as all 11 reactions are co-regulated
by PurR in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The third metabolic reaction for purine biosynthesis
(phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase) requires 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (10fthf). Thus, the
MinSpan pathway for purine biosynthesis also includes tetrahydrofolate (THF) recycling which
contains three reactions. The gene for the first reaction in THF recycling is transcriptionally
regulated by PurR, while the two other reactions&#x02019; genes are not transcriptionally regulated.
MinSpan elucidates a coupling of THF recycling to IMP biosynthesis that is independently verified by
the co-regulation of the necessary genes.</p><p>Third, the minimalist decomposition of MinSpan is especially useful for complex metabolic network
topologies where pathway enumeration is manually difficult. For example, threonine and methionine
metabolism in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is a small but complex network consisting of 12
metabolic reactions that involve multiple amino acids (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>C). KEGG contains two pathways for this region: <sc>l</sc>-aspartate to
<sc>l</sc>-threonine and <sc>l</sc>-aspartate to <sc>l</sc>-methionine (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>C). This ignores another potential path to <sc>l</sc>-methionine from
<sc>l</sc>-threonine. YeastCyc and GO cover all reactions in the example by containing many more
pathways, seven and five pathways, respectively. Similar to KEGG, both YeastCyc and GO describe
<sc>l</sc>-methionine synthesis through <sc>l</sc>-aspartate. On the other hand, MinSpan decomposes
the network into <sc>l</sc>-threonine production through <sc>l</sc>-aspartate and
<sc>l</sc>-methionine production through <sc>l</sc>-threonine (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>C). These two functional units contain the shortest possible connection between the major
metabolites. In the process, this decouples <sc>l</sc>-aspartate from <sc>l</sc>-methionine
production.</p><p>Genetic interactions are consistent with the parsimonious approach. From the correlation analysis
(at a False Positive Rate of 20%), both MinSpan and human-defined pathways correctly
identified four positive genetic interactions in the <sc>l</sc>-threonine synthesis pathway
(Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>C), suggesting a functional metabolic pathway. However,
there were no positive genetic interactions in the traditional <sc>l</sc>-methionine synthesis from
<sc>l</sc>-aspartate, suggesting no functional pathway and leading to five false positive
predictions. In fact, YDR158W and YER091C interact negatively, further supporting that the two genes
are not in the same pathway. Conversely, MinSpan separates <sc>l</sc>-aspartate from
<sc>l</sc>-methionine and hence correctly predicts no genetic interactions. In addition, YCL064C
negatively interacts with YER052C, YDR158W, YJR139C, and YCR053W lending support to
<sc>l</sc>-threonine and <sc>l</sc>-methionine production being decoupled.</p></sec><sec><title>MinSpan pathways predict transcriptional regulation</title><p>MinSpan is an inherent property of metabolic networks, unlike human-defined pathways, and offers
the direct ability to predict pathway-associated biomolecular properties from flux distributions
calculated by constraint-based modeling. From the above correlation analysis, we observed that genes
within a MinSpan pathway are often co-regulated by the same TF. Thus, we tested whether TFs act
directly on the MinSpan pathway structure during metabolic shifts to coordinate expression of the
metabolic genes needed to implement a fully functional pathway.</p><p>Constraint-based models can be used with Monte Carlo sampling methods to compute candidate
reaction flux states through the metabolic network (Schellenberger <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Comparing the significantly changed reaction fluxes between
two sampled metabolic conditions has been previously shown to be consistent with experimental
datasets (Lewis <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Bordbar
<italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Nam <italic>et al</italic>,
<xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>A).
However, these predicted differences are on an individual reaction basis, not for coordinated
changes in flux states that might reflect the actions of the TRN.</p><fig id="fig05" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>MinSpan pathways help predict transcription factor activity</title><p><list list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p>Constraint-based models can determine reaction activity, or flux states (<bold>v</bold>), using

(Gama-Castro <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>)

as well as 51 nutritional shifts due to changes in carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur sources,
as well as supplementation of amino acids and nucleotide precursors and removal of oxygen. Sampled
metabolic reaction fluxes (<bold>v</bold>) were decomposed into MinSpan pathway flux loads
(<bold>&#x003b1;</bold>) to determine significantly changed pathways across nutritional conditions
(Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>A). TFs associated with significantly changed pathways
(<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) were then used as predictors of
transcriptional regulation.</p><p>Predicted TF activities (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>B) substantially agreed with
known regulatory changes detailed in EcoCyc (Keseler <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and primary literature (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Information</xref>). As the TRN is not completely known, we focused primarily on
true-positive and false-negative results. Transcriptional regulatory changes for 37 of the 51
nutrient shifts matched known associations and eight other shifts partially matched known
TF&#x02013;environment associations (see Supplementary Dataset S3). Overall, the predicted activities
were highly enriched in known TF&#x02013;environment associations (<italic>P</italic> =
2.79e-107, binomial distribution). Focusing on the 45 shifts, there were 247 predicted
TF&#x02013;environment associations. 154 of those predictions are confirmed in EcoCyc and primary
literature. 93, or 38%, of the predicted TF activities are not known to be associated with
the corresponding shift, providing numerous novel transcriptional regulation predictions.</p><p>Hierarchically clustering nutrient shifts based on predicted TRN response stratifies key classes
of shifts (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>B). Nucleotide precursor supplementation is
characterized by PurR and GcvA activity. Alternate sulfur sources as well as <sc>l</sc>-cysteine and
<sc>l</sc>-methionine supplementation clustered by CysB activity. Sugar carbon sources clustered by
Cra. Organic acid carbon sources, including glycerol, were systemic and characterized by Fnr, Lrp,
and Cra activity. Other systemic shifts included the response to the lack of oxygen and alternate
nitrogen sources. Finally, predicted transcriptional regulatory changes of well-studied shifts (Cho

greater detail enumerating specific MinSpan pathway changes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Information</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>MinSpan pathways aid in experimental discovery of novel regulation</title><p>MinSpan pathways not only accurately predict known TF activities but also offer an opportunity to
discover novel regulation. We chose three novel TF&#x02013;environment predictions to experimentally
validate that are non-obvious, in the sense that little to no literature links the TF with the
predicted associated environment. To be rigorous in the experimental design, we chose environmental
shifts that have been well-studied; where discovering novel experimental findings would be more
difficult.</p><p>The three tested associations were Nac with adenine supplementation (ade/Nac), Cra with
<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan supplementation (<sc>l</sc>-trp/Cra), and MntR with shift to anaerobic
conditions (O<sub>2</sub>/MntR). The chosen shifts represent three distinct magnitudes of dual
perturbations. In the ade/Nac case, the environment and genetic perturbations are both relatively
minor. In the <sc>l</sc>-trp/Cra case, Cra is a broad acting TF and dominates, while the
environmental perturbation to the absence of oxygen dominates in the O<sub>2</sub>/MntR case.</p><p>We generated RNA-seq data from dual perturbation experiments (Ideker <italic>et al</italic>,
<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Covert <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) for the three cases consisting of perturbations in the environment (media
supplementation) and genetics (TF knockout) of <italic>E. coli</italic>. For each case, we
determined the gene set that is exclusively differentially expressed because of the combination of
the genetic perturbation and environmental shift (see Materials and Methods) in order to analyze
whether the TF plays a role in the environmental shift.</p><p>Global analysis of the gene sets, based on enrichment of regulatory interactions with known TF
associations (Gama-Castro <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>),
suggested that predictions for ade/Nac and O<sub>2</sub>/MntR were correct, and the
<sc>l</sc>-trp/Cra prediction was indeterminate. In the ade/Nac case, the gene set was enriched with
genes known to be regulated by the TFs GcvA, Lrp, and PurR (<italic>P</italic> = 9.5e-6,
1.6e-4, 1.8e-4, hypergeometric test), suggesting that Nac (nitrogen assimilation control) regulates
similar genes during the shift or even regulates the corresponding TFs. In the <sc>l</sc>-trp/Cra
case, there were no enriched TFs suggesting no global consensus. This discrepancy might be due to
(1) Cra knockout causing a large genetic shift that might have changed how <italic>E. coli</italic>
responds to <sc>l</sc>-trp and (2) MinSpan is inaccurate for predicting global regulation. In the
O<sub>2</sub>/MntR case, TFs known to be associated with the anaerobic shift (including ArcA and
Fnr) were enriched as a whole (<italic>P</italic> = 3.6e-3, hypergeometric test).</p><p>Through differential expression and detection of high confidence binding sequence motifs, we
identified novel regulatory roles for all three tested TFs (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>). For the ade/Nac case, we identified potential regulation of genes involved in purine
metabolism, involved in nitrogen assimilation, and regulated by Lrp (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>A). The transcription units (TUs) gcvTHP and gcvB are known to be regulated by
GcvA and PurR and are potentially regulated by Nac. Nac also seems to regulate gcvB, which is a
small regulatory RNA of Lrp (Modi <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Using FIMO (Grant <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), we detected a significant Nac binding sequence motif for gcvB (&#x02212;173 bp of
transcription start site (TSS), <italic>P</italic> = 1.73e-6). A significant increase in gcvB
suggests a repression of Lrp and genes typically repressed by Lrp should have higher expression and
genes activated by Lrp should have lower expression. This trend was observed in all significantly
changed expression of Lrp-regulated genes (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>A). We also
identified novel regulation and high confidence binding sequence motifs for nitrogen assimilation
genes: nirB (&#x02212;87 bp of TSS, <italic>P</italic> = 7.63e-5) and nrdHIEF (&#x02212;170 bp
of TSS, <italic>P</italic> = 2.2e-5).</p><fig id="fig06" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>MinSpan TRN predictions suggest informative dual perturbation experiments that led to

potentially regulates the <sc>l</sc>-trp symporter and tryptophanase (tnaCAB, Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>B). Crp is a known regulator of this TU (Botsford &#x00026;
DeMoss, <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">1971</xref>), but our data suggest that Cra also plays a
role, possibly by in-direct regulation through Crp (Shimada <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>Finally in the O<sub>2</sub>/MntR case, MntR potentially regulates four TUs highly regulated
during the anaerobic shift including the TF GadX (-120 bp of TSS, <italic>P</italic> =
2.6e-5) (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>C). GadX regulates pH-inducing genes and the
GAD system that play roles during fermentation (Tramonti <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b54" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). MntR also potentially regulates a subunit of pyruvate
formate lyase (yfiD), NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase II (ndh), and molybdenum biosynthesis
(moaABC).</p><p>It is important to note that potential regulatory sites were only detected during dual
perturbation, suggesting that experiments to elucidate TRNs under one environmental condition
underestimate non-intuitive regulatory events. The additional potential binding sites nearly double
the known potential binding sites for Nac and MntR (Keseler <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Dual perturbation predictions were more accurate for local
TFs (Nac/MntR) than global TFs (Cra), which is also consistent with the correlation analysis. The
analysis presented to predict TF&#x02013;environment associations is only possible with MinSpan
pathways, as opposed to pathway databases, as MinSpan pathways directly link flux simulations from
constraint-based models to pathway biomolecular properties.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>High-throughput technologies have transformed biological data generation and experimentation.

on whole network function and a principle of parsimonious use of cellular components. We find that
the MinSpan pathways are not only biologically relevant in their ability to recapitulate independent
datasets on biomolecular interaction, but are surprisingly more accurate than traditional pathway
databases such as KEGG, EcoCyc, YeastCyc, and Gene Ontology. The results have three
implications.</p><p>First, the results suggest that the traditional approach to defining metabolic pathways is not
complete and an unbiased alternative might be more representative of the underlying pathway
structure. Traditional pathway enumeration focuses predominantly on biochemical reactions. By
incorporating a minimal criterion of the number of reactions used, the MinSpan approach indirectly
introduces the requirements for biomolecular machinery usage into the pathway definition. There are
two fundamental features of MinSpan pathways that differentiate them from traditional pathways. (1)
MinSpan pathways account for all necessary components to make a pathway fully functionally
independent (e.g., they are network-based). (2) MinSpan pathways represent the simplest pathway
structure in a given network context. The improved consistency of MinSpan with biomolecular
interactions suggests that the coordinated regulation and usage of biological components in the cell
have evolved to be minimal and independent in order to adapt to perturbation with as little cost to
the cell as possible. Biologically meaningful pathways may be minimal, independent, and segregated.
Future delineation of metabolic pathways, both network and human-defined, should take into
consideration the cost of biomolecular machinery and systemic functional requirements for metabolic
function.</p><p>Second, the MinSpan pathways provide an alternative, complementary, and potentially more powerful
approach for investigators to analyze their generated data. Current pathway databases are
tremendously important in conceptualizing biological function and are used by numerous investigators
for data analysis. As MinSpan pathways are more biologically relevant in terms of the underlying
biomolecular interactions, the theory presented here for an unbiased pathway structure opens up the
potential for a whole new suite of pathways to be used with tools such as Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b52" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).</p><p>Third, MinSpan pathways can guide the difficult process of reconstructing and determining TRNs.
The best characterized TRN is that in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Though the <italic>E. coli</italic>
TRN is not complete, our approach of coupling metabolic models with MinSpan pathways identifies
novel associations between TFs and environmental shifts, providing a rational method to design
context-specific dual perturbation experiments. In this study, we have experimentally validated
three of the 93 novel predictions allowing us to double the known potential regulatory sites for Nac
and MntR. Our analysis shows that experiments under varying environmental conditions are required to
elucidate novel regulatory roles. Further, we recently confirmed two additional novel MinSpan
predictions for cytosine/Nac and cytosine/NtrC (Kim, <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>)
using chromatin immunoprecipitation with exome sequencing methods (Rhee &#x00026; Pugh, <xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). This work also confirms the biochemical binding of Nac to
the transcription unit gcvTHP, which is the mechanism for which Nac is involved in purine metabolism
(Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>A). The remaining 88 MinSpan predictions provide a
roadmap for future experimentation to help discover numerous new regulatory roles in <italic>E.
coli,</italic> and the overall method can be applied to any organism with a metabolic and regulatory
network.</p><p>There are also some limitations and areas for further research with regards to the MinSpan
algorithm. First, the MinSpan algorithm is dependent on the quality of the genome-scale metabolic
model utilized; in the same way, the quality of pathway databases for particular organisms is
dependent on the biochemical knowledge available. The MinSpan pathways are more comprehensive in
<italic>E. coli</italic> than <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> as iJO1366 is much more complete than
iMM904. This difference is a reflection of the biochemistry of <italic>E. coli</italic> being better
studied than <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Second, just as there are multiple pathway databases
for the same organism, there are sometimes multiple metabolic network reconstructions for the same
organism. Further research is needed to assess the differences in the calculated MinSpan pathways
for different metabolic models of the same organism. Third, human-defined pathways are often defined
in a universal, rather than organism-specific, manner. This can be a strength, particularly for
educational purposes as it provides a common &#x0201c;language&#x0201d; to describe the function of
many organisms. However, universal pathways can also be a weakness. Human-defined pathways focus on
the topology of gene products, while ignoring the organism-specific functional context of metabolic
pathways. For example, isotopomer metabolic flux profiling has shown that metabolic functionality
can often be quite different than the gene products present (Amador-Noquez <italic>et al</italic>,
<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). To assess the conservation of MinSpan pathways, a
preliminary analysis comparing <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> MinSpan
pathways is provided in the Supplementary Information. However, further research with several
reconstructions of different organisms is needed to fully assess whether MinSpan pathways are
conserved across species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>MinSpan Formulation</title><p>The MinSpan algorithm determines the shortest, linearly independent pathways for a stoichiometric
matrix (<bold>S</bold>) with dimensions <italic>m</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>n</italic> and a rank of
<italic>r</italic>. The input is a metabolic model (variables <italic>S</italic>, lb, ub) and
outputs a MinSpan pathway matrix (<bold>P</bold>). <bold>P</bold> is the sparsest null space of
<bold>S</bold> that maintains biological and thermodynamic constraints (lb and ub). Coleman and
Pothen defined the mathematical problem for the sparsest linear basis of the null space as the
&#x0201c;sparse null space basis problem&#x0201d; and then proved that a greedy algorithm must find
the globally optimal sparsest null space (least number of non-zero entries) (Coleman &#x00026;
Pothen, <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>). More recently, Gottlieb and Neylon showed that
a similar problem, &#x0201c;the matrix sparsification problem,&#x0201d; is equivalent to the
&#x0201c;sparse null space basis problem&#x0201d; (Gottlieb &#x00026; Neylon, <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). We formulated &#x0201c;the matrix sparsification problem&#x0201d; as a
mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The MILP is boxed in the pseudo-code below. Simply
put, the orthonormal null space (<bold>N</bold>) of <bold>S</bold> is initially defined by singular
value decomposition. Then, the vectors of the orthonormal null space are iteratively replaced by the
shortest pathways that span the removed vector's subspace. This process is continuously
repeated until the number of non-zero entries in <bold>P</bold> has converged to a minimum. Before
running the algorithm, all reactions that cannot carry a flux are removed, all exchanges are opened,
and the biomass function is removed. The algorithm is summarized below:</p><p><bold>N</bold> = null(<bold>S</bold>)</p><p><bold>P</bold> = <bold>N</bold></p><p>while (true)</p><p><bold>P</bold><sup><bold>0</bold></sup> = <bold>P</bold></p><p>for j = 1:n-r</p><p><disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="msb0010-0737-m1.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/></disp-formula></p><p><disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="msb0010-0737-m2.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/></disp-formula></p><p><disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="msb0010-0737-m3.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/></disp-formula></p><p><disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="msb0010-0737-m4.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/></disp-formula></p><p>end</p><p><bold>P</bold> = <bold>P&#x02032;</bold></p><p>if nnz(<bold>P</bold>) == nnz(<bold>P</bold><sup><bold>0</bold></sup>), break,

of <bold>p</bold><sub><bold>j</bold></sub> and is linearly independent from <bold>P&#x02032;</bold>.
<bold>b</bold> is a binary version of the flux vector (<bold>v</bold>) that is minimized by the
optimization problem to determine the MinSpan pathways. This is proved by contradiction. If
<bold>P</bold>&#x02032; and <bold>x</bold> are linearly dependent, then multiples of <bold>x</bold>
and the vectors of <bold>P</bold>&#x02032; should linearly combine to zero:</p><p><disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="msb0010-0737-m5.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/></disp-formula></p><p>&#x003b8;<sup>T</sup>&#x003b8; is a positive semi-definite matrix by definition and cannot equal
zero. Thus, <bold>P</bold> and <bold>x</bold> are linearly independent. The
<bold>x</bold><sup>T</sup>&#x000b7;<bold>v</bold> &#x02260; 0 constraint ensures that the calculated
pathway spans the proper dimension of the null space. For a MILP problem, the constraint is
formulated as below, where &#x003b5; is an arbitrarily small value (set to 0.1, various other choices
yield similar results), and f<sup>+</sup> and f<sup>-</sup> are binary variables required to
formulate a &#x0201c;not-equal&#x0201d; constraint:</p><p><disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="msb0010-0737-m6.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/></disp-formula></p><p>The termination criterion for the branch and bound method for each MILP iteration is a relative
gap tolerance of 1e-3 or time limit of 30 min. These criteria were developed based on convergent
properties of solutions as the two parameters were varied. As the MinSpan algorithm is a MILP
problem, there can exist alternative optimal solutions. The total number of non-zero entries in the
matrix is unique, but the pathways may not be. Rerunning the correlation analysis to determine
biological relevance with alternate MinSpan pathways for both <italic>E. coli</italic> and
<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> yielded little changes to the results (see Supplementary

optimization was switched to a maximization problem to make the densest null space. For RandSpan, we
assigned a random value from &#x02212;0.5 to 0.5 to the optimization <bold>c</bold> vector to
randomly minimize and maximize the use of reactions while constructing each null space. For
maximization, the following constraints are added to link the binary and continuous variables:</p><p><disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="msb0010-0737-m7.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/></disp-formula></p><p>Where &#x003b5; is an arbitrarily small value (set to 0.1, various other choices yield similar

gene-protein-reaction associations. Pairwise Spearman rank correlations of the co-occurrence or
co-absence of genes and proteins across the pathways were calculated. Correlations that were not
significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05, permutation test) were filtered from further
analysis. The total number of correlations remaining after filtering is the coverage criteria (i.e.,
log(interactions)) in the <italic>x</italic>-axes of Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>.
The correlation coefficient was the varied discrimination threshold for generating the receiver
operating characteristics (ROC) curve, using a convex hull. <italic>P</italic>-values to determine
statistically different ROC convex hull curves were calculated using the approach by Hanley and
McNeil (Hanley &#x00026; McNeil, <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>).</p><p>The correlations were compared to biomolecular interaction data types to assess the biological
relevance of gene and protein groupings of the pathways. Known biomolecular interactions were taken
as the gold standard positive set. All available yeast two-hybrid screening data from BioGRID (Stark
<italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) were used for protein-protein
interactions. &#x0201c;Stringent&#x0201d; positive genetic interactions (defined by the authors as
<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 and &#x003b5; &#x0003e; 0.16) were taken from Costanzo <italic>et

<italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) were used. A lack of reported
biomolecular interactions in these three datasets was deemed the gold standard negative set.</p><p>KEGG modules (Kanehisa <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and
GO Biological Processes ontology (Ashburner <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) were downloaded from their respective websites on 01/27/2013 for comparison. EcoCyc

<italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) pathways were downloaded on
02/12/2013. Only distinct pathways with two or more genes from the metabolic networks were
considered. The same correlation analysis was used for the human-curated pathways, MaxSpan, and
RandSpan.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparing pathway databases</title><p>We calculated the connection specificity index (CSI) (Green <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Bass <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) between pathways based on their gene products across all pathway definitions (MinSpan,
KEGG, BioCyc, and Gene Ontology). The CSI is a metric that determines the similarity between two
vectors by ranking the Pearson's correlation coefficient of the two vectors based on the
correlations of all other vectors versus the two vectors in question. A CSI between pathways A and B
is defined as:</p><p><disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="msb0010-0737-m8.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/></disp-formula></p><p>where PCC is the correlation coefficient of gene products, PCC<sub>AB</sub> is the correlation
between A and B, <italic>t</italic> is an empirically derived threshold, and
<italic>n</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub> is the total number of pathways. Further explanation
of CSI and software tools for its use is available (Bass <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The threshold for CSI was set based on the distribution of
correlations (<italic>E. coli</italic> &#x02013; 0.0350, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> &#x02013;
0.0562, see Supplementary Figure S13). Pathways were considered similar if their CSI ranked in the
top 15% of CSI values.</p><p>We also employed a k-nearest neighbors search to find the most similar pathways across the
pathway databases. The Pearson's correlation was used as the distance metric. The closest hit
that also had a high CSI value (top 15%) was used as the nearest neighbor. If the pathway did
not have a high CSI value, then the pathway was deemed unique compared to the other databases.</p><p>MinSpan pathways contain many gene products related to the mass balancing of the network, such as
transporters, that are active in nearly every pathway. In order for a meaningful comparison between
MinSpan and human-defined databases, the genes in each MinSpan pathway were filtered to only the
representative genes of that pathway. To do so, we used a conservative filter to remove genes that
were in nearly every pathway (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.85, hypergeometric, empirically
derived).</p></sec><sec><title>Determining reaction fluxes and transcription factor activities</title><p>Monte Carlo sampling (Schellenberger <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) was used to determine 10,000 reaction flux distributions for the <italic>E.
coli</italic> metabolic network for each of the 52 nutrient conditions. For glucose minimal media
conditions, exchange constraints were taken from Covert <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). For anaerobic conditions, rate of oxygen input was set to
zero. For amino acid and nucleotide simulations, rate of amino acid or nucleotide input was set to
the minimum rate that would allow the biomass constituent, at the wild-type growth rate, to be
generated solely from exogenous substrate. Six nutrient shifts were not considered
(<sc>l</sc>-alanine, <sc>l</sc>-asparagine, <sc>l</sc>-aspartate, <sc>l</sc>-glutamate,
<sc>l</sc>-glutamine, and uracil), as they are involved with type 3 loops (physiologically
infeasible pathways that are artifacts of pathway enumeration algorithms (Palsson, <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>)). For alternate carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur
sources, the original input source from glucose minimal media conditions was set to zero and an
equal rate of atom flow was set as the input. All nutrient conditions had the basal biomass flux
rate set to 90% of the optimal value. To compare different conditions, sampled fluxes within
a particular condition were normalized by median growth rate for comparison. The specific lower

upper-quartile normalization. EcoCyc annotations were used for transcript quantification.
Differential expression analysis was done using cuffdiff with upper-quartile normalization, and
appropriate parameters set for strand-specific library type. A fold change of greater than 2-fold

the four conditions as: E1 (WT versus WT + nutrient), E2 (KO versus KO + nutrient), G1
(WT versus KO), and G2 (WT + nutrient versus KO + nutrient). The differential gene set
of the combination of environmental and genetic perturbations is defined as the union of the
following sets: {{E2&#x025b5;E1}\G1 and {G2\G1}. The gene sets for the three experiments are provided

determine whether a gene set was enriched (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, hypergeometric test,

correct if the enriched transcription factors had known associations with the environmental
