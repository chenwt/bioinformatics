genes. The properties of the TCR determine both the degree of self-reactivity and the repertoire of antigens that can be recognized. For CD8 T cells, the relationship between TCR identity&#x02014;hence reactivity to self&#x02014;and effector function(s) remains to be fully understood and has rarely been explored outside of the H-2<sup>b</sup> haplotype. We measured the affinity of three structurally distinct CD8 T-cell-derived TCRs that recognize the identical H-2 L<sup>d</sup>-restricted epitope, derived from the Rop7 protein of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>. We used CD8 T cells obtained from mice generated by somatic cell nuclear transfer as the closest approximation of primary T cells with physiological TCR rearrangements and TCR expression levels. First, we demonstrate the common occurrence of secondary rearrangements in endogenously rearranged loci. Furthermore, we characterized and compared the response of Rop7-specific CD8 T-cell clones upon <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> infection as well as effector function and TCR signalling upon antigenic stimulation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Antigen-independent TCR cross-linking <italic>in vitro</italic> uncovered profound intrinsic differences in the effector functions between T-cell clones. Finally, by assessing the degree of self-reactivity and comparing the transcriptomes of naive Rop7 CD8 T cells, we show that lower self-reactivity correlates with lower effector capacity, whereas higher self-reactivity is associated with enhanced effector function as well as cell cycle entry under physiological conditions. Altogether, our data show that potential effector functions and basal proliferation of CD8 T cells are set by self-reactivity thresholds.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CD8 T cells</kwd><kwd>self-affinity</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>091664/B/10/Z</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Francis Crick Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001076</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI033456</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>November 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>T cells play a key role in the immune response by assisting B cells in antibody production, activation of phagocytic cells or killing of infected cells. The stochastic assembly of an MHC-restricted &#x003b1;&#x003b2; T-cell receptor (TCR) during thymic development [<xref rid="RSOB160293C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] requires positive and negative selection steps that ensure minimal affinity for the complex of self-peptide and MHC molecules, without causing overt and deleterious response against self [<xref rid="RSOB160293C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSOB160293C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Survival of mature naive T cells in the periphery likewise relies on constant tonic signalling through the TCR, which of necessity involves self-MHC&#x02013;peptide combinations [<xref rid="RSOB160293C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Activation of antigen-specific T cells leads to clonal expansion and&#x02014;in the case of CD4 T cells&#x02014;functional polarization [<xref rid="RSOB160293C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The characterization of Th1 and Th2 CD4 cells has been expanded upon by the description of additional CD4 T-cell subsets [<xref rid="RSOB160293C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSOB160293C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Each of these subsets occupies a functional niche during the immune response, allowing countermeasures tailored to a variety of pathogens. Furthermore, investigation of the variegated expression of nine different phenotypic markers, cytokines and cytotoxic proteins, has suggested considerable functional diversity in CD8 T-cell response [<xref rid="RSOB160293C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Unlike CD4 T cells, this diversity might represent a continuum of distributed properties, rather than truly discrete CD8 T-cell subsets. The full extent of heterogeneity of effector CD8 T cells and the functional mechanism(s) that underlie it remain to be uncovered.</p><p>For CD8 T cells, the affinity of the TCR for the antigen&#x02013;MHC complex dictates the extent of the primary and memory immune response [<xref rid="RSOB160293C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. CD8 T cells can execute their effector functions even upon <italic>in vivo</italic> stimulation with ligands that are relatively poor agonists [<xref rid="RSOB160293C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For a given CD8 T-cell clone, the strength of TCR ligation positively correlates with IFN&#x003b3; production, proliferation and memory formation [<xref rid="RSOB160293C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Whether differences in TCR affinity for antigen between CD8 T-cell clones of identical specificity necessarily correlate with their respective effector functions remains to be investigated.</p><p>All &#x003b1;&#x003b2; T cells require continuous interactions of the TCR with a complex set of self-peptide&#x02013;MHC complexes not only in the course of development, but also in the periphery to ensure their survival. Affinity for self-peptide&#x02013;MHC is intrinsic to each T-cell clone. Consequently, the intensity of such tonic signalling will presumably leave an imprint that may influence T-cell function upon TCR ligation with a foreign peptide&#x02013;MHC complex. Levels of CD5 expression correlate with TCR self-reactivity for self-peptide MHC [<xref rid="RSOB160293C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSOB160293C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Recent studies have established a correlation between self-reactivity and T-cell effector functions, although with some contradictory findings [<xref rid="RSOB160293C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSOB160293C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Possible mechanisms underlying functional differences between CD5<sup>low</sup> and CD5<sup>high</sup> T cells include enhanced basal TCR signalling, as inferred from increased CD3&#x003b6; phosphorylation at rest [<xref rid="RSOB160293C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="RSOB160293C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], or greater sensitivity to inflammatory signals [<xref rid="RSOB160293C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>There are no comparisons for CD8 T-cell clones that share the same TCR specificity to explore whether the affinity of the TCR for antigen&#x02013;MHC and/or affinity for self correlates with effector functions. It also remains to be determined whether there are functional differences between CD8 T-cell clones equipped with TCRs of similar specificity and, if so, what factors shape such differences. Here, we measured the affinity of the TCR for antigen&#x02013;MHC for CD8 T cells from three different lines of transnuclear (TN) mice, all of which recognize the identical epitope, derived from the Rop7 protein of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> in complex with H-2 L<sup>d</sup> [<xref rid="RSOB160293C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We characterized Rop7 CD8 T-cell activation <italic>in vivo</italic> upon <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> infection as well as antigen-dependent and -independent stimulation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our data highlight major intrinsic differences in effector capacity between Rop7 clones regardless of the stimulation. We also demonstrate that self-reactivity thresholds determine effector functions: lower self-reactivity correlated with decreased functionality, whereas increased self-reactivity was associated with enhanced effector functions. Transcriptome-wide analysis of Rop7 CD8 T-cell clones showed major differences in expression of cell cycle-associated genes. In this manner, the identity of the clonotypic TCR contributes to the function of T cells beyond antigen recognition, by setting the degree of self-reactivity through basal TCR signalling as well as through mitotic status at rest and prior to activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><label>2.</label><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><label>2.1.</label><title>T-cell development and endogenous T-cell receptor rearrangements in Rop7-I, -II and -III transnuclear mice</title><p>We reported the generation, using somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) [<xref rid="RSOB160293C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSOB160293C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], of three lines of CD8 T-cell TN mice, all of which bear an &#x003b1;&#x003b2; TCR specific for the peptide IPAAAGRFF derived from the Rop7 protein of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> [<xref rid="RSOB160293C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The CD8 T cells that served as SCNT donors were obtained by cell sorting, using H-2 L<sup>d</sup> tetramers loaded with the Rop7 epitope. We refer to these lines of mice as Rop7-I, -II and -III (R7-I, -II and -III in figures). Thymocyte development in Rop7-I, -II and -III mice heterozygous for the TN TCR&#x003b1; and &#x003b2; chain progressed normally, with a slight increase in CD8 single-positive cells (CD8<sup>SP</sup>) due to the expression of the class I MHC-restricted TCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB160293F1">figure&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>a</italic>(i)). The majority but not all CD8<sup>SP</sup> cells expressed a Rop7-specific TCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB160293F1">figure&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>a</italic>(ii)). We observed a skewed ratio of mature CD8 T cells in the spleen of all Rop7 mice compared to WT mice and significant differences in the percentage of CD8 T cells between Rop7-I versus Rop7-II and -III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB160293F1">figure&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>b</italic>). The percentage of CD8 T cells that expressed a Rop7-specific TCR was different for Rop7-II versus Rop7-I and -III CD8 cells. Indeed, whereas the fraction of tetramer-negative cells was moderate in Rop7-I and -III mice, up to 30% of CD8 T cells did not stain for H2-L<sup>d</sup> Rop7 in Rop7-II mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB160293F1">figure&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>b</italic>). This could be due to rearrangements of a TCR&#x003b1; V-J combination on the endogenous germline allele or to secondary rearrangements at the original TN TCR&#x003b1; locus. To distinguish between both possibilities, we bred Rop7 mice to homozygosity for the TN TCR&#x003b1; and &#x003b2; chain. Thymocyte development from double-negative to single-positive cells in TCR&#x003b1; and &#x003b2; homozygous mice occurred was comparable to T-cell development observed in the respective heterozygous mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB160293F1">figure&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>c</italic>). Most importantly, we observed not only the presence of CD8<sup>+</sup> tetramer-negative cells in all Rop7 mice, although at different percentages, but also CD4 T cells in readily detectable numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB160293F1">figure&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>c,d</italic>), all of which were tetramer-negative (electronic supplementary material, figure S1). Both findings demonstrate the occurrence of secondary rearrangements at the TCR&#x003b1;, possibly TCR&#x003b2; locus. The percentages of mature H2-L<sup>d</sup> Rop7<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells were different for the different Rop7 mice but altogether similar to percentages in the heterozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB160293F1">figure&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>d</italic>). Altogether, T-cell development occurred normally in Rop7 mice. Furthermore, our data show that secondary TCR rearrangements are common for the TN rearranged loci.

We already noted subtle differences in dissociation rates of their TCRs from Rop7-H-2 L<sup>d</sup> tetramers [<xref rid="RSOB160293C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. To determine whether the TCRs used by CD8 T cells from Rop7-I, -II and -III mice recognize the Rop7 epitope in a qualitatively different manner, we designed a set of altered peptide ligands and monitored the ability of CD8 T cells to recognize such ligands in the context of H-2 L<sup>d</sup>, using the caged tetramer approach [<xref rid="RSOB160293C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSOB160293C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Indeed, single amino acid substitutions differentially affected tetramer binding to CD8 T cells from Rop7-I, -II and -III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB160293F2">figure&#x000a0;2</xref><italic>a</italic>). CD8 T cells from all three lines of Rop7 mice bound tetramers loaded with the nominal antigen (IPAAAGRFF), with little quantitative variation. Binding of H-2 L<sup>d</sup>-IPAAAGRFF to Rop7-II T cells was slightly less avid than binding to Rop7-I or -III, suggesting a lower affinity. Rop7-I and -II, but not Rop7-III T cells bound IPA<bold>N</bold>AGRFF-loaded tetramers, whereas only Rop7-II T cells bound IPA<bold>F</bold>AGRFF-loaded tetramers. We expressed recombinant Rop7-I, -II and -III TCRs to measure their affinity for epitope-loaded H-2 L<sup>d</sup> molecules by surface plasmon resonance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB160293F2">figure&#x000a0;2</xref><italic>b</italic>).

As expected, based on differential TCR&#x02013;MHC binding strength between Rop7-III and -II, we also observed differences in expression of genes related to TCR signalling (electronic supplementary material, table S2).

A comparison of these CD8 T cells should allow us to assess the impact of the TCR's identity on the functional characteristics T cells as revealed also by the status of their transcriptome. This is important not only because it extends this type of analysis to an MHC haplotype other than H-2<sup>b</sup>, but also because no such comparison has been made for independently generated lines of mice bearing Class I MHC-restricted receptors of the same specificity on a genetically homogeneous background. We first analysed T-cell development in Rop7 mice heterozygous or homozygous for the TN TCR&#x003b1; and &#x003b2; chain and report the presence of appreciable percentage of CD8 cells that fail to stain with Rop7 tetramers, as well as the presence of a reduced, but important percentage of mature CD4 T cells. In heterozygous mice, the expression of a TCR other than the original TN receptor requires the endogenous rearrangement of the WT TCR&#x003b1; (or &#x003b2;) locus or secondary rearrangements at the TN TCR&#x003b1; (or &#x003b2;) locus.

Furthermore, Rop7-II cells secreted significantly fewer cytokines compared with Rop7-I and -III CD8 T cells and an increased proportion of cells died as the strength of stimulus decreased. Because the Rop7-II TCR has a significantly lower affinity for H-2 L<sup>d</sup>-IPAAAGRFF than the TCR of Rop7-I and -III (25- and 3-fold less, respectively), such differences could have been explained by differences in affinity. However, Rop7-II CD8 T cells showed an equally poor ability to secrete cytokines and enhanced cell death compared with Rop7-I CD8 T cells when stimulated with IPANAGRFF-loaded BMDC. In these conditions, the difference in affinity was less (approx. twofold), whereas differences in cytokine production remained large, suggesting inherent impairment of Rop7-II effector function. Stimulation of Rop7 CD8 T cells with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 (i.e. independently of antigen affinity) confirmed that Rop7-II CD8 T cells had lower intrinsic effector capacities as well as a marked propensity to cell death. Moreover, we observed differences between Rop7-I and -III T cells in proliferation, cytokine production and cell viability. Both inferior and superior effector functions might be intrinsically set by thresholds of self-reactivity. Indeed, for the CD8 clonal variants characterized here, self-reactivity positively correlates with effector capacities as demonstrated for several CD4 transgenic T cells [<xref rid="RSOB160293C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="RSOB160293C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] or a CD8 T cell polyclonal population [<xref rid="RSOB160293C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

First, accumulation in the spleen might not faithfully reflect global clonal expansion, for example, due to changes in cell migration behaviour. Second, discrepancies might be explained by quantitative (antigen dose) and qualitative (cytokines, co-stimulation) differences in stimulation as well as other cell-extrinsic factors (e.g. nutrients) between both conditions. Third, although we have no indication of increased apoptosis, Rop7-III CD8 T cells may be unable to sustain long-lasting expansion.</p><p>Our analysis of protein phosphorylation upon antigenic stimulation has uncovered interesting differences in signal transduction as well. Although we observed a decreased level of ERK and S6 phosphorylation in Rop7-II T cells, differences between the various Rop7 T cells seemed qualitative rather than merely quantitative. In fact, accumulated data suggest that signalling might occur in a different manner for every single clone depending not only on signal strength, but also on cell state as determined by tonic signalling experienced in the periphery [<xref rid="RSOB160293C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="RSOB160293C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Differences in signal integration [<xref rid="RSOB160293C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] are likely to explain heterogeneity in effector functions [<xref rid="RSOB160293C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Our work and that of others [<xref rid="RSOB160293C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSOB160293C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] show a correlation between effector function of T cells and self-reactivity. How, then, does self-reactivity dictate future effector functions? Self-reactivity, hence tonic signalling, might impact the phospho-proteome of each T-cell clone in a different manner. Indeed, evidence of changes in protein phosphorylation at rest has been provided in two independent studies [<xref rid="RSOB160293C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="RSOB160293C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Self-reactivity might also imprint the trancriptome of each clone in physiological conditions. Data presented above as well as results from others [<xref rid="RSOB160293C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] support this hypothesis. Our transcriptome-wide analysis showed that differences between unstimulated Rop7-II and -III CD8 T cells in cell cycle-associated genes were highly significant, even more so than TCR signalling-associated genes when considering adjusted <italic>p</italic>-values (electronic supplementary material, table S2). We confirmed these findings in a polyclonal CD8 T cell population. Indeed, the vast majority of cycling, Ki-67<sup>+</sup> cells were CD5<sup>high</sup>. This correlation suggests a threshold of self-reactivity (and CD5 levels) beyond which cells enter the cell cycle under physiological conditions and in the absence of the Rop7 epitope. Homeostatic expansion, a process linked to CD5 expression level [<xref rid="RSOB160293C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="RSOB160293C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], is assumed to be driven by &#x02018;self&#x02019; antigen when resources (e.g. IL-7) are abundant, as is the case in lymphopenia [<xref rid="RSOB160293C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, it is local rather than global cytokine excess that will be sensed by T cells. Of note, the IL-7 receptor (IL7r) gene itself was upregulated in Rop7-III T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB160293F6">figure&#x000a0;6</xref><italic>a</italic>).</p><p>In conclusion, the concept of a &#x02018;naive&#x02019; T cell as a fixed entity may need revision. Effector capacities of T-cell clones are shaped by the prior experience of self-reactivity. Future investigations focusing on signalling or transcriptomic analysis at the single-cell level in antigen-inexperienced T cells may very well uncover an even greater heterogeneity. In the very same way, the definition of &#x02018;self&#x02019; in the context of these recent studies is worth reconsidering. &#x02018;Homeostatic peptidome&#x02019; may be a more appropriate term than &#x02018;genome-encoded self&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><label>4.</label><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="s4a"><label>4.1.</label><title>Mice</title><p>BALB/c and BALB/c CD45.1 mice were purchased from the Jackson laboratory and bred in the animal facility of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research (Cambridge, MA) or in the animal facility of the Francis Crick Institute, Mill Hill Laboratory (London, UK).
