There are several reasons that make zebrafish as one of the most sought out organisms for biomedical research. High fecundity, fast growth rate, short generation time, ease of maintenance and an abundant supply of research material are some of the reasons for considering this model. Further, the availability of a number of genomic tools and the transparent embryos facilitate the non invasive strategy to observe experimental effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Most importantly, comparison of human reference genome shows that at least 70&#x000a0;% of the genes have one zebrafish orthologue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Of the human genes identified with morbidity descriptions in Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database, about 82&#x000a0;% can be related to at least one zebrafish orthologue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This high genomic similarity between zebrafish and human has resulted in important discoveries in the areas of human diseases, drug screens and therapeutic measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a major class of non-coding RNA molecules that have steadily gained impetus over the past decade. They regulate several genes post-transcriptionally and serve as an added layer of control, being termed as &#x0201c;Micromanagers of gene expression&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The expression patterns of miRNAs represent the physiological state of the cell and thus have an essential prognostic capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Previous studies have revealed that comprehensive expression profiling of miRNA is useful in determining their specific expression patterns in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], disease conditions such as cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and during cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>There are several experimental methods for profiling miRNAs such as northern blotting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], RT-PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and RAKE assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Each of these methods has their own limitations and advantages. Some of these methods are either cumbersome for scaling up and some are not sensitive enough to detect the low expressing miRNAs. The short length of these miRNAs also creates technical difficulties in the detection of mature miRNAs; further the above techniques are not suited to discover new miRNAs from the system.</p><p>With the advent of Next Generation sequencing (NGS) technology, there has been an increase in the efficiency of miRNA discovery. It not only overcomes the limitations of other methods but also provides an absolute and quantitative expression measurement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. NGS technology facilitates profiling of known miRNA and discovery of new transcripts. Owing to its high sensitivity, this technology can identify low abundant miRNA transcripts, which may not be detected by other methods.</p><p>In zebrafish, miRNA expression profiling and discovery was initially carried out through small RNA cloning and microarray analysis. MicroRNA expression was detected through large scale sequencing of sRNA libraries prepared from different developmental stages of zebrafish and two adult cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and this study identified about 154 mature miRNAs. Further this study revealed that the early zygotic stage (0&#x000a0;h) stage is nearly devoid of miRNAs. The expression of miR-430 family peaks at the blastula stage (4&#x000a0;h) and dominates the miRNA profile up to the pharyngula stage (24&#x000a0;h) and then decreases. Role of miR-430 in maternal RNA clearance during maternal to zygotic transition has been well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Kloosterman and co-workers identified 139 known and 66 new miRNA from 5-day old zebrafish larvae and adult zebrafish brain; using in situ hybridization and northern blotting they identified developmental stage specific and tissue specific expression patterns for some of these miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Using pyrosequencing technology to discover miRNAs, Soares et al. retrieved 90&#x000a0;% of the known miRNAs and predicted 25 novel miRNAs from different developmental stages and fully developed organs of zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>One of the recent publications used NGS technology to determine the temporal expression patterns for miRNAs and piRNAs during early embryonic development of zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In this study, they identified a number of known miRNA, 8 novel miRNAs and a diverse set of piRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Based on all the above mentioned studies, a total number of 247 mature and 344 pre-miRNAs were identified and submitted as genomic resource for zebrafish (miRBase Release 19). However, no attempt has been made to identify tissue associated or sex associated miRNAs from the known miRNA resource. MicroRNA database (miRBase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] has a total of ~2000 mature miRNAs for human and only about 247 miRNAs for zebrafish (miRBase Release 19). It is known that number of coding genes in human and zebrafish are almost same. However, zebrafish miRBase has substantially low number of miRNA compared to human. Thus it appears that most of the miRNA in zebrafish are yet to be discovered.</p><p>Using NGS technology we undertook a systematic and comprehensive approach to determine the tissue/sex associated expression patterns of known miRNAs and to discover novel miRNAs from different tissues of zebrafish such as the brain, gut, liver, ovary, testis, eye, heart and embryo. For tissues such as brain, gut and liver, smallRNA from both the male and female counterparts were sequenced separately. The aim of our study was to discover new miRNAs from different tissues and to identify tissue associated and sex associated expression of known and novel miRNAs. In this work we generated about 20&#x000a0;M reads per library (and 3 biological replicates) which is significant enough to determine expression profiling and to discover novel miRNAs. The expression pattern of miRNAs associated to each tissue and gender can serve as a useful resource for further research and for understanding the miRNA-mRNA regulatory mechanisms in zebrafish. We have also discovered 459 putative novel pre-miRNAs, of which about 30&#x000a0;% had human seed homologs. This study adds a significant genomic resource to the zebrafish miRNA landscape and has potential to provide better understanding of miRNA based gene regulation in zebrafish.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>MicroRNA frequency distribution in the sRNA datasets</title><p>Zebrafish small RNA deep sequencing data from different tissues and embryo was generated using Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform.

The known miRNAs (344 precursors, 247 mature miRBase Release 19) comprised a wide range of the mapped reads (16&#x02013;62&#x000a0;%), with the brain samples having the maximum amount (38&#x02013;62&#x000a0;%) and with the ovary and testis having the minimum amount (6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;%). The final unannotated pool of sequences that serves as a source of novel miRNA prediction was 7.6&#x02013;23.0&#x000a0;% with exceptions of ovary (51.4&#x000a0;%) and testis (55.2&#x000a0;%) that had almost half of the sRNA sequences unannotated. The presence of such a high amount of unannotated sequences in ovary and testis suggests the presence of some unknown small non-coding RNAs such as piRNA that needs to be further analysed. It has been shown that piRNA are most abundant in reproductive tissues and early embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] .</p><p>The known mature miRNAs in each sample showed a wide range of expression values spanning 7 levels of magnitude. The expression values of the known miRNAs of all tissue samples showed an almost normal distribution.</p><p>To obtain tissue associated known miRNAs, the mature miRNA expression profile of each tissue sample was compared pairwise with the others to obtain the miRNAs significantly up-regulated in itself and commonly down-regulated in all the others. The miR-430 family was found to be very highly expressed in embryo with very low to none expression in adult tissues as seen in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The miR-430 family has been shown to be involved in maternal RNA degradation during gastrulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Since our samples contained gastrulation stage embryo as well, it is logical to expect abundant presence of miR-430 in the sequence data. This miRNA family was found to be commonly down-regulated in all the adult tissues. The brain showed the highest number of tissue associated known miRNAs (22) pointing out to the fact that these miRNAs may have significant roles in brain development and functioning. Among the tissue associated miRNAs detected, some of them were reported in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] .</p><p>The sex associated miRNAs were obtained by comparing the mature miRNA expression profiles of the male and female counterparts of brain, gut and liver. The liver showed the highest number of sex associated known miRNAs (34), revealing major differences in the functioning of male and female livers. The miRNA dre-miR-2190 was found to be commonly sex associated for brain, gut and liver, enriched in the male counterparts. The miRNAs dre-miR-34c, dre-miR-430a, dre-miR-430b, dre-miR-430c, were found to be commonly sex associated for gut and liver, enriched in the female counterparts as well as ovary (on comparison with testis). For sex associated comparison, a pairwise comparison was made only between the male and female counterparts of the same tissue and hence the miRNAs 430a,b,c showed up as sexassociated as well. This phenomenon is overshadowed by the highest abundance of these miRNAs in embryo. Their specific expression in female liver and gut indicate that these miRNAs may be involved in functions in addition to maternal RNA degradation.</p><p>One of the most important applications of Next Generation Sequencing is the ability to detect novel miRNAs. The prediction of novel miRNAs was done by miRDeep2 software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] using the unannotated pool of sequences, left after the removal of the annotated sequences through the elimination pipeline. The sieving out of the known and annotated sequences through the elimination pipeline cuts down on the number of false predictions and increases the specificity of novel miRNA prediction.</p><p>Before using miRDeep2 for novel miRNA prediction, we ran the software on the unsieved and entire samples comprising of the annotated and unannotated reads. The number of known miRNA picked up by miRDeep2 in comparison to the total number of miRNAs in the samples at the similar cut-off used for novel miRNA prediction was used as an indicator of sensitivity. The sensitivity of miRDeep2 ranged from 89 to 95&#x000a0;% with the exception of one female liver sample, for which the sensitivity was 81&#x000a0;%.</p><p>A total of 459 novel pre-miRNAs were predicted in this study based on the sequence data. Majority of these novel miRNAs were less abundant and showed a skewed frequency distribution, with large number of miRNAs falling within the low levels of expression and very few within the high levels of expression. This is perhaps the reason they have not been discovered so far and highlights the merit of our really deep sequencing approach. These predicted novel miRNAs were also found to be having less seed conservation to human miRNAs (30&#x000a0;% on an average). These findings were in accordance to an earlier study that also reported less abundance and less conservation of the novel miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>The sequences of the predicted novel pre-miRNAs were compared with each other to obtain the ones associated to each tissue. Here again, the brain showed maximum number (125) tissue associated novel pre-miRNAs. It would be further interesting to correlate these tissue and sex associated miRNAs to their targets to understand the gene regulatory network and pathways regulating zebrafish development. The combination of the miRNA and their targets would certainly reveal the intricacies of regulation going on in each tissue.</p><p>In conclusion, even though ~247 mature miRNAs have been identified for zebrafish (miRBase19) we have categorized sex associated and tissues associated candidates and this attempt paves the path for tissue biomarker discovery. Addition of 459 novel pre-miRNAs will serve as a good resource for future research to understand miRNA-mRNA regulation in zebrafish. The high degree of similarity in the protein coding genes between zebrafish and humans promotes the application of discoveries in zebrafish to humans; functional analaysis of the novel zebrafish miRNAs will have implications in understanding their role in humans.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>RNA Isolation and Libraries Construction</title><p>Total RNA were extracted using mirVana&#x02122; miRNA Isolation Kit (Life Technologies). For small RNA sequencing, total RNA was extracted from tissues (brain, gut, liver, ovary, testis, eye and heart) of adult fishes. For brain, gut and liver, the RNA was extracted from male and female fishes separately. For each tissue sample, 3 biological replicates were prepared; each biological replicate comprised of RNA extracted from tissues collected from 4 to 5 fishes. For the embryo RNA, early embryonic stages ( 2.5, 6, 12 and 24 hpf stage embryos; about 30 embryos per stage) and 15&#x000a0;day juveniles were pooled and RNA was extracted. Three replicates were prepared for each sample.
