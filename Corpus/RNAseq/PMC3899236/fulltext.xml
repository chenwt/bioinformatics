Primary goals are QTL detection and genomic selection. The purpose here was design of a 50&#x02013;60,000 SNP chip for goats. The success of a moderate density SNP assay depends on reliable bioinformatic SNP detection procedures, the technological success rate of the SNP design, even spacing of SNPs on the genome and selection of Minor Allele Frequencies (MAF) suitable to use in diverse breeds. Through the federation of three SNP discovery projects consolidated as the International Goat Genome Consortium, we have identified approximately twelve million high quality SNP variants in the goat genome stored in a database together with their biological and technical characteristics. These SNPs were identified within and between six breeds (meat, milk and mixed): Alpine, Boer, Creole, Katjang, Saanen and Savanna, comprising a total of 97 animals. Whole genome and Reduced Representation Library sequences were aligned on &#x0003e;10 kb scaffolds of the <italic>de novo</italic> goat genome assembly. The 60,000 selected SNPs, evenly spaced on the goat genome, were submitted for oligo manufacturing (Illumina, Inc) and published in dbSNP along with flanking sequences and map position on goat assemblies (i.e. scaffolds and pseudo-chromosomes), sheep genome V2 and cattle UMD3.1 assembly. Ten breeds were then used to validate the SNP content and 52,295 loci could be successfully genotyped and used to generate a final cluster file. The combined strategy of using mainly whole genome Next Generation Sequencing and mapping on a contig genome assembly, complemented with Illumina design tools proved to be efficient in producing this GoatSNP50 chip. Advances in use of molecular markers are expected to accelerate goat genomic studies in coming years.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Grants were funded by ANR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/">http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/</ext-link>), ANR-09-GENM-009-03 GENIDOV, CHEST-454, funded by APIS-GENE; CAPRISNIP programme: UNCEIA, CAPGENES and APIS-GENE French Breeding organizations; and EC&#x02019;s Seventh Framework Programme, 3SR Integrated Project(Sustainable Solutions for Small Ruminants) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.3srbreeding.eu">http://www.3srbreeding.eu</ext-link>).

According to the FAO, the world goat population has been estimated to be around 921 million animals, with an increase of more than 20% during the last ten years. Goats are a source of milk, meat and fibre and are adapted to a wide range of grazing environments. To date, however, they lack genomic research tools available in cattle and sheep.</p><p>Goat genome knowledge has benefited from different sources: the development of generic resources such as a BAC large inserts genomic library <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086227-Schibler1">[2]</xref>, mapping of microsatellites and genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086227-Schibler2">[3]</xref>, local resources developed in order to make progress in a specific genome region (for example, researches on Polled Intersex Syndrome have allowed progress on the chromosome 1 genetic map <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086227-Pailhoux1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086227-Vaiman1">[5]</xref>) and comparative cytogenetic analysis between goat genome and related species as reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086227-Schibler3">[6]</xref>. Fontanesi and co-authors have also used bovine tiling arrays to characterize copy number variations in goats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086227-Fontanesi1">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Recently, the development of next generation sequencing (NGS) allowed <italic>de novo</italic> sequencing of the goat genome, which in turn offered an opportunity to create the International Goat Genome Consortium (IGGC, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.goatgenome.org">www.goatgenome.org</ext-link>) in 2010, whose aims were to consolidate research efforts at the international level. The Goat Genome reference sequence has been published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086227-Dong1">[8]</xref> and is available to the scientific community through a web interface and mirror (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://goat.kiz.ac.cn/GGD/">http://goat.kiz.ac.cn/GGD/</ext-link>). A RH panel has also been developed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086227-Du1">[9]</xref>. Alongside these two new tools to speed up development of genetic and physical animal maps, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels allow screening the genetic variability of a species and thus open the way towards their use for genomic selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086227-Hayes1">[10]</xref>. SNP chips have already been developed for several domestic animal species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086227-Fan1">[11]</xref> and cattle are the best funded with a clear use for genomic selection. Tools for cattle include low (3K, 7K <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086227-Boichard1">[12]</xref>), moderate (50K <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086227-Matukumalli1">[13]</xref>) and High density SNP chips (628K &#x00026; 777K). 50&#x02013;60K SNP chips have also been developed for sheep, pigs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086227-Ramos1">[14]</xref> and chickens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086227-Groenen1">[15]</xref> and a 700&#x02013;800K chip is under development for sheep (James Kijas, personal communication). One of the challenges of developing a SNP chip is ensuring utility of the chip in a wide variety of breeds. In 2010, goat SNP detection projects were underway in: France, Netherlands and Malaysia/Canada, all prioritizing native breeds. IGGC proposed the consolidation of these SNP detection projects towards the goal of creating an international SNP chip. The objective was to design a moderate density chip (50&#x02013;60K) consisting of markers evenly spaced across the goat genome and segregating with high to medium allele frequencies in each of six breeds (Alpine, Saanen, Creole, Boer, Katjang and Savanna).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Goat Reference Genome</title><p>Scaffolds of the <italic>de novo</italic> assembled goat genome were made available by BGI sequencing center (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genomics.cn">www.genomics.cn</ext-link>) to allow mapping of the flanking sequences of the identified SNPs. The assembly consisted of 285,379 scaffolds representing 2,665,022,236 bp. Since a Yunling female goat was sequenced to create the assembly, no representation of the Y chromosome was included in the sequence. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086227-g001">Figure 1</xref>, there were 2,731 scaffolds larger than 10 kb, representing 97% of the total assembly.

This explains why the SNP discovery was achieved through two different pipelines, for milk and mixed breeds (Alpine, Saanen and Creole) in one project and meat breeds (Boer, Katjang and Savanna) in another project.</p><p>For dairy and mixed breeds, sixteen animals (seven Alpine, three Creole and six Saanen) were sequenced using a HiSeq2000 (Illumina, Inc) and produced 80 to 220 million high quality (passing filter) 100 bp reads per animal. This resulted in a sequencing coverage of 13.5 to 26X depending on the breed, after filtration of the BAM files. Another set of 17 Dutch Saanen animals was used to construct a RRL library. Sequencing from this RRL library resulted in 120 million 76bp sequences. The sequence coverage, using those data, after BAM filtration, was 2.85X on average in the genomic regions that were covered with one read at least.</p><p>SNP discovery was performed for each breed separately after which the results were combined. A minimum of two reads per allele was mandatory in the definition of a SNP not including the reference, with a minimum sequencing depth of six and a maximum depth of 100, to avoid repeated regions.

We opted to select only Infinium II SNPs, to maximise the number of genotyped polymorphisms, within the allocated space on the SNP chip.</p><p>Since the average spacing of markers on a 50&#x02013;60K SNP chip is about 60,000 bp, we disregarded SNPs mapping on contigs of fewer than 10,000 bp. To maximise the success rate of the beadpool, we also eliminated INDELs or SNPs that a) represented &#x0003e;2 alleles b) were within 20bp from another variant c) had an ADT score &#x0003c;0.8 or d) had an estimated MAF &#x0003c;0.2 in breeds of interest. This list of 537,145 SNP was ranked using increasing category number (see material and methods) and decreasing MAF. Class 1 SNPs were detected in ESTs and all included. The following ten classes corresponded to a decreasing number of breeds in which the SNP is observed. The first selection of 60,000 SNPs was done with spacing along the genome using an in-house algorithm (available on request). More than 97% of the SNPs were heterozygous in at least three breeds. To capture some remaining large genomic regions without SNPs, 1,000 SNPs of this first list were replaced by an alternative SNP, presenting either a higher number category or a &#x0003c;0.2 MAF or an &#x0003c;0.8 ADT score.

This chip has already been successfully used for genetic diversity studies on Boer, Cashmere and Rangelang goats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086227-Kijas1">[17]</xref>. This utility across non-discovery breeds is the consequence of using six goat breeds for SNP discovery with different characteristics (including milk, meat and mixed breeds), origins, and grazing environments. Our procedures to identify SNPs and estimate their MAF proved to be reliable, with a &#x0003e;98% successful loci, comparable to the rate observed in chicken (95%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086227-Groenen1">[15]</xref>) and somewhat higher to that observed in cattle (88%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086227-Matukumalli1">[13]</xref>) or pigs (89%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086227-Ramos1">[14]</xref>). However, the estimates of SNPs declared as polymorphic by the various authors are quite difficult to compare since: the number of samples genotyped and proportion of genotyped samples used for SNP discovery, differed. Factors contributing to the high conversion rate include: a high sequencing depth (13.5 to 35X, depending on the breed) and the selection of high MAF candidate SNPs across breeds. This high sequencing coverage on the whole genome, when compared to Sanger sequencing strategies previously used, has been obtained through NGS technologies. This sequencing coverage, combined with the choice of high MAF SNP, had already proven its efficiency, on reduced representations of the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086227-Groenen1">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Technology failures during probe synthesis resulted in 11% loss of SNPs that were submitted to design resulting in 89% conversion of the pre-manufacturing content which was slightly below expected conversion of working assays based upon the weighted average ADT design score of.95 leading to the expectation that 95% of the assays would convert to working assays. The reason for the failure of a subset of the probes to appear in the final post-manufacturing content is independent of the likelihood of a sequence to convert to a working design due to the random nature of the assembly of beads into wells and the minimum redundancy threshold in the Infinium manufacturing process for each probe. If a probe was manufactured successfully, but the number of beads representing that probe were not represented in a minimum redundancy of over 5x (for an average of 15x redundancy of all probes), then it was removed <italic>via</italic> the quality checking process by Illumina. This results in a random failure that is unrelated to the sequence and design of the probes themselves.</p><p>In addition, because we did not have goat genome input into the ADT tool, we were not able to do a check on probe design based upon expected repetitive, low diversity or otherwise known problematic regions of the genome. As a result, any scores that come from the design as &#x0201c;species: Other&#x0201d; will be slightly inflated compared to whether we had the genome check integrated into the design process.</p><p>50&#x02013;60K SNP chips are primarily used for finding association between markers and phenotypes. To achieve this well, both a uniform distribution of the SNPs on the genome and the complete coverage of the genome are required. A large excess of SNPs is required to be able to evenly space the SNPs on the genome. Groenen and co-authors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086227-Groenen1">[15]</xref> proposed &#x0201c;a rule of thumb&#x0201d; that this number be 10-fold higher than the targeted number of the final chip. With about 10 million SNPs in our database, we were easily able to achieve a uniform spacing. This source of high-quality SNPs will also be useful for further studies and tool development: e.g. we will have a large number of SNPs available for fine-mapping in subsequent studies. However, the sequencing depth we have achieved is not sufficient to identify the majority SNPs with low MAF. These are a source of SNPs which are valuable for association studies as emphasized by Gorlov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086227-Gorlov1">[18]</xref>. With the use of whole genome sequence at high coverage, complete coverage of the genome was achieved using contigs &#x0003e;10kb and a preliminary assembly of the goat genome. This highlights the efficiency of using draft genome assemblies for SNP chip designs. Only 26 regions larger than 150kb remained without a designed SNP on the goat scaffolds. To independently check this spacing, we successfully mapped 59,000 SNPs out of the 60,000 selected SNPs on the cattle genome, supporting the already described co-linearity of cattle and goat genomes. On the cattle genome, 260 regions larger than 150kb without a SNP were observed. This can be explained by i) differences between cattle and goat genomes, ii) the use of &#x0003e;10kb goat scaffolds only that represent 97% of the goat genome, 3% of the genome remaining unassembled in our sequences.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The combined strategy of using mainly whole genome NGS and mapping on a contig genome assembly, coupled with Illumina designing tools proved to be efficient when creating the GoatSNP50 chip.

In short, equal amounts of DNA from the 17 bucks were combined into two pools each consisting of 25 &#x000b5;g of DNA. Aliquots of 5 &#x000b5;g for each pool were digested with either <italic>Alu</italic>I or <italic>Hha</italic>I (10 units per reaction, Pharmacia). The digested pools in Orange loading dye (Fermentas) were size-fractionated on precast 10% polyacrylamide in 1xTBE with the Criterion&#x02122; Cell (BioRad). After staining, the target fragment size range of 110&#x02013;130 bp was sliced out of the gel. The gel slice was sheared by nesting a 0.5ml eppendorf tube (with a hole in the bottom formed with a needle) containing the gel slice inside a 2ml eppendorf tube, and centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 2 minutes. The sheared gel pieces were covered with 300ul DNA recovery buffer (8mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.08mM EDTA, 1.25M ammonium acetate), vortexed, and eluted at 4&#x000b0;C overnight, followed by 15 minutes incubation at 65&#x000b0;C.
