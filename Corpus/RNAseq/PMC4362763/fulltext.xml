Unfortunately, the corresponding systematic capture of patient phenotypic variation needed to fully interpret the impact of genetic variation has lagged far behind. Exploiting deep and systematic phenotyping of a cohort of 197 patients presenting with heterogeneous developmental disorders and whose genomes harbour <italic>de novo</italic> CNVs, we systematically applied a range of commonly-used functional genomics approaches to identify the underlying molecular perturbations and their phenotypic impact. Grouping patients into 408 non-exclusive patient-phenotype groups, we identified a functional association amongst the genes disrupted in 209 (51%) groups. We find evidence for a significant number of molecular interactions amongst the association-contributing genes, including a single highly-interconnected network disrupted in 20% of patients with intellectual disability, and show using microcephaly how these molecular networks can be used as baits to identify additional members whose genes are variant in other patients with the same phenotype. Exploiting the systematic phenotyping of this cohort, we observe phenotypic concordance amongst patients whose variant genes contribute to the same functional association but note that (i) this relationship shows significant variation across the different approaches used to infer a commonly perturbed molecular pathway, and (ii) that the phenotypic similarities detected amongst patients who share the same inferred pathway perturbation result from these patients sharing many distinct phenotypes, rather than sharing a more specific phenotype, inferring that these pathways are best characterized by their pleiotropic effects.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Developmental disorders occur in &#x0223c;3% of live births, and exhibit a broad range of abnormalities including: intellectual disability, autism, heart defects, and other neurological and morphological problems. Often, patients are grouped into genetic syndromes which are defined by a specific set of mutations and a common set of abnormalities. However, many mutations are unique to a single patient and many patients present a range of abnormalities which do not fit one of the recognized genetic syndromes, making diagnosis difficult. Using a dataset of 197 patients with systematically described abnormalities, we identified molecular pathways whose disruption was associated with specific abnormalities among many patients. Importantly, patients with mutations in the same pathway often exhibited similar co-morbid symptoms and thus the commonly disrupted pathway appeared responsible for the broad range of shared abnormalities amongst these patients. These findings support the general concept that patients with mutations in distinct genes could be etiologically grouped together through the common pathway that these mutated genes participate in, with a view to improving diagnoses, prognoses and therapeutic outcomes.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the MRC (funding to SM, AT and CW) and the Clarendon Scholarships, Somerville College Scholarships, and NSERC Julie Payette Scholarships (funding to TA) and by the European Commission: GENCODYS grant 241995 under FP7 (AVvS, BBAdV and CW), the Dutch Organisation for Health Research and Development: ZON-MW grants 917-86-319 and 912-12-109 (BBAdV).

The epidemiology of these heterogeneous disorders strongly implicates an underlying genetic etiology, with many patients possessing an increased burden of copy number variants (CNVs; regions of the genome &#x0003e; 1Kb that are deleted or duplicated). CNV screens now routinely included in primary diagnostics[<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] with exome analyses expected to grow in use as the cost falls [<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the heterogeneity in patient phenotypes is similarly reflected in the underlying genetic variation making it difficult to pin-point those particular genes whose mutation contributes to the phenotype. The field of disease genomics has, in particular, heralded two developments to address heterogeneous and multigenic disorders, namely (i) deep and systematically-defined patient phenotypes[<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and (ii) pathway analysis approaches[<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>For genetically heterogeneous disorders, the power of a cohort of patients to identify a shared pathoetiology may be diminished by the presence of multiple etiologies, each etiology contributing non-exclusively to different aspects of the phenotypic heterogeneity. Accordingly, it is often advantageous to analyse more phenotypically-similar subgroups, assuming that these subgroups would be enriched for a particular etiology[<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Indeed, the observation by clinicians of marked phenotypic similarities across a broad range of features for a particular subgroup of patients has enabled the identification of the genetic causes of many syndromes; for examples see[<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. To enable large-scale, systematic and automated patient phenotypic comparisons, phenotype ontologies, such as the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)[<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], have been developed. These ontologies consist of thousands of predefined phenotypic terms arranged in a hierarchy in which more specific child terms are organised underneath broader parent terms; for example, a patient ascribed the more specific phenotype &#x0201c;abnormality of the retina&#x0201d; would also recursively inherit any overarching phenotypic terms such as &#x0201c;abnormality of the eye&#x0201d;. Once these phenotypic terms have been rigorously assigned to large numbers of patients, ontologies such as the HPO enable various degrees of phenotypically-similar subgroups of patients to be systematically and objectively constructed, permitting the search for shared pathoetiologies at many levels of phenotypic homogeneity. A second challenge for large-scale analyses of patient phenotypes is that often only the presence of phenotypes is recorded without confirmation that unrecorded phenotypes had been considered. This forces the dangerous assumption that the absence of evidence for the presence of a given phenotype is evidence of absence of that phenotype. Many non-obvious and non-superficial genotype/phenotype relationships may be missed unless the presence/absence of phenotypes are explicitly determined and, in particular, pleiotropy will likely be under-reported[<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Complementing patient phenotype subgrouping, pathway analysis approaches rely on the observation that disruptions to different genes that operate within the same pathway often produce similar phenotypes[<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Thus, the analysis of patients that share a common phenotype, regardless of whether they can be classed into an over-arching disorder, may yield insights into commonly disrupted pathways underlying that phenotype and contribute to the spectrum of presentations in each patient. This approach is well suited to the study of multigenic disorders as pathway approaches gain power from coverage of the pathway, rather than recurrent hits to the same gene. One approach to identifying commonly disrupted pathways amongst distributed variants is to employ &#x0201c;functional enrichment&#x0201d; approaches[<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This approach proposes that the genes affected by dispersed variants that act within a common pathway are likely to share other functional or biological characteristics, such as being annotated to a particular biological process[<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], exhibiting a particular expression pattern[<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], expressing protein products that interact with each another[<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and/or presenting a shared phenotype upon their orthologue&#x02019;s disruption in a model organism[<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Such collections of gene annotations vary both in terms of their rates of false positives, especially when formed from high-throughput experiments or computational-inference, and false negatives, for example where gene coverage is poor[<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, different annotation types may be combined to increase confidence that genes are functionally concordant[<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we tested the paradigm that pathway analysis approaches applied to a large and systematically-phenotyped cohort that present heterogeneous developmental disorders can detect common molecular pathologies and the extent to which these inferred common etiopathologies confer common phenotypic presentations. Focusing on 197 patients that possessed <italic>de novo</italic> CNVs smaller than 5 Mb, we systematically grouped them according to the structure of the HPO and applied a range of complementary functional enrichment approaches that converged on numerous molecular pathways underlying a range of phenotypes. These gene networks were deemed biologically coherent through enrichments of direct molecular interactions, and we provide an exemplar as to how they can be used as &#x0201c;baits&#x0201d; to identify genes disrupted in other cohorts that participate in the same network. Finally, we show that patients whose variants contribute to the same functional enrichments are significantly more phenotypically-similar overall and results primarily from pleiotropic effects arising from the perturbation of the same inferred network, but that this similarity varies with the enrichment approach employed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Summary of data</title><p>We sought to employ common functional enrichment and pathway analysis to a large cohort of deeply and systematically-phenotyped patients presenting with heterogeneous developmental disorders, in order to identify the genes and molecular pathways underlying these phenotypes and to investigate the phenotypic similarity among patients whose variants affect genes detected to lie in the same pathways. We focused on sporadic patients possessing <italic>de novo</italic> CNV events as it is often the case that the <italic>de novo</italic> CNV mutation is consequential, and thus copy change of one or more of the genes disrupted by the CNV is responsible for the phenotypes observed<sup>2; 10</sup>. Furthermore, we excluded patients with CNVs &#x0003e;5Mb, as the large numbers of genes affected make it substantially more challenging to identify specific functional enrichments. Through our integrative approach, we sought to identify the genes and pathways underlying each phenotype presented by members of the cohort.</p><p>A cohort of 4297 patients was collected by the Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, the Netherlands. All patients were diagnosed with intellectual disability, developmental delay and/or congenital abnormalities. Each patient was deeply phenotyped by clinicians, using terms from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) to describe their clinical abnormalities. The HPO contains over 10,000 terms for clinical phenotypic abnormalities, which relate to one another through a hierarchical structure, with less specific parent terms, covering more specific child terms. All parent (more general) phenotypic terms were additionally assigned to patients based on their clinically-assigned phenotypes. Central to the analyses performed in this study, these patients were systematically phenotyped and thus each patient was considered for the same phenotypes as every other, enabling accurate comparison of patient phenotypic similarity.</p><p>Of 1663 rare CNVs observed within at least one patient in the cohort, 437 were identified as <italic>de novo</italic>. Filtering our patients to include those that had only a <italic>de novo</italic> CNV shorter than 5Mb left 197 patients remaining (see <bold><xref rid="sec007" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref></bold>). Of these, 154 patients (78%) had intellectual disability of varying severity, 80 were diagnosed with developmental delay, 54 with growth abnormalities, and 37 with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). These 197 patients possessed 826 distinct HPO phenotypes (individuals possessing 2&#x02013;182 phenotypes, including parental terms), while the median number of phenotypes per patient increased to 31. There were 219 <italic>de novo</italic> CNVs remaining across the 197 filtered patients, with a median size of 1.37 Mb. Of these, 82 were duplication, or gain, CNVs, while the remaining 137 were deletion, or loss, CNVs. Gains and Losses had a median size of 1.36Mb and 1.40Mb respectively. 2907 unique genes were affected across all 197 patients, ranging from 0&#x02013;190 genes per patient, with a median 95 gene disrupted per patient.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Inferring molecular pathways</title><p>We employed a multifaceted functional genomics approach to analyzing the genes disrupted in the cohort. In turn, we investigated each set of genes found to be affected by <italic>de novo</italic> CNVs in patients that shared a specific HPO phenotype, where patients sharing the phenotype numbered 3 or more (408 patient-phenotype groups). For each phenotype, we employed a four-way functional genomics analysis, to identify functional associations between genes disrupted in these particular patient-phenotype groups which could represent a disrupted biological process that underlies the shared phenotype. Firstly, we employed a Gene Ontology (GO) analysis[<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], in order to determine whether or not genes disrupted with each phenotype were associated with any particular GO terms, using a whole genome background as a comparator. The second method applied was to similarly determine enrichments among disrupted genes using pathway annotations from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As a third method, we examined the abnormal phenotypes observed from gene disruption events (&#x0201c;knockouts&#x0201d;) in mouse [<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For this, we asked whether the unique mouse orthologues of genes affected by these CNVs yield particular phenotypes when disrupted. Finally, our fourth method examined whether or not genes from patients&#x02019; CNVs clustered together in a gene co-expression network. Given these patients predominantly neurological phenotypes, we used the BrainSpan dataset which measured the spatiotemporal expression of genes across 16 brain regions and at 6 developmental time points (see <bold><xref rid="sec007" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref></bold>).</p><p>Each of these functional association approaches was applied to each of 408 sets of genes disrupted by CNVs in patients presenting a particular phenotype (patient-phenotype groups). Genes variant in only two patient-phenotype groups were found to possess significant functional associations using all four of the methods applied, namely HP:0001250 (<italic>Seizures</italic>) (<bold><xref rid="pgen.1005012.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold>) and HP:0010864 (<italic>Intellectual disability</italic>, <italic>Severe</italic>). Significant enrichments using three of the methods were observed in a further 64 patient-phenotype groups, enrichments for two methods for 120 patient-phenotype groups, and for just one method in a further 143 groups. Of the four methods employed, enrichments of phenotypes from mouse-orthologue knockouts (MGI) gave the least number of significant results, identifying functional association among affected genes in only 12 phenotype groups including HP:0001250 (<italic>Seizures</italic>) and HP:0000717 (<italic>Autism</italic>) (<bold><xref rid="pgen.1005012.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref></bold>). While the MGI method identified fewest associations, the enriched terms were the most relevant to the particular HPO phenotypes. For example, for patients with <italic>Seizures</italic> we saw an enrichment of genes whose mouse orthologue knockouts present with, amongst others (<bold><xref rid="pgen.1005012.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold>), <italic>Absence seizures</italic> (MP:0003216; 6.2-fold enrichment; <italic>p</italic> = 3 x 10<sup>&#x02013;4</sup>). Similarly, in patients with HP:0010864 (<italic>Intellectual Disability</italic>, <italic>Severe</italic>) we see an enrichment of mouse synaptic phenotypes such as <italic>Abnormal synaptic transmission</italic> (MP:0003635; 3.3-fold enrichment; <italic>p</italic> = 2.0x10<sup>&#x02013;5</sup>). This was in contrast with the results for <italic>Intellectual Disability</italic>, <italic>mild</italic> (HP:0001256) which was significantly enriched in learning phenotypes in mouse, such as <italic>abnormal associative learning</italic> (MP:0002062; <italic>p</italic> = 3.6x10<sup>&#x02013;6</sup>). When these two subsets of patients were combined under the more general term of <italic>Intellectual Disability</italic> (HP:0001249) no mouse phenotypes were significantly associated but many signalling pathways described in KEGG were significantly enriched among the patients, including the <italic>MAPK signalling pathway</italic>, and <italic>Neurotrophin signalling pathway</italic>. Other methods provided a larger number of significant results, with enrichments of GO terms found for each of 121 human phenotypes; however these enrichments were generally smaller, and involve less specific categories than those observed using mouse phenotypes (<xref rid="pgen.1005012.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005012.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>
<bold>Tables, <xref rid="pgen.1005012.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig.</xref></bold>). Additionally, affected genes within each of 189 phenotype groups were associated with particular KEGG pathways (<bold><xref rid="pgen.1005012.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref></bold>), while genes affected within each of 262 phenotype groups showed similarities in their brain spatiotemporal expression patterns, clustering significantly in the BrainSpan expression network (<bold><xref rid="pgen.1005012.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref></bold>). For 186 of 408 patient-phenotype groups, we found functional associations using multiple methods, and of these 177 (95%) phenotype groups identified the same genes using multiple methods, with the number of genes repeatedly identified for these groups ranging from 1 to 355 (<bold><xref rid="pgen.1005012.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005012.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref></bold>).</p><fig id="pgen.1005012.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1005012.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Functional genomics enrichments significantly enriched in genes affected by <italic>de novo</italic> CNVs in 33 patients presenting with seizures.</title><p>

Specifically, given each of the 65 PPI molecular networks perturbed by CNVs in Nijmegen patients presenting with the same specific phenotype, we asked whether the proteins encoded by genes found to be copy number changed in an additional cohort with the same phenotype also interacted within the same molecular networks. For this, we considered patients possessing <italic>de novo</italic> CNVs that were annotated within the DECIPHER database[<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

Of these 15 phenotypes, only for <italic>Microcephaly</italic> was there found to be a sufficient number of genes in both the NIJMEGEN-derived PPI network and DECIPHER patients CNVs to test for interactions.

Moving beyond a mutation in a single gene, we reasoned that if a functional enrichment identified among the copy number variant genes within a given set of patients identifies a common biological pathway perturbed within those patients, then the consequence of perturbing the same pathway may yield a similar set of phenotypes.

However, this is highly variable between the different functional genomics resources used to identify the functional enrichment, as well as between phenotypes examined. Only patients whose copy number variant genes showed significantly co-ordinated brain expression patterns within the BrainSpan data were consistently found to be more similar in their overall phenotypes as compared to pairs of patients whose genes were not similarly co-ordinately expressed in the brain (<bold><xref rid="pgen.1005012.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref></bold> and <bold>B</bold>).

In almost all cases, the distribution of subterms was indistinguishable between patients contributing to the pathway enrichment and non-contributing patients, demonstrating that the phenotypic similarity between patients whose variant genes contribute to the same functional enrichment was produced by common co-morbidities of phenotypes distinct from the enrichment-associated phenotype.

Similarly the four KEGG pathways significantly associated with more than 30 human phenotypes failed to identify phenotypically similar patient subsets.

Exploiting the &#x0201c;evidence of absence&#x0201d; of a phenotype among these patients, we were able to test the phenotypic convergence amongst patients whose variant genes contribute to the same functional enrichment. Overall, we find that there is significant phenotypic convergence providing general support for the &#x0201c;same perturbed molecular pathway, similar resulting phenotype&#x0201d; paradigm, but we note (i) that this relationship shows significant variation across the different functional genomics resources used to infer a commonly perturbed molecular pathway among a group of patients, and (ii) that these phenotypic convergences result from these patients sharing many distinct phenotypes, rather than sharing a more specific phenotype, suggesting that these pathways are best characterised by their pleiotropic effects (<bold><xref rid="pgen.1005012.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref></bold>).</p><fig id="pgen.1005012.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1005012.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Clusters of 33 genes whose products have known protein-protein interactions copy changed among 34 (22%) of 154 patients with intellectual disability.</title><p>These genes were those identified using two or more methods (from KEGG, GO and Gene Expression clustering) and that were found to contribute to a significant enrichment of interactions identified by the Dapple protein-protein interaction network (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 1x10<sup>&#x02013;4</sup>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1005012.g005"/></fig><p>Phenotypic convergence amongst patients whose variant gene contributed variant gene contributed to inferred (GO, expression) and/or determined (KEGG, PPI) molecular pathways was identified from the shared spectrum of distinct phenotypes presented by these patients, indicating common pleiotropic effects arising from the disruption of the inferred molecular pathway.

Inevitably, this may in part be a consequence of the phenotypic resolution captured for these patients, but we note that most patient phenotypic clustering based on subterms performed poorly including the more phenotypically-detailed &#x0201c;Abdomen&#x0201d; patient/pathway groups. Irrespectively, our finding of common pleiotropic effects arising from perturbing the same pathway strongly supports broad, systematic patient phenotyping to identify shared underlying molecular pathology [<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Systematically combining large-scale molecular and phenotypic variation is at the heart of disease genomics. However, the limitations of attempts to correlate imposed categorisations of both gene function and patient phenotype are obvious; both depend on limits of experimental/diagnostic techniques, prevailing ideas of biologically- or clinically-relevant observations, and motivation to investigate a given gene or patient. Surprisingly, the functional enrichment resource that is arguably the most well-aligned with HPO phenotypes[<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], namely the MGI mouse phenotypes, appeared to perform poorest in this study, both in detecting functional associations among variant genes (<bold><xref rid="pgen.1005012.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref></bold>) and in identifying phenotypically homogenous patient groups (<bold><xref rid="pgen.1005012.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref></bold>). Importantly, neither the literature-based pathways of the KEGG database nor GO-defined functionality delivered as many functional associations, nor identified as much phenotypic homogeneity within associations, as the most functionally/phenotypically-agnostic approach of correlated gene expression (BrainSpan; <bold>Fig. <xref rid="pgen.1005012.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref></bold> &#x00026; <bold><xref rid="pgen.1005012.g004" ref-type="fig">4B</xref></bold>). Despite the pleiotropic character of the phenotypic convergences, we found that a brain-specific gene expression set (BrainSpan) proved more effective than a body-wide expression set (GTEx; see <bold><xref rid="sec007" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref></bold>; <bold><xref rid="pgen.1005012.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig.</xref></bold>).

Nonetheless, the systematic genotyping and phenotyping of these patients has in turn enabled systematic pathway-based genotype/phenotype approaches that identify extensive molecular networks that appear perturbed, often with pleiotropic consequences, thereby giving insight into the more rigorously genotyped and phenotyped future of genomic medicine.

Four thousand two hundred and ninety seven patients with either intellectual disability, developmental delay, and/or multiple congenital abnormalities were recruited by the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre. Each patient was phenotyped by clinicians using a uniform and standardised clinical form, classified using the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms[<xref rid="pgen.1005012.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. More general HPO terms assigned to individuals were imputed from specific terms recorded. Of &#x0223c;10,000 possible HPO phenotypic terms covering the full spectrum of human phenotypic abnormalities, 1350 terms were assigned to one or more patients within the cohort. DNA samples were mainly taken via peripheral blood and analysed using the Affymetrix 250k <italic>Nspl</italic> SNP array platform (262,264 SNPs, 200 Kb resolution). CNVs were called where there were at least five or seven consecutive aberrant SNPs, for losses and gains, respectively.
