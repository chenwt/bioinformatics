Functional principal component analysis was used to examine time varying B cell vaccine responses. In subjects vaccinated within the previous three years, 90% of transcriptome variation was explained by a single subject-specific mathematical pattern. Within individual vaccine response patterns, a common subset of 742 genes was strongly correlated with migrating plasma cells. Of these, 366 genes were associated with human plasmablasts differentiating <italic>in vitro</italic>. Additionally, subject-specific temporal transcriptome patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells identified migration of myeloid/dendritic cell lineage cells one day after vaccination. Upstream analyses of transcriptome changes suggested both shared and subject-specific transcription groups underlying larger patterns. With robust statistical methods, time-varying response characteristics of individual subjects were effectively captured along with a shared plasma cell gene signature.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Pandemic and seasonal influenza causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. A key strategy in preventing influenza infection is vaccination, which induces B cells to differentiate through several stages into plasmablasts and long-lived plasma cells. These cells produce protective antibodies (immunoglobulin) against hemagglutinin (HA) capsid proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines effective influenza vaccine responses as 28-day post-vaccine antibody hemagglutinin inhibition assay (HAI) titer &#x02265; 1:40<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. However, influenza vaccines produce highly variable B cell responses among individuals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, making it difficult to predict who will achieve protective antibody titers and when.</p><p>Advances in data-driven personalized medicine, as applied to vaccine immunobiology, require new statistical methods that are able to capture immune response features common across subjects (e.g. consensus gene expression patterns) and patient-specific patterns which differ between subjects. This is especially true in vaccine studies. For example, recent studies on transcriptome patterns in vaccine responses have used sparse sampling (i.e. microarray analysis of PBMC on days 0, 3, and 7), and analytic methods that do not involve time series analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. In this report, we describe a robust systems biology approach using functional principal component analysis to identify common and subject-specific time-varying gene signatures within the trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) immune response.</p><p>In a memory response to influenza vaccination, resting memory B cells differentiate through proliferating plasmablast states to terminally differentiated non-proliferating plasma cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Migrating through peripheral blood to bone marrow and spleen, virus-specific antibody-secreting cells (ASC) appear 5&#x02013;9 days post-vaccination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Vaccine or influenza exposure induces memory B cells producing cross-reactive antibodies to similar influenza strains, termed heterosubtypic immunity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The presence of heterosubtypic immunity alters the speed and strength of TIV responses. Previous systems biology vaccine response analyses have sampled subjects on a single day empirically described as the peak B cell response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Such approaches lack the structure to capture peak responses or the statistical power to separate time varying gene signatures from inter-subject variation. Our approach is fundamentally different. Our goal was instead to identify differences in the character of the transcriptome responses of individuals using high-frequency sampling and an analytical method designed to characterize temporal patterns in complex systems. In contrast to other studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, we were not trying to predict who responded to the vaccine. Rather, our goal was a deeper understanding of the time varying, vaccine specific, transcriptome response, and to determine if the B and plasma cell gene expression patterns varied as a function of pre-existing vaccine antigen memory. Systems analysis of high-frequency time course data requires more samples per subject, but better defines peak and time varying B cell immune responses.</p><p>To separate concensus from subject-specific time-varying B cell transcriptome responses to influenza vaccination, we performed high-frequency (daily) sampling of serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), B cells and plasma cells from 14 human subjects over 11 days post-TIV administration. Our approach combined time-series transcriptome analysis, flow cytometry, ELISPOT, ELISA, and HAI assays with computational analysis to identify time-varying RNA biomarkers associated with robust B cell responses. To identify subject-specific gene expression signatures, we used functional principal component analysis (FPCA), a statistical dimension reduction method for high frequency time series data similar to principal component analysis for single time-point data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. In essence, the differential expression of each gene is determined by its own signal-to-noise ratio. The major temporal variation in the RNAseq time-series data can be characterized by a few representative patterns called eigenfunctions. Each gene expression curve is approximated by a linear combination of these eigenfunctions, enabling a flexible and parsimonious representation of time-series data. This method accommodated individuality in vaccine response by identifying time-varying transcriptome patterns unique to each subject. For a detailed explication of FPCA, and underlying statistical theory, please see the specific section in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Methods</xref>.</p><p>This approach identified a peripheral blood B cell transcriptome signature in previously vaccinated subjects that was strongly correlated with migrating plasma cells observed with cytometry. Upstream analysis of significant gene sets revealed common immunological dynamics between subjects as well as unique vaccine response features in individuals. At the subject level, these responses were associated with robust protective antibody responses and a prior history of influenza vaccination. Eigenfunctions calculated for PBMC gene expression also demonstrated an early wave of myeloid/dendritic cell lineage migration peaking 24&#x02005;hours post-vaccination. Additional eigenfunctions identified transcriptome changes unique to each individual, commonalities between subject-specific signatures, and their relative contribution to the overall vaccine response.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Heterogeneous antibody responses to TIV vaccination</title><p>We vaccinated three cohorts of 3&#x02013;6 subjects (n = 14 subjects) with the 2010&#x02013;2011 TIV.

No two subjects had identical changes in HAI titers.

Due to cost, RNA Seq analysis was performed on PBMC and B cell enriched samples from one contemporaneous cohort of five subjects, days 0 to 10 (110 samples). S01 RNA was used for RNA Seq pilot studies. We selected a single cohort of subject samples for RNA Seq analysis. Each gene was tested for differential change from day 0 to day 10 using FPCA-based significance testing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and a permutation test coupled with multiple-testing correction to control the false discovery rate (FDR &#x0003c; 0.05)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.

S02 had the largest number of significantly time-varying genes (5580 genes) while S06 had few (2 genes). For better comparison with other subjects, 1600 genes with the highest signal to noise ratio were added to the analysis of S06. After excluding genes with less than a 1.2-fold-change from baseline, the numbers of temporally differentially expressed genes still varied greatly: S02 (5256 genes), S03 (1309 genes), S04 (2147 genes), S05 (1603 genes) and S06 (1053 genes). Notably, 742 genes were common to three of five subjects.</p><p>We next used FPCA to identify the major variations in temporal RNA expression patterns of the differentially expressed genes for each subject, which were then represented by eigenfunctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, complete list of significantly time-varying genes in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). For three subjects (S02, S03, S04), 90% of transcriptome variation could be accounted for by a single eigenfunction. All three of these subjects had a previous history of influenza vaccination, pre-vaccine immunity to at least one viral vaccine strain by WHO criteria, and strong antibody responses by HAI titer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, p-values in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) and vaccine-specific ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, p-values in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p><p>Cellular responses were seen by FACS in the appearance of vaccine-specific ASC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>), and migrating CD27<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup>CD20<sup>lo</sup> CD138<sup>+</sup> plasma cells and CD27<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup>CD20<sup>lo</sup>CD138<sup>&#x02212;</sup> plasmablasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>, p-values in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>).

While the signaling pathways of these activators are not mutually exclusive, this is consistent with a plasma cell history of germinal center reaction.</p><p>In addition to common upstream activators, each subject also had a unique set of significantly varying transcription factors. Of particular interest, a wave of probable activation of Type I IFN and IFN-related gene sets appeared in S04 two days after the shared germinal center pattern. This could be evidence of a secondary migration of B cells with previous plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) interaction within the broader peak response. Producers of large amounts of Type I Interferons, pDC are part of the innate response to virus and can induce antibody production by CD40-stimulated B cells in response to influenza<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. As interferon regulatory factor (IRF) proteins can also regulate B cell differentiation in response to toll-like receptor stimulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, another interpretation of this pattern is a viral DNA-initiated innate response to the vaccine. The eigenfunctions derived by the analysis, along with upstream analysis, identified both common and subject-specific dynamic gene sets that may represent the effects of interacting innate and adaptive cellular immune systems on differentiating plasma cell.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Myeloid cell gene signatures peak in PBMC primary eigenfunctions at Day 1</title><p>We next hypothesized that the PCgs could be identified in PBMC collected in parallel with the B cell samples. We found something quite unexpected. The primary eigenfunction in the RNA Seq gene expression data, which explained over 70% of the variation for four out of five subjects (S02, 81.44%; S03, 86.68%; S04, 72.8%; S05, 57.15%; S06, 85.32%), peaked on day 1 post-vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). In the predominantly recall subjects, the genes with largest positive loadings on the primary eigenfunction were enriched for myeloid/dendritic cell (DC) lineage-associated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Table S8</xref>). Interestingly, the first eigenfunctions for predominantly de novo response subject S06 also contained myeloid/DC genes with more modest overall gene expression changes. These results suggest that even within the far more complex and dynamic mix of cellular populations in post-vaccination PBMC, FPCA analysis could identify a wave of myeloid lineage cells released into peripheral blood one day post-influenza vaccination in four of five subjects.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using a method based on FPCA for time-series transcriptome analysis, we identified a 742 gene signature, upstream transcription factors, and subject-specific gene sets associated with a robust B cell response to influenza vaccine. The method yields quantitative functions (eigenfunctions) that describe the temporal pattern of major transcriptome variation. In previously vaccinated subjects, the 742 gene signature was highly correlated with the migration of differentiating plasma cells through peripheral blood. There was an association between the PCgs and key upstream transcription factors that control antibody production including <italic>PRDM1</italic> and <italic>XBP1</italic>. A second gene signature was identified in unfractionated PBMC with a transcriptome profile suggesting migration of cells of the myeloid/DC lineage one day post-vaccination. In addition to these common gene signatures, eigenfunctions identified specific points of variation between individuals including a late spike in IFN-related gene activity. Thus, this approach can identify processes common across individuals in a vaccine response, as well as unique features that may underlie variation between subjects.</p><p>A systems biology approach to studies of B cell response requires not only connections between nested levels of regulation from genes to the whole organism, but also perturbations in these systems over time. This study was designed to capture frequent and complete B cell gene expression dynamics after influenza vaccination in a small set of subjects. In this study, high-frequency data from each subject serves as an intra-subject control, adding statistical power and accuracy for detection of significant signals from noisy transcriptome data. A better understanding of vaccine-induced subject-specific gene dynamics may help design studies with more subjects and fewer timepoints that still capture transcriptome patterns.</p><p>The use of eigenfunctions to identify common patterns of gene expression that explain transcriptome variations is a powerful analytic method. Inter-subject vaccine response heterogeneity is considerable<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. To generalize conclusions, other systems biological studies have averaged gene expression data across subjects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> or restricted their analyses to significant genes shared in at least 20% of subjects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Our goal was not to predict vaccine efficacy in large groups of people and indeed, all of our subjects achieved protective HAI titers. Our goal was to identify differences between the vaccine responses of individual subjects over time, and to identify dynamic gene expression mechanisms that underlie those differences. Our method approached subject variation by identifying subject-specific time-varying transcriptome signatures and <italic>within those unique patterns</italic>, identifying a B cell response gene set shared among individuals. This approach may yield more robust insights into immune response dynamics than sampling at wide time intervals (e.g. only days 0, 4 and 7 post-vaccination), which misses critical events in the individual response. While other studies have found plasma cell associated genes upregulated on Day 7<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, we found subject-specific variation in peak expression of PCgs that would have been missed with typical interval sampling.</p><p>Using high-frequency sampling, we found that subjects that had been previously vaccinated each had individual response characteristics, but 90% of the gene expression variation over time could be accounted for by a single subject-specific eigenfunction containing a common plasma cell transcriptome signature. This gene signature was identical in all three of the previously vaccinated subjects. As our sample size is small and all of our subjects for RNA Seq achieved protective HAI titers for the vaccine antigens, it is difficult to compare vaccine efficacy with incidence of the PCgs. One interpretation suggested by our findings is that the predominantly recall influenza vaccine responses exhibited a synchrony of B cell differentiation across vaccine-specific memory B cell populations, while the predominantly <italic>de novo</italic> responses did not. In combination with stochastic nature of plasma cell fate determination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, this synchrony of initiation likely resulted in a wave of differentiating plasma cell migrating from the germinal center of individuals with B cell memory.</p><p>PBMC eigenfunctions contained a signature suggesting migration of myeloid/DC lineage cells 24&#x02005;hours after vaccination. Our results are quite consistent with a recent study using transcriptional analysis of whole blood after influenza vaccination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. In this study, neutrophils and monocytes were implicated as the major source of the IFN-related gene set upregulated within 15&#x02005;hours post-vaccination for influenza. Interferon-related transcripts upregulated one day after Influenza vaccination in an earlier study were also correlated with anti-Influenza antibody titers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. This myeloid/DC gene signature likely triggers the initial germinal center reaction that results in plasma cell migrations later.</p><p>At the organ level in normal human subjects, we cannot sample lymph nodes and spleen. However, our analysis suggests that with higher temporal transcriptome resolution, peripheral blood does reveal evidence of prior upstream gene regulation, reflecting hidden dynamic events within lymphoid compartments. Also, upstream transcriptome analysis revealed that migration of multiple B cell populations underlie broader B cell and plasma cell surface marker phenotypes observed by flow cytometry. Further detailed experiments are needed to determine if transcriptome patterns observed are from broad changes in B cell population cell frequencies or a single dominating subpopulation. Given that our PBMC analysis reflects mixed and dynamic cell populations, any resulting gene interaction network cannot be considered strictly causal, but rather should be interpreted as a network of temporally associated transcriptome changes, likely occurring in several cell populations. Further and more detailed cell sorting work will need to be done to validate this hypothesis.</p><p>At the cellular level, division-linked B cell differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> is asymmetric with key control molecules like BCL-6 bequeathed to one daughter cell<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. This, along with graded <italic>IRF4</italic> expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, is thought to affect diversification of B cells. Our findings suggest that even with diverse B cell fates, a common transcriptomic signature can identify pre-existing vaccine-specific B cell memory, likely a marker for heterosubtypic immunity. During a pandemic, the PCgs may be useful in early prediction of both successful vaccine responses and heterosubtypic immunity.</p><p>At the individual gene level, within the PCgs we identified key plasma cell regulatory genes including those seen in other systems biology studies. <italic>TNFRSF17</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> was found in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data sets, and <italic>XBP1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> was central to our networks. Our high-frequency sampling extends these observations with detailed time-series data capturing individual response patterns. Other genes previously associated with the post-vaccination neutralizing antibody response include <italic>KBTBD7</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, which did not significantly change. We also found more genes specifically associated with plasma cells than previous studies. Whether this difference is due to the statistical strength of high-frequency sampling and FPCA, or other methodological differences, will be addressed in future studies.</p><p>Finally, we would like to note that FPCA-based time-series transcriptome analysis extends beyond simple statistical analysis. The method of FPCA and the form of the results are well suited for application to machine learning in computational modeling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. In replacing instinctive or heuristic approaches with a rigorous mathematic method that can approximate behaviors of a complex biological system, FPCA lends itself to the utilization of artificial intelligence methods in models and systems biology analyses. Specifically, the resulting eigenfunctions and matrix formulations allow more rigorous characterization and modeling of complex cellular and transcriptome responses.</p><p>In conclusion, these data provide evidence for a novel transcriptomic signature associated with differentiating B cell and plasma cell migration through peripheral blood B cell pools in subjects previously vaccinated for influenza. They also suggest that with further study, temporal transcriptome patterns that accommodate individual variation may illuminate more detailed system dynamics underlying large-scale responses. The method of FPCA may also allow robust modeling and systems analysis of immune responses using artificial intelligence and machine learning methods.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Human subjects protection</title><p>This study was approved by the Research Subjects Review Board at the University of Rochester Medical Center.

The cells were FACS-sorted into three stages of differentiation (Undivided, CD27lo, and CD27hi). (c) Row-normalized RNA expression levels from gene array data previously published by our group<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> were re-examined for the PCgs (genes ordered as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Table S6</xref>, red = upregulation, blue = downregulation). Genes upregulated in the PCgs also tended to be upregulated in the most differentiated CD27hi cells, expressed at moderate levels in less differentiated CD27lo cells, and at lowest levels in undivided cells. The converse was true of PCgs downregulated genes. (d) Of 2033 genes significantly different between CD27lo and the more differentiated CD27hi plasmablasts, 366 genes were shared with the PCgs (full list, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Table S6</xref>).

Upstream modifiers with a Z-score of 2.0 or higher, indicating probable activation, are shown. Molecule sets downstream of these modifiers were not mutually exclusive. All three subjects showed probable activation by upstream cytokines typical of the germinal center reaction, including IL2, IL4, IL5, IL6 and CD40LG across days of peak response. Upstream modifiers unique to each subject suggested immunological differences. Of interest, late in the peak response of S04, IFN-related signaling molecules were identified. This could be the result of a previous innate-type stimulus such as interaction with plasmacytoid dendritic cells or viral DNA-initiated toll-like receptor activation. Our method identified dynamic gene regulation patterns with common as well as subject-specific upstream regulatory elements underlying the larger post-vaccine response.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="srep02327-f6"/></fig><fig id="f7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>PBMC Gene Expression Patterns Suggest Myeloid/Dendritic Cell Migration.</title><p>PBMC were isolated in parallel with enriched B cell samples.

Second eigenfunctions explained most of the remaining variation in three subjects (S02, 13.11%) (S03, 7.24%) (S06, 10.2%). S05 had a third eigenfunction that explained 13.85% of variation. The first eigenfunction for S02, S03, and S04 peaked day 1. (b) The largest positive loadings on these functions were enriched for genes expressed by myeloid/DC lineages (gene symbols in red), (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Table S8</xref>). The first eigenfunction for S05 had few myeloid/DC genes. Second and third eigenfunctions, peaking day 1, both contained small numbers of myeloid/DC genes. The first eigenfunction of S06 peaking on day 1 was enriched for myeloid/DC genes, but expression changes were modest.
