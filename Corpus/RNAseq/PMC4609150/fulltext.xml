Here we approach this problem by linking sequence databanks to well annotated gene-chip datasets, using a multigene transcriptomic fingerprint as a link between gene mutations and gene expression in breast cancer patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The database consists of 763 NGS samples containing mutational status for 22,938 genes and RNA-seq data for 10,987 genes. The gene chip database contains 5,934 patients with 10,987 genes plus clinical characteristics. For the prediction, mutations present in a sample are first translated into a &#x02018;transcriptomic fingerprint&#x02019; by running ROC analysis on mutation and RNA-seq data. Then correlation to survival is assessed by computing Cox regression for both up- and downregulated signatures.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>According to this approach, the top driver oncogenes having a mutation prevalence over 5&#x000a0;% included AKT1, TRANK1, TRAPPC10, RPGR, COL6A2, RAPGEF4, ATG2B, CNTRL, NAA38, OSBPL10, POTEF, SCLT1, SUN1, VWDE, MTUS2, and PIK3CA, and the top tumor suppressor genes included PHEX, TP53, GGA3, RGS22, PXDNL, ARFGEF1, BRCA2, CHD8, GCC2, and ARMC4. The system was validated by computing correlation between RNA-seq and microarray data (r<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.73, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1E-16).

Current anticancer therapy presupposes a direct connection between mutational status and phenotype, therefore clinical decisions are often directly based on the genotype. For instance, KRAS status is considered an indicator of a patient&#x02019;s response to the EGFR inhibitor panitumumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and BRAF V600E status is used to predict response to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, such direct associations are not consistent among different clinical cohorts. For instance, vemurafenib was effective in BRAF V600E mutant melanoma but had no activity in BRAF V600E mutant colon cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Similarly, mTOR and PI3K inhibitors have the same activity in PI3K mutant and normal breast tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Also, the recently approved CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib had the same level of activity in breast tumors harboring altered and normal CDK4/6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The first NGS studies of breast cancer (BC) identified only three genes mutated in more than 10&#x000a0;% of BC tumors: TP53 (mutation rate 40&#x000a0;% of tumors), PI3K (25&#x000a0;% of tumors), and GATA3 (10&#x000a0;% of tumors). In particular, the most important genes identified in 100 primary breast cancers included AKT1, BRCA1, CDH1, GATA3, PIK3CA, PTEN, RB, TP53, ARID1B, CASP8, and MAP3K1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Banerji and coworkers studied 103 BC patients with NGS and recognized AKT1, PIK3CA, GATA3, TP53, and MAP3K1 as the most significant genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the TCGA project, the most prevalent mutations hit PIK3CA, PTEN, AKT1, TP53, GATA3, CDH1, RB1, MLL3, MAP3K1, and CDKN1B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Ellis and associates performed NGS on biopsies from two neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitor clinical trials and found PIK3CA, TP53, GATA3, CDH1, RB1, MLL3, MAP3K1, and CDKN1B to be the primary genes affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Despite differences in study design, these studies have a few common messages. First of all, NGS for a few hundreds of breast tumors has revealed new cancer genes. Additionally, NGS allowed the survey of intratumoral heterogeneity and has shown that there was always a dominant clone comprising at least 50&#x000a0;% of the tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therapeutically targeting the driver genetic aberrations will have the most significant effect on this clone. Targeted NGS in primary and metastatic breast cancers revealed that almost 85&#x000a0;% of tumors have a genetic aberration in a gene which is already actionable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We must, however, note that some of the most important genes including TP53 and KRAS are not yet directly targetable.</p><p>The relationship between somatic mutations and clinical outcome is multi-layered, complex, and to a large extent unknown, therefore the assumption of a direct influence of genotype on phenotype is a key limitation in the generally accepted paradigm. An empirical analysis to associate sequence variations to outcome would need thousands of patients with sufficient follow up to be sequenced with next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. We are far from this desirable goal. For instance, among the patients included in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] &#x02013; the largest breast cancer NGS database available today &#x02013; approximately 89&#x000a0;% of the patients are censored. While one can expect fewer events because TCGA reports overall survival only, but this is coupled with a median follow up of merely 1.3&#x000a0;years.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> Thus, the paucity of clinical annotation of the TCGA and other mutation datasets makes direct testing of the prognostic impact both limited and underpowered especially if one is interested in survival differences in selected sub-cohorts of patients.</p><p>Here we propose an approach that could circumvent this limitation. We postulate that a somatic mutation perturbs not only the mutated gene but the perturbation will propagate to a network of functionally related genes from the same or other cellular pathways. As a result, the effect of the mutation will be leveraged by a set of genes, and the changes in the expression of these genes that we term a &#x02018;transcriptomic fingerprint&#x02019; can be used as a surrogate marker of the mutation status (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Complex effects of a single mutation. A cornerstone of our model is the leveraged effect of gene regulation network influencing the final consequence of a mutation. Some target genes will be suppressed while others will be amplified resulting in a markedly changed transcriptomic fingerprint for important genes</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13073_2015_228_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Naturally, the genes indirectly affected by a mutation are unknown, but can be inferred by statistical means if there are sufficient data available. As we have recently shown, genome-wide transcriptomic analysis across all genes can identify genes affected by a given mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In brief, a large number of patients with known genotype are divided into two cohorts (those with mutations in a given gene or wild type), and transcripts associated with mutational status are identified by ROC analysis across all genes. These genes can then be evaluated for correlation with clinical outcome including therapy response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>In the present work we extend this analysis to predict the probability of patient survival from mutational data of breast cancer patients. As already mentioned, there is a growing body of samples with both mutation and gene expression data, but only a few datasets include relapse events on the same patients. At the same time, microarray (gene chip) data have been collected that have substantially longer follow up times and extensive clinical annotations. Harvesting the combined prognostic value of these two kinds of data is a challenging task with a potential for exceptional clinical relevance. Here, our aim was to combine available genotype and RNA-seq data generated by NGS with gene expression data generated by gene chips, in order to develop a tool that could estimate the complex prognostic impact of a genomic anomaly. We believe that this method and the associated online tool can be used to prioritize genes for further functional study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We implemented an approach to predict survival by simultaneously using gene mutation status and gene expression data. Main steps of the algorithm termed G-2-O (genotype to outcome) involve splitting TCGA samples into two cohorts using mutation status of the gene(s), then identifying differentially expressed genes between these cohorts using ROC analysis, and rendering a survival analysis using an independent dataset established using gene chip data. The entire statistical pipeline is summarized in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and the individual steps as well as database construction are described below.

Our rationale behind the selection of a lower stringency threshold was intra-tumor heterogeneity, that is, the presence of multiple, genetically diverse clones in a single tumor which may affect tumor growth and patients survival. During treatment minor clones can also have a prominent effect on the patients&#x02019; response to therapy and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

The applied filters for the &#x02018;Function class&#x02019; were: coding non-synonymous, stop gain, coding synonymous, locus region of gene, and splice site. The complete gene list comprising of n&#x02009;=&#x02009;22,938 genes from SNPeff was used during the functional annotation (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Processing of copy number variations</title><p>Copy-number variation (CNV) data were downloaded from the TCGA repository on 1 February 2015.

For this purpose, we used the TCGA lung squamous cell carcinoma dataset (LUSC), because it contains matched RNA-seq and Affymetrix gene chip data on the same samples. A matched gene list comprising 10,987 genes was prepared and pre-processed as described above for the breast cancer datasets. For each gene, we used the Spearman rank correlation to compare RNA-seq and gene-chip based expression levels.

Generally, the type of DNA mutation used to split the samples can be any alteration in the gene. As an output of this step a binary vector termed &#x02018;mutation pattern&#x02019; is calculated. In this, affected samples are represented by a &#x02018;1&#x02019; and unaffected samples are represented as &#x02018;0&#x02019;.</p><p>In certain settings one might be interested in a custom selection of gene variations &#x02013; we performed such an analysis to compare mutations resulting in altered mRNA sequence (including start gain, exon, splice site, non-synonymous coding, stop gain, and stop loss mutations) to silent mutations (including mutations in introns and synonymous coding mutations). In the final analysis interface we enabled the user to custom-select a combination of the alterations.</p><p>The next step is categorizing genes whose expression is different between the two cohorts designated in the previous step. For this, a univariate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis is separately performed using the expression values of each gene. In other words, samples are compared based by the previously identified &#x02018;mutation pattern&#x02019; and significantly altered genes are selected based on the area under the curve (AUC) value, and the associated <italic>P</italic> value computed in the ROC analysis. The AUC value is calculated by the ROCR package using the <italic>prediction()</italic> and <italic>performance()</italic> functions. The G2O algorithm calculates the <italic>P</italic> values where the null hypothesis is that the AUC value equals to 0.5. First, the script calculates the standard error of the null hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] from which the function derives the z-score. The <italic>P</italic> value is then calculated by transformation of the z-score using the normal distribution. Only genes passing both AUC and <italic>P</italic> value thresholds are considered significant. The final output of this step is a list of up- and downregulated genes whose expression is significantly associated with the given genotype alteration of the original input gene.</p><p>The final step involves the calculation of survival in the gene chip database using the &#x02018;metagenes&#x02019; selected in the TCGA data &#x02013; the average expression of the set of significant genes identified by the ROC analysis are designated as the &#x02018;metagene&#x02019; for the given genotype. This survival analysis is therefore independent from the genotype and RNA-seq data.</p><p>We then assessed the correlation with survival for each metagene using Cox proportional hazards regression and by plotting Kaplan-Meier survival plots for median-dichotomized metagenes. In each analysis, metagenes for up- and downregulated gene sets are treated separately resulting in two survival analyses for each genotype (up- and downregulated genes in tumors having a mutation of the gene).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Statistical packages utilized in the G-2-O algorithm</title><p>The ROC analysis is performed using the ROCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] Bioconductor (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioconductor.org/">http://www.bioconductor.org/</ext-link>) library in the R statistical environment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org">http://www.r-project.org</ext-link>). The AUC values are calculated automatically by the ROCR package using the <italic>prediction()</italic> and <italic>performance()</italic> functions. By default, a significance threshold of 0.01 and a minimal AUC of 0.65 are required for each gene to be considered as significant.

The two key elements of this system are: (1) the link between NGS datasets and the well-annotated gene-chip datasets; and (2) the assumption that the link is not one-to-one, but includes a set of genes (transcriptomic fingerprint) indirectly affected by a somatic mutation. We have set up a web-based system that enables utilization of the entire analysis pipeline to assess the correlation between mutational status and survival for 10,987 genes. Raw data for each of the available samples were downloaded and re-processed using the same analysis pipeline to enable robust utilization of the data. Genes correlated with a given genotype were identified by employing a ROC analysis across all genes. Simultaneous utilization of RNA-seq and gene chip assays to measure expression of the same genes is supported by the recent validation of high concordance between these technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>While microarray and RT-PCR based assays are limited to measuring the expression of selected, <italic>a priori</italic> chosen genomic features, next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are not subject to this limitation and can be used to evaluate whole genomes, targeted genome regions, transcriptomes, and epigenomes. A primary goal of an NGS analysis is the identification of driver mutations &#x02013; changes conferring selective advantages to cancer cells and thus contributing to tumor expansion. However, driver mutations are often buried inside a cloud of passenger mutations &#x02013; changes without biological significance, most likely products of the genomic instability in cancer cells.</p><p>As of today, there are no validated drivers of metastatic disease and drivers of therapy resistance. In addition, genes imperative for therapy decision including HER2 (mutation in 1.5&#x000a0;% of samples) and ESR1 (mutation in 0.6&#x000a0;% of samples) show a very low mutational prevalence. These facts emphasize that many driver genes are not yet identified. Here, we provide an alternative approach to identify new driver genes. We hypothesize that by measuring the leveraged effect of a given mutation on the overall transcriptomic profile of the tumor the effects of that genomic change can be evaluated. The utilization of this approach on already established driver genes confirmed our method. We have to note that some genes tend to have high false discovery rate in mutation calling, for instance HYDIN, SYNE1, and USH2A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] &#x02013; it is an advantage of the proposed methodology is that despite the high mutation rate, none of these genes reached the significance necessary to be included in the list of putative driver genes.</p><p>A potential limitation of our method is the assumption that a direct link exists between mutation changes and gene expression. In fact, a mutation in a driver gene can be silent without changes in the transcriptional fingerprint &#x02013; for example activation of certain signaling pathways like PIK3, which has been shown to be independent of changes in expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Another restriction of our approach is that it cannot be validated for genes with mutation in a few patients only (low mutation prevalence below 1&#x000a0;%). A further limitation is that due to lack of data we had to disregard epigenetic effects on transcription. The same mutation with or without a methylation event might result in different transcriptional consequences.</p><p>We have also computed the expected number of significant genes selected at random, which yielded an average of 9.2 significant genes per 100 randomly picked genes. This analysis includes a proportion of false positive hits in addition to the known driver genes (5&#x000a0;% of all genes based on COSMIC consensus genes). Nonetheless, an alternative explanation is that there are still a large number of unidentified driver genes. Altogether, the overall number of false positive results is far below the output of random multigene signatures &#x02013; 90&#x000a0;% of which delivered significant association with survival in breast cancer in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. We have to note that these random signatures contained more than 100 genes and the G-2-O metagenes contain less than 100 genes in most of the analyses.</p><p>Direct analysis on the prognosis of a given mutation based on the TCGA data is possible using the cBioPortal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, shortcomings of the cBio portal include utilization of overall survival data only, short follow-up, few death events, and unbalanced cohorts dependent on prevalence of the mutation. Furthermore, today we know that breast cancer subtypes carry different sets of mutations and are linked with different baseline prognoses &#x02013; these differences can be easily detected using the G-2-O analysis platform which enables one to investigate the effect on prognosis in each of the molecular subtypes separately. For example, the hazard ratio associated with a PIK3CA mutation in ER positive and negative tumors deliver completely different prognostic implications (for the upregulated gene signature is the HR in ER negative samples 0.66 and HR in ER positive tumors is 1.2).</p><p>Previously, an integrated algorithmic approach termed DriverNet was set up to analyze population-based genomic and transcriptomic interrogations of a tumor to identify pathogenic driver mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Paradigm, another similar project was developed to identify driver pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Both of these approaches were based on incorporating known associations or interactions between genes. In contrast, the G-2-O approach is fundamentally different as no recognized gene or pathway interaction data are included in the analysis. Rather, the association between genes is re-computed for each gene in each analysis &#x02013; this approach delivers results not influenced by <italic>a priori</italic> association networks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>To date, targeting of recognized driver genes delivered suboptimal results in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. There are two major reasons behind this phenomenon &#x02013; only a handful of genes are already actionable while most of these known driver genes have a prevalence below 10&#x000a0;% of patients. Thus, we need to identify clinically relevant mutations to spot candidate genes for targeted therapy or for new personalized clinical trials. Here, we have set up a pipeline enabling the functional validation of a discovered mutation for any gene in a large breast cancer cohort by computationally connecting genotype to an extended, surrogate gene expression signature and utilizing this signature in gene chip datasets. Gene chip databases already serve as transcriptomic basis for cross-dataset analysis tools like Breast-Mark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] or the KM-plotter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Since the gene expression datasets are large and reasonably well annotated, we can use the gene expression surrogate to test the prognostic significance of a DNA level change.
