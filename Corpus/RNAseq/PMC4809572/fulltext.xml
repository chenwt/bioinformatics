Despite the clinical significance of this pseudo-kinase, there is little information on the regulation of TRIB1. Previous studies reported <italic>TRIB1</italic> mRNA to be unstable, hinting that TRIB1 might be subject to post-transcriptional regulation. This work explores TRIB1 regulation, focusing on its post-transcriptional aspects. In 3 distinct model systems (HEK293T, HeLa and arterial smooth muscle cells) TRIB1 was undetectable as assessed by western blot. Using recombinant TRIB1 as a proxy, we demonstrate TRIB1 to be highly unstable at the protein and RNA levels. By contrast, recombinant TRIB1 was stable in cellular extracts. Blocking proteasome function led to increased protein steady state levels but failed to rescue protein instability, demonstrating that the 2 processes are uncoupled. Unlike as shown for TRIB2, CUL1 and TRCP&#x003b2; did not play a role in mediating TRIB1 instability although TRCP&#x003b2; suppression increased TRIB1 expression. Lastly, we demonstrate that protein instability is independent of TRIB1 subcellular localization. Following the identification of TRIB1 nuclear localization signal, a cytosolic form was engineered. Despite being confined to the cytosol, TRIB1 remained unstable, suggesting that instability occurs at a stage that precedes its nuclear translocation and downstream nuclear function. These results uncover possible avenues of intervention to regulate TRIB1 function by identifying two distinct regulatory axes that control TRIB1 at the post-transcriptional level.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the Heart &#x00026; Stroke Foundation of Canada # T-7268, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hsf.ca/research/en/personnel-award-programs">http://www.hsf.ca/research/en/personnel-award-programs</ext-link>.

By comparison, higher eukaryotes express three distinct <italic>tribbles</italic>, TRIB1, 2 and 3 which are characterized by a relatively well conserved kinase-like domain (40&#x02013;70% identity) and variable N and C-terminal regions [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Whether the <italic>tribbles</italic> are completely inactive as kinases is still unresolved as recent evidence suggests that TRIB2 possesses low nucleotide binding properties and a weak kinase activity at least <italic>in vitro</italic>, although structural data suggest that this ability may be lost in TRIB1 [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p><italic>Tribbles</italic> have been implicated in multiple types of cancer. Early studies demonstrated that the <italic>tribbles</italic> are associated with myeloid leukemia [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and a gain of function TRIB1 promotes leukemic transformation [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. TRIB1 is also strongly upregulated in pancreatic cancer where it supports proliferation and survival [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition to its contribution to cancers, genome-wide-association studies (GWAS) have uncovered a functional association of the <italic>TRIB1</italic> locus with lipid traits, cardiovascular disease (CAD) as well hepatic steatosis, the accumulation of fat in the liver [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Experiments in animal models support the statistical association of TRIB1 with disease where altering <italic>Trib1</italic> expression affects lipid and glucose homeostasis [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>A prominent hypothesis to account for the role of TRIB1 in disease involves the degradation of C/EBP proteins by TRIB1 [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; this process is conserved in Drosophila where degradation of the C/EBP ortholog (<italic>slbo</italic>) is stimulated by <italic>tribbles</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. TRIB1 could serve as a scaffold for the assembly of C/EBPA and/or C/EBPB and COP1, an E3 ligase, thereby promoting the degradation of these C/EBPs via the Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Whereas the UPS has been shown to play a prominent role in mediating TRIB1 action in the degradation of the CEBPs, its role in the regulation of TRIB1 itself remains to be explored.</p><p>While a clearer picture of TRIB1 function is slowly coming into focus, regulation of the <italic>tribbles</italic> and TRIB1 in particular, remains largely unexplored. The available data hint that it is likely complex. For one, <italic>TRIB1</italic> is expressed from an unstable RNA [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition the <italic>TRIB1</italic> gene contains a long 1.5 Kbp 3' untranslated region (UTR), quite conserved in parts, that undergoes miRNA regulation [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The importance of mammalian <italic>tribbles</italic> to both physiological and pathological processes emphasizes the need to clarify and elucidate the mechanisms regulating the <italic>tribbles</italic> and <italic>TRIB1</italic> in particular.</p><p>Prior work from our laboratory demonstrated the importance of transcriptional regulation in the response of the <italic>TRIB1</italic> gene to mitochondrial stressors [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, TRIB1 could not be detected at the protein level, despite its wild-type sequence and significant RNA levels, suggesting that it might be suppressed post-transcriptionally [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Genome-wide analyses indicate that concentrations of mRNA and protein correlate by about 40%, indicating that post-transcriptional regulation plays a crucial role in controlling net protein output [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Indeed, mere presence in the cytosol does not guarantee translation as certain conditions elicit the redistribution of RNAs to regions for temporary storage [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Translation requires initiation, elongation and termination steps, all of which provide potential inroads for intervention should the situation demand it [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For example, p53 output can be enhanced by shifting the p53 transcript from ribosome-poor to ribosome-rich polysomes [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The net result is that translation efficiency, defined by the number of protein units per mRNA molecule, can vary substantially [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>This work aims to provide a more comprehensive view of TRIB1 regulation, focusing on identifying processes regulating the stability of TRIB1 at the RNA transcript and protein levels, with the expectation that this knowledge should help identify potential avenues for disease prevention and intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Lysates were obtained by incubating cells for 5 min in lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, 0.13 M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% TRITON X-100) containing phosphatase and protein inhibitor cocktails (PhoSTOP and EDTA-free cOmplete protease inhibitors, Roche), unless specified.

Rather, our results indicate that TRIB1 instability can be controlled at an early point before TRIB1 enters the nucleus. This suggests co-translational regulation, but does not exclude a contribution of other downstream cytosolic events. We propose that TRIB1 can be regulated by 2 distinct translational events that can be distinguished based on their requirement for proteasomal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152346.g012">Fig 12</xref>). One, under kinetic regulation, controls the turnover rate of the protein. Whether this early regulatory node is linked to the short transcript half-life remains a matter of speculation but is consistent with these findings. This process is largely if not entirely proteasome-independent and as such does not meet the requirement of the classical translation quality control pathways mediated by heat shock proteins [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. While stabilizing the TRIB1 protein might conceivably lead to increased total output, our proteasome experiments demonstrate that it is not a requirement, as the proteasome inhibitors did not prevent loss of TRIB1 following CHX treatment. Instead, these experiments point to a control that increases the steady state level of TRIB1 without changing its basic instability. This is unlikely to be achieved solely by increased transcripts as our results exclude a consistent (i.e. MG132 and BTZ-dependent) increase in total RNA following short term treatment with these inhibitors. We did however observe that longer (16 h) MG132 and BTZ regimens led to increased transcript and protein abundance from the TRIB1UTR and TRIB1 constructs (data not shown), which probably reflect increased transcriptional output secondary to cellular stress caused by prolonged UPS interference.</p><fig id="pone.0152346.g012" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0152346.g012</object-id><label>Fig 12</label><caption><title>Model of TRIB1 regulation.</title><p>TRIB1 is rapidly degraded in the cytosol during or after synthesis by proteasome-independent processes that remain to be identified.

The protein Ball and Stick structure shown corresponds to TRIB1 (pdb5cem) and was generated with the Swiss-PdbViewer; &#x003b2; sheets residues are in yellow and &#x003b1; helical residues in red while unstrunctured residues are displayed in gray.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0152346.g012"/></fig><p>One can envision that blocking the proteasome pathway leads to a more efficient translation of existing <italic>TRIB1</italic> mRNA and, conversely, that these pathways normally restrain the translation machinery handling TRIB1. The UPS system plays a nuanced but pivotal role in the control of translation. Proteasome inhibition induces a stress response that includes a global reduction of translation activity as well as targeted increases in key stress-induced proteins including CHOP and ATF3/4 [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Under normal conditions however, important translation-initiation factors including eIF4G and eIF3A undergo UPS mediated degradation, inhibiting translation in the process [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>This work addressed the role of UTRs in TRIB1 regulation only partially by demonstrating that these regions do not play a prominent role in regulating TRIB1 protein instability. This is not to be misconstrued as evidence that they play no role in regulating TRIB1. TRIB1 may be regulated at other levels, as seen with the UPS system. Given the important role UTRs have on RNA regulation [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], the role of these regions will need to be examined in greater depth. A recent report identified miR-224 as capable of suppressing TRIB1 protein level ~2-fold, although the underlying mechanisms were not examined [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Publicly available algorithms (e.g. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.microrna.org/">http://www.microrna.org/</ext-link>) predict several putative miRNA binding sites in the 3&#x02019;UTR but these theoretical predictions need to be experimentally validated. Previous work by Kiss-Toth et al that demonstrates a net (RNA) stabilizing role of the 3&#x02019;UTR when overexpressed in <italic>trans</italic>, is certainly consistent with the role of a net destabilizing effect by the 3&#x02019;UTR on TRIB1 mRNA [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>Within the <italic>tribbles</italic> family, RNA instability is not unique to <italic>TRIB1</italic>. We demonstrate that <italic>TRIB3</italic> (but not <italic>TRIB2</italic>) is also sensitive to ACTD. This contrasts with prior findings where all 3 transcripts were unstable in mouse embryonic stem cells with half-lives of 0.9, 1.8 and 2.8 h for <italic>TRIB1</italic>, 2 and 3 respectively [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Hence these numbers agree well with ours with TRIB1 being the most unstable but differ with regard to TRIB2 stability. Presumably these differences reflect different cellular and/or species-specific functions which underscore that <italic>tribbles</italic> RNA stability has the potential to be regulated. At the protein level, preliminary experiments indicate that the TRIB3 protein is also sensitive to CHX (we have yet to examine TRIB2). Interestingly, genes characterized by unstable transcripts and proteins tend be regulatory genes, whose expressions need to be highly responsive to environmental cues [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. As for TRIB2, work by Wilkin <italic>et al</italic> showed overexpressed TRIB2 to be highly labile in dog thyroid cells and undetectable after 1 h CHX treatment [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A recent report by Qiao et al also confirms that TRIB2 is unstable and that this instability is, in contrast to TRIB1, proteasome-dependent. More specifically in hepatocellular carcinoma Bel-7402 cells, TRIB2 instability requires&#x003b2;TRCP and total levels are under the regulation of CUL1 [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. These results clearly contrast with our findings on TRIB1 and underscore a fundamental difference between the 2 <italic>tribbles</italic>. Alternatively, the &#x003b2;TRCP regulatory axis might represent a cancer adaptation. Judging from the presented western blot evidence, it seems that the amount of TRIB2 is considerable in Bel-7402 and perhaps the SCF<sup>&#x003b2;TRCP</sup> targets TRIB2 only when it is amplified. <italic>Tribbles</italic> amplification has been reported in some pancreatic cancer cell lines [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and increased <italic>tribbles</italic> expression may represent a common strategy adopted by some cancerous cells to meet their altered metabolic demands.</p><p>Unlike our original hypothesis, <italic>TRIB1</italic> transcript instability does not solely account for the lack of detection seen in our model systems. Indeed, overexpressed TRIB1 was detected despite being sensitive to CHX. In this respect TRIB1 behaves like the majority of genes, where, unlike RNA abundance, RNA stability is a poor predictor of protein abundance [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Rather, the lack of detection of the endogenous signal may reflect low RNA abundance. Detection of TRIB1 was evident in the stable cells we generated but only after 60-200-fold overexpression of TRIB1, suggesting that the basal levels are very low. Extrapolating from the <italic>in vitro</italic> titration of the antibody, and assuming a linear relationship between the <italic>TRIB1</italic> RNA and protein amounts, approximate upper limits to the amount of cellular TRIB1 can be calculated. Using a conservative estimate of 10 ng of signal per 30 ug of cellular HeLaT1 extracts (corresponding to ~ 1 X 10<sup>5</sup> HeLa cells), and the 150-fold RNA overexpression value, one can estimate upper limits in the amount of endogenous protein in HeLa, with as many as 9,000 molecules per average HeLa cell. This would place TRIB1 close to the median number of 18,000 copies per protein found in the average HeLa cell [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This represents upper limits and true amounts are likely much lower as mass spectrometry failed to detect TRIB1, 2 or 3 in HeLa extracts [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>These observations highlight the low expression levels of TRIB1, at least in our model systems, but should not be interpreted as evidence for a lack of function. The <italic>TRIB1</italic> transcript is ubiquitously expressed, typically at low levels, with preferential expression in liver and lymphoid tissue (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000173334-TRIB1/tissue">http://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000173334-TRIB1/tissue</ext-link>). In HepG2 cells for instance where levels of <italic>TRIB1</italic> transcript compare with the 293T, we recently demonstrated that <italic>TRIB1</italic> suppression was associated with marked transcriptome alterations in primary human hepatocytes [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Rather, low expression suggests significant signal amplification is a prerequisite to function. This would be in line with transcriptional regulation at a few select loci or enzymatic functions via regulation of kinases for instance. Although a role as a kinase is inconsistent with the recently solved structure of TRIB1, TRIB1 could still interact and regulate the activity of kinases, as shown for MAP2K4 and MAP2K1 [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>Our results identify the N-terminal region as required for nuclear import of TRIB1 in HeLa cells. According to publicly available data a second form of TRIB1 transcript, encoding AA 167&#x02013;372 has been reported (NM_001282985.1). This form, possibly resulting from alternate splicing and transcription initiation sites corresponds for the most part to our fusion eCFP that was entirely cytosolic, leaving open the possibility that it performs a cytosolic function. This alternate form requires further validation however as its abundance is orders of magnitude lower than the canonical TRIB1 form (see publicly accessible GTEx portal data for TRIB1at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gtexportal.org/home">http://www.gtexportal.org/home</ext-link>) and it may represent transcriptional noise. What about the other <italic>tribbles</italic>? According to cNLS Mapper, predictions for TRIB3 indicate the presence of a strong bipartite NLS spanning AA 15&#x02013;37, that is consistent with its nuclear residence and is reminiscent of TRIB1. By contrast, no NLS, mono- or bipartite is predicted for TRIB2, in line with reports indicating that TRIB2 does not show preferential localization to the nucleus, and might actually be excluded in some systems [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. A similar analysis of <italic>Drosophila tribbles</italic> fails to identify classical NLSs; <italic>tribbles</italic>, like TRIB2, has been reported to be present in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Thus the appearance of a bipartite NLS seems to be a recent addition that may have taken advantage of the poorly conserved and loosely structured N-terminal region to tailor certain <italic>tribbles</italic> for exclusive nuclear functions. TRIB2 (or indeed <italic>tribbles</italic>) could still perform nuclear functions since TRIB2 may be compact enough to diffuse passively through the nuclear pore complex into the nucleoplasm, a process that could be facilitated by putative non-classical NLSs [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>Taken together these findings lead to the conclusion that interventions aimed at regulating TRIB1 should focus on modulating transcript levels, translation efficiency, protein stability or biological activity rather than affecting RNA stability. This could be achieved by altering its interaction interfaces with known effectors (e.g. MEK1, COP1, CEBPs). As TRIB1 could be tumorigenic [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], our results also suggest that treatment with proteasome inhibitors, which are currently being used as treatment for certain forms of cancer (e.g. Velcade&#x000ae;) [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], may benefit from adjunctive therapy with TRIB1 inhibitors or suppressors with the aim of offsetting associated TRIB1 level increases; the recently available structure of TRIB1 will be of considerable help in this matter [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Cancer amplification notwithstanding, a moderate increase in TRIB1 may indeed be beneficial. In a previous study we correlated a <italic>TRIB1</italic> genotype (rs2001844), associated with protection against CAD and decreased circulating triglycerides, with increased <italic>TRIB1</italic> expression. More specifically, <italic>TRIB1</italic> mRNA levels in the homozygous risk group were 20% lower than in the homozygous reference group [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. To this day it remains unclear how this polymorphism located 30 kb away from the TRIB1 gene proper is impinging on these traits. That region harbors sequences with enhancer capabilities and encodes for a nuclear non-coding transcript (<italic>TRIBAL</italic>) that have the potential to affect net protein output by modulating <italic>TRIB1</italic> transcription [<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152346.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However as these are regulatory events are confined to the nucleus they are unlikely to influence TRIB1 protein stability which we demonstrate to be controlled in the cytosol. While the CAD/dyslipidemia-associated etiology is unlikely to implicate changes in TRIB1 protein stability, increasing the latter modestly by targeted pharmacological interventions may still offer a means to harness the protective functions of TRIB1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0152346.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>TRIB1 upregulation in response to CHX is secondary to increased transcription.</title><p>TRIB1 transcript was measured in HeLa cells in response to CHX and/or ACTD by qRT-PCR.
