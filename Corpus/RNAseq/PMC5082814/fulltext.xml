Thus, their responses to changes in ocean chemistry and environmental conditions, particularly to higher seawater temperatures, will have potential impacts on the future of these reefs. To better understand the sponge thermal stress response, we investigated gene expression dynamics in the shallow water sponge, <italic>Haliclona tubifera</italic> (order Haplosclerida, class Demospongiae), subjected to elevated temperature. Using high-throughput transcriptome sequencing, we show that these conditions result in the activation of various processes that interact to maintain cellular homeostasis. Short-term thermal stress resulted in the induction of heat shock proteins, antioxidants, and genes involved in signal transduction and innate immunity pathways. Prolonged exposure to thermal stress affected the expression of genes involved in cellular damage repair, apoptosis, signaling and transcription. Interestingly, exposure to sublethal temperatures may improve the ability of the sponge to mitigate cellular damage under more extreme stress conditions. These insights into the potential mechanisms of adaptation and resilience of sponges contribute to a better understanding of sponge conservation status and the prediction of ecosystem trajectories under future climate conditions.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>University of the Philippines System</institution></funding-source><award-id>OVPAA-BPhD-2012-04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conaco</surname><given-names>Cecilia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>L&#x02019;Oreal-UNESCO For Women in Science National Fellowship</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conaco</surname><given-names>Cecilia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by the University of the Philippines System PhD Recruitment Grant (OVPAA-BPhD-2012-04) and a L&#x02019;Oreal-UNESCO For Women in Science National Fellowship to CC.

This increased SST may have deleterious impacts on many marine invertebrates. In fact, mass coral bleaching events triggered by elevated seawater temperatures have resulted in significantly reduced coral cover throughout the tropics [<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This decrease in coral cover can result in changes in benthic reef communities [<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], which may allow other species, such as algae and sponges, to increase in abundance. Sponges are one of the earliest multicellular animal groups [<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Members of this phylum display remarkable ecological adaptability, having integrated into diverse marine ecosystems through the development of complex physiological and chemical properties [<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Sponges play important roles in the functioning of these ecosystems [<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Despite the diversity within the sponge phylum, data on sponge conservation status is still lacking [<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Out of the thousands of known sponge species, very few are currently listed as threatened, suggesting that sponges are highly adaptable to environmental stressors, such as elevated temperatures, ocean acidification, sedimentation, and microbial pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In fact, compared to other reef taxa, marine sponges have the potential to be resilient to large-scale thermal stress events. Recent studies have reported that sponges are more tolerant to increased SST, with larval dynamics, ecological functions and physiological processes unaffected by increases in water temperature [<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For example, the growth and survival of several Carribean sponges remained unaffected by exposure to thermal stress [<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Furthermore, the sponge assemblage in Bahia, Brazil, did not change between pre- and post-El Ni&#x000f1;o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) years [<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In contrast, some studies have described the negative effects of elevated temperature on different sponge species. For example, adult colonies of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>odorabile</italic> were found to be highly sensitive to thermal stress at 32&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] while severe sponge die-off due to cyanobacterial decay was triggered by elevated temperatures in the Mediterranean sea [<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to recognize that different sponge species may have variable responses to environmental perturbations, specifically to thermal stress.</p><p>The molecular mechanisms underlying sponge responses to thermal stress are poorly understood, with most studies focusing on the effect of temperature on the sponge-associated microbial community. In one example, 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA metagenome revealed that exposure to 31&#x000b0;C had no effect on the bacterial biosphere within the Great Barrier sponge <italic>Rhopaloeides odorabile</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Likewise, in the Mediterranean Sea sponge <italic>Ircinia spp</italic>., neither thermal stress combined with food shortage nor large fluctuations in temperature and irradiance disrupted the stability of the sponge-bacteria partnership [<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The importance of cell-cell signaling genes in the maintenance or breakdown of the sponge-bacteria interaction during thermal stress events has been explored to some extent [<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Targeted studies on gene expression have demonstrated the upregulation of heat shock protein 70 in the Carribean sponge <italic>Xestospongia muta</italic> upon exposure to elevated temperature [<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Expression profiling by multiplexed reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (mRT-qPCR) showed that <italic>R</italic>. <italic>odorabile</italic> larvae are remarkably able to withstand seawater temperatures up to 9&#x000b0;C above normal [<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The apparent resilience of some sponge species and the sensitivity of others highlights the need to understand the genomic basis of sponge responses to environmental stressors and how they are able to adapt to rapidly changing ocean conditions.</p><p>High-throughput transcriptome sequencing is a powerful tool that allows sensitive and high-resolution detection of a wider dynamic range of expression levels in contrast to other commonly used molecular approaches, such as quantitative PCR, multiplex reverse-transcription quantitative PCR, and microarrays [<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Global transcriptome analysis can reveal how organisms respond to external stimuli and stressors by detecting changes in gene expression dynamics. This plasticity of gene expression underlies the ability of organisms to adapt to changing environmental conditions. In fact, sequencing of the genome of model demosponge, <italic>Amphimedon queenslandica</italic>, revealed the presence of a diverse genetic toolkit, or a set of conserved regulatory genes, that can integrate various signaling pathways and allow the organism to rapidly respond to its environment [<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we performed a transcriptome-wide analysis to elucidate the changes in gene expression that occur when a sponge is subjected to different levels of thermal stress. In particular, we focused on the differential expression of genes involved in protein folding, oxidative stress response, immune response, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, and tissue morphogenesis. The findings of this study unveil key processes that underlie sponge tolerance to thermal stress, which will gain importance as ocean temperatures continue to rise with the changing climate.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>As global warming continues to raise ocean temperatures, marine ecosystems are placed at risk. However, some marine organisms, including sponges (Porifera), thrive in naturally warm environments and can tolerate high temperatures. Studies on these organisms will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that confer resilience to thermal stress. Thus, to elucidate the transcriptome dynamics underlying the sponge thermal stress response, we focused our study on the demosponge, <italic>Haliclona tubifera</italic>, found native to shallow reef flats in Bolinao, Pangasinan, Philippines. Based on regular monitoring by the Bolinao Marine Laboratory, sea surface temperatures in this region range from 25&#x000b0;C to 32&#x000b0;C with an annual mean temperature of 28.89&#x000b1;0.90&#x000b0;C. Sponges in this area are of great interest in exploring the determinants of ecological success, particularly in terms of tolerance to a wide range of temperatures.</p><p><italic>H</italic>. <italic>tubifera</italic> belongs to order Haplosclerida, which is the largest and most diverse group within class Demospongiae of phylum Porifera (sponges). This tubular pink sponge is found in association with branching corals in shallow water reef flats at depths of 1&#x02013;2 meters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165368.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Because of its shallow habitat, this sponge species is subjected to widely fluctuating temperatures on a daily basis. The reference transcriptome used in this study was previously assembled <italic>de novo</italic>, and contains 50,067 non-redundant transcripts, which translate into 18,000 peptides [<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0165368.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0165368.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Global transcriptome profile of adult colonies of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>tubifera</italic> exposed to thermal stress.</title><p>(A) <italic>H</italic>. <italic>tubifera</italic> is a soft, pink or brownish, tubular sponge found in association with coral skeletons in shallow water reef flats.

The expression profiles of sponges subjected to acute short-term thermal stress (34&#x000b0;C for 4 hours) showed higher correlation with controls maintained at 29&#x000b0;C while the transcriptome profiles of sponges subjected to longer thermal exposure (32&#x000b0;C for 12 hours and 34&#x000b0;C for 12 hours) were more similar to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165368.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Although some sample replicates showed larger variability, principal component analysis was still able to differentiate the transcriptome profiles of sponges subjected to different temperature (Fig A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165368.s001">S1 File</xref>). Our results show that prolonged exposure to temperatures much higher than the average encountered by the sponge triggers substantial changes in gene expression that may influence cellular characteristics or behavior.</p><p>Differential expression analysis detected a total of 1,584 unique transcripts, referred to here as genes, exhibiting a significant change in expression across all treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165368.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). These results suggest that the sponge can rapidly deploy cellular mechanisms that support tolerance to increased temperatures. Most of the differentially expressed genes were up or downregulated by greater than four-fold relative to the controls (Table A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165368.s001">S1 File</xref>). The greatest number of differentially regulated genes were observed between the control (29&#x000b0;C) and samples heated at 34&#x000b0;C for 12 hours (1,010 genes). 294 genes remained differentially regulated in all samples subjected to elevated temperature while 178 differentially expressed genes were shared between samples exposed to 34&#x000b0;C for 4 hours and at 32&#x000b0;C for 12 hours. Only 32% (505 genes) of differentially expressed genes have homology to proteins in the UniProt database (Table B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165368.s001">S1 File</xref>). Of the genes with no UniProt matches, 644 exhibit similarity to sequences in the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>queenslandica</italic> reference genome (Table B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165368.s001">S1 File</xref>). Further studies are needed to elucidate the functions of these unannotated genes, which may include non-coding RNAs expressed from polyadenylated transcripts [<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], as well as species-specific genes that are responsive to thermal stress.</p><p>By comparing the log2 fold change of genes that are commonly differentially expressed under the various treatments, we were able to determine the number that show a greater magnitude of change in expression under certain temperature regimes. Pairwise comparisons revealed that between the samples subjected to 34&#x000b0;C, more genes exhibited a greater magnitude of upregulation at 4 hours compared to 12 hours of exposure (142 vs. 104 genes), whereas more genes were downregulated in samples maintained at 34&#x000b0;C for 12 hours than for 4 hours (116 vs. 85 genes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165368.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Between samples exposed to different degrees of thermal stress, more genes were either up or downregulated in the samples exposed to 34&#x000b0;C for 4 or 12 hours relative to the samples maintained at 32&#x000b0;C for 12 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165368.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>). This indicates that acute thermal stress at 34&#x000b0;C, regardless of duration, results in a greater change in gene expression levels compared to sublethal exposure at 32&#x000b0;C, which is still within the temperature range of the sponge habitat.</p><p>Downregulated sequences represent genes that are normally maintained at high levels in the sponge, which may include transcripts encoding proteins that form the first line of defense or transcripts with housekeeping functions that are generally energy intensive. Upregulated sequences are mostly stress-induced genes. Interestingly, thermal stress in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>tubifera</italic> resulted in more downregulation than upregulation of genes (Table A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165368.s001">S1 File</xref>). This finding is consistent with transcriptome-wide studies in other organisms, suggesting that widespread downregulation is a conserved phenomenon under stressful conditions [<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

Protective mechanisms that are enriched under acute short-term stress include antioxidant activity, toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway, and innate immune response activation. Signaling mechanisms that are enriched include calcium-mediated signaling, cellular ion homeostasis, messenger-mediated pathways, transporter activity, and microtubule-based movement. This suggests that the sponge responds immediately to stress exposure by inducing signaling cascades that initiate various pathways involved in the cellular stress response and by producing transcripts that encode proteins that protect the cell from damage.</p><fig id="pone.0165368.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0165368.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Gene ontology (GO) analysis for gene groups that are up or downregulated by greater than 4-fold under various temperature regimes.</title><p>Enrichment p-values for selected terms are shown.

This analysis showed that stress triggers a series of processes that function to maintain cellular homeostasis at all stages of stress exposure. Immediate responses, which are apparent in sponges subjected to short-term stress, involve modulating the oxidative response, immune response, and intracellular signaling. These responses are designed to prevent or minimize cellular damage at the onset of thermal stress. Under prolonged exposure, where the sponge may have already sustained some tissue damage, genes that are activated include those associated with protein refolding, tissue growth, cellular repair, and apoptosis. Induction of such functions may reflect sponge health, the ability to tolerate higher temperatures, and the potential for recovery and survival under continued stress conditions. It is interesting to note that exposure to sublethal temperature activates the expression of protein folding chaperones that provide sponge cells with some protection against extended or intensified stress conditions.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Network responses to stress</title><p>As is evident from the results of gene ontology enrichment, the cellular stress response involves the coordination of multiple pathways that are linked through protein-protein interactions.

This is partly controlled by the abundance of different transcription factors that regulate the expression of specific genes in response to stimuli. We found that specific transcription factor groups exhibit distinct patterns of expression during thermal stress exposure, suggesting that these groups of factors play central roles in controlling the expression of genes commonly required to deal with the effects of increased temperatures. The most obvious trend observed for transcription factor families is an increase in expression at higher temperature with greater upregulation under prolonged exposure, as is evident for the bZIP, Tbox, ETS, bHLH, and forkhead families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165368.g004">Fig 4</xref>). In contrast, most HMGbox and homeobox family transcription factors were not responsive to thermal stimuli. While the specific gene targets of these transcription factor families remains to be determined, the increase in their expression during stress correlates with the upregulation of stress-related genes in the sponge. This suggests that while the responses observed upon acute exposure at 4 hours may be mainly due to rapid cellular responses involving mRNA turnover and protein translation or modification, longer term stress can influence global changes in the transcriptome through shifts in regulatory factor concentrations.</p><fig id="pone.0165368.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0165368.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Relative expression of regulatory genes in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>tubifera</italic> during thermal stress exposure.</title><p>Relative expression of genes encoding transcription factors (bZIP, T-box, ETS, homeobox, and forkhead), G-protein coupled receptors (rhodopsin, glutamate, and secretin GPCRs), and scavenger receptors.

As such, the sponge may be able to trigger early protective responses in anticipation of seawater warming when it senses a rise in light intensity. Some specific glutamate GPCRs were upregulated upon exposure to 34&#x000b0;C. Glutamate GPCRs, such as the GABA-like and GRM-like receptors, may be involved in controlling the contraction of sponge canal system to regulate seawater filtration rate in response to environmental stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].

Secretin GPCRs were downregulated at 4 hours of exposure to 34&#x000b0;C but increased in expression after 12 hours.

Using a high-throughput sequencing approach, we identified the potential mechanisms enabling <italic>H</italic>. <italic>tubifera</italic> to survive conditions of thermal stress and observed the different responses that are triggered at different stages of exposure. In <italic>H</italic>. <italic>tubifera</italic>, immediate stress response includes induction of heat shock proteins, antioxidants, and genes involved in signal transduction and innate immunity pathways while prolonged exposure to thermal stress affects expression patterns of genes involved in cellular damage repair, apoptosis, signaling and transcription. Differential deployment of a diverse repertoire of genes may allow the sponge to fine-tune its response to local conditions in the environment that they typically encounter. Thus, <italic>H</italic>. <italic>tubifera</italic>, which is normally located in shallow reef flats and is exposed to variable temperatures, may have a more robust response to temperature fluctuations compared to sponges found at deeper depths with colder and more stable temperatures. A similar phenomenon has been reported for several coral species, where individuals living in habitats that experience highly variable conditions exhibit greater expression of protective and metabolic genes [<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>For a more comprehensive understanding of sponge tolerance to climate change-related stressors, further comparative studies should be conducted on diverse species of marine sponges. The diversity within the sponge phylum and the relative plasticity of sponge cellular elements represent a treasure trove of gene innovations that may provide insights into the various pathways that have evolved to contribute to animal resilience [<xref rid="pone.0165368.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. It is likely that differences in ecological and physiological features of different sponges, and even their different life stages, will reflect variations in thermal tolerance and resilience that may have downstream effects on populations in areas where seawater temperatures begin to exceed tolerable temperatures. As sponges perform diverse roles in the marine ecosystem, changes in sponge distribution and abundance will have implications on reef functions. Thus, knowledge of gene expression responses in relation to organism physiology and health will support better assessment of sponge conservation status and contribute to the ability to predict reef trajectories under future climate conditions. Given the overwhelming evidence of coral decline due to climate-associated stressors, only those remarkably resistant taxa, such as sponges, are likely to survive the increasingly stressful marine environment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Sample collection and thermal stress experiment</title><p>Sponges were collected by scuba diving in Malilnep Channel, Bolinao, Pangasinan (16.43530&#x000b0;N 119.94062&#x000b0;E) in September 2013 at depth of 1&#x02013;3 meters.
