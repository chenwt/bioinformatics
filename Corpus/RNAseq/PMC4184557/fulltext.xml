It leads to progressive weakness of limb and bulbar muscles, spasticity and muscle wasting, followed by death due to respiratory insufficiency. ALS is the most common adult onset motor neuron disease, affecting worldwide over 100,000 people yearly.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Due to the lack of effective treatment, the prognosis remains poor with median survival ranging from 3 to 5 years from the symptoms onset.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> However, the disease course and prognosis may be affected by genetic factors, age at onset, localization of onset, and clinical phenotype. Approximately 80&#x02013;85% of ALS cases are sporadic (SALS), the rest are inherited (familial ALS, FALS) mainly as an autosomal dominant trait. Although the disease starts earlier in FALS patients, their survival may not differ from that of SALS. Overall, ALS patients with respiratory phenotype survive the least, and the bulbar phenotype is characterized by the second shortest survival.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> On the other hand, individuals suffering from pure upper motor neuron phenotype (PUMN) &#x02013; a very rare ALS phenotype &#x02013; may survive over 15 years, so may some of the patients with pure lower motor neuron phenotype (PLMN) if the disease does not spread into the upper motor neuron (UMN) evolving into classic ALS.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The factors determining clinical phenotypes remain elusive, there are also discussions if the nonclassic cases should be considered as ALS or &#x02013; more generally &#x02013; as motor neuron disease.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Several mechanisms involved in motor neuron degeneration in ALS have been described to date. Molecular indicators of glutamate excitotoxicity, impaired axonal transport, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, growth factor deficiency, protein aggregation, abnormal RNA metabolism, and apoptosis have been observed in human brain, spinal cord, and transgenic disease models long before symptom onset.<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Studies on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) allowed to identify phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain and complement C3 as well as cytokine panels of granulocyte&#x02013;monocyte colony stimulating factors as potential disease biomarkers.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Extensive studies on plasma proteins are, however, still lacking.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>The aim of this study was to analyze the protein profiles in plasma of a large group of clinically well-characterized patients with various clinical phenotypes of ALS in search for profiles that could contribute to improved understanding of ALS pathology. We have here employed an affinity proteomics approach applying antibody suspension bead arrays with the potential to screen hundreds of proteins in hundreds of patient samples simultaneously in a parallel analysis. This method was utilized with 352 antibodies generated within the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) targeting 278 proteins and profiled in plasma from 367 ALS patients and 101 controls.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>In total, 367 ALS patients (350 SALS and 17 FALS) were diagnosed and followed at the Department of Neurology, Medical University of Warsaw, Poland. The ALS diagnosis was made according to revised El Escorial criteria.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Patients were further characterized according to age, gender, clinical phenotype, site of onset, diagnosis delay, disease duration, and functional status (ALS-functional rating scale). Classic ALS was defined as concomitant UMN and lower motor neuron (LMN) involvement of either limb or bulbar onset with rapid symptoms generalization. Cases were classified as bulbar phenotype if isolated dysarthria and/or dysphagia were present for at least 6 months from the first symptom onset. PUMN phenotype was characterized by isolated UMN involvement without electrophysiological signs of the LMN damage; it was considered a clinically possible ALS. Since the PLMN phenotype was not classified in the revised El Escorial criteria, we used the previously used term of &#x0201c;suspected ALS&#x0201d; elaborated in the primary El Escorial criteria.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> PLMN was considered if the symptoms were restricted to the LMN and if genetic factors (CAG expansion or SMN1 deletion) and electrophysiological conduction block were excluded. Neuroimaging was used to exclude organic changes of the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord in all cases. The control group included 101 healthy individuals or patients diagnosed at the same department with benign non-neurodegenerative diseases such as headache or radiculopathy. The study was approved by the Institutional Bioethical Committees according to Helsinki declaration. All subjects signed an informed consent prior to inclusion in the study.

For the bead array, antibodies were immobilized onto magnetic color-coded beads with one bead identity corresponding to a certain antibody. Samples were then further diluted 1:50 in an assay buffer, heat treated at 56&#x000b0;C for 30 min, combined into a 384-well microtiter plate, and incubated with the bead array at RT on a shaker overnight.

Technical variation was assessed by calculating the coefficient of variation for each antibody based on samples measured in triplicates. The association between groups was tested using normalized data by Wilcoxon rank sum or Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis tests and unadjusted <italic>P</italic>-values lower than 0.01 were regarded as significant. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to evaluate associations and Euclidian distance was applied for hierarchical clustering. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate the classification power of selected proteins and normalized data were log transformed for logistic regression applied for either the antibodies individually or combined. The model was trained with data from 324 individuals and to assess the classification power, the remaining 144 were used for testing.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>With the aim to identify protein profiles associated to ALS, we have performed an extensive profiling of plasma samples from 367 ALS patients and 101 controls. The selection of protein targets was based on thorough literature mining with an aim to include all published proteins with potential relation to ALS and the disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, we added a selection of targets from previous in-house efforts of antibody-based protein profiling of plasma and CSF within neuroscience. In the end, availability of validated antibodies within the HPA directed the final set to a unique panel of 352 antibodies targeting 278 unique proteins.</p><p>The samples were randomly divided into two sample plates and screening using the panel of 352 antibodies was performed for both plates. After analysis of all 468 individuals, eight antibodies were found to reveal significant or close to significant differences (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in both plates. To further verify the findings, additional antibodies were included toward these targets and all samples were analyzed once more with a direct labeling assay. Of these eight, three proteins were replicated with a significant difference between ALS patients and controls. See Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref> for an overview of the study design.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the study design.

Eight antibodies were found to detect altered levels of their targets in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients compared to the control group and these were selected for an additional replication round including both sample sets.

All three showed higher levels of the proteins in ALS patients (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>) with a technical variation of 14%, 13% and 13%, respectively. The NEFM antibody was analyzed with Western blot and gave a distinct band of expected molecular weight (150 kDa) and one additional band at higher molecular weight (&#x0223c;450 kDa), which could indicate multimeric forms. A band of predicted molecular weight (33 kDa) was also observed for the SLC25A20 antibody. The antibody toward RGS18 showed no band in this analysis. The high-density peptide microarray-based epitope mapping revealed clear binding to several adjacent peptides and epitopes for all three antibodies. The results can be summarized as the shortest common amino acid sequences for adjacent peptides and the minimal epitopes identified were VVTI for NEFM (corresponding to amino acids 746&#x02013;749, ENSP00000221166), VITNSIT for RGS18 (amino acids 160&#x02013;166, ENSP00000356430), and KYTGTLDC, APPGKY, and YKGFNAV for SLC25A20 (amino acids 148&#x02013;155, 240&#x02013;245, and 266&#x02013;272, respectively, ENSP00000326305).</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Differences in protein levels between amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients and controls.

A screening of 468 samples using 352 antibodies resulted in the finding of three interesting proteins with potential to discriminate ALS patients from controls where NEFM as well as both RGS18 and SLC25A20 were found at higher levels in ALS patients. While NEFM is highly enriched in the nervous system, the other two have a more widespread expression and have been detected in various cells and tissues at both RNA and protein level.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>NEFM, the protein with the highest statistical significance in this study, is one of the subunits of neurofilaments. According to both gene expression based on RNAseq data and Immunohistochemistry staining in the HPA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proteinatlas.org">http://www.proteinatlas.org</ext-link>), as well as the GeneSapiens database,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> expression of this protein is highly restricted to neurons in the central and peripheral nervous system. The neurofilaments have been mentioned in the context of several neurodegenerative disorders, in which for instance mutations and abnormal accumulation of filaments have been identified as markers.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Increased levels of neurofilament light and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy polypeptide have been reported in CSF and plasma of ALS patients. Light and heavy subunits have also been associated with disease progression and survival, where higher concentrations in CSF and/or plasma were associated with a faster progression and shorter survival.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Neurofilaments are heavily phosphorylated and accumulation of the hyperphosphorylated forms have been identified in ALS.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Also glycosylations of these proteins have been described as a modification related to neurodegeneration and in a transgenic rat model of ALS, a decrease in the <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation of NEFM was observed.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Since NEFM is used as an indicator of neuronal damage, its increased plasma concentration might be a consequence of the axonal death in ALS. Interestingly, it has also been suggested as an autoimmune target in the context of this disease.<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>RGS18 belongs to a large family of regulators of G-protein signaling proteins, all sharing a highly conserved RGS domain of &#x0223c;120 amino acids. RGS proteins are known inhibitors of signal transduction and increase GTPase activity of the alpha subunits of G proteins.<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> RGS18 expression has been reported in human platelets, leukocytes, megakaryocytes, and lymphocytes<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and it was found to decrease in abundance in degenerating muscle of rainbow trout.<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Muscle wasting secondary to the loss of motor neurons is a key symptom of ALS. The increase in RGS18 level in plasma may reflect its leakage from the degenerated muscles in patients with ALS.</p><p>SLC25A20, a member of the large mitochondrial carrier family, catalyzes transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Cytosolic acylcarnitines are transferred into the mitochondrial matrix for oxidation by the <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-oxidation pathway in exchange for carnitines.<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Disturbances of ATP production, calcium homeostasis, and regulation of apoptosis, all related to mitochondria, have all been reported in ALS. Abnormalities of this organelle's morphology and biochemistry in brain cortex, spinal cord, and muscles have been seen both in ALS patients and in <italic>SOD1</italic> transgenic mice.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>In this study, a number of proteins showed trends that could be of potential interest but was either not significant in the screening at set threshold, only significant in one of the plates or not significant in the replication assay. These proteins include ERRFI1, LRRC39, C9, SLC9A3R1, PSMD7, TFPT, CRYAA, MMP9, GSK3B, MAP3K1, TJP2, S100A8, and ZFP36L1 for which levels were higher in the ALS patients, whereas CST3, DYNC1I1, KIFC3, PIK3CA, PRPH, and PSMB1 were found at lower levels in these patients. It is noticeable that we did not find any significant changes in the plasma level of several proteins directly or indirectly associated to the pathogenesis of ALS (data not shown). The reasons that the antibodies utilized did not show differences could though be many, for example, that the proteins are not present in plasma at detectable levels (currently approximately in the high pg/mL to low ng/mL range).</p><p>For target verification using Western blot, the NEFM and SLC25A20 antibody detected a target of the predicted molecular mass. The absence of bands for RGS18 could be due to the difference in representation of protein in a denatured state on a membrane compared to solution, potentially affecting the antibodies&#x02019; recognition to find their epitopes. However, for all three antibodies, epitopes were successfully identified using high-density peptide arrays.</p><p>In the replication stage of this study, several antibodies were included toward the selected protein targets. For all additional antibodies toward NEFM, RGS18, and SLC25A20 signal intensities were low in the direct labeling assay, indicating that these antibodies might not capture their targets in the described setup. They were also generated toward other parts of the respective proteins and their epitopes might therefore differ in accessibility and detectability as a response to heat treatment.</p><p>The three proteins were found at higher levels in plasma of ALS patients compared to controls, however, they were not able to distinguish between FALS and SALS. Interestingly, there were also no differences in levels for subclassifications, site of onset, or phenotypes, aside from the levels of NEFM for definite and suspected ALS. This is especially interesting for PUMN, the most rare clinical phenotype with comparably very long survival, which could potentially be due to a different pathogenic background. There has also been a vivid discussion concerning the inclusion of PLMN phenotype in the diagnosis of ALS.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Although primarily classified as suspected ALS the phenotype was excluded from the ALS diagnosis according to the revised El Escorial criteria.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, data published recently reported the existence of common genetic, risk and survival determining factors in progressive muscular atrophy (PLMN of a long duration; &#x0003e;48 months) and classic ALS.<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Our results sustain the common pathogenesis of these disorders by showing the comparably increased levels of the three identified proteins in plasma of all ALS phenotypes, including PLMN, as compared to controls.</p><p>The present study has enabled a representation and assessment of the individual variation in plasma protein levels not only in ALS patients as a whole but also in clinically relevant subgroups, comparisons that would have been limited if it were not for the large sample size. However, to increase the understanding of the function and role of these proteins, further characterizations are required in a broad range of independent sample materials, not at least is it important to investigate the potential association and relation to other neurological and muscle degenerative disorders.</p><p>To our current knowledge, this is the most extensive plasma profiling study conducted within ALS and we have here identified three interesting proteins as candidate markers to be further explored, to elucidate their potential role in the pathogenesis of ALS, as well as their usefulness in monitoring the response to therapy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was funded by grants from Science for Life Laboratory Stockholm, ProNova VINN Excellence Centre for Protein Technology (VINNOVA, Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems), Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, and grant 5/JPND/2011 (M.
