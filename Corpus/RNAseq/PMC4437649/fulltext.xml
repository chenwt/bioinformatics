Their growth rates vary between species and are dependent on environmental conditions. The cell cycle, starch and triacylglycerol accumulation are controlled by the diurnal light:dark cycle. Storage compounds like starch and triacylglycerol accumulate in the light when CO<sub>2</sub> fixation rates exceed the need of assimilated carbon and energy for cell maintenance and division during the dark phase. To delineate environmental effects, we analyzed cell division rates, metabolism and transcriptional regulation in <italic>Dunaliella viridis</italic> in response to changes in light duration and growth temperatures. Its rate of cell division was increased under continuous light conditions, while a shift in temperature from 25&#x000b0;C to 35&#x000b0;C did not significantly affect the cell division rate, but increased the triacylglycerol content per cell several-fold under continuous light. The amount of saturated fatty acids in triacylglycerol fraction was more responsive to an increase in temperature than to a change in the light regime. Detailed fatty acid profiles showed that <italic>Dunaliella viridis</italic> incorporated lauric acid (C12:0) into triacylglycerol after 24 hours under continuous light. Transcriptome analysis identified potential regulators involved in the light and temperature-induced lipid accumulation in <italic>Dunaliella viridis</italic>.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding for this project and the presented research was provided by NSF Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation (EFRI) grant #0937721 and #1332341.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="12"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="32"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All transcriptome loci count data files are available from the NCBI GEO database (GSE40997) and the ITS2 sequence is available from NCBI Genbank (KP057241).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All transcriptome loci count data files are available from the NCBI GEO database (GSE40997) and the ITS2 sequence is available from NCBI Genbank (KP057241).</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Marine microalgae have been investigated for their great potential as feedstocks for renewable liquid transportation fuels because they could replace petroleum-derived fuels without competing for resources like land or fresh water required for food and feed production [<xref rid="pone.0127562.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127562.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. <italic>Dunaliella spp</italic>. grow in salt lakes and marine environments worldwide and have adapted to their specific environments [<xref rid="pone.0127562.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127562.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].

Despite all these useful traits of <italic>Dunaliella</italic> for bioenergy production, production of algae oil for liquid transportation fuels is commercially not viable.

Our results show that changes in photoperiod and temperature have both, specific and combined effects on gene expression and metabolism. While cell division is synchronized by the dark period, the cellular protein content only responds to temperature, not light period. Starch metabolism on the other hand is controlled via transcriptional regulation of its degradation enzymes and does not respond to temperature changes under light:dark cycles, but is sensitive to temperature under continuous light conditions. Accumulation of TAG has two distinct and independent components&#x02014;a photoperiod responsive component that increased oil content more than five-fold, and a temperature-dependent component responsible for a doubling of oil content. These effects were independent, so that the combination of continuous light and elevated temperature led to a tenfold increase in oil content. Transcriptome analysis showed that fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis for increases in oil content under elevated temperature is not transcriptionally regulated, while TAG biosynthesis is driven by transcriptional up-regulation of lipases involved in the recycling of FAs from membrane lipids.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Strain and growth conditions</title><p>The <italic>Dunaliella spp</italic>. strains (<italic>Dunaliella viridis</italic> dumsii, <italic>D</italic>. <italic>salina</italic> LB200, <italic>D</italic>. <italic>tertiolecta</italic> LB999 and <italic>D</italic>. <italic>primolecta</italic> LB1000) used in this study were obtained from the Center for Applied Aquatic Ecology at North Carolina State University.

Transcripts for starch synthase (SS) which uses ADP-glucose as a substrate to generate amylopectin followed a strong diurnal pattern of regulation under LD, but was increasingly down-regulated under LL. The transcripts encoding for the branching enzyme (BE) shows opposite regulation under both light conditions in comparison to SS. The debranching enzymes like isoamylase (ISA) and pullulanase hydrolyze amylopectin to release maltose and malto-oligosaccharides from starch and can also be involved in modifications of branch density and therefore crystallinity of the starch. Transcripts encoding for both the ISA and pullulanase followed diurnal pattern under LD cycle, with opposite pattern of regulation. Malto-oligosaccharides are hydrolyzed in the plastid by the disproportionating enzyme 1 (DPE1) into glucose and by starch phosphorylase into G1P. Transcripts encoding for DPE1 showed a strong diurnal regulation under LD, whereas under LL it was increasingly down-regulated. Transcripts of genes involved in starch degradation via hydrolysis such as oligo-1,6-glucosidase (O-1,6G) and alpha-amylase (&#x003b1;-AMY) or by phosphorylation such as &#x003b1;-GWD (alpha-glucan water dikinase) and BAM (beta-amylase) were identified.

The diurnal pattern of expression of these genes fades into a continuous expression pattern under LL suggesting that the population of cells is no longer dividing synchronously. The loss of synchronous growth most likely stems from the lack of the dark induced pause in the cell cycle, which allows cells to resume cell cycle progression as soon as cell division is complete.

The most dramatic effect in response to LL at either temperature (25&#x000b0;C or 35&#x000b0;C) was observed in the transcript abundance changes of specific carbonic anhydrase isoforms (<xref rid="pone.0127562.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11A Fig</xref>). When light absorption exceeds CO<sub>2</sub>-fixation rates, the excitation energy can cause photoinhibition. To adjust their photosynthesis to excess light energy (as under LL), the cells can either increase photoprotective mechanisms for non-photochemical quenching or increase their CO<sub>2</sub> fixation rates. Based on our transcript data, <italic>Dunaliella</italic> cells use both strategies to compensate for LL exposure. It has been shown in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> that the major extracellular carbonic anhydrase (HLA5) is induced by light or low CO<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0127562.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Increasing the carbonic anhydrase as part of the carbon concentrating mechanism, enables the cell to productively use the excitation energy for the uptake of C<sub>i</sub> against a concentration gradient, and for the fixation of CO<sub>2</sub>. The increase in cell number and storage components (starch and TAGs) requires a net increase in CO<sub>2</sub> fixation in cells under LL exposure. Photoprotection by non-photochemical quenching is apparent from the differential expression of transcript 10594 encoding chloroplast carotene biosynthesis-related (CBR) protein (<xref rid="pone.0127562.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). Under LD conditions, expression varied from ~1500 RPKM to no expression in the dark (~5&#x02013;10 RPKM), while under LL, transcript abundance remained above 400 RPKM during the course of the experiment.

This decrease was due to the reduction of the chloroplast membrane lipids MGDG and DGDG (<xref rid="pone.0127562.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>), and strongly correlates with the low content of chlorophyll under LL at 25&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="pone.0127562.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>).

The activity of AGPase in vascular plants is regulated allosterically by triosephosphates and phosphate as well as via posttranslational redox modification.

We found two <italic>DGAT1</italic> gene and 4 <italic>DGTT</italic> genes in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic> based on sequence similarity to <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> proteins, which were differentially regulated at 35&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="pone.0127562.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0127562.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11L Fig</xref>). The two <italic>DGAT1</italic> genes had opposite pattern of regulation. <italic>DGAT1</italic> (transcript 6208) was down-regulated 6 hours after the temperature switch to 35&#x000b0;C, but then was up-regulated at the higher temperature whereas <italic>DGAT1</italic> (transcript 3780) was initially up-regulated after the temperature shift to 35&#x000b0;C and then down-regulated at 40 and 54 hrs (<xref rid="pone.0127562.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0127562.s020" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7A Table</xref>). One of the <italic>DGTT</italic> genes (transcript 9514) had slight up-regulation with increasing time in response to higher temperature. In <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic>, DGAT had the largest increase in abundance of all analyzed proteins from the FA and TAG biosynthesis pathway under N-deprivation [<xref rid="pone.0127562.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. We hypothesize that either the enzymes of the acyl-CoA dependent pathway for TAG synthesis are not transcriptionally regulated in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic>, or the pathway is not up-regulated under high temperature and thus the acyl-CoA dependent TAG synthesis pathway does not have a major role in TAG accumulation under high temperature.</p></sec><sec id="sec036"><title>TAG biosynthesis through membrane lipid recycling of fatty acids</title><p>When considering TAG synthesis through the acyl-CoA independent pathway (<xref rid="pone.0127562.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>), we need to consider the recycling of the chloroplast membrane lipids for TAG formation. Under higher temperature, all enzymes involved in membrane lipid formation were up-regulated except for sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQD1) and MGD1 (<xref rid="pone.0127562.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>). At 25&#x000b0;C, MGDG is the second most abundant chloroplast membrane lipid after DGDG, but upon growth at 35&#x000b0;C its content more than doubles and it becomes the most abundant membrane lipid (<xref rid="pone.0127562.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). The accumulation of MGDG at 35&#x000b0;C and the down-regulation of the <italic>MGD1</italic> gene suggest this process is either not transcriptionally regulated, but alternatively regulated, or an unknown enzyme/pathway for the biosynthesis of MGDG exists in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic>. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, MGD1 is post-transcriptionally regulated by PA and PG [<xref rid="pone.0127562.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. At 35&#x000b0;C, increases in both PA and PG (<xref rid="pone.0127562.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>), suggest a possibility for the post-transcriptional control of MGD1 activity in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic>. In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, PDAT and PGD1 were found to be important in membrane lipid recycling for TAG accumulation [<xref rid="pone.0127562.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127562.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127562.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Under N-starvation in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, PDAT1 is a protein found in purified lipid bodies [<xref rid="pone.0127562.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], although its expression for TAG accumulation is not clear. <italic>PDAT1</italic> was found to be up-regulated under N-starvation [<xref rid="pone.0127562.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. However it was also shown that if PDAT contributed appreciably to the TAG formation under favorable growth conditions, its contribution under N deprivation was minor [<xref rid="pone.0127562.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. In <italic>D</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic> at 35&#x000b0;C, <italic>PDAT1</italic> is down-regulated at all-time points suggesting that its contribution to recycling of membrane lipids for TAG accumulation is only minor unless the enzyme is not transcriptionally regulated (<xref rid="pone.0127562.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>). <italic>PGD1</italic> was up-regulated at 35&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="pone.0127562.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>), which is similar to TAG accumulation in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> under N-deprivation [<xref rid="pone.0127562.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127562.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Presumably, the mechanism of TAG accumulation by membrane lipid recycling using PDAT1 and PGD1 is similar for higher temperature in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic> and for N-deprivation in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>.</p><p>In addition, lipases are thought to be involved in membrane lipid recycling. We found several lipases highly up-regulated at 35&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="pone.0127562.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0127562.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11N Fig</xref>), similar to lipases upregulated by N-starvation in other algae for TAG accumulation [<xref rid="pone.0127562.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127562.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Another enzyme involved in membrane remodeling in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> under freezing stress is galactolipid: galactolipid galactosyltransferase (GGGT), which uses MGDG as both a donor and acceptor molecule and forms DGDG and DAG [<xref rid="pone.0127562.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This enzyme was up-regulated in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic> at 35&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="pone.0127562.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>). Based on our findings and insights from other research, we hypothesize that TAG accumulation in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic> under heat stress could be mainly due to the membrane lipid recycling of FAs.</p><p>In summary, environmental conditions enabled the production of high levels of oil during fast growth in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic>. The effects of eliminating the dark period in the growth cycle of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic> resulted in a loss of cell cycle synchronicity and faster growth rates. The accumulation of TAG and starch in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic> cells were apparently due to the lack of degradation that usually occurs during the dark period. Temperature changes did not have any effect on short-term growth rates, but did lead to increases in chlorophyll, starch and lipid content likely due to higher photosynthesis rates under elevated temperature. The most interesting aspect was that the effects of light duration and temperature increase were independent but additive with respect to TAG accumulation. The higher temperature also increased the degree of saturation in the TAG fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids in the TAG fraction are advantageous, because it reduces the cost for hydrogenation during refining for fuel production. Transcriptome analysis indicated that TAG accumulation in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic> under heat stress could be mainly due to the membrane lipid recycling of FAs.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec037"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0127562.s001"><label>S1
