The production of more effective enzyme cocktails is a key objective for efficient biofuel production. To achieve this objective, it is crucial to understand the response of fungi to lignocellulose substrates. Our previous study used RNA-seq to identify the genes induced in <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> in response to wheat straw, a biofuel feedstock, and showed that the range of genes induced was greater than previously seen with simple inducers.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><p id="P5">In this work we used RNA-seq to identify the genes induced in <italic>A. niger</italic> in response to short rotation coppice willow and compared this with the response to wheat straw from our previous study, at the same time-point. The response to willow showed a large increase in expression of genes encoding CAZymes. Genes encoding the major activities required to saccharify lignocellulose were induced on willow such as endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases and xylanases. The transcriptome response to willow had many similarities with the response to straw with some significant differences in the expression levels of individual genes which are discussed in relation to differences in substrate composition or other factors. Differences in transcript levels include higher levels on wheat straw from genes encoding enzymes classified as members of GH62 (an arabinofuranosidase) and CE1 (a feruloyl esterase) CAZy families whereas two genes encoding endoglucanases classified as members of the GH5 family had higher transcript levels when exposed to willow. There were changes in the cocktail of enzymes secreted by <italic>A. niger</italic> when cultured with willow or straw. Assays for particular enzymes as well as saccharification assays were used to compare the enzyme activities of the cocktails. Wheat straw induced an enzyme cocktail that saccharified wheat straw to a greater extent than willow. Genes not encoding CAZymes were also induced on willow such as hydrophobins as well as genes of unknown function. Several genes were identified as promising targets for future study.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P6">By comparing this first study of the global transcriptional response of a fungus to willow with the response to straw, we have shown that the inducing lignocellulosic substrate has a marked effect upon the range of transcripts and enzymes expressed by <italic>A. niger</italic>.

A key problem with using lignocellulose is its recalcitrance to saccharification. This recalcitrance leads to a requirement for large amounts of polysaccharide-degrading enzymes which are costly to produce at the industrial scale. Furthermore, the enzyme cocktails produced mainly by saprobic fungi are usually deficient in activities required for complete saccharification of a particular substrate. One cause of this may be the industrial use of simple, cost effective inducers, such as lactose or cellulose which fail to induce the full range of hydrolytic and accessory activities encoded within an organism&#x02019;s genome. Differences in the enzyme cocktails expressed in response to complex, lignocellulosic substrates as compared to defined substrates such as pure cellulose have been observed in several fungal species [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Simple inducers may not provide the most effective possible enzyme profile that is achievable from the arsenal encoded within a fungal genome for any given substrate. The effectiveness of the cocktail is also likely to vary towards different substrates, even if the induction mechanism remains elusive. The pairing of inducer and lignocellulosic substrate is therefore a key consideration in biofuel production.</p><p id="P8">The perspective of how plants and fungi evolved provides a context for improvement of the efficiency of saccharification. Lignocellulose is present in plant secondary cell walls and is mainly composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Generally, plants that are evolutionarily close share a more similar lignocellulose composition and this is particularly evident in hemicellulose composition [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. At the same time, fungi have evolved complex regulatory mechanisms to sense their environment including nutrients such as lignocellulose [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This is evidenced by the response of fungi to the presence of different polysaccharides such as xylan, arabinan or pectin and suggests that fungi may have specific degradative responses to lignocellulosic substrates from different plant species [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p id="P9">We chose to study the response of a fungus to two plant species using <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> as the fungus and wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) and willow (<italic>Salix</italic> sp.) as the plant species for three key reasons. Firstly, wheat (a grass) and willow (a tree) represent the two major lineages of flowering plants which have evolved cell walls with diverse compositions. Secondly, both species are of potential industrial relevance as feedstocks for biofuel production [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Thirdly, <italic>A. niger</italic> is an industrially-relevant model fungus with a large repertoire of CAZymes [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of <italic>A. niger</italic> to respond differently at the transcriptional level to different polysaccharides [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] making it ideally suited to investigate responses to different substrates.</p><p id="P10">RNA-seq is a method which is transforming how transcriptomes are studied [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and provides a highly sensitive read-out of responses to substrates at the genome-wide level. Our previous studies using RNA-seq have defined and compared the responses of <italic>A. niger</italic> and <italic>T. reesei</italic> to wheat straw [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Another study by Hakkinen et al. [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], in <italic>T. reesei</italic> showed differences and similarities in the transcriptional response to different lignocellulosic substrates. One limitation of that and other studies is the use of microarrays which have a narrower range for which expression can be measured compared to RNA-seq. Also, substrates can be used that have been subjected to harsh pre-treatments, albeit industrially relevant, which alter the substrate far from what fungi have evolved to sense and degrade in nature.</p><p id="P11">To our knowledge, there is no study that reports the transcriptional response of a fungus to willow, a perennial species that has much potential as a bioenergy crop [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The use of the same experimental conditions for culturing <italic>A. niger</italic> on straw and willow presented a unique opportunity to compare the transcriptional responses of <italic>A. niger</italic> to these substrates. These transcriptional responses were compared with biochemical assays of the protein mixes secreted by <italic>A. niger</italic> when cultured with the different substrates.</p><p id="P12">Here we report on differences and similarities in the transcriptional responses and the secreted protein activities of <italic>A. niger</italic> exposed to wheat straw or willow. We show that the fungal response is to some extent specific to the inducing substrate. Moreover, our results highlight the importance of using complex inducing substrates for production of enzymes and accessory proteins by industry or for discovering the relevant small inducing molecules. Finally, we discuss how biotechnology could be used to benefit biofuels by making better fungal strains.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S5"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="S6"><title>The willow-induced CAZy expression profile</title><p id="P13"><italic>A. niger</italic> was cultured in a glucose medium for 48 h followed by transfer to a medium where ball-milled willow was the sole carbon source for 24 h. The sugar composition of the willow substrate (as % of total solids) was 38.5% (&#x000b1;0.90) glucose, 10.4% (&#x000b1;1.03) xylose and 1.1% arabinose (&#x000b1;0.02) and the lignin content was 23.1% (&#x000b1;0.95) (the values in parentheses are standard deviations). To re-introduce a simple carbon source in the presence of lignocellulose, glucose was added to the willow cultures after 24 h and incubated for a further 5 h. RNA was extracted and sequenced from these three conditions. Reads including those mapping to genes encoding enzymes defined by CAZy [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] as being either glycoside hydrolases, polysaccharide lyases, carbohydrate esterases or auxiliary activity proteins, were counted and the relative expression of each family was calculated.</p><p id="P14"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows that after culturing <italic>A. niger</italic> for 24 h with willow, the most abundantly expressed family is GH5, which accounts for 13.3% of total CAZy RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads). The GH5 family is divided into a range of subfamilies and encompasses a variety of functions [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The majority of GH5 family expression seen in this study originates from two endoglucanase-encoding genes, TID_205580 and TID_209376 (<italic>eglB</italic>), which are expressed at 121 and 210 RPKM respectively. The expression values of the genes described in this section are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and a full list of individual gene expression values can be found in the Additional file 1.</p><p id="P15">The two GH7, reducing-end-active, cellobiohydrolases encoded within the <italic>A. niger</italic> genome, CbhA and CbhB (the products of TID_53159 and TID_51773), are expressed at 156 and 116 RPKM respectively, and together represent 9.9% of CAZy gene expression. The non-reducing end processive cellobiohydrolases of the GH6 family are also expressed highly due to expression of TID_54490 at 145 RPKM and TID_133986 at 55 RPKM.</p><p id="P16">Expression of two genes encoding GH12 family enzymes, TID_211053, encoding the endoglucanase EglA, and TID_52011 encoding an enzyme with strong similarity to xyloglucan-specific endo-beta-1,4-glucanase from <italic>Aspergillus aculeatus</italic> [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], at 116 and 49 RPKM respectively account for 6.1% of CAZy expression.</p><p id="P17">In addition to the glycoside hydrolase families, the AA9 (formerly GH61 [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]) family of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases, is also highly expressed and accounts for 8.9% of CAZy expression. This is almost completely due to the expression of TID_211595 at 247 RPKM. A 5.6% contribution is also made by the CE1 family of carbohydrate esterases due to high levels of transcription of a single gene, the acetyl xylan esterase, <italic>axeA</italic> (TID_211544) at 161 RPKM.</p><p id="P18">This transcript distribution broadly reflects the enzymes required for the saccharification of lignocellulose. The key enzymes involved in the bulk degradation of the cellulose and xylan backbones, i.e. endoglucanases and cellobiohydrolases in the former case and xylanases in the latter, make up the greatest proportion of CAZy expression. Expressed at a lower, but still substantial level, are accessory proteins such as the AA9 family lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases, that are thought to improve the accessibility to the recalcitrant polymers and play a role in depolymerisation of cellulose through oxidative cleavage [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. CE1 esterases, which cleave the acetyl group linkages of xylans [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] are also expressed at a lower, but still sizable level. Notably, there is relatively little expression of the &#x003b2;-glucosidases and xylosidases when <italic>A. niger</italic> is exposed to willow.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>A cross-substrate comparison using transcriptomics</title><p id="P19">In an earlier study [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] we delineated the transcriptional profile of <italic>A. niger</italic> under conditions identical to those used here, with the exception that wheat straw was provided as the only lignocellulosic substrate. The composition of the wheat straw (as % of total solids and using the same compositional analysis methods as used for willow) was 37.4% (&#x000b1;2.96) glucose, 16.8% xylose (&#x000b1;2.48) and 2.7% arabinose (&#x000b1;0.29) and the lignin content was 21.6% (&#x000b1;0.73) (the values in parentheses are standard deviations). Re-calculation of the expression data using the updated genome model and method outlined in this manuscript, allows the direct comparison of the two datasets. A time-dependent transcriptome profile on the two different substrates was not feasible but we accept that the transcript profiles may change with time differently on wheat straw or willow. Therefore, we interpret the comparative data cautiously and focus on the major differences for discussion.</p><p id="P20">Following 24 hours exposure to each substrate, the total CAZy expression induced by willow contributes 15% of total gene expression, while the equivalent for wheat straw is 21%. Therefore, the CAZy portion of the transcriptome is approximately one third greater in response to wheat straw than willow at this specific time point. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> compares the relative contribution to total gene expression under each condition per CAZy family (for those families in which a total of at least 100 RPKM was achieved on either substrate) and also per selected enzyme activities that the genes encode. There are similarities in the general expression pattern observed, with GH6, 7, 11, 12, CE1 and AA9 being amongst the most highly expressed families on either substrate. For almost all families, relative expression is greater in response to wheat straw than willow, as might be expected when the total expression of CAZy genes overall is one third greater on wheat straw. However, the size of the increase in expression of the CAZy families is not uniform, implying that the difference between the two responses is not simply correlated with the total CAZy expression but instead due to differences in the levels of induction of genes in the CAZy families. In the CE1 family, for example, a single acetylxylan esterase gene, <italic>axeA</italic>, is highly expressed following exposure to willow (161 RPKM). The gene <italic>axeA</italic> is also highly expressed following exposure to straw (562 RPKM) with no statistically significant difference in expression compared to willow (DESeq, P = 0.89). However a second CE1 family member, TID_43785 which is the ortholog of the feruloyl esterase <italic>faeC</italic> from <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], is expressed poorly on willow (3 RPKM) but is highly induced (325 RPKM) on wheat straw with a significant 53-fold (DESeq, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) increase in expression on straw compared to willow (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> and Additional file 1).</p><p id="P21">The two most striking differences seen in the pattern of expression of genes encoding entire CAZy enzyme families are in GH62 and GH5. GH62 family members are arabinofuranosidases, a single example of which is encoded within the <italic>A. niger</italic> genome, the 1,4-&#x003b2;-D-arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolase, <italic>axhA</italic> (TID_55136) [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], which is expressed at 116 RPKM on willow. The GH62 family is the tenth most expressed family on willow whereas in contrast it is the third most expressed family on straw. This difference in the ranking order of the GH62 family is due to a 3.4 fold increase in expression of <italic>axhA</italic> (900 RPKM) on straw compared to willow. This trend in expression with the GH62 family member <italic>axhA</italic> has been confirmed by qRT-PCR (Additional file 2).</p><p id="P22">The GH5 family is notable amongst the most highly expressed families for being the only one in which greater expression is seen in response to willow. Whilst the two predominant endoglucanases expressed on willow, TID_20 5580 and TID_209376 (<italic>eglC</italic>), remain the two most highly expressed members of the family on wheat straw, levels are ~3-fold reduced for each as calculated using DESeq1.9.</p><p id="P23">The overall responses to these two different substrates, represented by the hardwood and straw feedstocks, retain a core set of highly induced genes that encode enzymes required for the degradation of any lignocellulosic substrate. Regulatory differences at the level of individual genes could have led to the substrate-specific variations in gene expression, which fine-tuned the response of the cells for the degradation of the particular substrate. These variations in gene expression are possibly due to differences in the inducing signals that are generated from the substrates, probably through the generation of small inducing molecules (e.g. sugars and sugar oligomers) from the respective feedstocks. Wheat (a graminaceous (grass) monocot) and willow (a woody dicot) lineages are separated by ~400 million years of evolution and in that time have evolved different plant cell wall properties.</p><p id="P24">At the molecular level one of the notable differences between the hemicelluloses of grasses and dicots (reviewed in [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]) is the increased decoration of glucuronoxylan in grasses with arabinose to form glucuronoarabinoxylan. The increased levels of arabinoxylans within grasses may explain the particularly increased expression level seen for the GH62 family on wheat straw as compared to willow. The enzymes within this family are arabinofuranosidases that act to cleave arabinofuranose side chains from the xylan backbone of arabinoxylans [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. GH43 also includes arabinofuranosidases, many of which display both &#x003b1;-L-arabinosidase and &#x003b2;-D-xylosidase activity. Although the overall expression level of this family in these experiments was relatively low on both substrates, there was significantly increased expression on wheat straw compared to willow of two genes, TID_182100 and TID_47677, which were both significantly more highly expressed (28-fold and 4-fold increased respectively, analysed using DESeq1.9, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Arabinose-responsive transcriptional regulation of CAZy enzymes through the AraR regulatory pathway has been described previously in <italic>A. niger</italic> [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p id="P25">In addition to hemicellulose composition, the cross-linking between cell wall components also differs between wheat and willow; in grasses such as wheat, ferulic acid linkages connect lignin and hemicelluloses but are largely absent from dicots such as willow [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. There are three genes encoding enzymes with potential ferulic acid esterase activity within the <italic>A. niger</italic> genome <italic>faeA, faeB</italic> and TID_43785. The gene <italic>faeA</italic> (TID_51662) has been demonstrated by de Vries and colleagues [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] to encode a ferulate esterase, although it is not officially classified as a carbohydrate esterase by CAZy. After exposure to wheat straw [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], <italic>faeA</italic> was one of the most highly expressed genes and the expression level as calculated for this study is 396 RPKM. In comparison, the expression of <italic>faeA</italic> on willow is 13.9-fold lower than the expression on straw. The expression levels of <italic>faeA</italic> were demonstrated to be regulated by both xylose/xylan and ferulic acid specific systems, with induction stimulated by xylose alone but optimal induction occurring in the presence of ferulic acid in addition to xylose [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. FaeB (encoded by TID_51478), which is not expressed over 2 RPKM on either substrate has significantly decreased activity towards wheat straw arabinoxylan compared to FaeA [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. As discussed previously, the putative feruloyl esterase encoded by TID_43785 is one of the most highly differentially expressed genes between the two substrates. The increased expression on wheat straw could indicate that it shares a ferulate-dependent induction system with <italic>faeA</italic>. The same trend was observed for TID_43785 and <italic>faeA</italic> using qRT-PCR with a repeat experiment replicating the conditions used for RNA-seq (Additional file 2). These transcriptional observations support the hypothesis that the response of <italic>A. niger</italic> to lignocellulose is fine-tuned by, and linked to, the substrate composition.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Comparison of culture supernatant activity using azurine dyed substrates</title><p id="P26">The RNA-seq data suggested transcriptional specificity in the response of <italic>A. niger</italic> to each substrate. To investigate this biochemically, supernatants harvested from <italic>A. niger</italic> cultures incubated with either substrate for 24 h (the same conditions used for RNA-seq) were assayed for activity towards two azurine-linked substrates: cellulose &#x02013; a major component of both the wheat straw and willow substrates and arabinoxylan &#x02013; a hemicellulose found in much greater abundance in wheat straw than willow. Activities in the culture supernatants were assayed using a predetermined volume of the supernatants that gave a linear response between time and azurine dye release. The activity towards arabinoxylan was 10-fold greater in the straw-induced cocktail compared to the willow-induced cocktail (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). To demonstrate that this higher level of activity towards arabinoxylan could not just be explained by higher total amounts of lignocellulosic active enzymes in the straw cocktail, the activity towards arabinoxylan was expressed as a ratio of the activity towards HE-cellulose. This ratio showed that there was still a greater level of arabinoxylan activity in the straw-induced cocktail because the ratio of the activities was 4-fold greater in the straw-induced cocktail compared to the willow-induced cocktail (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). The greater activity towards arabinoxylan in the wheat straw-induced cocktail has support from the RNA-seq data where the GH62 family gene <italic>axhA</italic> encoding arabinofuranosidase activity has higher expression in <italic>A. niger</italic> wheat straw-induced cultures compared to the willow-induced cultures.

Slightly higher specific &#x003b2;-glucosidase (1.28 fold) and &#x003b2;-xylosidase (1.17 fold) activities were measured in the straw culture supernatants compared to the willow culture supernatants. The cellobiohydrolase specific activity was also higher (~3.5 fold) in the straw culture supernatants. In contrast, the specific &#x003b1;-arabinofuranosidase/arabinofuranoside hydrolase activity was ~ 2.5 fold lower in the straw culture supernatants compared to the willow culture supernatants. When these specific activities were compared with the RNAseq data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, there were similarities in the trends. There was a significantly higher proportion of expression of genes encoding &#x003b2;-xylosidase activity in the straw cultures. Expression of genes encoding for cellobiohydrolase activity or &#x003b2;-glucosidase activity was not significantly different in the straw cultures compared to the willow cultures and neither was there a significant difference in the expression of genes encoding for &#x003b1;-arabinofuranosidase/arabinofuranoside hydrolase activity between the two cultures although that comparison is complicated by the fact that the majority of the gene expression was from <italic>axhA</italic> and AxhA is unable to hydrolyse the pNP-&#x003b1;-arabinofuranoside.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Comparison of culture supernatant activities using saccharification assays</title><p id="P29">Over a 48 h saccharification time course using varying concentrations of protein from supernatants of straw or willow cultures, the release of reducing end group equivalents from the straw or willow substrates was periodically assessed using the DNS assay [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and free glucose levels measured using the GODPOD assay. After 24 h the levels of free sugars measured were over 80% of the total measured after 48 h, and therefore this incubation time was chosen as the standard for all further assays (Additional file 4). Over a 24 h period concentrated samples of supernatant from <italic>A. niger</italic> exposed to wheat straw, containing 55 &#x003bc;g of secreted proteins, released on average 0.096 mg of reducing end group equivalents per mg of wheat straw substrate (as measured by the DNS assay) whilst only 0.042 mg of reducing end group equivalents per mg of willow was released over the same time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Similarly the supernatant taken from <italic>A. niger</italic> exposed to willow (which contained an equivalent amount of protein to the supernatant assayed from <italic>A. niger</italic> exposed to straw) released 0.042 mg of reducing end group equivalents per mg of willow substrate, but only 0.030 mg was released per mg of wheat straw. These results show that the wheat straw-induced enzyme cocktail had over double the activity towards wheat straw than it does towards willow, and the willow-induced enzyme cocktail shows a 40% greater activity towards willow compared to wheat straw. Both of these differences are statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test). Use of the GODPOD assay for free glucose monomers present within the digest products showed a similar pattern to the DNS assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) at approximately one third of the levels seen in the DNS assay. These proportions may indicate that the primary target of degradative activity in the assays was hemicellulose rather than the glucose-rich cellulosic fraction or that a significant number of oligomers are being released. These assay values are comparable to those in other studies with similar methodologies [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>The lignocellulosic substrate used can have a specific effect on induction</title><p id="P30">The data presented in this study show that the lignocellulosic substrate used to induce the expression of genes encoding degradative enzymes can have a specific effect on the combination of enzymes produced. Wheat straw and willow induced a central core set of shared genes that are likely to be induced by a wide variety of lignocellulosic substrates, but also showed significant differences in the induction of genes encoding both particular GH families and individual genes. This is likely due to the integration of several different regulatory pathways that respond to either different inducing molecules present within the substrates, or else the differences in concentration or proportions of such inducing molecules. Such a system may have evolved to give <italic>A. niger</italic> the ability to adapt its degradative response to match the available substrate within its natural environment. Of the two ball-milled substrates compared in this study, wheat straw led to a larger scale response at the transcriptomic level that was matched by an increased concentration of proteins within the culture supernatant.</p><p id="P31">With regard to the enzyme activities, the straw-induced enzyme cocktail out-performed the willow-induced cocktail. As well as the wheat straw-induced cocktail saccharifying straw to a greater extent than the willow-induced cocktail, the straw-induced cocktail saccharified willow to the same extent as the willow-induced cocktail. Both cocktails released almost identical amounts of reducing end group equivalents from willow in the DNS assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The out-performing by the straw-induced cocktail of the willow-induced cocktail may reflect the intrinsically greater recalcitrance of a woody substrate such as willow over a gramineous substrate such as straw rather than differences in specificities of the cocktails. It is possible that any specificity in the willow-induced cocktail towards willow is masked by this greater recalcitrance of the willow substrate.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Effect of sugars initially present and released over time in the lignocellulose media</title><p id="P32">The insoluble polymers and soluble inducing molecules related to these polymers may not be the only factors leading to differences in gene expression. There may be a role for the higher amount of free glucose present initially and released in early time points from the willow media compared to the straw media by <italic>A. niger</italic>. This glucose could delay the onset of induction of CAZy genes longer than in the straw media due to CreA repression which would only be alleviated when the free glucose became exhausted. Sugar analysis showed that there was a greater amount of free glucose present initially and released from the substrate by <italic>A. niger</italic> over time in the willow media compared to the straw media (Additional file 5) [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Differences in the timing of transcriptional induction and enzyme secretion, as well as with fungal growth rate, could be investigated in future work with straw and willow substrates. This free glucose and other sugars, while a complicating factor in comparing the response to different substrates, are unavoidable because performing some form of extraction or washing of the lignocellulose substrate will likely remove other small soluble molecules relevant to induction. Even so, the level of free glucose in lignocellulosic substrates initially and released over time are variables to consider when comparing the fungal response to different lignocellulosic substrates. In the study reported here, the levels of free glucose at the outset were very low compared to the amount of fungal biomass added and would not support a significant increase in fungal biomass.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Non-CAZy responses to lignocellulose</title><p id="P33">In a previous wheat straw study, we identified 28 genes not categorised as members of any CAZy category that had significantly higher transcript levels in response to wheat straw, using a cut-off of a minimum 20-fold induction relative to expression in the glucose media [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We divided those genes into four defined categories, encoding: esterases and lipases, surface-interacting proteins, carbon and nitrogen metabolising enzymes, and transporters. The expression of these 28 genes was examined in <italic>A. niger</italic> after exposure to willow for 24 h (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref> and Additional file 1). Of the 7 genes included in the lipase/esterase category, four genes were induced significantly by at least 50-fold following the switch from glucose to willow media and were expressed at an RPKM of &#x0003e;10. Some of the encoded proteins have been biochemically characterised as possessing lignocellulosic degrading activity (e.g. the ferulic acid esterase, FaeA [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]). For two uncharacterised genes TID_173684 and TID_54865, our data support the notion that they could function in the degradation of lignocelluloses and are induced by a factor common to wheat straw and willow.</p><p id="P34">The surface-interacting proteins category consisted of 4 genes with two of these genes encoding hydrophobins, another gene (TID_188224) which is a homolog of a hydrophobic surface binding protein <italic>hsbA</italic> from <italic>A. oryzae</italic> [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and one gene (TID_54125) which encoded a protein with homology to a transmembrane protein Pth11p of <italic>Magnoporthe grisea</italic> [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. All of these four proteins have homology to proteins involved in the sensing of, or physical association with, hydrophobic surfaces and promotion of substrate degradation [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Transcripts from three of these genes had higher expression levels in the presence of willow as compared to glucose media, with the exception being the hydrophobin-encoding TID_128530. However, the only member of this category expressed on willow at an RPKM of &#x0003e;10 was TID_188224 at 721 RPKM, further supporting the hypothesis that this protein may play a role in fungal response to lignocellulose. Interestingly, the expression in response to willow was 32-fold greater than that to straw (DESeq, p &#x0003c; 0.01).</p><p id="P35">Of the carbon and nitrogen metabolising category, only 2 of the 5 genes had transcript levels raised by &#x0003e;20-fold by wheat straw and willow (TID_51997 and TID_52460). This, in a similar manner to the CAZy response, could reflect differences in composition of the substrates and the small metabolites released during their degradation. All genes within the transporters category had transcript levels raised &#x0003e;20-fold on willow. In our previous study with straw, five other genes were induced on straw but could not be easily categorised so we categorised as &#x02018;Others&#x02019;. One of these genes TID_120161, was induced on willow with expression &#x0003e; 10 RPKM.

Firstly, the inducing substrate used for the production of enzymes has marked effects upon the enzyme cocktail achieved highlighting the limitations of the use of simple inducing substrates for the generation of complex enzyme mixtures. Secondly, the relationship between the inducing substrate and the activity of the cocktail secreted from this induction is not straightforward. For example, the wheat straw-induced cocktail was more effective at saccharifying straw than the willow-induced cocktail but the willow-induced cocktail was not more effective as saccharifying willow than the wheat straw-induced cocktail. While the cost effectiveness of using simple inducing substrates together with de-repressed fungal strains cultured on glucose-containing media has clear attractions, fungi have an enzymatic capability that can currently best be realised with induction by complex substrates. As more detailed knowledge of the complexities of how fungi efficiently saccharify lignocelluloses emerges, it will become possible to incorporate that knowledge into production procedures for more efficient and complex enzymatic cocktails. Also, the effectiveness of wheat straw as a general inducing substrate compared with other potential biofuel feedstocks could also be explored. Wheat straw induces a robust response, with good activity towards a variety of cellulose and isolated hemi-cellulosic substrates as well as towards willow and wheat straw.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S16"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S17"><title>Substrate preparation</title><p id="P38">Short rotation coppice willow (<italic>Salix</italic> sp.)
