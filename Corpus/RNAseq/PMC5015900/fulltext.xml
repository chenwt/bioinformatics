virus and its host hinges on the ability of the virus to aggressively replicate in epithelial cells at the site of infection and transport into the nervous system through axons innervating the infection site. Interaction between the virus and the sensory neuron represents a pivot point where largely unknown mechanisms lead to a latent or a lytic infection in the neuron. Regulation at this pivot point is critical for balancing two objectives, efficient widespread seeding of the nervous system and host survival. By combining genetic and in vivo in approaches, our studies reveal that the balance between latent and lytic programs is a process occurring early in the trigeminal ganglion. Unexpectedly, activation of the latent program precedes entry into the lytic program by 12 -14hrs. Importantly, at the individual neuronal level, the lytic program begins as a transition out of this acute stage latent program and this escape from the default latent program is regulated by de novo VP16 expression. Our findings support a model in which regulated de novo VP16 expression in the neuron mediates entry into the lytic cycle during the earliest stages of virus infection in vivo. These findings support the hypothesis that the loose association of VP16 with the viral tegument combined with sensory axon length and transport mechanisms serve to limit arrival of virion associated VP16 into neuronal nuclei favoring latency. Further, our findings point to specialized features of the VP16 promoter that control the de novo expression of VP16 in neurons and this regulation is a key component in setting the balance between lytic and latent infections in the nervous system.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Herpes simplex virus remains a significant human pathogen associated with extensive acute and chronic disease in humans worldwide. The virus invades the peripheral and central nervous systems where it replicates but also establishes life-long latent infections in neurons. Two distinct viral transcriptional programs support these distinct lifestyles, but how entry into either the lytic or latent programs is regulated in the neuron is not understood. This process is fundamentally important to a virus with the capacity to be extremely virulent, in balancing two objectives, efficient widespread seeding of the nervous system and host survival. In this report, we provide new insight into this regulation and data that support a novel model in which virus transported into the neuron from the body surface enters the latent program by default. In a subset of these, there is a transition into the lytic cycle, which requires VP16 transactivation and is gated by a region in the VP16 promoter. Thus, HSV takes advantage of the anatomy and axonal transport systems in sensory neurons so that VP16 is left behind and latency is favored, while features of the VP16 promoter insure adequate virus spread in the nervous system and maximized latent infections.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI093614</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sawtell</surname><given-names>Nancy M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI116389</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>Richard L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the national Institutes of Health under award numbers RO1AI093614 to NMS, Ph.D. and R21AI116389 to RLT, Ph.D. The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

Despite safe and effective antiviral treatment for limiting viral replication, the numbers of infected individuals continues to increase. The expansive reservoir of HSV genetic information is maintained unaffected by current antivirals within the nervous system of every infected individual. This reservoir of latent viral genomes fuels transmission, sporadically giving rise to infectious virus shed to surface sites [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Understanding how the virus establishes latent infections is an important goal for the development of new treatment strategies. Although progress has been made, the core mechanism(s) underlying the latent/lytic balance are yet to be defined.</p><p>The HSV life cycle is complex, interacting in a series of distinct and temporally shifting host cellular environments. Infection of a host at a mucosal surface and pursuant replication results in viral invasion of the innervating sensory nerve termini and transport to the sensory neurons in the ganglion. Viral replication occurs in the ganglion and at the periphery but is resolved within about 10 days. This acute stage of HSV infection is followed by a lifelong latent infection, primarily marked by the absence of signs of infection. Thus lytic and latent viral programs appear to be temporally distinct features of the viral life cycle. However, following the identification of the latent program promoter (LATp) [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and generation of viruses carrying a LATp reporter gene [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], it became evident that during the acute stage of infection in the TG, both viral programs were represented in the population of infected neurons [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These findings revealed that viral program selection in the TG neuron was more complex and regulated in ways that were not understood. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this dichotomy, including neuronal type [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], transition from some lytic gene expression into the latent program [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and alternative regulation of gene expression [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, while progress has been made, the mechanism underlying this complexity remains unclear. Recent findings indicate that the virion transactivator protein, VP16, may play a pivotal role in these processes [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>VP16 is an essential viral tegument protein required for virion morphogenesis [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In infected cell cultures VP16 also provides an important role in initiating the viral lytic cycle at low multiplicity of infection (moi), increasing plaquing efficiency 10&#x02013;1000 fold in a cell type dependent manner [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. VP16 has a potent carboxy-terminal acidic activation domain and an upstream core domain region that interacts with host cell proteins HCF and Oct-1 to form a VP16 induced complex (VIC) [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] (for review see [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). These host cell partners are required for binding of the VIC to the TAATGARAT motifs unique to 5 viral immediate early (IE) gene promoters [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The possibility that latency in neurons is linked to the regulation of VP16 function, either through its absence (e.g. VP16 does not reach the neuronal nucleus or there is strict nonnuclear compartmentalization of essential co-activators), or its conversion from an activator to a repressor through altered neuronal cofactor interactions (e.g. HCF-2, Oct-2 or Brn3) have been proposed [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In an influential study, attempts to perturb the establishment of latent infections utilizing strategies to induce VP16 expression in infected TG failed [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and reactivation (in an ex vivo setting) was not dependent upon VP16 transactivation function [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], limiting enthusiasm for the hypothesis that VP16 functioned as a central regulator in latency and reactivation in vivo. At this time, an alternate viral protein, IE gene ICP0, became the focus of intense investigation as possibly initiating reactivation. The ability of ICP0 to induce modifications of the histone codes on quiescent/latent viral genomes from those associated with repression to those associated with derepression and induce the transcription of reporter promoters in tissue culture models make it an attractive candidate (recently reviewed in [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>In more recent studies, two distinct VP16 transactivation deficient mutants failed to exit latency in vivo, both blocked at a very early stage prior to viral protein synthesis [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In addition, evidence that de novo expression of VP16 may be required for viral replication in neurons during the acute stage of infection has also been reported [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In cultured neurons strong evidence that VP16 dissociates from the nucleocapsid prior to retrograde transport into the nucleus favoring quiescence (latency) has been published [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] although alternate mechanisms of retrograde transport of VP16 occur that can induce viral replication [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>The design of experiments to test the functions of VP16, ICP0 or other factors in the latent/lytic decision is not straightforward. Infection of neurons in the TG is highly asynchronous, with new infections and superinfections occurring in the TG from virus transported from the surface over multiple days. Thus studies of the temporal expression patterns in neurons are difficult to interpret. Already by 32&#x02013;36 hrs pi, infectious virus is detectable in the TG [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and when examined at 3 days pi, neurons undergoing productive lytic infection were found temporally and spatially distributed among neurons in which the viral latent program was activated [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. At very early times pi, extremely few trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons are infected. For these reasons classic single cell based measures such as immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization on tissue sections, or bulk analyses such as quantitative reverse transcription PCR, proteomic approaches and RNAseq cannot adequately address these important questions.</p><p>In this study we sought to overcome these difficulties by employing viral mutants expressing reporter proteins from viral promoters of diverse kinetic classes or viral transcriptional regulators expressed from the LAT promoter, combined with whole ganglion histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques. This permits the interrogation of the earliest events in TG neurons infected from the body surface in the context of essentially wild type virus infection at the single neuron level. In addition whether select viral proteins are sufficient to alter the balance between latent and lytic infection in neurons in vivo can be determined.</p><p>Our findings reveal that the balance between latent and lytic programs in individual neurons is (i) observable, (ii) that entry into the latent program is the default (occurs first), (iii) the lytic cycle begins as a transition out of this early latent program, (iv) VP16 can play a dominant role in this transition, and (v) the VP16 promoter contains elements dispensable in cultured cells and corneas, but required for efficient transition out of the default latent program and productive lytic infection in neurons. Importantly, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized transition occurring in individual neurons. This transition from latent into lytic programs is gated, at least in part, by de novo VP16 expression and emphasizes the importance of the novel regulation of this gene during acute infection of sensory neurons in vivo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Strategy for testing the outcome of de novo expression of VP16 in trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons</title><p>We exploited the properties of the basal latency associated transcript promoter (LATp) to express selected open reading frames from the viral genome. Prior studies demonstrated that the (LATp) (driving expression of the E. coli beta galactosidase gene (LacZ)) is silenced in the context of infection in cultured cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. However, in the mouse corneal model, as early as day 3 pi, this promoter is active in a population of trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons which are largely devoid of viral proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Importantly, this promoter contains neuronal specific elements, and an ICP4 binding site that down regulates its activity very early in the lytic cycle [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. These features provide for a viral platform in which an open reading frame driven by the LATp would fail to express during lytic infection (and thus would not alter the normal lytic cycle) but would express de novo (in the absence of an ongoing lytic cycle) in a population of TG neurons. Since our focus in these studies is neurons that have entered the latent program during the acute stage of infection (in contrast to the common use of &#x0201c;latent&#x0201d; at times &#x0003e;30days pi), we will designate this as acute stage latent program to avoid confusion.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Design of viral mutants and functional assessment of constructs</title><p>The design of the viral mutants is shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005877.g001">Fig 1</xref>.

However, it is possible that the LATp is leaky in neurons and that the effects of a second copy of VP16 expressed early in the lytic cycle could confound the interpretation of in vivo studies.

We analyzed relative promoter strengths in cultured cells with transient assays utilizing the promoter/reporter constructs that were employed to generate promoter/reporter viruses. As previously reported, the LacZ ORF was cloned behind the immediate early ICP0 gene promoter (ICP0p) [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], the leaky late UL48 gene promoter (VP16p) [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] or the basal LATp as detailed in methods. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005877.g004">Fig 4A</xref> the ICP0p was slightly stronger than the VP16p promoter and both lytic phase promoters were stronger than the basal LATp. One caveat is that VP16 protein would be carried into the cell in the virion tegument. To mimic this condition an additional plasmid expressing VP16 from the human CMV IE gene promoter was added to the transfections. The order of the relative strengths of the promoters remained the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005877.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The addition of VP16 increased expression from the ICP0 promoter, but had no significant effect on the VP16p or LATp. In vivo in TG neurons findings were similar in that it required more time for blue color to develop in TG infected with 17LATpLacZ than did TG infected with either 17ICP0pLacZ or 17VP16pLacZ. While only semi-quantitative this is consistent with the relative activity of the promoters in transient assays. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005877.g004">Fig 4</xref>, LacZ expression from the lytic promoters coincided with detection of viral proteins, suggesting the native and reporter promoters behaved similarly and that the moderate difference between the strengths of the ICP0 and VP16 promoters did not affect detection on the time scale employed here.</p><fig id="ppat.1005877.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1005877.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Quantification of viral lytic and acute stage latency gene transcription in individual neurons at very early times pi.</title><p>A.

These findings offer compelling support for the idea that in sensory neurons infected from the body surface HSV first enters the latent transcriptional pathway and expresses the LAT locus. About 12&#x02013;14 hrs later a portion of the LAT expressing neurons transition from this acute stage latent program into the lytic transcriptional pathway (the dual labeled neurons) while other neurons remain b-gal positive only (e.g. remain in the latent transcriptional program).

Three independent mutants were generated and characterized for replication in vitro and in vivo. These mutants exhibited phenotypes like 17VP16p&#x003c0;RR (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005877.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Mice were infected with 17VP16p&#x003c0;RR+LATpLacZ and 17LATpLacZ as above and at 44 hrs pi, TG were harvested and processed for the simultaneous detection of b-gal and viral proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005877.g006">Fig 6</xref>). At this time 12/12 TG were positive for b-gal with 17 or more neurons positive per TG. This was not different than the results for 17LATpLacZ (p = 0.16, Student&#x02019;s t test). A small number of neurons (&#x0003c;3) were positive for viral protein in 7/12 TG from 17VP16p&#x003c0;RR+LATpLacZ infected mice, and these all showed evidence of LATp activity. In contrast, 10/10 TG with an average of 12.6 neurons/TG were viral protein positive in the 17LATpLacZ infected group (p&#x0003c;0.0001, Student&#x02019;s t test). While the total numbers of neurons evidencing expression from the viral genome (either viral proteins or b-gal) were similar between the two groups (362 and 350, respectively) the percentage of neurons that had transitioned from the early latent program into the lytic program, was very different, 33% for 17LATpLacZ and only 2% for 17VP16p&#x003c0;RR+LATpLacZ. At this time, a small number of neurons (total of 3) in which blue could not be visualized were detected in the 17LATpLacZ infected TG. Whether these represent loss of blue or a separate population is not clear. These findings do indicate that because similar numbers of LATp positive neurons were observed in 17VP16&#x003c0;RR+LATpLacZ and 17LATpLacZ, that the failure of the 17VP16&#x003c0;RR promoter mutants to replicate in the TG is <italic>not</italic> a result of a defect in transport to the TG. Combined our results indicate that de novo expression of VP16 mediated through sequences in a specific region of the VP16 promoter is a major determinant of whether neurons transition into productive lytic infection during the acute stage of infection.</p><fig id="ppat.1005877.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1005877.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>The VP16 promoter contains a region required for efficient exit from the default latent state.</title><p>Mice were infected on scarified corneas with 2x10<sup>5</sup> pfu of (A) 17LATpLacZ or (B) 17VP16&#x003c0;RR+LATpLacZ.

Entry into the lytic program occurs as a transition out of this default latent state which is gated by de novo VP16 expression. Importantly, perturbing this natural virus/host determined balance, as we did by expressing VP16 directly from the LATp, reveals the significance of the evolved strategy of VP16 regulation in the viral life cycle. Three lines of evidence underpin this model. First, activation of the latent program in TG neurons infected from the corneal surface precedes activation of the lytic program by 12&#x02013;14 hrs. Importantly our studies revealed that at the individual neuronal level, the lytic program begins as a transition out of this early acute stage latent program. This temporal pattern of viral transcription in neurons is consistent with the view that the potent transactivator VP16 packaged in the virion tegument does not reach neuronal nuclei concomitantly with the viral genome, thus promoting entry into the latent program [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The possibilities that in the neuronal context, VP16 is sequestered in the cytoplasm [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], or the required coactivators are absent [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] are not consistent with the robust phenotype observed when VP16 but not the VP16 transactivation function (TF) deficient mutant is expressed de novo (from the LATp) in the neuron. While we have not formally demonstrated at the single neuron level that the viral protein expression marking the transition out of the latent program reflects productive viral replication, low levels of infectious virus can be detected in the TG at this time. Since these are the only HSV protein positive cells, it is reasonable to assume that these neurons are the source of the infectious virus detected. Third, we have identified a region downstream of the VP16 TATA box that regulates exit from the acute stage latent state. A bioinformatics analysis revealed three potential combinatorial sites known to confer reciprocal regulation on stress responsive neuronal genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005877.g005">Fig 5</xref>). A total of 13 nucleotide changes in three potential regulatory elements within this ~170 bp region results in viral mutants that replicate like wild type in cultured cells and in mouse eyes. However, these mutants fail to shift efficiently out of the acute stage latent state resulting in ~100 fold reduction in viral titers in TG.</p><p>The timing, number, and viral expression pattern of TG neurons infected from the corneal surface (at times prior to viral spread within the TG) confirmed the expected asynchrony of infection of TG neurons (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005877.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005877.g006">6</xref>). However, our analysis is a compilation of &#x0201c;snap shots&#x0201d; over time and thus a sequence of events in any particular neuron can be inferred but not proven. The fact that the LAT promoter is strongly repressed by ICP4 in cells including neurons during acute infection [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], allows us to conclude with some confidence that the viral protein expression observed at these early times pi occurs in neurons transitioning out of the acute stage latent program into the lytic cycle. Our findings point to the regulation of de novo VP16 expression as an important component in gating the transition from the acute latent state into the lytic program. However, the temporal lag of 12&#x02013;14 hrs suggests that additional factors influence this outcome. Increasing numbers of viral genomes feeding into these neurons as lytic infection progresses at the surface is a likely factor. We propose that i) the preIE regulatory region of the VP16 promoter is skewed toward &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; and ii) a context related threshold, potentially viral genome copy number and/or neuronal subtype related factors [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] ultimately flips the de novo regulation of VP16 to the &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; position. Mutation of the preIE region of the VP16 promoter results in the dramatic reduction in VP16 expression and viral replication selectively in the TG (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005877.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005877.g006">6</xref>), although this is not absolute. We also know that the requirement for VP16TF is not absolute in so far as transactivation deficient mutants do replicate to some extent in TG albeit ~100 fold reduced [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. High genome copy number could potentially override a requirement for VP16TF and this is supported by the finding that strategies increasing surface replication also increase replication in the TG [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>Viral proteins that can shift the balance from latent to lytic infection are of great interest because their identification yields insights into the mechanisms governing the lytic/latent switch and represent targets for novel therapies. By expressing extra copies of ICP0 or VP16 from the basal LAT promoter we tested the ability of these proteins to precipitate productive lytic viral replication in neurons in which the acute latent program would be starting. A comparable experimental design has not previously been reported, however superinfection of dissociated cells from latently infected ganglia with adenovirus constructs expressing ICP0 or VP16 [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] suggests that both of these proteins can induce HSV reactivation from latency in vitro. Surprisingly, we found that the de novo expression of VP16, but not that of ICP0 resulted in measurable phenotypic differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005877.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Possible technical issues, including genomic rearrangement and/or instability of ICP0, nonfunctional ICP0, and ICP0 silencing by viral microRNAs were systematically ruled out. However, further experimentation is needed before the lack of effect of ICP0 in this context can be fully interpreted as at least one host microRNA can target ICP0 [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>].</p><p>We recently published evidence that de novo synthesis of VP16 is required prior to detectable viral protein synthesis during exit from the latent state [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which is also the case in quiescently infected (latent) neuronal cultures [<xref rid="ppat.1005877.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Combined with the results presented here we conclude that VP16 protein expression is a dominant nexus regulating the boundary between latency and lytic infection of neurons at all stages of the complex natural history of HSV infection. We hypothesize the VP16 promoter has evolved to strike a balance between three critical tasks (i) to maximize the establishment of latent infections, (ii) to limit the involvement of the central nervous system and resulting neurovirulence, and (iii) to control viral reactivation frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005877.g007">Fig 7</xref>). It is likely that the probability of productive infection of neurons infected from the body surface, or during reactivation from latency is greatly enhanced by the coordinated expression of the five viral immediate early genes.</p><fig id="ppat.1005877.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1005877.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Regulation of de novo VP16 expression in neurons controls the exit from the default acute stage latent transcriptional program.</title><p>Rectangular panels showing viral program usage in TG neurons at 22, 36, and 44 hours pi.

These viruses display wild type replication and virulence properties. Left panel: Disruption of the pre-immediate early regulatory region of the VP16 promoter, mutant 17VP16p&#x003c0;RR+LATpLacZ. Similar to WT numbers of neurons positive for the latent transcription program are seen at 22 hrs pi but the number of neurons transitioning into the lytic viral transcription program is reduced to 2%. These mutants replicate normally on eyes, but as would be expected from the reduced transition into the lytic cycle, replicate poorly in the TG and virulence was not observed. Right panel: Expression of VP16 from the LAT promoter, mutant 17LATpVP16. Expression of VP16 directly upon engagement of the latent transcription program results in entry into the lytic cycle in neurons at 22 hrs pi. Neurons continue to enter the lytic transcription program and viral replication in the nervous system and virulence are increased.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1005877.g007"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec017"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec018"><title>Viral strains/mutants and stock production</title><p>Stocks of HSV-1 strain 17syn+ (originally obtained from John H.
