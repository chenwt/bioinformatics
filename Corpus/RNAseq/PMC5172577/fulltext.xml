Such transgenic &#x02018;reporter&#x02019; parasites have proven to be useful tools to interrogate <italic>Plasmodium</italic> gene function, examine the effect of inhibitors on parasite development, to evaluate sub-unit vaccine efficacy <italic>in vivo</italic> and to rank order and evaluate live-attenuated parasite vaccines [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For rodent malaria parasites technologies have been developed to stably introduce transgenes into the parasite genome and efficient and rapid methods exist for the generation of reporter parasite lines that do not contain drug-selectable markers [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168362.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Such &#x02018;marker-free&#x02019; parasites make it considerably easier to further genetically modify transgenic parasites and, moreover, they can be used for drug-sensitivity testing, as possible interference from an introduced drug-selection marker is absent. In rodent malaria parasites such reporter parasite lines have been generated in multiple strains of three different <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>In comparison to rodent malaria parasites the technologies to genetically modify the human malaria parasite, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>, are much less efficient [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and the number of stable reporter parasite lines in different <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> strains is limited [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168362.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, currently no cloned reporter lines have been published that are drug-selectable marker free. The traditional approaches to engineer the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> genome have been hampered by the limited methods available and transfection inefficiencies in introducing exogenous DNA into the parasite genome. Also the limited number of drug-selectable markers restricts genetic engineering of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>, for example, performing sequential genetic manipulations in the same parasite line. Several technologies have been developed for the removal (re-cycling) of drug-selectable markers from the modified parasite genome, specifically using either FLP or Cre recombinases [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168362.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the application of these techniques are time consuming as it can take 4&#x02013;5 months to generate cloned &#x02018;marker-free&#x02019; genetically modified parasites.</p><p>The RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) system has transformed genome editing in a wide variety of organisms [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This powerful genome editing technique has also been applied to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> and provides an efficient method to manipulate the parasite&#x02019;s genome, such as site directed mutagenesis, gene disruption and the introduction of transgenes [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168362.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The CRISPR/Cas9 method is based on the initial generation of site-specific double strand DNA break induced by a Cas9 endonuclease and subsequent repair and modification of the DNA locus. The Cas9 enzyme is guided to a specific site in the genome by a single guide RNA (sgRNA) that can be modified to specify the exact DNA sequence within the genome. The presence of a template or &#x02018;donor DNA&#x02019; that contains sequences surrounding the double stranded DNA break can result in guided (or homology directed) repair, resulting of introduction of donor DNA at the site of the break [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Frequently a two plasmid approach is used to introduce Cas9, the single guide RNA (sgRNA) composed of a fusion between CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA), and donor DNA into the nucleus of the organism. <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> transfections have been performed with Cas9 and sgRNA either expressed on two separate plasmids or combined on one plasmid and different selectable markers have been used to maintain the plasmids in transformed parasites after transfection [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168362.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168362.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The selectable markers used are human dihydrofolate reductase (h<italic>dhfr</italic>), blasticidin S deaminase (<italic>bsd</italic>), neomycin phosphotransferase (<italic>neo</italic>) and yeast cytosine deaminase/uridyl phosphoribosyl transferase (y<italic>fcu</italic>). Generation of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> transgenic reporter parasites would benefit from the availability of standard CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids that permit the rapid introduction of different transgenes into the parasite genome without permanently integrating a drug-selectable marker cassette. Recently improved CRISPR/Cas9 constructs have been reported for marker-free editing of the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> genome [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. One plasmid contains Cas9, the sgRNA and a <italic>bsd</italic> selectable marker cassette, whereas the other construct, containing the donor DNA, does not encode a drug selectable marker. The use of this &#x02018;marker-free&#x02019; construct thus can permit an introduction of larger donor DNA sequences. Using these constructs marker-free GFP-expressing parasites have been reported.</p><p>In this paper we describe the generation of marker-free reporter parasites by using modified CRISPR/Cas9 constructs compared to the constructs described in previous studies. We generated a standard plasmid that encodes Cas9 and contains the <italic>bsd</italic> selection marker cassette. The sgRNA and donor DNA are both present on a second plasmid, which contains the positive selectable marker, h<italic>dhfr</italic>, fused to the negative selectable marker, y<italic>fcu</italic>. This dual positive-negative selectable marker cassette is not integrated into the genome but is used to rapidly select &#x02018;marker-free&#x02019; transgenic parasites by the successive application of positive drug selection followed by negative selection. By generating three reporter lines which stably express GFP under the control of different promoters we show that cloned marker-free reporter parasite lines can be obtained within a period of 10&#x02013;12 weeks. In addition, we show that these reporter parasites have the same <italic>in vitro</italic> blood-stage growth kinetics and drug-sensitivity profiles as the parental wild-type parasites and we compared the relative strengths of the different promoters to drive GFP expression. The constructs and selection protocol described in this study provide a simple set of tools to rapidly generate modified <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> lines, in particular transgenic parasites that can be used to examine different <italic>Plasmodium</italic> regulatory elements to control transgene expression. The same constructs can be used to perform other genetic modifications, for example gene disruption or gene mutation, to interrogate gene function and can be used to perform rapid and multiple successive genetic manipulations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Improved CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids to introduce transgenes into the Plasmodium genome without the addition of drug selectable markers</title><p>Homologous recombination using the CRISPR/Cas9 protocol requires introduction of the Cas9 endonuclease complexes with a sgRNA and DNA sequences (donor DNA) that will induce a double stranded break in the genome and then repair the target region. Often these different elements are present on two different plasmids encoding different drug-selectable markers. To introduce Cas9 we used the plasmid described by Ghorbal <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

The Cas9 construct contains the <italic>bsd</italic> selectable marker. The sgRNA/donor construct contains a fusion of the positive selectable marker h<italic>dhfr</italic> and the negative selectable marker y<italic>fcu</italic> genes and two homology regions (HR1 and HR2) that target a gene of interest (GOI) and introduce the donor DNA by homologous recombination. Double positive selection using both BSD and WR99210 is applied from day (d) 1 resulting in the selection of parasites that contain both plasmids within a period of 3 weeks (w). After positive selection, cultures are maintained 2&#x02013;4 days without drug before negative selection is applied using 5-FC to select parasites free of episomal plasmid DNA. Parasites are genotyped by diagnostic PCR for integration of the donor DNA followed by cloning of the parasites by limiting dilution (w6). Clones are genotyped for the correct genotype by diagnostic PCR and Southern analysis. This transfection and selection protocol can result in the generation of cloned mutant parasites within a period of 11 weeks.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0168362.g001"/></fig><p>A second plasmid (pLf0022) was generated that both contains the donor DNA, the sgRNA expression cassette and drug-selectable marker. For sgRNA we used the expression cassette of the published plasmid pL6-eGFP [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which contains the BtgZ1 adaptor sequence and the tracrRNA sequence under control of the <italic>Plasmodium u6</italic> RNA promoter. The drug-selectable marker cassette we used is a fusion of the positive selectable marker h<italic>dhfr</italic> (human dihydrofolate reductase), and the negative selectable marker y<italic>fcu</italic> (<italic>yeast cytosine deaminase/uridyl phosphoribosyl transferase</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This fusion gene, h<italic>dhfr</italic>::y<italic>fcu</italic>, was placed under control of the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum hsp86</italic> promoter and the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei dhfr/ts</italic> transcriptional terminator (3&#x02019;UTR) and the positive-negative drug selection marker was tested in a transient transfection drug-sensitivity assay. In this assay, parasites of the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> NF54 line were transiently transfected with a circular plasmid (pLf0033; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168362.s001">S1A Fig</xref>) encoding the h<italic>dhfr</italic>::y<italic>fc</italic> fusion protein and were treated with either WR99210 (positive) or 5-FC (negative) for 12&#x02013;16 days. The transiently transfected parasites treated with WR99210 exhibit a growth rate comparable to untreated NF54 wild type parasites <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168362.s001">S1B Fig</xref>), whereas treatment with negative drug selection (using 5-FC) killed transfected parasites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168362.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). The h<italic>dhfr</italic>::y<italic>fcu</italic> fusion cassette therefore confers both resistance to WR99210 and sensitivity to 5-FC and can be used efficiently for positive and negative selection in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> transfections. We reasoned that by applying first positive selection (with BSD and WR99210) followed by negative selection (with 5-Fluorocytosine, 5-FC), would improve the selection of parasites where the donor DNA had been integrated into the genome. Specifically, applying first positive selection will select for parasites that contained both plasmids, resulting in a DNA break followed by donor DNA mediated repair of the target locus. Once parasites were visible in blood stage cultures we applied negative selection to select only parasites free of episomal plasmid DNA. Moreover, we placed the selectable marker fusion cassette outside the donor DNA cassette in the plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168362.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This location permits the introduction of donor DNA sequences into the target locus without the introduction of a drug-selectable marker into the parasite genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168362.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The fusion of the positive and negative selectable marker cassette also reduces the size of the overall plasmid compared to a construct where both selectable markers were controlled by separate regulatory elements.

Before CRISPR/Cas9, modifications of the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> genome, such as gene disruption or mutation or the introduction of transgenes into the genome, required 1&#x02013;3 months of continuous culture to select for parasites in which episomally maintained plasmids became integrated into the parasite&#x02019;s genome, either by single or by double cross-over recombination [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Further, the process of generating cloned genetically modified and drug-selectable marker-free parasites would typically take 5 months or more to complete [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. With the methods described here we are able to generate cloned marker-free parasite lines that stably express reporter proteins within a period of 10&#x02013;12 weeks.</p><p>The constructs we have generated can be modified and used in future studies as template constructs to remove or introduce transgenes into the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> genome, for example they could be used to generate reporter lines that express additional (fluorescent/bioluminescent) reporter proteins or used to analyse the regulatory elements that control <italic>Plasmodium</italic> gene expression.</p><p>In addition the sgRNA/donor DNA construct can be adapted to permit the introduction of transgenes into other <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> genetic loci by adapting the homology regions in the donor plasmid, or the construct can be modified to introduce other transgene (e.g. reporter) expression cassettes under the control of a variety of regulatory promoter and transcription terminator (5&#x02019;- and 3&#x02019;- UTR) regions. All the plasmids and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> mutant lines described in this study are available on request.</p><p>In the sgRNA/donor plasmid we have placed the selectable marker cassette outside the donor DNA cassette which then does not result in the introduction of the selectable marker into the parasite genome upon repair of the target locus. Hence the locus can be modified without the inclusion of a selectable marker cassette. The same type of constructs can also be used to perform other genetic manipulations, notably gene-disruption and gene-mutations, which can be used to interrogate gene function and importance. As a consequence of the absence of a drug-selectable marker in the genome of the mutants, these constructs can be adapted and used to create rapid successive genetic modifications in the same parasite line. For example, &#x02018;doubly&#x02019; modified parasites that contain both a reporter gene as well as a disrupted (or mutated) gene. Such rodent malaria mutants have been used extensively to analyse the phenotypic consequences of a gene disruption/mutation using a variety of imaging technologies. Moreover, our transfection protocol permits for a more rapid generation of multiply modified parasites since it is possible to further transfect the uncloned population of a modified parasite (after parasite emerge from negative selection). With the high transfection efficiencies we observe in our transfection protocol, combined with the rounds of positive and negative selection, it is possible to create cloned and SM free, doubly transgenic parasites in the same time (~5 months) it would have taken to create a single SM-free genetic modification in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> using conventional approaches. Indeed a cloned <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> double gene deletion mutant (Pf&#x00394;<italic>mrp1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>mrp2</italic>), which still contained a drug-selectable marker, has been recently reported and it required 3 independent transfections, 2 rounds of cloning, 1 round of SM recycling and took nearly a year to generate [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>To select for parasites with the donor DNA integrated into the genome we made use of a selectable marker cassette containing a fusion gene of the human dihydrofolate reductase (h<italic>dhfr</italic>) positive selectable marker and a negative selectable marker, the bifunctional protein that combines yeast cytosine deaminase and uridyl phosphoribosyl transferase (y<italic>fcu</italic>). Negative selection based on yFCU expression has been used for both for genetic modification of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and for rodent malaria parasites [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The drug 5-FC efficiently kills parasites that express <italic>y</italic>FCU both in <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures and <italic>in vivo</italic> in laboratory animals. We established that the positive/negative selectable marker (h<italic>dhfr</italic>::y<italic>fcu</italic>) cassette was functional in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> by transiently transfecting parasites with a plasmid (pLf0033) containing the h<italic>dhfr</italic>::y<italic>fcu</italic> fusion cassette and obtaining parasites using positive drug (WR99210) selection, followed by the application of negative drug (5-FC) selection that killed the parasites demonstrating that they were sensitive to this drug. In the CRISPR/Cas9 method described here, we apply negative selection to kill parasites that still retain the sgRNA/donor plasmid DNA, enriching for the population of parasites where the donor DNA has integrated into the parasite&#x02019;s genome. Negative selection will also not kill &#x02018;wild type&#x02019; parasites that are still present in the population, i.e. parasites that had lost the donor DNA construct without an integration event. From the ratio of GFP-positive and GFP-negative parasites present in the cultures after negative selection, as well as the results of cloning, we found that percentage of stable transgenic parasites was in excess of 50% and therefore the presence of wild type parasites appeared not to be an obstacle for obtaining the desired mutants. It has also been reported that homologous repair mediated by a donor DNA in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> after CRISPR/Cas9 transfection appears to more efficient than parasite mediated non-homologous end joining repair of DNA, which therefore favours the selection of transgenic parasites over either wild type parasites or parasites that have repaired the double strand break through the introduction of a site specific frame shift [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

By comparing RNAseq data of blood stages we selected three genes with expression levels higher than <italic>eef1&#x003b1;</italic>, a promoter that has been previously used to generate GFP-expressing reporter <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> lines [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168362.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We found that the <italic>cam</italic> promoter resulted in relatively weak GFP-expression compared to <italic>gapdh</italic> and <italic>hsp70</italic> which is in agreement with the RNAseq data. GAPDH is an enzyme involved in glycolysis, the main pathway for ATP production in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and therefore this protein is likely to be expressed throughout the complete life cycle. Indeed proteome analyses of oocysts and sporozoites provide evidence for high abundance of GAPDH in these stages (PlasmoDB; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plasmodb.org/">www.plasmodb.org</ext-link>). Therefore, we believe, that this promoter can be a useful tool to drive transgene expression throughout the complete life cycle.</p><p>Currently several CRISPR/Cas9 methods using two plasmid based strategies have been described for <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> genetic modification. The constructs described in Ghorbal <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] like our study, have both the sgRNA and donor sequences on one plasmid. In contrast to our method, the use of these constructs result in generation of mutants, both deletion mutants and transgenics, that carry a drug selectable marker into their genome. This method has the advantage that there is no need for negative selection to remove parasites that retain the plasmid. While in the Ghorbal <italic>et al</italic>. study marker free point mutation mutants have been generated, it is unclear if their constructs could be used for complete gene deletion or a large genetic insertion without inclusion of a drug selectable marker. As both our and the Ghorbal <italic>et al</italic>. method have the <italic>cas9</italic> gene introduced on a separate plasmid, only one plasmid has to be modified for each subsequent modification (i.e. changing the sgRNA and/or donor sequences) and therefore multiple <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> genes can be targeted using a pool of constructs in a single transfection experiment. Consequently, multiple mutants can be obtained from a single transfection experiment. In contrast the method described by Lu <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], where the sgRNA and donor sequences are on separate plasmids, requires both plasmids to be modified to create an additional gene modification/disruption. However the strategy described by Lu et al, where the donor DNA is on a separate plasmid, allows for the introduction of larger DNA inserts into the parasite&#x02019;s genome.</p><p>When we examined clones from the 3 different transgene mutants 57&#x02013;66% had the expected genotype. The other clones were WT clones or, more commonly, clones where the donor construct appears to integrate into the parasite genome by single cross-over recombination. While &#x02018;single cross-over&#x02019; parasites retain the h<italic>dhfr</italic>::y<italic>fcu</italic> SM a reduction in sensitivity to 5-FC is expected, due to reduction of h<italic>dhfr</italic>::y<italic>fcu</italic> copies in the genome compared to parasites containing multiple episomal plasmids. A reduction in the selection of the clones with the undesired genotype can be accomplished by increasing the 5-FC concentration during selection and/or by increasing the expression of the h<italic>dhfr</italic>::y<italic>fcu</italic> SM, for example by replacing the promoter of the SM (<italic>Pfhsp86</italic>) with that of a more highly expressed gene (e.g. <italic>Pfhsp70</italic>). This is particularly important when a gene deletion may result in a growth defect (unlike <italic>Pf230p</italic>) and WT parasites may &#x02018;over grow&#x02019; the deletion mutant.</p><p>In summary, we have created improved constructs and describe an efficient transfection protocol to create modified <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> parasites and these reporter parasites are suitable for further genetic modifications since they are SM-free. Improving the ability to perform genetic manipulations, including making it easier to perform successive gene-deletions and gene-mutations, will not only be of value to interrogate parasite gene function but also for the development of multiple attenuated malaria parasites suitable for vaccination [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Parasites and <italic>in vitro</italic> cultivation of blood stages</title><p><italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> parasites from the NF54 strain [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] were obtained from the Radboud University Medical Center (Nijmegen, The Netherlands).

Five &#x003bc;l of the preparation was mounted on a microscopic slide under a cover slip to visualize the parasites by Hoechst and GFP fluorescence using a Leica fluorescence MDR microscope (100x magnification). Pictures were recorded with a DC500 digital camera microscope using Leica LAS X software and with the following exposure times: GFP 0.7 s; Hoechst 0.136 s; bright field 0.62 s (1x gain).</p><p>The relative GFP-fluorescence intensity of different asexual blood stages was analysed by flow cytometry. Triplicate samples of 100 &#x003bc;l of infected RBC were collected from cultures that had been synchronized with sorbitol and cultured in the semi-automated <italic>in vitro</italic> system. Samples were collected at 30 and 42 h after synchronization and resuspended in 1 ml of culture medium containing 5% serum. Cells were stained with the DNA-specific dye Hoechst33258 by adding 20 &#x003bc;l of a 500 &#x003bc;M stock-solution to a final concentration of 10 &#x003bc;M [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Staining was performed for 30 min. at 37&#x000b0;C. GFP and Hoechst fluorescence intensity was determined using a LSRII flowcytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA, USA) and the data was analysed using FlowJo software (Treestar, Ashland, OR, USA). 100.000 cells were analysed per sample and RBC were selected by gating on FSC and SSC. Doublets are excluded by using FSC-Area and FSC-height parameters. Excitation of cells for Hoechst33258 was performed with a UV laser (355 nm) and band pass filter 450/50 nm and for GFP with a blue laser (488 nm) and a band pass filter of 530/30 nm. The GFP fluorescence intensity was determined of the haploid blood stages (rings and trophozoites; Gate 1) and polyploid blood stages (schizonts; Gate 2). Haploid and polyploid blood stages were distinguished based on Hoechst-fluorescence intensity [<xref rid="pone.0168362.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Data generation was performed using the FACS DIVA software (Becton Dickinson) and analysed with FlowJo software.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0168362.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Drug sensitivity of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites expressing the <italic>hdhfr</italic>::<italic>yfcu</italic> fusion cassette.</title><p>A.
