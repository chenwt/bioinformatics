CLIC4 is predominantly soluble and traffics between the cytoplasm and nucleus and participates in cell cycle control and differentiation. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-&#x003b2;) elevates CLIC4, which enhances TGF-&#x003b2; signaling through CLIC4 mediated stabilization of phospho-Smad2/3. CLIC4 is essential for TGF-&#x003b2; induced conversion of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts and expression of matrix proteins, signaling via the p38MAPK pathway. Therefore, regulation of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling is a major mechanism by which CLIC4 modifies normal growth and differentiation. We now report that elevated CLIC4 alters Smad7 function, a feedback inhibitor of the TGF-&#x003b2; pathway. Overexpression of CLIC4 in keratinocytes, mouse embryonic fibroblasts and other mouse and human cell types increases the expression of Smad7&#x00394;, a novel truncated form of Smad7. The alternatively spliced Smad7&#x00394; variant is missing 94bp in exon 4 of Smad 7 and is conserved between mouse and human cells. The deletion is predicted to lack the TGF-&#x003b2; signaling inhibitory MH2 domain of Smad7. Treatment with exogenous TGF-&#x003b2;1 also enhances expression of Smad7&#x00394; that is amplified in the presence of CLIC4. While Smad7 expression inhibits TGF-&#x003b2; signaling, exogenously expressed Smad7&#x00394; does not inhibit TGF-&#x003b2; signaling as determined by TGF-&#x003b2; dependent proliferation, reporter assays and phosphorylation of Smad proteins. Instead, exogenous Smad7&#x00394; acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of Smad7, thus increasing TGF-&#x003b2; signaling. This discovery adds another dimension to the myriad ways by which CLIC4 modifies TGF-&#x003b2; signaling.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was conducted with funding to SHY from the NCI, CCR intramural program under project BC005445-30.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>The TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway importantly regulates numerous cellular activities including growth, differentiation, apoptosis, adhesion and motility [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These myriad effects are elicited by a signaling cascade from the cell membrane to the nucleus. The canonical TGF-&#x003b2; signaling cascade is initiated when a TGF-&#x003b2; ligand binds to the TGF-&#x003b2; Type II receptor on the cell surface, and subsequently heterodimerizes with and phosphorylates the TGF-&#x003b2; Type I receptor [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This then leads to phosphorylation of Receptor Smad molecules (R-Smads), their association with Smad4 (Co-Smad) and translocation to the nucleus to regulate transcription of target genes. TGF-&#x003b2; signaling is fine tuned and regulated through multiple means, one of which is induction of expression of Inhibitory Smads (I-Smads) [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The expression and nuclear export of the I-Smads, Smad6 and Smad7, is induced by TGF-&#x003b2; signaling. Smad6 preferentially inhibits BMP signaling [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] whereas Smad7 inhibits both TGF-&#x003b2; and BMP signaling [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. They inhibit Smad signaling by several mechanisms: Smad7 interferes with interaction of R-Smads with type I receptors and thus preventing R-Smad phosphorylation and activation [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; Smad6 and Smad7 prevent complex formation between R-Smad and co-Smads that prevents R-Smad nuclear translocation and subsequent transcriptional regulation [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; they interfere with functional Smad-DNA complex formation in the nucleus [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; or directly regulate transcription in the nucleus [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>CLIC4 (Chloride Intracellular Channel 4) is a highly conserved multifunctional member of a family of six proteins that are similar in size, highly homologous and participate in many signaling activities [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Of all family members, CLIC4 has been most extensively studied. The 28kD ubiquitously expressed CLIC4 is dimorphic, found both in intracellular membranes as well in soluble form in the cytoplasm and regulated by cellular redox state [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A major site of action of soluble CLIC4 appears to be in the nucleus where it modifies TGF-&#x003b2; signaling [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. CLIC4 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus under cellular stress including metabolic stress, growth arrest, apoptosis and DNA damage [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the nucleus, CLIC4 enhances TGF-&#x003b2; signaling by associating with phosphorylated R-Smads and inhibiting their dephosphorylation by specific Smad phosphatase PPM1a, thereby prolonging the activated state of Smads and hence the TGF-&#x003b2; signal [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. CLIC4 deficient mice display spontaneous skin erosions and delayed wound healing possibly through altered TGF-&#x003b2; signaling [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. During carcinogenesis, CLIC4 mirrors the dual nature of TGF-&#x003b2; in causing context dependent tumor suppression or enhancement. Elevating CLIC4 levels in tumor epithelium suppresses tumor growth that is coincident with enhanced TGF-&#x003b2; signaling [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In contrast, elevating CLIC4 in tumor stroma via TGF-&#x003b2; and p38 signaling enhances tumor growth and tumor cell invasion [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Here we report that CLIC4 has devised another strategy to enhance TGF-&#x003b2; signaling: by inducing expression of a novel, alternate form of Smad7 in collaboration with TGF-&#x003b2;. We describe the identification of this previously uncharacterized shorter form of Smad7 that appears to be the result of an alternative splicing event and designate it as Smad7&#x00394;. <bold>The splicing event as well as sequences of Smad7&#x00394; are conserved between mouse and human cell types</bold>. Expression of endogenous Smad7&#x00394; is induced upon overexpression of CLIC4 and by TGF-&#x003b2; treatment of keratinocytes and other cell types in the presence of CLIC4. Exogenous Smad7&#x00394; acts as a dominant inhibitor of Smad7 and enhances TGF-&#x003b2; signaling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Expression of exogenous CLIC4 induces a shorter form of Smad7</title><p>Overexpressing CLIC4 in mouse keratinocytes revealed two Smad7 transcripts: the expected amplicon and a transcript producing an approximately 100bp shorter band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161410.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).

As expected, increasing expression of Smad7 decreases p3TP luciferase TGF-&#x003b2; reporter activity. The same assay reveals that transduction with increasing amount of Smad7&#x00394; expressing adenovirus increases TGF-&#x003b2; reporter activity. A combination of Smad7 and Smad7&#x00394; increases reporter activity irrespective of proportion of the two viruses. For example, 2.5 MOI of Smad7&#x00394; prevents repression of TGF-&#x003b2; reporter activity even by 10 MOI of Smad7 virus. This shows that exogenous Smad7&#x00394; functions as a dominant inhibitor of Smad7 function to repress TGF-&#x003b2; signaling. Support for this conclusion also comes from a study of adenovirally transduced keratinocytes analyzed for the expression of various TGF-&#x003b2; downstream genes on a TGF-&#x003b2; PCR expression array. Following a 1h treatment with TGF-&#x003b2;, exogenous Smad7 inhibits or enhances expression of various TGF-&#x003b2; downstream genes whereas Smad7&#x00394; does the opposite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161410.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Co-expression of Smad7 and Smad7&#x00394; resulted in TGF-&#x003b2; signaling changes similar to Smad7&#x00394; alone supporting the indication that Smad7&#x00394; functions in a dominant negative manner over Smad7.

Importantly, the nucleotide and protein sequence of Smad7&#x00394; is conserved between mouse and human species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161410.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). In the unstimulated state, an analysis of split vs unsplit tags yielded a 2% total abundance of Smad7&#x00394; transcripts relative to total Smad 7 transcripts in MEFs while HOS showed a relative abundance of 1.2%. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161410.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Introduction of exogenous CLIC4 into MEFs modestly increased the expression of Smad7&#x00394; that was inhibited by blocking the TGFBRII indicating it is TGF-&#x003b2; dependent. In contrast TGF-&#x003b2; treatment of MEFs at 1 ng/ml induced expression of Smad7&#x00394; transcripts 20&#x02013;30 fold suggesting it is a primary signal for regulating the splicing of the Smad7 transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161410.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>). Interestingly, the level of induction of Smad7 transcripts by TGF-&#x003b2; in these cells was substantially less than the induction of the Smad7&#x00394; transcript implying that TGF-&#x003b2; preferentially elevates the variant transcript. As in many ying-yang functions of TGF-&#x003b2;, this preferential induction of the &#x00394; transcript could serve as a mechanism to bring the two opposing protein functions into better balance during exposure. To determine if the Smad7&#x00394; transcript is detected in vivo or altered in disease states, we examined RNA by real time PCR from normal skin and benign and malignant squamous tumors induced by oncogenic ras transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161410.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Smad7&#x00394; could not be detected in normal skin but low levels of Smad 7 were detectable. In contrast, Smad7&#x00394; transcripts were readily detectable in all tumors at variable but highly elevated levels in some tumors, even in the benign state. Smad 7 transcripts were also elevated in both benign and malignant tumors where TGF-&#x003b2; levels are generally high [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

However, whether these transcripts are expressed in the same cells or same compartments of the tumor cannot be determined by these methods.

R-Smads consist of the MH1 (Mad-homology 1) and MH2 domains connected by a linker region [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Their C terminus has a SSXS motif that is phosphorylated by activated Type I receptor. The Co-Smads contain MH1 and MH2 domains but do not contain the SSXS motif at their C terminus and hence cannot be phosphorylated by the receptors. I-Smads have a conserved MH2 domain but also lack the SSXS motif. Their N-termini lack the DNA-binding domain present in MH1 domains of the R-Smads and Co-Smads. The C-terminal MH2 domains of Smad6 and Smad7 are responsible for their interaction with the Type I receptor and for inhibition of the TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The MH2 domains of Smad6 and Smad7 are sufficient to repress TGF-&#x003b2; signaling while isolated N-terminal domains of these proteins are unable to cause this repression themselves. The N-domain of Smad7 determines its subcellular localization and aids the inhibitory activity of its MH2 domain through physical interaction with the MH2 domain [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. As predicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161410.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, the observed deletion of 94bp in exon 4 of Smad7 produces a frame shift and early truncation of the protein, eliminating the MH2 domain in Smad7&#x00394; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161410.g006">Fig 6</xref>). In the absence of an MH2 domain and an altered C-terminus, it would be expected that Smad7&#x00394; would be unable to inhibit TGF-&#x003b2; signaling. Our results show that Smad7&#x00394; does not inhibit TGF-&#x003b2; signaling but instead acts as a dominant inhibitor of Smad7 function and potentiates TGF-&#x003b2; signaling.</p><fig id="pone.0161410.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0161410.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Comparison of Smad7 and Smad7&#x00394; domains.</title><p>A.

Examination of multiple cell types suggests the Smad7&#x00394; transcript is widely expressed in both human and mouse cells albeit at low levels but inducible. As depicted by RNA-seq analysis of primary MEFs and osteosarcoma cell line HOS, Smad7&#x00394; is expressed in baseline, unmanipulated conditions in normal primary cells as well as in disease state. qPCR indicates it is induced by TGF-&#x003b2; treatment in MEFs and multiple other cell types. Thus it seems likely that Smad7&#x00394; participates in the regulation of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling as required, and can modify the downstream readout of this pathway. Our results show that CLIC4 is important for induction of Smad7&#x00394;. The enhanced induction of Smad7&#x00394; by combined TGF-&#x003b2; treatment and overexpression of CLIC4 supports this idea as do the reduction in TGF- &#x003b2; induced Smad7&#x00394; transcript in CLIC4 KO keratinocytes and decrease in CLIC4-induced Smad7&#x00394; transcripts when TGF-&#x003b2; signaling is blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161410.g002">Fig 2</xref>). That the &#x00394; transcript had not been seen previously in Smad7 studies suggests some selectivity, either direct or indirect, for a mechanism related to expression of CLIC4. It is likely that our previously reported mechanism where TGF-&#x003b2; enhances CLIC4 expression that in turn stimulates TGF-&#x003b2; signaling by sustaining the phosphorylated Smad2/3 signal is operative here as well [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The enhanced induction of Smad7&#x00394; by combined TGF- &#x003b2; treatment and overexpression of CLIC4 supports this idea. Since CLIC4 is constitutive in most cell types and TGF-&#x003b2; is in the microenvironment of all tissues, it is likely they participate in basal regulation of Smad7&#x00394;. Additional studies are required to interrogate this mechanism.</p><p>Analysis of the borders of the deletion that gives rise to Smad7&#x00394; reveals a GT/AG motif (highlighted in bold red and underlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161410.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) that is the hallmark of alternate splicing and denotes a splice donor and acceptor site. RNA-seq analysis of MEFs and human osteosarcoma cells further shows that Smad7&#x00394; arises due to novel splicing and that we have uncovered an alternately spliced form of Smad7. TGF-&#x003b2; signaling has been shown to participate in splicing of many genes [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It is likely that alternate splicing of Smad7 to produce Smad7&#x00394; involves enhanced TGF-&#x003b2; signaling brought about by CLIC4. According to an analysis using NCBI&#x02019;s Aceview program, transcription of the Smad7 gene could produce at least 7 different alternately spliced mRNAs all putatively encoding good proteins. There are 5 probable alternate promoters and 2 validated polyadenylation sites. The mRNAs appear to differ by truncation of the 5' end, overlapping exons with different boundaries, alternative splicing or retention of one intron. Smad proteins are commonly known to have several splice isoforms. A splice form of Smad2 that lacks exon 3 is differentially expressed during mouse brain development and aging [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Alternately spliced forms Smad5 and Smad5&#x003b2; diverge at the junction of exon 6, with Smad5&#x003b2; found to be more highly expressed in undifferentiated hematopoietic stem cells than in terminally differentiated peripheral blood leukocytes [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Three human Smad6 isoforms have been identified [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Apart from the full length Smad6 that consists of an N-terminal MH1 domain and a C-terminal MH2 domain, Smad6s exhibits a truncated MH1 domain while Smad6B, due to use of an alternate exon 4, has a C-terminal truncation leading to lack of the entire MH2 domain and parts of the linker region. Smad8B, a splice variant of Smad8 lacks the C-terminal SXSS motif and inhibits Smad8 mediated signaling [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Smad8B acts as a dominant inhibitor of BMP signaling. Analysis of the annotated RNA database does not display Smad7&#x00394;. Therefore this study discovers a constitutively expressed, hitherto unannotated form of Smad7 that functions at least experimentally as an inhibitor of Smad7 and potentiates TGF-&#x003b2; signaling.</p><p>Smad7 is frequently elevated in various tumor types including squamous cancers of the skin [<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161410.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].
