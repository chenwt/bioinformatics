KDM5B-silencing in the TNBC cells correlated with the upregulation of hsa-miR-448 and led to suppression of MALAT1 expression with decreased migration, invasion and clonogenic capacity in vitro, as well as, poor survival in vivo. This projects MALAT1 as a mediator of KDM5B oncogenic potential and highlights the critical role of this microRNA, lncRNA and histone demethylase in cancer cell motility and metastatic colonization. Increased expression of KDM5B correlating with disease progression and poor clinical outcome in breast cancer was reversed by hsa-miR-448.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings demonstrate the critical role of KDM5B and its negative regulator hsa-miR-448 in TNBC metastasis and progression.

Recent data approximates the global cancer mortality at 7.6 million, and breast cancer with an annual incidence of over one million newly diagnosed cases, accounts for over 6&#x000a0;% of this mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Breast cancer, like many polyetiologic human pathologies, is a product of cumulative genetic, epigenetic, somatic, and endocrine aberrations. The polyaetiologism and constitutive complexity of breast cancer presents a challenge for prevention and treatment of breast malignancies. There are five subtypes of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and of these, the hormone receptor-negative basal epithelial, commonly referred to as &#x02018;triple negative breast cancer&#x02019; (TNBC), is the most aggressive, most common among younger women of African-American and Latina ancestry and has the worst clinical prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. TNBCs are very invasive breast carcinomas lacking estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptors (HER2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and are associated with enhanced cellular proliferation, early disease recurrence, and poor overall survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, despite increased knowledge of the aetiology and mechanism of this breast cancer type, developing an effective anti-TNBC therapeutic strategy is still a clinical challenge.</p><p>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcribed RNA molecules longer than 200 nucleotides and endogenously expressed in mammalian cells. Accumulating evidence indicate that lncRNAs, once considered to be genomic anomalies and functionless, do play significant roles in both physiologic and pathologic human conditions through their regulation of defined target mRNA expression, and their post-transcriptional epigenetic modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Following the work of Okazaki et al., which demonstrated that many mammalian transcriptome are non-protein coding and defined lncRNAs as a significant class of these transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], it is estimated that about 11&#x000a0;% of the approximately 180,000 large mouse transcriptome are probably protein-coding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and that the number of lncRNAs far exceeds protein-coding mRNAs in the mammalian transcriptome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Despite the heightened interest in lncRNA biology, their precise function in cellular processes and promoter regulation remains widely undetermined, thus, our study of the functional significance of lncRNAs, their genomic role and their epigenetic regulation.</p><p>We hypothesized that the 8.6&#x000a0;kb lncRNA MALAT1 is epigenetically-regulated, and that this is associated with the modulation of various oncogene expression and activities including cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis. This is consistent with documented evidence that transient MALAT1 overexpression enhanced tumor proliferation in cell lines and xenograft tumor formation in nude mice, while its attenuation resulted in reduced tumorigenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>KDM5B belongs to the histone lysine demethylase family, with the ability to cause transcriptional silencing by specifically demethylating di- and tri- methylated lysine 4 of histone 3 of their target genes, and is overexpressed in several carcinomas, including gastric cancer, glioma and breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Observing a concomitant increase in MALAT 1 and KDM5B expression as breast cancer progresses, we investigated and validated the hypotheses that MALAT 1 interacts with KDM5B, and that the MALAT1 expression is positively regulated by that of KDM5B in the highly malignant and clinically challenging TNBC. In addition, since highlighting the problem without proffering a solution was not the intent of our work, we systematically screened for an effective therapeutic approach that not only targets KDM5B or MALAT1 expression and/or activities, but also improve clinical outcome, using a combination of small molecule inhibitors, genetic ablation or sncRNA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Tissue samples</title><p>Twenty human breast tumor tissue samples collected during reduction mammoplasty and classified into various histological subtypes were obtained from archived samples of the Tissue Bank at Taipei Medical University- Shuang Ho Hospital (TMU-SHH).

H&#x00026;E&#x02013;stained sections of the mammoplasty specimens were reviewed to select representative areas of the tumor to carry out KDM5B immunohistochemical detection. The working dilution was 1:200. KDM5B immunohistochemistry was carried out using tissue microarray (TMA) on an automated system for immunostaining (Dako Autostainer), with antigen retrieval at high pH. We graded the intensity of the membrane and cytoplasmic staining as absent, weak, moderate, or intense, after stained sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. However, for subsequent statistical analysis we reclassified the cases as high (moderate or intense) or low (null or weak staining similar to control areas of normal breast tissue).

We confirmed previous reports that the proliferation of breast cancer cells was inhibited by the conditions in which KDM5B expression and/or activity was attenuated on the premise that increased invasiveness of the triple negative breast cancer cells was augmented by proliferation of these cancer cells. There was increased proliferation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), mammosphere generation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>) and colony formation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>) in the KDM5B-positive vector breast cancer cells, while cells with attenuated KDM5B expression exhibited reduced proliferation, mammosphere formation and clonogenicity ability. To determine if KDM5B was sufficient for the activation of the increased TNBC oncoagression observed, we further evaluated the expression of KDM5B, c-Myc (a metastatic factor and mesenchymal marker) and other EMT markers in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. Our data revealed a similar expression pattern for KDM5B and c-Myc in both clinical samples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). Positive correlation was also noted for the expressions of KDM5B and the survival factor, Survivin, as well as with EMT markers, c-Met, Slug and N-Cadherin, while as anticipated E-Cadherin exhibited a reverse pattern of expression compared with KDM5B (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). Thus, we inferred that the difference in the malignant invasive potential of the breast cancer cells was due to their differential KDM5B expression.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>KDM5B enhances the proliferation and maintenance of TNBC cells malignant phenotype. <bold>a</bold> Proliferation assay showing that KDM5B knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, (<bold>b</bold>) silencing KDM5B suppressed the ability of the shKDM5B infected MDA-MB-231 cells to form mammospheres, and (<bold>c</bold>) colony formation assay showed that vector-infected cells possessed greater clonogenicity than their counterpart shKDM5B infected MDA-MB-231 cells.

Using bioinformatics approach, we also probed available freely accessible miR databases for miRs associated with KDM5B expression and came up with a panel of miRs (data not provided). From our literature-based functional analyses, deductive association, and miR - mRNA alignment, we narrowed down on hsa-miR-448 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Our bioinformatics prediction was validated by using the sequence-based RNA-protein interaction algorithm described earlier in section (KDM5B interacts with MALAT1 to modulate its expression in triple negative breast carcinoma cells and consequently facilitate invasion and associated metastatic activities). We found that the 5&#x02032; end of hsa-miR-448 perfectly aligned with and bonded to the 3&#x02032; end of KDM5B (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref> &#x00026; <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">b</xref>), with a RF and SVM interaction classifier score of 70 and 81&#x000a0;% respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8c</xref>).

Recently, the identification, validation and integration of novel biomarkers with current diagnostic or prognostic practices in TNBC clinics have been the subject of several studies, with the aim of proffering better patient stratification and more effective therapeutic strategy. In this study, we demonstrated the critical roles of KDM5B and its downstream target MALAT1 in triple negative breast cancer metastatic phenotype and clinical prognosis, based on the following observations: (i.) KDM5B was more abundant in the proteome of the highly metastatic TNBC cells, (ii.) KDM5B was over-expressed in highly invasive TNBC MDA-MB-231 and other metastatic cell lines, than in non-invasive MCF-7 and non-tumorigenic MCF-10A cells, (iii.) KDM5B ablation attenuated tumor cell migration, invasion, clonogenicity, and mammosphere formation ability of breast cancer cells, (iv.) KDM5B-silencing suppressed MALAT1 expression and inhibited cell proliferation, and (v.) human breast carcinoma samples exhibited the highest expression of KDM5B and MALAT1 in advanced stage (T3 and T4) cancer with associated poorer overall survival. These findings were concordant with our hypotheses that KDM5B through the modulation of MALAT1 expression is associated with breast tumorigenesis, progression and poor prognosis.</p><p>Recently, the role of epigenetic regulation in breast cancer biology, especially that of the histone lysine demethylases (KDMs), has been the subject of several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This group of chromatin structure modifiers are increasingly shown to facilitate several steps of cancer progression. Several KDMs, including KDM5B have been implicated in tumor growth, angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis, and more recently, in tumor-related chemoresistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. KDM5B, a member of the JmjC/ARID domain-containing protein family, with restricted tissue distribution, specifically removes methyl residues from methylated lysine 4 of histone 3 (H3K4), consequently repressing gene transcription. This repression is through the discriminate binding of the AT-rich interactive domain (ARID) of KDM5B to CG-rich DNA sites, or its interaction with proteins at the DNA binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In contrast to its physiologically low expression in normal adult tissue, except in the testes where it is highly expressed, aberrant expression of KDM5B has been demonstrated in skin, lung, prostate, bladder and recently in breast cancer tissues and cell lines, while KDM5B gene silencing, similar to knockdown of KDM3A, was shown to cause a significant G<sub>1</sub>/S transitional lag in MCF-7 breast tumor cells, suggesting its proliferative and tumorigenic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Similar to KDM1A, KDM5B is involved in the silencing of breast tumor suppressors, including BRCA 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], BRCA 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], pRB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], CAV1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], HOXA5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and SFN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], in addition to its active role in the signal transduction of hormone-regulated organs such as the ovaries, testes and breasts of gravid females, as well as, in transcriptional activation of androgen receptor (AR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies have shown that the dissemination of malignant cells, as well as disease recurrence, is linked to the activity of a small subpopulation of cancer cells believed to possess tumor-growth initiating abilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Based on the role of KDM5B in cancer stem cell-like events such as cell fate determination, self-renewal and enhanced cell motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], we hypothesized that KDM5B is actively involved in the highly metastatic phenotype of TNBC cells.</p><p>Our immunohistochemistry analysis of metastatic human breast cancer samples indicated a positive correlation between KDM5B expression, advanced tumor stage and poor clinical outcome of patients (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This is suggestive of KDM5B&#x02019;s ability to enhance tumor cell invasion, facilitate their homing and increase the clonogenicity of KDM5B-expressing cells. It is thus not unlikely that secondary site colonization by highly metastatic TNBC cells involves the active participation of KDM5B and its functional substrate, MALAT1. Our data revealed a correlative association between the expression and/or activity of KDM5B, MALAT1 and that of MALAT1-regulated effector genes, vimentin and snail (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In parallel experiments, KDM5B ablation downregulated MALAT1 expression and also blocked the MALAT1-induced expression of snail and vimentin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Taken together, these data show that KDM5B via modulation of MALAT1 activity plays a critical role in the maintenance of TNBC invasive phenotype, and that the KDM5B&#x02013;MALAT1 signalling axis regulates the activity of the metastatic EMT factors, such as snail and vimentin. These findings are consistent with previous findings in which MALAT1 was shown to positively modulated tumor cell motility by concomitantly regulating motility factors, including snail and vimentin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, to validate the structural feasibility of KDM5B-MALAT1 complex formation, we used the GUI PyMOL software to demonstrate ligand docking coupled with limited binding site analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). In addition, we utilized the catRAPID graphic and strength RNA-protein interaction validation tool for confirmation of KDM5B-MALAT1 complex formation with KDM5B-MALAT1 interaction strength of 93&#x000a0;% (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) based on interaction propensity rank of binding regions in the positive set (10201 interacting pairs). We propound that targeting these factors of breast tumor aggression, or their regulatory genes, might be a more effective therapeutic approach for combating metastasis and disease recurrence in breast cancer patients.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRs) play very critical roles in the regulation of many eukaryotic genes and their associated bioprocesses, however, epigenetic dysregulation of these miR activity or expression has been implicated in several human carcinomas including breast carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Differential expression of miRs in tumor versus non-tumor tissues, tumor tissue groups with varying degrees of invasiveness, or amongst tumor samples with favourable compared to poor clinical outcome, currently serve as vital template for the generation of miR signatures with potential diagnostic and/or prognostic value. Nevertheless, the biofunctional relevance of aberrant miR expression in triple negative breast carcinoma remained largely underexplored. Thus, we evaluated the interaction between KDM5B and the miR, hsa-miR-448.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that the expression of hsa-miR-448 is inversely correlated with that of KDM5B (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Mechanistically, miRs suppress the expression of their target genes by effecting proximity and facilitating interaction between RNAi-induced silencing complex (RISC) effector proteins and complementary sequences of the target mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In compliance with the consensual miRNA - mRNA rule of functional binding, nucleotide 2 to 7 of the 5&#x02032; region of hsa-miR-448 served as the interaction &#x02018;seed&#x02019; region. The seed match of this evolutionarily conserved region of hsa-miR-448 bonding in a complementary manner with nucleotides in the 3&#x02032; untranslated region (3&#x02032;UTR) of KDM5B was sufficient for KDM5B mRNA recognition and eventual degradation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). On the molecular level, we demonstrated that this process combines inhibition of translation, and mRNA degradation. Our data show that hsa-miR-448, with as little as 6 base pair (bp) match, significantly suppressed KDM5B expression (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Consistent with emerging model of miR-mediated gene silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], it is probable that this hsa-miR-448-induced suppression of KDM5B expression is sequel to the deadenylation and exonucleolytic cleavage of KDM5B mRNA.</p><p>We are not unaware of the limitations associated with the use of differential gene expression in the identification of miR targets, such as their link with several indirect alterations in transcript abundance, however, this pattern of gene expression utility in the identification of miR targets is in compliance with several seminal reports, including that which indicates that over 84&#x000a0;% of miR-mediated gene suppression was due to reduced mRNA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Unravelling the molecular mechanism of KDM5B expression in TNBC cells remains a work in progress, however, taken together, our findings indicate that KDM5B is an epigenetic modulator of MALAT1 activity and its downstream effector genes, SNAI and vimentin, as well as plays a critical role in tumor invasion, survival, and niche colonization by the highly metastatic TNBC cells. We demonstrated that KDM5B is a surrogate prognostic biomarker of breast cancer progression and represents a therapeutic target in metastatic breast cancer. Furthermore, we showed that the microRNA, hsa-miR-448 significantly inhibits MALAT-mediated oncogenic and metastatic potential by directly suppressing the expression of KDM5B in triple negative breast cancer, thus, alluding to the clinicopathophysiologic relevance of these findings. The dearth of an effective TNBC anticancer therapy necessitates the development of new therapeutic strategies such as miR replacement therapy. We posit that systemic hsa-miR-448 inoculation, targeting the expression and/or activities of KDM5B may be a stride in the right direction in combating the menace of triple negative breast cancer.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec24"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12885_2016_2108_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>Quantification of GAPDH-normalized average gene expression in MCF10A OE, MDA-MB-231 WT and MDA-MB-231 KD cells with estimated fold change in expression.
