The single strongest observed protein-level oscillation is in a ribonucleotide reductase, which may reflect a defense strategy against phage infection. The peak in abundance of most proteins also lags that of their transcript by 2&#x02013;8 hours, and the two are completely antiphase for some genes. While abundant antisense RNA was detected, it apparently does not account for the observed divergences between expression levels.

While the topology of information flow from DNA genes to mRNA transcripts to protein enzymes is established in the central dogma of molecular biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Crick1">[1]</xref>, much remains to be resolved regarding how much and how quickly changes in gene product abundance at one level affect downstream abundances and activities. Even in bacteria, in which an mRNA molecule can be simultaneously transcribed and translated, post-transcriptional regulation is increasingly recognized as an important mode of control on the abundances of gene products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Picard1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-EvguenievaHackenberg1">[3]</xref>. Relatively weak correlations between the magnitudes of mRNA and protein abundance changes following laboratory-imposed perturbations have been observed in a number of bacteria, including in responses to IPTG addition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Lee1">[4]</xref> and oxygen deprivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Kramer1">[5]</xref> in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, antibiotic treatment in <italic>Streptomyces coelicor</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Jayapal1">[6]</xref>, iron starvation in <italic>Pelagibacter ubique</italic>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Britos1">[8]</xref>. Such results raise the question of how expression dynamics are coordinated between transcript and protein levels in response to various types of stimuli.</p><p>Experiments designed to explore the cascading dynamics of gene expression have typically relied on abrupt, artificially severe stressors to induce expression responses, rather than the natural environmental variability to which organisms have adapted over evolutionary timescales. These types of experiments, while informative, are not likely to reveal the coordination of cellular processes that has been honed by selection in an organism's natural habitat. Multilevel gene-product dynamics have, for the most part, not been explored in cell populations whose growth cycles have been synchronized, either artificially or by entrainment to a natural environmental cue. To date, only one paired transcriptome-proteome analysis of a bacterial cell cycle has been published, that of the unusual asymmetric division of <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Grnenfelder1">[9]</xref>. Expression dynamics observed in unsynchonized populations represent an average of responses of cells across different stages of their cell cycles, which blurs signals that are cell-cycle dependent and may obscure some important operational features of the cellular system.</p><p>Here we present paired transcript- and protein-level expression dynamics in a minimal phototroph, the marine cyanobacterium <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Chisholm1">[10]</xref>, which is not subject to such limitations. <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> is naturally synchronized by the diel light-dark cycle in the lab <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Jacquet1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Holtzendorff1">[12]</xref> and in the ocean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Vaulot1">[13]</xref>, usually doubling once per day on a natural photoperiod (though see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Shalapyonok1">[14]</xref>). The cells undergo substantial physiological shifts over the course of the diel cycle, with various portions of metabolism dominating at different times of day. Production of biomass via photosynthesis occurs from sunrise throughout the light period, and DNA is replicated in the late afternoon. Cell division begins around sunset and is complete soon after midnight, and at night the cells respire some of the carbon they fixed and stored during the day to maintain ATP and NAD(P)H levels. This synchronization results in well-defined B-, C- and D-phases roughly equivalent to the G1, S and G2+M phases, respectively, of eukaryotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Wang1">[15]</xref>. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses over the course of the diel cycle have revealed highly choreographed transcriptional responses to the daily oscillation in energy availability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Zinser1">[16]</xref>. The naturally induced transcriptional dynamics of the <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> cell cycle &#x02013; driven by the daily pulse of energy from light &#x02013; serve as a useful framework for the analysis of coupled downstream effects presented here.</p><p>The Zinser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Zinser1">[16]</xref> diel study tracked genome-wide transcript-level expression with 2-hour resolution over two successive diel periods in <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> MED4. They found that 82% of transcripts of protein-coding genes had detectable expression oscillations over the course of the light-dark cycle, which suggests that the diel cycle is the central control on <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> gene expression under natural conditions. In other cyanobacteria where diel transcriptome oscillations have been measured, smaller proportions of transcripts have been found to cycle with 24-hour periodicity, including 9% in <italic>Synechocystis</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Kucho1">[17]</xref>, 30% in <italic>Cyanothece</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Stckel1">[18]</xref>, 47% in <italic>Crocosphaera watsonii</italic>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Ito1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Vijayan1">[22]</xref>. The higher proportion of diel-cycling mRNAs in <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> is likely partially due to the entrainment of the cell cycle to the light-dark cycle and cells dividing once per day, such that all cell-cycle related genes (such as those for DNA replication) are also on a diel cycle. The data reveal a transcriptional program underlying the temporal division of different parts of metabolism: cells are &#x02018;born&#x02019; in the middle of the night, and expression of photosynthetic genes peaks around sunrise, priming the cell for carbon fixation and biomass accumulation during the light period. Following completion of chromosome replication around sunset, the direction of carbon metabolism switches as respiratory gene expression peaks, providing energy and reducing power for dark metabolism and cell division, which produces a new daughter cell during the night, and the cycle repeats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Zinser1">[16]</xref>.</p><p>A key unresolved question for the <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> system is the extent to which light-dark induced oscillations in gene expression at the transcript level are actually manifested at the protein level. Are the gene-product abundance variations stronger or weaker at the protein level compared to the respective mRNAs? Is the timing the same &#x02013; that is, does the abundance of an enzyme wax and wane synchronously with its transcript? If these dynamics are substantially different, this divergence needs to be accounted for in systems-level models of cellular function. Diel transcriptome-proteome analysis of <italic>Cyanothece</italic> has indicated that protein-level oscillations can diverge from those of mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Stckel2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Aryal1">[24]</xref>, but how general these patterns are across phototrophic bacteria remains unclear. In order to draw ecological and biogeochemical inferences from high-throughput metatranscriptomic data obtained from natural environments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-FriasLopez1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Shi2">[26]</xref>), we need a clearer sense of how mRNA-level variation relates to protein abundance change in a diversity of ecologically-relevant organisms. The diel cycle is one of the strongest yet most predictable perturbations imposed on natural ecosystems, and evolution has selected for strong choreography between this signal and both metabolism and growth in <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic>. Given its enormous global population (estimated at &#x0223c;10<sup>27</sup> cells or 120&#x000d7;10<sup>12</sup> g of carbon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-GarciaPichel1">[27]</xref>), and the &#x0223c;5% of global photosynthesis performed by this single organism (based on daily turnover and the global estimates of gross primary productivity in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Field1">[28]</xref>), understanding how gene expression coordinates with daily variations in light availability has global biogeochemical significance.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell cycle and periodicity of gene transcription and translation</title><p><italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> MED4 cultures were synchronized to a diel light-dark cycle with an irradiance curve that simulated natural diurnal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043432-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), resulting in distinct progression through the phases of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043432-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Total length of the light period was 13 hours, and irradiance peaked at local noon at an intensity of 206 &#x000b5;mol photons/m<sup>2</sup>s. 95% of the cells divided during the period of the experiment. The progression and timing of the cell cycle is consistent with previous experimental observations under laboratory conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Zinser1">[16]</xref> as well as in the ocean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Vaulot1">[13]</xref>, and reflects the coherent population behavior that allows us to interpret the population properties as those of an &#x02018;average&#x02019; individual cell. Using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) transcriptomics and mass-spectrometry (MS) based proteomics with <sup>15</sup>N metabolic isotope labeling for quantification (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), we captured the expression dynamics of 1685 transcripts and 548 proteins over the diel cycle with 2-hour resolution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043432-t001">Table 1</xref>). When these data were fit to sinusoids with 24-hour periodicity, we detected diel cycling in 1279 mRNA and 312 protein timecourses (all cycling proteins also oscillate at the transcript level). For these 312 genes, we determined both phase (i.e., time of peak abundance) and amplitude (i.e., magnitude of abundance change) of oscillation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043432.s013">Table S2</xref>); these are the key parameters we used to compare temporal expression patterns between mRNA and protein. Based on false-discovery-rate analysis that takes into account the sensitivity and specificity of our measurements, we estimate the total proportion of genes with significant diel expression oscillation to be 87% (1464/1685) at the transcript level and 71% (391/548) at the protein level (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043432-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043432.s012">Table S1</xref>); the former result is in agreement with the microarray-based results of Zinser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Zinser1">[16]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0043432-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0043432.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Diel cell growth and cycling.</title><p><bold>A</bold> Growth of the <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> MED4 culture over the diel light/dark cycle.

The estimated number of significantly cycling timecourses is higher than the number for which specific cycling parameters (phase and amplitude) could be calculated because the former incorporates calculations of the sensitivity and specificity of the cycling analysis (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043432.s012">Table S1</xref>).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>These 312 paired transcript-protein timecourses reveal a variety of relationships between gene product abundances at the transcript and protein levels, three of which are shown as examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043432-g002">Fig. 2</xref>. Overall, significant divergence between mRNA and protein levels in the relative timing and/or magnitude of abundance oscillations are the rule rather than the exception, and there is a high degree of variability between genes in these transcript-protein relationships. For example, ribonucleotide reductase (<italic>nrdJ</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043432-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), shows strong oscillations of both transcript and protein: the 18.1-fold change in abundance at the mRNA level resulted in a 8.5-fold change in protein abundance, and the peak of expression coincides with C/S-phase just before sunset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043432-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), when DNA synthesis is likely most active. By contrast, the magnitude of protein abundance oscillation of <italic>rbcL</italic>, the large subunit of the key carbon-fixation enzyme Rubisco, is more dramatically damped compared to its transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043432-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>): a 36.8-fold change in transcript abundance results in only a 1.3-fold change in protein level.

The peak of RbcL protein abundance, which occurs in the early afternoon, lags more than 9 hours behind the sunrise maximum of the transcript. Other genes show even more radically phase-shifted behaviors in the relationship between transcript and protein oscillation, including the chlorophyll biosynthesis gene <italic>chlP</italic> for which mRNA and protein oscillations are entirely antiphase (12 hours offset) from one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043432-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>).

We did not observe any specific correlation between transcript-protein amplitude ratios and gene functional categories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043432.s002">Fig. S1A</xref>) or with the time at which genes were maximally expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043432.s003">Fig. S2</xref>).

Given the large diel oscillations in both transcript levels and the metabolic activity of the cells, this muted temporal variation in protein abundance is surprising, and suggests that fluxes through at least some biochemical networks in the cell are quite sensitive to levels of their constituent enzymes, with abundance changes &#x0003c;2-fold over the diel cycle sufficient to drive metabolic oscillation and the cell cycle.</p><fig id="pone-0043432-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0043432.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Amplitudes of mRNA and protein oscillations.</title><p><bold>A</bold> Comparison of abundance oscillation amplitudes at the transcript and protein levels for the 312 paired expression timecourses.

This variation is certainly coherent with NrdJ's role in DNA synthesis, which occurs between noon and sunset. Yet other cell-cycle-specific proteins do not oscillate nearly so strongly: FtsZ and MreB, both involved in cell division, vary only by 1.3-fold. It may be that the presence of ribonucleotide reductase in the cytosol outside of C/S phase is deleterious; at other times, the main goal of nucleotide synthesis is RNA, and having material diverted to DNA may be substantially counterproductive. But the presence of ribonucleotide reductase homologues in phage genomes and their expression during lytic infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Thompson1">[30]</xref> offers another hypothesis: the low abundance of NrdJ outside of the DNA synthesis may be a mode of defense against phage infection. When a bacteriophage infects a host cell, it shuts down translation of the host genome and begins expressing its own using the host's machinery. Thus, to make progeny, a phage is generally dependent on the presence of DNA-synthesis enzymes (notably NrdJ) in the host cell at the time of infection. If infection occurs when NrdJ protein levels are low (as they are in the morning), infection may stall for want of deoxyribonucleotides to copy the phage genome. In this scenario, the presence of ribonucleotide reductase genes in numerous cyanophage genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Thompson1">[30]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Sullivan2">[32]</xref> is a strategy adopted by phage to circumvent dependence on host NrdJ by encoding their own copy and expressing it during infection.

There is, however, an interesting distinction between the genes whose transcripts peak just before sunrise, between 2am and 5am (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;84), and those that peak near sunset, between 4pm and 8pm (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;79), which together represent about half the protein-mRNA timecourses in our dataset. Evening-peaking transcripts have lower median protein-transcript lag times (4.2 hours) than do morning-peaking transcripts (6.7 hours) and have a tighter distribution of lag times with few very long lags (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043432.s005">Fig. S4</xref>). We hypothesize that this difference in lag times may result from the timing of cell division, which occurs between sunset and midnight and could prompt cells to translate the cluster of evening-peaking transcripts more rapidly, so that their protein products reach sufficient activity levels to complete cell fission and restart the cycle. The morning-peaking transcripts include a number of photosynthesis and carbon-fixation genes, whose activity is expected to be prolonged throughout the light period, and so the temporal lag between mRNA and protein expression can be extended.</p><p>The common protein-transcript lags of 2&#x02013;8 hours could be explained in part by the low rate of protein production in a small, slow-growing cell like <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic>. While no direct measurements of translation rates in <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> have yet been made, given estimates of the cellular phosphorus quota <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Bertilsson1">[33]</xref> and the size of the genome (1.66 Mbp) of this strain of <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic>, we estimate that the cells have only about 600&#x02013;2,400 ribosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043432.s001">Text S1</xref>) compared to as many as 70,000 in rapidly-growing <italic>E. coli</italic> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Bremer1">[34]</xref>.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Steglich1">[29]</xref>, so some transcripts may turn over even before a ribosome is available to translate them. As a consequence, limiting translation could act as a throttle on expression variations in <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic>, both muting and delaying the effect of transcriptional-level regulation on protein abundances for many genes. To explain the observed antiphase mRNA-protein timecourses, however, some form of posttranscriptional regulation is likely required.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Antisense transcripts</title><p>Another possible mechanism to explain the differences between amplitude and phase cycling at the transcript and protein level is the presence of anti-sense RNA molecules. Anti-sense mRNA, transcribed from the DNA strand opposite to the protein-coding gene, can have many effects on gene expression such as altering target RNA stability or inhibiting translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Georg1">[35]</xref>. Translation inhibition results in the presence of transcripts but not of the corresponding proteins, and anti-sense regulation is a plausible explanation for the observed divergences between mRNA and protein abundances. Using a directional RNAseq approach for transcriptome quantification, we detected antisense transcripts for 73.0&#x000b1;6.4% of genes at each time point, and the abundance of antisense RNA was found to be relatively high, with an average of 35.4&#x000b1;5.2% of the corresponding sense message (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043432.s015">Table S4</xref>).

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Sharma1">[36]</xref>, and antisense transcription rates in various bacteria ranged between 1.3 and 26.8% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Georg1">[35]</xref>. While the abundance of antisense RNA varied during the course of the diel cycle for many genes in our study, reads corresponding to antisense messages showed no preferential location inside sense transcripts in genes where mRNA and proteins were expressed in phase or not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043432.s006">Fig. S5</xref>). In addition, genes that show larger differences between protein and mRNA amplitudes did not contain higher antisense transcript levels. Similarly, no distinction in antisense coverage could be detected between genes that are translated in phase or those that displayed phase shifts. Taken together, these observations suggest that neither antisense RNA abundance nor within-gene localization are sufficient to account for the post-transcriptional regulation required to produce at least some the observed differences between transcript and protein expression profiles.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Diel balance of carbon metabolism in <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic></title><p>One of the key cellular functions in <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic>, and arguably the most important with regard to its role in ocean biogeochemistry, is carbon fixation using reducing power generated by water-splitting photosynthesis. Two components of the metabolic network responsible for carbon fixation, the Calvin cycle and the pentose phosphate pathway, can be viewed as a superpathway of two intersecting cycles working in opposite directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043432-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). The reductive portion (the Calvin cycle) trades energy (ATP) and reducing power (NADPH) for fixed carbon, while the oxidative portion (the pentose phosphate pathway) trades fixed carbon for reducing power. During the day, photosynthesis can replenish the ATP and NADPH consumed by the Calvin cycle, allowing net fixation of carbon. At night, reserves of fixed carbon stored as glycogen are consumed and NADPH is regenerated. Proper regulation of the intersection of these two cycles is essential: if metabolic flux is allowed to run around the outside of the superpathway, then chemistry accomplished in one part of the cycle is undone in another, with no net result except the waste of 3 molecules of ATP. It is the balance of fluxes through the intersection of the reductive and oxidative portions that determines whether net carbon fixation or respiration occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Zinser1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Thompson1">[30]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0043432-g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0043432.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Gene product dynamics of central carbon metabolism.</title><p>The Calvin cycle-pentose phosphate superpathway of carbon metabolism in <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic>.

Genes for which timecourses are not shown were either not detected in the proteome or not measurably oscillating in our experiment; note that <italic>cbbA</italic>, <italic>glpX</italic> and <italic>tktA</italic> catalyze multiple reactions. The Calvin cycle consumes CO<sub>2</sub> and trades reducing power for fixed carbon, while the pentose phosphate pathway does the reverse; reactions in the shared intersection reverse direction depending on the net metabolic flux. The Calvin cycle is the dominant pathway in the light period, when photosynthesis supplies NADPH for carbon fixation. Calvin cycle genes peak near dawn at the mRNA level, and near midday at the protein level. The pentose phosphate pathway is dominant at night, when stores of carbon fixed during the day are respired. Transcripts of pentose phosphate pathway genes peak in the late afternoon, and their proteins after sunset. Genes of the shared intersection show cycling parameters akin to those of the Calvin cycle. For all genes of this superpathway, however, the amplitudes of protein abundance oscillation are much smaller than those of the corresponding mRNA, implying that this redirection of the net flow in this superpathway between light and dark periods is controlled by small changes in protein abundance and posttranslational regulation.

As in that experiment, we observed that transcripts of Calvin cycle genes peak around sunrise, whereas those of the pentose phosphate pathway peak just before sunset, and both pathways have large amplitudes at the mRNA level (median fold change over the diel of 5.3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043432-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Our combined proteome-transcriptome dataset, however, reveals that these large variations in mRNA abundance result in only modest changes in protein levels, where the median fold change for the superpathway is just 1.2. If these small changes are sufficient to contribute to redirecting the net flux through this central intersection over the diel cycle, this observation suggests an exquisite balance of this key metabolic network. The relatively constant abundance of Calvin cycle enzymes also helps explain a somewhat puzzling observation that, at night, the maximal light-saturated rate of carbon fixation drops to only 2- to 3- fold below its daytime peak (c.f. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043432-g003">Figure 3B</xref> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Zinser1">[16]</xref>).

And because mass-spectrometry based proteomics measures only protein abundance, not enzymatic activity, it is still only an indirect measure of biochemical action. There is clearly a need for further integration of downstream physiological assays &#x02013; such as metabolomics in the case of anabolic/catabolic pathways, biophysical measurements of photophysiology, and isotopic tracers of nutrient uptake/assimilation &#x02013; into genome-wide expression studies, in order to produce a more complete picture of how gene expression is manifested as metabolism. The quantitative concordance between levels of biological organization (transcriptome, proteome, metabolome) is likely to be closest in concerted responses to acute stresses, and more divergent when perturbations are weaker or gradual <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Halbeisen1">[54]</xref>. Our results provide an example of how evolutionary adaptation to natural, periodic stimuli (such as the rising and setting of the sun) can result in a multilayered expression program. Understanding regulatory responses to natural environmental perturbations on the time scale of microbial growth is an important step towards a mechanistic and predictive picture of how microbial metabolism functions, and how it can drive numerous globally-important biogeochemical processes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Diel growth experiment</title><sec id="s4a1"><title>Culture conditions</title><p>Axenic <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> MED4 was grown in batch culture in 30L acid-cleaned polycarbonate carboys (Nalgene) in a modified I-66LL illuminated incubator (Percival Scientific).

Metabolic isotope labeling using <sup>15</sup>N has a number of advantages for the type of high-precision protein timecourse quantification needed in this experiment. Mixing the samples taken at each diel sampling timepoint with aliquots of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled cells at the earliest stage of protein extraction minimizes the effect of extraction yields and different protein solubilities on the observed abundance ratio, because those biases apply equally to both sample and standard. Similarly, potential biases due to subsequent sample preparation steps, such as variable enzymatic digestion efficiencies or peptide extraction yields, are experienced equally by the intermixed sample and standard. Accurate cell counts of both the <sup>14</sup>N diel samples and the <sup>15</sup>N internal standard pellets by flow cytometry ensured that the <sup>14</sup>N/<sup>15</sup>N mixing ratio was near 1&#x02236;1.</p><p>MS1 peaks corresponding to <sup>15</sup>N-labeled isotopologues of identified MED4 peptides were matched to their unlabeled, coeluting partners by ASAPRatio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Li2">[65]</xref>, and the abundance ratios of the <sup>15</sup>N- versus <sup>14</sup>N-peaks computed. A window of 0.05 <italic>m/z</italic> was used for integration, multiple charge states were used for quantification, and peakgroup pairs were constrained to the same elution time range. ASAPRatio estimates an integrated intensity error for each peak by the difference between the integrated raw intensity and the integrated area under a fitted peak generated by a Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter; this error was used to calculate a coefficient of variation (CV) for each individual peakgroup ratio. The total dataset comprised isotope ratios for 95,542 unique peakgroup pairs &#x02013; here referred to as &#x0201c;peaks&#x0201d; for brevity, but actually representing in excess of 500,000 distinct LC-MS features, including both <sup>14</sup>N- and <sup>15</sup>N-partners and <sup>13</sup>C-isotopologues for each peptide across multiple charge states.</p><p>The set of unique peak ratios was then filtered to remove peaks with a ratio CV greater than 41%, corresponding to the 80th percentile in CV ranking. These high-CV peaks are generally of low intensity and/or poor peak shape, making them more prone to quantification errors. The remaining data were then log<sub>2</sub>-transformed, and the peak ratios were adjusted to compensate for slight variations away from 1&#x02236;1 in the mixing ratio of <sup>14</sup>N- and <sup>15</sup>N-protein at different timepoints. This was done by finding the median of the log<sub>2</sub>-transformed peak ratios for each timepoint, and subtracting that value from each peak ratio at that timepoint. This normalization procedure ensures that the peak ratio distributions for each timepoint have a common median (i.e., 0 on a logarithmic scale) and that timecourse variations for indivdual proteins are not due to systematic biases in the overall dataset.</p><p>Protein-level expression timecourses were constructed from the peak-level data in the following manner: for a given protein, if four or more peaks were found at eight or more timepoints, those timepoints were included in the timecourse. If a timecourse could not be constructed with those criteria, the threshold number of peaks required for that protein was sequentially lowered (to 3, 2, or 1) until 8 or more timepoints were included. This approach was chosen to maximize the quality of the extracted timecourses for data-rich proteins, but to also allow timecourses to be constructed for proteins consistently detected at low levels. For timepoints with at least 4 peaks, the set of peak ratios was tested for outliers using a variation of the integrated inconsistent rate (IIR) method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043432-Hsiao1">[66]</xref>, with an IIR cutoff value of 1.81.</p><p>Protein expression ratios were calculated from the peak-level data at each timepoint by maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of a lognormal fit to the data, taking the mean of the lognormal distribution as the protein ratio.
