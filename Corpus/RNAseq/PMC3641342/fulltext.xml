We noted previously in mice with a <italic>p300</italic> mutation (<italic>plt6</italic>) within the Myb-interaction-domain phenocopied <italic>Myb</italic> hypomorphic mutant mice with regard to thrombopoiesis, and here, changes in GI homeostasis. p300 is a transcriptional coactivator for many TFs, most prominently cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and also Myb. Studies have highlighted the importance of CREB in proliferation and radiosensitivity, but not in the GI. This prompted us to directly investigate the p300&#x02013;Myb&#x02013;CREB axis in the GI. Here, the role of CREB has been defined by generating GI-specific inducible <italic>creb</italic> knockout (KO) mice. KO mice show efficient and specific deletion of CREB, with no evident compensation by CREM and ATF1. Despite complete KO, only modest effects on proliferation, radiosensitivity and differentiation in the GI under homeostatic or stress conditions were evident, even though CREB target gene <italic>pcna</italic> (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) was downregulated. <italic>creb</italic> and <italic>p300</italic> mutant lines show increased goblet cells, whereas a reduction in enteroendocrine cells was apparent only in the <italic>p300</italic> line, further resembling the <italic>Myb</italic> hypomorphs. When propagated <italic>in vitro</italic>, <italic>creb</italic>KO ISC were defective in organoid formation, suggesting that the GI stroma compensates for CREB loss <italic>in vivo</italic>, unlike in <italic>Myb</italic>KO studies. Thus, it appears that p300 regulates GI differentiation primarily through Myb, rather than CREB. Finally, active pCREB is elevated in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells and adenomas, and is required for the expression of drug transporter, MRP2, associated with resistance to Oxaliplatin as well as several chromatin cohesion protein that are relevant to CRC therapy. These data raise the prospect that CREB may have a role in GI malignancy as it does in other cancer types, but unlike Myb, is not critical for GI homeostasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>p300</kwd><kwd>Myb</kwd><kwd>CREB</kwd><kwd>colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>Apc<sup>Min/&#x0002b;</sup></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The epithelium of the small intestine (SI) and colon is the fastest self-renewing tissue in the body. Self-renewal is facilitated by intestinal stem cells (ISCs) near the bottom of the crypts. Gut ISC produce highly proliferating transit-amplifying cells. Maturation of these cells coincides with upward migration and differentiation into either secretory or mucin-secreting goblet cells, hormone peptide-secreting enteroendocrine cells and in the SI a fourth cell type; bactericidal and ISC niche-supporting Paneth cells (PC).

A similar proliferative defect was noted in the SI (data not shown).

These interactions are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, raising the question of whether CREB, which is expressed in gut epithelium, might be similarly important in the GI for proliferation and crypt homeostasis.</p></sec><sec><title>CREB recombination is specifically and efficiently induced in the GI tract</title><p>In view of studies demonstrating that CREB contributes to proliferation and differentiation of different cell types in multiple non-GI tissue compartments, we deleted CREB in the intestine using a Tamoxifen-inducible CRE-mediated intestine-specific <italic>creb</italic>KO mice line. In these mice, exon 10 was flanked by <italic>loxP</italic> sites, and earlier studies indicated that the deletion of exon 10 results in loss of all CREB polypeptides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> To assess whether CREB deletion occurred in the gut epithelium after 4 weeks of Tamoxifen treatment, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was employed using antibodies against CREB. Control littermates (<italic>creb</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup>&#x0002b;Tamoxifen) showed CREB protein throughout the colonic crypts and the SI extending into the villi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a and c</xref>). Enterocytes were the predominant CREB&#x0002b;ve cell type, but cells in metaphase were CREB&#x02212;ve. Importantly, CREB was evident in the lamina propria, lymphoid-rich Peyer's patches and basal stromal regions, particularly where endothelial cells would be expected to reside. The muscularis also contained a few CREB&#x0002b;ve cells. When epithelial cells were examined after Tamoxifen treatment, all crypt and villi exhibited loss of CREB expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2b and d</xref>). These data indicate that the <italic>creb</italic> deletion (from this point called <italic>creb</italic>KO) was epithelial-specific, pervasive and uniform, but resulted in only modest effects on GI architecture.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of CREB loss on crypt proliferation and cell fate</title><p>As crypts have a high turnover and <italic>pcna</italic> has been reported to be a CREB target gene,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> we examined the proliferative status in WT and <italic>creb</italic>KO intestines by IHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3a&#x02013;d</xref>). Overall, there was a reduction in PCNA&#x0002b;ve cells at the crypt base in SI and colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3a and c</xref>), but this was only significant in the SI when considering the total number of PCNA&#x0002b;ve nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3e and f</xref>) and was confirmed by evaluation of mRNA by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>).

No pCREB staining epithelial cells were evident in the <italic>creb</italic>KO sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), whereas this active form of CREB, unlike the CREB protein in general, is restricted to the crypts in the SI, consistent with the location of the proliferating transit-amplifying cell and stem cell compartment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> Importantly, due to close structural similarity, the pCREB antibody also recognizes the kinase-inducible domains shared by family members, CREM and ATF1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), which allows the conclusion to be drawn that the active form of these other members are not co-expressed in the GI epithelium, and therefore, unable to compensate for CREB loss. To extend this analysis further, we also employed an antibody against a more distantly related TF, ATF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), finding it to be expressed in a similar manner to pCREB, but in the <italic>creb</italic>KO this antigen is expressed to a weaker extent compared with WT crypts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Defects in proliferation are sometimes revealed or exacerbated by stressing the GI with radiation, as observed with <italic>Myb</italic> mutant mice,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> although Myb expression itself was unaffected in the unirradiated CREBKO GI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>).

Even under these stress conditions, pCREB/pCREM/pATF1 were not induced in irradiated GI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>), suggesting that PCNA expression under these conditions is in part under the influence of pCREB but that CREB loss does not lead to GI hypersensitivity to radiation, challenging previous views based upon using dominant negative forms of CREB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> deletion of CREB impedes SI organoid formation</title><p>Having found only modest defects in proliferation of <italic>creb</italic>KO crypts under homeostasis or following challenge with radiation, we decided to quantify the ability of crypt stem/progenitor cells to initiate and form organoids <italic>ex vivo</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> Crypt nests were isolated from <italic>creb/villinCre</italic><sup><italic>ERT2</italic></sup> mice that had not been exposed to Tamoxifen and were plated in phenol-free Matrigel with one group receiving 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4OHT) throughout the 7-day-culture period.

MRP2 expression, however, was restricted to crypts in both the SI and the lower half of colonic crypts in WT mice and this signal was markedly diminished in KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8a and b</xref>). Although MRP2 is reported to be apically expressed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> this was not overtly evident in WT sections.

That the <italic>p300</italic> mutation resides within the KIX domain raised a parallel question about the role of the archetypical p300/CBP-binding partner CREB in intestinal biology. Indeed, as transcription is mostly an orchestrated process of many TFs, we explored the interplay of p300 with Myb and CREB in regulating intestinal biology.</p><p>Protein (histone) acetyl transferases p300 and CBP are transcriptional co-activators and central to transcriptional activation of many genes through direct interaction with partner TFs that directly bind to enhancer elements within target gene promoter regions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup> Several interaction faces within p300/CBP are implied, with the KIX box being the best characterized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> Of key relevance here is the kinase-inducible domain (KID) in CREB and the transactivation domain in Myb, which share structural similarities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref></sup> implying that Myb and CREB may even directly compete for KIX domains in p300/CBP. The intriguing observation that even though CBP expression is coincident with p300, it does not compensate for the defects associated with the p300 hypomorphic mutation, is also evident in the hematopoietic system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup></p><p>Evidence that p300 might be important in the intestines has been reported,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> with mRNA analysis in the rat indicating that p300 is expressed in excess of CBP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Here, we have shown by IHC that p300 is expressed to a similar extent to its close relative protein, CBP, within the crypt base and in the transit-amplifying regions. There is some debate about the relative contributions of each of these acetyl transferases, but the most convincing case is made for p300.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> Thus, the defects in the <italic>p300</italic><sup><italic>plt6/plt6</italic></sup> mutant leading to reduced proliferation, distorted differentiation and indeed shorter crypts are completely consistent with a central role for p300, and not for CBP.</p><p>When we examined the role of CREB in the intestines by tissue-specific deletion, it was anticipated that crypts would be either lost or replaced by crypts in which CREB was not deleted. This view was informed by our previous studies in high-proliferation tissues in mice and zebrafish,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> and other work that collectively shows that CREB is important in the maintenance of proliferation and protection from apoptosis. The <italic>villin</italic>Cre-driven deletion of CREB in both the colon and SI was essentially absolute and restricted to the epithelial cells, sparing cells in the <italic>lamina propria</italic> and <italic>muscularis</italic>. Nevertheless, near-normal looking crypts were evident, and directed investigation into proliferation and specific cell lineages revealed relatively subtle effects. For instance, by evaluating the PCNA&#x0002b;ve nuclei at each crypt cell position it became evident that proliferation could be maintained, but to a reduced extent. Such an effect was seen in the hypomorphic <italic>p300</italic><sup><italic>plt6/plt6</italic></sup> and <italic>Myb</italic> mutant mice,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> although these were not full loss of function mutants, whereas the <italic>creb</italic>KO was null. Similarly, an increase in mucin production and the presence of more ChrA&#x0002b;ve cells suggested that perhaps goblet and enteroendocrine cells may be abnormally increased, however, only goblet cells were increased and enteroendocrine cells were reduced in the hypomorphs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> Together these data indicate that Myb has a more dominant role in crypt proliferation compared with CREB, and that p300 is required for Myb to prosecute this role, whereas CREB has mostly a distinct effect on the differentiation of secretory lineages.</p><p>The question remains as to why CREB loss has such a modest effect on this highly proliferative tissue? We were concerned that CREB loss might be compensated for by family members, CREM and ATF1, as reported in brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> However, these other family members were not expressed in the GI under homeostasis or when stressed, excluding compensation. Nevertheless, using RNAseq and by validation using qRT-PCR and IHC, a range of gene expression changes suggested that CREB regulates an important group of genes most relevant to carcinogenesis, for example, PTEN, MDR2 and, most interestingly, related proteins involved in chromatin/chromosome cohesion (for example, both STAG1 and 2 (SCC3; SA1 and 2) and SMC2, as well as SMC6). The established role of CREB in regulating these cohesion proteins in the context of DNA repair certainly warrants further investigation.</p><p>With regard to PTEN, it is fascinating that it is expressed at reduced levels in the <italic>creb</italic>KO crypts, as it is reported that the CREB protein is a target for PTEN phosphatase action,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> which opens up the prospect that a regulatory feedback loop may involve pCREB and PTEN.</p><p>Much has been made of the role of CREB in radiation sensitivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> Accordingly, we were surprised to find that deletion of CREB <italic>in vivo</italic> in a highly radiation-sensitive tissue like GI was innocuous. One clear difference between these contrasting observations might be that the radiosensitivity studies were done in cell lines with dominant negative forms of CREB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> and this may reflect that other mechanisms might be at play.</p><p>Reducing p300 function might be predicted to shift TF interactions to those with CBP as is argued for <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-catenin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> and this in turn would favor an expansion of non-differentiated (and perhaps) stem and progenitor cells. However, the opposite appears to be the case for the p300<sup><italic>plt6/plt6</italic></sup> hypomorph, where reduced proliferation and enhanced differentiation occur. Overall, the data presented here suggest that much of the effects exerted by p300 in the GI are mediated through Myb and are also apparent in the hematopoietic system,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup> and, by contrast, CBP seems less important in both of these highly proliferative compartments.</p><p>The modest roles of CREB and, by implication, CREM and ATF1 in the GI was a genuine surprise, but there was evidence that pCREB/CREM/ATF1 is elevated in early-stage and advanced adenocarcinoma in the mouse. Commensurate with this association is the increased expression of a key cytotoxic drug transporter, MRP2, which may have a role in the response of CRC to frontline drugs, Oxaliplatin, 5-Flurouracil and Camptothecin. Based upon other studies where increased MRP2 may invoke resistance to cytotoxic drugs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> it is reasonable to speculate that the elevated pCREB evident in mouse adenomas and CRC may also occur in human CRC and have a role in compromising the therapeutic impact of these drugs. Overall, the data presented here indicate that Myb is central to the action of p300 in the GI and that if CREB is working through p300, it is more engaged in potentially important gene regulation that impinges upon CRC but not GI homeostasis or radiation response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p><italic>creb/villinCre</italic><sup><italic>ERT2</italic></sup> mice were generated by crossing <italic>creb</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup> mice, as described,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> to <italic>villinCre</italic><sup><italic>ERT2</italic></sup>mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref></sup> on a C57BL/6J background.

(<bold>a</bold>) Like <italic>Myb</italic> hypomorphs, <italic>plt6/6</italic> mutant mice have shorter crypts than WT mice (<italic>P</italic>=0.03). (<bold>b</bold>) This reduced crypt length corresponds to reduced proliferation, as determined by PCNA staining at crypts positions from the base (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05&#x02013;0.01). (<bold>c</bold>) Expression of ISC gene <italic>Myb</italic> is significantly reduced in colonic crypts isolated from <italic>plt6/6</italic> mutants compared with <italic>WT</italic> as is Myb target and ISC gene, <italic>lgr5</italic>, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01. (<bold>d</bold>) p300 and Myb can be viewed as being part of a larger complex of interacting TFs, including <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-catenin, and most particularly, closely related CREB family members (CREB, CREM and ATF1) and more distantly related, ATF2. Linear protein lengths are shown in amino acid (AA) residues, and key interaction and function domains (DNA-binding domain (BD), transactivation domain (T/A), negative regulation domain (NRD) with leucine zipper-like domain (LZ), C=conserved homology domains (Ch), kinase interaction domain (KIX) and key conserved phosphorylation site (P).
