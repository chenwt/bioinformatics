It is an attractive component of grassland farming, because of its high yield and protein content, nutritional value and ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. Enhancing its role further in sustainable agriculture requires genetic improvement of persistency, disease resistance, and tolerance to grazing. To help address these challenges, we have assembled a chromosome-scale reference genome for red clover. We observed large blocks of conserved synteny with <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> and estimated that the two species diverged ~23 million years ago. Among the 40,868 annotated genes, we identified gene clusters involved in biochemical pathways of importance for forage quality and livestock nutrition. Genotyping by sequencing of a synthetic population of 86 genotypes show that the number of markers required for genomics-based breeding approaches is tractable, making red clover a suitable candidate for association studies and genomic selection.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Red clover is one of the most important forage legume crops in temperate agriculture, and a key component of sustainable intensification of livestock farming systems. Its beneficial attributes in terms of high protein forage and reduced need for nitrogen fertilizer input can contribute to reduce the environmental footprint of grassland based agriculture<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Red clover provides good biomass yield for two or three seasons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. This limited persistency has been attributed to biotic and abiotic stresses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. There is thus an urgent need for improving our understanding of the genetic basis of these traits, as well as those affecting forage yield, quality and livestock nutrition, in order to facilitate genetic improvement.</p><p>In terms of available genomics resources, genome assemblies exist for the two model legumes, <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> (Gaertn.) and <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic> L.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, and several legume pulse crops including common bean<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, soybean<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, chick pea<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> and pigeon pea<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Genomics resource development in forage legumes are less advanced, but a transcriptome assemblies exist for example in alfalfa (<italic>Medicago sativa</italic> L.)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> and red clover<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. For the latter a consensus genetic map, based primarily on SSR markers is also available<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Current evidence suggests that synteny between white clover and <italic>M. truncatula</italic> is more highly conserved than synteny between red clover and <italic>M. truncatula</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, most likely due to the fact that the basic chromosome number of eight is conserved between <italic>M. truncatula</italic> and white clover, whilst red clover has seven.</p><p>Red clover is a diploid (2n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2x&#x02009;=&#x02009;14) species with a genome estimated to be 420 Mb<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. It is heterozygous due to its gametophytic self-incompatibility system, and is difficult to inbreed without severe loss of viability and vigour<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. A draft assembly of reads from 16 different genotypes was recently published<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, consisting of 305&#x02009;Mb in 267,382 scaffolds, and an N50 value of 2.4&#x02009;Kb, using the same statistical criteria, as we have used here. While this assembly is a significant step forward, it is fragmented, and the scaffolds have not been anchored to a genetic or physical map. Here we report a chromosome-scale reference draft genome for a red clover genotype of the variety Milvus (Milvus B) by integration of Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) of short-length reads, Sanger-based bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) end sequences, a physical and two genetic maps. This assembly is the first within the major <italic>Trifolium</italic> genus, one of the largest in the Fabaceae family with 255 species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. After the model species <italic>M. truncatula</italic>, it is the second genome assembly of a forage legume at pseudo-molecule level. This will provide a great platform for advances in genomics studies of traits of biological and agronomic importance in forage crops.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Red clover genome sequencing and assembly</title><p>The genotype Milvus B of red clover was the source of genomic DNA for the sequencing and construction of the physical map. WGS was assembled from paired-end and mate-pair libraries using the Platanus assembler<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, which outperformed the results obtained by ABySS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> and SOAP2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The number of contigs was lower and their contiguity statistics were higher in the assembly produced by Platanus. We also tested and discarded the option of using SOAP2 to scaffold the contigs produced by ABySS, and the use of a <italic>Gap-Closer</italic> as an additional final step. After discarding sequences shorter than 500&#x02009;bp, ABySS assembled 376&#x02009;Mb in 108K scaffolds, SOAP2 assembled 430&#x02009;Mb in 102&#x02009;K scaffolds, and ABySS contigs scaffolded with SOAP2 produced 452&#x02009;Mb in 105&#x02009;K scaffolds. Platanus assembled 309&#x02009;Mb in 39,904 scaffolds. Half of the assembly was contained in 353 scaffolds (N50&#x02009;=&#x02009;223&#x02009;Kb), while 1054 scaffolds longer than 50&#x02009;Kbp contained another 25%, and a significant number of shorter scaffolds contained the remaining 25% of the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). We observed that 87.1% of the Kmers in the ABySS + SOAP2 assembly were present in the Platanus assembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). We annotated 40,868 genes and 42,223 transcripts. Of those, 22,042 genes were anchored onto the seven chromosomes. Our final assembly with Platanus was smaller in total size than the others because the repeat content appeared fewer times, but without missing low copy regions, such as those rich in gene content. This is supported by the gene annotations and the K-mer spectras of reads for the different assemblies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). In these figures, the areas under the Kmer spectra were coloured according to the number of times that such Kmers appeared in each assembly. Approximately 173, 74 and 41&#x02009;Mb appeared once, twice and more than twice in the Platanus assembly, compared to approximately 206, 62 and 206&#x02009;Mb in the ABySS+SOAP2. Also, we compared the annotation of the Platanus assembly with the annotation of the assembly by ABySS and SOAP2, which contained 66,250 proteins. Approximately 27% of these proteins were fully contained with a perfect match in other proteins, while the corresponding percentage was 2.8 in the Platanus annotation. The gene-space lengths were similar, with 138 and 148&#x02009;Mb for the Platanus and ABySS assemblies, respectively. We aligned 93% of the proteins from the Platanus assembly to the ABySS + SOAP2 assembly. The proportion of aligned proteins was the same in the other direction. Finally, we aligned each proteome to the <italic>M. truncatula</italic> proteome and identified best-reciprocal-hits (BRH). Approximately 9% of the BRH with the Platanus proteome were not found among the BRH with the ABySS+SOAP2 proteome. The proportion of these exclusive BRH was identical in the other direction (i.e. 9%). Furthermore, the percentage of complete and partial core proteins reported by CEGMA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> was 85.48% and 95.56% for the Platanus assembly, and 78.2% of the previously published RNA-Seq reads<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> mapped to this assembly. Finally, we compared our WGS assembly with an assembly previously published from a pool of 16 red clover varieties<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. The composite nature of the original sample and the absence of genetic or physical maps limited the coverage of that assembly. The sample was sequenced to an average of 30&#x000d7;, and the assembly contained 267,382 scaffolds, of which 135,502 were longer than 500&#x02009;bp, for a total of 268.2&#x02009;Kbp including an important proportion of duplicated content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>We integrated our WGS with Sanger-based bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) end sequences, and two genetic maps. The physical map contained 29,730 BACs, of which almost 23,000 were in contigs (77.3%). Singleton BACs amounted to 6,743. There were 2,440 contigs ranging in size from a few hundred kb to over 1.7&#x02009;Mb. Originally, about 200 genetic markers from two maps<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>) were anchored to the physical map. Here we aligned 1,031 of the 1,388 markers from the two maps to place 532 of the longest scaffolds totalling 153.4&#x02009;Mb, and used the BAC-end sequences as markers to further link 330 unplaced scaffolds with already placed scaffolds from the same physical contig. After removing shorter sequences, the final version of the genome assembly consisted of 309&#x02009;Mb including 164.2&#x02009;Mb in 7 chromosome-length sequences or pseudo-molecules, plus 75.2&#x02009;Mb in 542 scaffolds longer than 50&#x02009;Kb. The seven pseudo-molecules ranged from 13.02 to 28.17&#x02009;Mb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Genome annotation of the red clover genome</title><p>We annotated 40,868 genes and 42,223 transcripts. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> illustrates the spatial density of the 22,042 genes in the chromosomes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref> for the individual chromosomes). A homologous protein in the UniprotKB database was found for 39,516 transcripts (93.6%), and 1,580 of the remaining transcripts (3.7%) had a novel ORF. A total of 31,576 transcripts (74.8%) was annotated with at least one GO term (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). The number of genes in red clover is lower than in <italic>M. truncatula</italic> (50,894) and soybean (56,044), but higher than in common bean (27,197). Red clover and <italic>M. truncatula</italic> have similar gene density, around 1.3 genes per 10&#x02009;Kb (40,868 genes in 309&#x02009;Mb and 50,894 genes in 389&#x02009;Mb, respectively). However, the genes are not equally distributed in the genome. The mean value of the gene density in 10&#x02009;Kb windows is similar in red clover, common bean and soybean (approximately 0.75&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.96 genes per 10Kb), but lower than in <italic>M. truncatula</italic> (1.51&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.13 genes per 10&#x02009;Kb), because the latter has more intervals with many genes as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>. The CDS and exon lengths were similar in the four legumes, but the intron lengths were significantly longer in the legumes than in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Comparative genomics in legumes</title><p>There were 10,449 orthologous groups of genes common to red clover and four other Fabaceae species, and 2,730 groups common to all but <italic>L. japonicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). The number of genes in each cluster was similar among these legumes, but differed from <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Only 57 GO term clusters had more than twice the number of genes in red clover than in <italic>M. truncatula</italic>. This corresponded to 1,253 proteins mostly belonging to regulatory and transport families (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). We constructed a phylogenic tree on the basis of the alignment of the proteins of 818 single-copy clusters present in the five Fabaceae species and <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. We estimated that red clover and <italic>M. truncatula</italic> diverged around 23 million years ago (MYA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>), similar to that observed between common bean and soybean, which diverged ~19.4 MYA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Furthermore, our analysis showed that the split of the papilionoid clades took place around 50 MYA, consistent with previous results<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p><p>Macrosynteny was conserved between red clover and <italic>M. truncatula</italic>, which shared 17,278 gene pairs in 248 synteny blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Red clover chromosomes 1 and 6 were almost entirely syntenic with <italic>M. truncatula</italic> chromosomes 1 and 7, respectively. The remaining five chromosomes had large synteny blocks each with two or three <italic>M. truncatula</italic> chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>), as observed by others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. A synteny block was declared when there was at least 30 consecutive gene pairs. We quantified the divergence rates from gene pairs in the syntenic regions of each chromosome and observed a clear peak for the Kimura rates around 0.15 for the whole genome and equivalent divergence rates for each chromosome. We found 347 duplicated gene pairs in red clover (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>), approximately three times less than the 963 gene pairs found in <italic>M. truncatula</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The pairs in red clover originated from duplication events around 12.7 MYA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>), thus after the divergence from <italic>M. truncatula</italic>, but we did not find a closer relation to repeat elements <italic>Gypsy</italic> or <italic>Copia</italic> in these duplicated gene pairs relative to all genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig 10</xref>).</p><p>The repeat content was 41.82% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>), which is slightly lower than previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. We re-annotated the repeat elements in several legumes with recent versions of the databases and tools, and revised the fraction of repeats in <italic>M. truncatula</italic> to 48.7%, which is closer to the red clover values than the original annotation (30.5%)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. In common bean this value was adjusted to 72.1%, because we found a larger number of LINE and <italic>Copia</italic> transposable elements (TE) than in the original annotation (45.4%)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> and in soybean to 65.5%, similar to the values originally reported (61.5%)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Class 1 TEs constituted 20.6% of the red clover genome (63.5&#x02009;Mb). The fraction of LINEs and SINEs was similar in red clover and <italic>M. truncatula</italic>, but the proportion of <italic>Gypsy</italic> LTRs was much higher in <italic>M. truncatula</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Furthermore, the high <italic>Gypsy</italic> LTR regions coincided with high <italic>Copia</italic> LTR content. This striking difference is likely due to a recent burst of <italic>Gypsy</italic> activity, which took place 1&#x02013;2 MYA in regions of <italic>M. truncatula</italic> not shared with red clover. This recent burst of <italic>Gypsy</italic> LTR activity, as well as a second one around 20 MYA that can be observed in both species, resulted in a much lower number of new <italic>Gypsy</italic> copies in red clover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). Approximately 88% of the genes anchored in chromosomes had a <italic>Copia</italic> LTR within 10Kb, a third of them within 1&#x02009;Kb. Approximately 39% of the genes had a <italic>Gypsy</italic> LTR within 10&#x02009;Kb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). Class 2 TEs constituted 19.1% of the red clover genome (58.9&#x02009;Mb), which is similar to <italic>M. truncatula</italic>, but higher than in common bean and soybean (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> highlights that although the total concentration of DNA transposons was similar, the distribution of families was not. Red clover had a higher proportion of <italic>hAT</italic>, <italic>Stowaway</italic> and <italic>Pogo</italic> transposons than any of the other species analysed, but in contrast to <italic>M. truncatula</italic> did not have <italic>MULE</italic> transposons.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Gene clusters associated with forage nutrition traits</title><p>The high concentrations of isoflavones in red clover forage, particularly formononetin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, can have oestrogenic effects with adverse consequences for reproduction in ruminants, especially sheep<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.

Four enzymes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>) are involved in formononetin biosynthesis, isoflavone-synthase (IFS1), 2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase (HIDH), isoflavone-O-methyltransferase (IOMT), 2, 7, 4&#x02032;-trihydroxyisoflavanone 4&#x02032;-O-methyltransferase (HI4OMT), and two additional enzymes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>) are involved in the interconversion of formononetin conjugates isoflavone 7-O-glucosyltransferase (IF7GT) and isoflavonoid malonyl transferase (MAT7). Except for HIDH, which has had multiple copies since early in the evolution of plants and at least three recent duplication events in different loci of red clover (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>), the genes encoding the other enzymes were distributed in five clusters in red clover and <italic>M. truncatula</italic>. Each cluster is dominated by one of the enzymes, and is surrounded by the same genes in both red clover and <italic>M. truncatula</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>). Some genes encoding HI4OMT, IOMT and IF7GT were located in more than one cluster, but the genes in different clusters were distributed in different phylogenetic branches, and appear to encode distinct groups of isoenzymes and to have evolved independently prior to the Fabaceae divergence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 14&#x02013;18</xref>). Five IOMT genes were clustered on <italic>M. truncatula</italic> chromosome 5, and red clover scaffold 1068 (3&#x02009;genes) and scaffold 29975 (2&#x02009;genes). The IOMT cluster includes two copies of <italic>tRNA pseudouridine synthase</italic> (TruA) in both species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig 13</xref>). Five HI4OMT genes clustered in <italic>M. truncatula</italic> chromosome 4 embedded among several genes with unknown function. The five homologous genes in red clover were in different unplaced scaffolds, which may form a cluster too. The IFS1 cluster is on red clover chromosome 3 and <italic>M. truncatula</italic> chromosome 4, and is formed by four IFS genes, as well as two IOMT genes and two HI4OMT genes from phylogenetic branches different to the genes in the previous clusters. An <italic>Auxin-response 3</italic> transcription factor and a <italic>cellulose synthase A</italic> gene are also located in the IFS1 cluster in both species. The IF7GT cluster contains three contiguous IF7GT genes on red clover chromosome 2 and <italic>M. truncatula</italic> chromosome 5. IF7GT genes have expanded in soybean and common bean, but not in other analysed legumes. Finally, the MAT7 cluster on red clover chromosome 6 is formed by five contiguous MAT7 genes plus a sixth one 200&#x02009;Kb upstream. The latter is contiguous to an expansin gene, a duplicated F-box transcription factor, and three IF7GT genes from a different phylogenetic branch than the previous IF7GT genes. The <italic>M. truncatula</italic> MAT7 cluster on chromosome 7 has an equivalent structure except that two IOMT genes are located between the MAT7 genes, physically linking both pathways. There are three homologous genes in red clover in unplaced scaffolds. Furthermore, there are eight additional IOMT genes distributed in eight unplaced scaffolds in red clover, though they belong to the same phylogenetic branch (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 15</xref>). Remarkably, this branch contains 18 genes in soybean, only four in common bean, and four pairs in <italic>M. truncatula</italic> chromosomes 1 and 7, including the described pairs in the MAT7 and IFS clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 15</xref>). Some members of the families of three key genes of the formononetin biosynthesis pathway (IFS1, HIDH and HIOMT) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig 11</xref>) were previously shown to be expressed at low to moderate levels in leaves of mature plants. Of those, the IFS1 gene (mRNA 15433) was expressed most highly (up to 362 RPKM under drought conditions), while HIDH (mRNAs 39329 and 5684) and HIOMT (mRNAs 15429 and 15438) had expression levels between 4 and 66 RPKM. The MAT7 and IF7GT gene families were expressed at lower levels (&#x0003c;15 RPKM).</p><p>Red clover has superior feeding value in terms of transfer of omega-3 fatty acids from ruminant feed to milk<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, and reduced levels of proteolysis during wilting and ensiling of its biomass<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. These properties have been linked to the prevalence of the enzyme polyphenol oxidase (PPO). This enzyme catalyses the conversion of endogenous di-phenols to quinones. The quinones can bind with proteins and reduce the speed of proteolysis and lipolysis in the rumen. In red clover PPO appears to form a cluster with three<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> to seven<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> members. We have identified five PPO genes in the red clover genome assembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 19</xref>). Four of them were highly similar to each other and different to PPO genes in related species. PPO1 and PPO2 genes were located 1&#x02009;Mb apart on chromosome 6. A second copy of PPO1 was found on scaffold 8733, and PPO3 was located in scaffold 1247. The latter is also similar to mRNAs previously annotated as PPO4 and PPO5<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. A further PPO gene, which is homologous to the three PPO genes present in <italic>M. truncatula</italic>, was found on chromosome 2 of red clover in a region conserved with chromosome 2 of <italic>M. truncatula</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 20</xref>). The existence of two single copy PPO genes in common bean, and six copies of each of these two genes in soybean is consistent with the hypothesis that the red clover genes in the chromosome 6 cluster are a result of duplication events, and that their homologues are missing in <italic>M. truncatula</italic>. Both the latter and <italic>M. sativa</italic>, in contrast to red clover, have little PPO activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> implying that the PPO genes in these two species are inactive or lack a substrate.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Linkage disequilibrium in a synthetic population of red clover</title><p>Linkage disequilibrium (LD) in a population determines the marker density required in genome wide association studies (GWAS) and for genomic selection (GS) in breeding programmes, as well as providing insight into population structure. The average LD at 100&#x02009;Kb in the red clover variety Lea, a synthetic population with multiple parents, varied between 0.15 and 0.25 in the seven chromosomes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 21</xref> for graphs of LD decay, landscape and heatmaps).

The inbreeding depression and loss of viability associated with self-incompatibility of red clover<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> has precluded the generation of inbred lines for sequencing purposes. The evidence from the comparison of several short-reads assemblers supported the use of Platanus as the best option to generate a high quality reference assembly in this heterozygous species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 1 and 2</xref>). We showed that there was no additional content in the other assemblies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), and that our assembly is a significant step forward in comparison to the resources available to date.</p><p>The anchoring of a significant number of scaffolds, that contained at least half of the genes, allowed the spatial comparison of features between <italic>M. truncatula</italic> and red clover. We also estimated that the divergence of red clover and <italic>M. truncatula</italic> is comparable to the divergence of common bean and soybean. In general terms, the gene content, distribution, and length are conserved among legumes, which is relevant for translational agrigenomics. For example, the enzymes involved in the formononetin pathways are distributed in five clusters, the structure of which, are conserved between red clover and <italic>M. truncatula</italic>. Although the similar total content of repeats in <italic>M. truncatula</italic> and red clover is inconsistent with the hypothesis that outbreeding species have a higher potential for proliferation of transposable elements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, there are dramatic compositional differences between the two species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). The similar sized genomes, but contrasting breeding systems would appear to provide a good basis for comparison. It is possible that the compositional differences are associated with the different breeding systems, but perhaps other events such as chromosomal rearrangements are more closely associated with variation in repeat element composition.</p><p>The genotyping by sequencing analysis of the population based variety &#x0201c;Lea&#x0201d; has provided insight into the level of linkage disequilibrium in synthetic populations, which is one of the most common ways of generating new varieties in outbreeding forage crops. As expected there is no population structure, and low levels of linkage disequilibrium throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig 21</xref>). Nevertheless, the marker coverage would appear to be sufficient for meaningful studies of the genetics of complex traits, and genomics based breeding approaches, given that LD at the average marker distance was near 0.2 or above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>).</p><p>The unique feature of significant PPO activity in red clover in contrast to other forage legumes, notably <italic>M. truncatula</italic> and <italic>M. sativa</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> would suggest that some of the genes in the cluster of PPO genes located on chromosome 6 and two unplaced scaffolds is responsible for the red clover PPO activity, rather than the PPO gene on chromosome 2, which is homologous to a PPO cluster on chromosome 2 in <italic>M. truncatula</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 19 and 20</xref>). However, previous RNASeq data show that PPO genes located on chromosome 2, 4, 6 and 7 were expressed at moderate levels in red clover leaves, and five of those PPO genes were upregulated after exposure to drought stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Other expression analyses in red clover suggest that the PPO4 gene is responsible for most of the activity in red clover mature leaf tissue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. This is most closely related to the PPO gene, described here as PPO3, which is located on scaffold 1247 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 19</xref>). Two partial sequences from <italic>T. repens</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> have the highest degree of similarity to the PPO gene on scaffold 1247 (PPO3), but have been described as PPO1 and PPO2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Further experimental work is needed to establish the relative activity of the different PPO genes, and to what extent their activity is limited by substrate availability. The close relationship between red clover and <italic>M. truncatula</italic> will promote the translation of information from model species to forage crop, and this red clover assembly has facilitated analysis and mapping of pathways of particular importance for red clover nutritional quality.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Plant material and BAC libraries</title><p>The mapping population used in this work consisted of 188 genotypes of F<sub>1</sub> progeny from a cross between a genotype of the variety Milvus and a genotype of the variety Britta.
