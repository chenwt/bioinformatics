Up to the onset of major embryonic genome activation (MGA) at the 8-cell stage nuclei showed a non-uniform distribution of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). NPCs were exclusively present at sites where DNA contacted the nuclear lamina. Extended regions of the lamina, which were not contacted by DNA, lacked NPCs. In post-MGA nuclei the whole lamina was contacted rather uniformly by DNA. Accordingly, NPCs became uniformly distributed throughout the entire nuclear envelope. These findings shed new light on the conditions which control the integration of NPCs into the nuclear envelope. The switch from maternal to embryonic production of mRNAs was accompanied by multiple invaginations covered with NPCs, which may serve the increased demands of mRNA export and protein import. Other invaginations, as well as interior nuclear segments and vesicles without contact to the nuclear envelope, were exclusively positive for lamin B. Since the abundance of these invaginations and vesicles increased in concert with a massive nuclear volume reduction, we suggest that they reflect a mechanism for fitting the nuclear envelope and its lamina to a shrinking nuclear size during bovine preimplantation development. In addition, a deposit of extranuclear clusters of NUP153 (a marker for NPCs) without associated lamin B was frequently observed from the zygote stage up to MGA. Corresponding RNA-Seq data revealed deposits of spliced, maternally provided <italic>NUP153</italic> mRNA and little unspliced, newly synthesized RNA prior to MGA, which increased strongly at the initiation of embryonic expression of <italic>NUP153 </italic>at MGA.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by grants from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft to T.C, E.W. and V.Z.

These changes were most prominent during the transit through minor and major genome activation (mGA and MGA) which occur at the 2-cell stage [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and at the 8-cell stage [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], respectively. Embryonic nuclei in both IVF and cloned embryos adopted a peripheral localization of chromosome territories (CTs) separated from each other by wide interchromatin (IC) channels, whereas their interior was occupied by a major lacuna deprived of chromatin, but enriched with splicing factors and newly synthesized RNA. Nuclei with this phenotype were termed ENPs (for <underline>E</underline>mbryonic <underline>N</underline>uclei with <underline>P</underline>eripheral chromatin arrangement) and were predominant at MGA. After MGA, CTs were redistributed throughout the nucleus and showed features of nuclear architecture typical for somatic cell types. This conventional nuclear phenotype is characterized by a layer of densely DAPI-stained chromatin beneath the nuclear envelope and around nucleoli, a non-random radial chromatin arrangement with gene-poor chromatin enriched in the nuclear periphery and gene-rich chromatin towards the nuclear center [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Nuclei with this phenotype were termed ENCs (for <underline>E</underline>mbryonic <underline>N</underline>uclei with a <underline>C</underline>onventional architecture).</p><p>The present study was initiated to explore changes of the nuclear envelope and its underlying lamina during these massive changes of the nuclear architecture in bovine preimplantation embryos. The nuclear lamina is located directly beneath the nuclear envelope and is made up of lamins B1 and B2 in developing cells and of lamins A and C in differentiated cells [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It serves as an anchoring matrix for chromatin with major implications for chromosome organization and gene expression [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are made up of eight clusters of about 30 nucleoporins (NUPs) [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] building a short tunnel with an inner diameter of ~50 nm [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and an outer diameter of about 105 nm [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] to 145 nm [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] between a cytoplasmic and a nuclear ring spanning from the outer to the inner membrane of the bi-layer lipid nuclear envelope [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Eight fibers connect the nuclear ring with a more interior terminal ring forming the nuclear basket [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The 153 kDa nucleoporin NUP153 [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] can be localized at the nuclear ring and at the nuclear basket [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Chromatin can be associated with the nuclear basket and with internuclear filaments connected to the terminal ring [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Multiple, tubular, double-membraned invaginations of the nuclear envelope carrying NPCs were previously described in nuclei of a wide variety of species, including mammals, and it has been suggested that such invaginations would allow for close topographical relationships between NPCs and chromatin, as well as nucleoli, located in the nuclear interior [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In a recent review such invaginations were referred to as type II [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition, single-membraned invaginations, likely derived from the inner nuclear membrane and lacking NPCs, were described as type I [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Patterns of type I and type II invaginations can coexist in the same nucleus with branched type I extensions expanding from type II invaginations forming a nucleoplasmic reticulum (NR), which helps to perform export-import functions of the nuclear envelope not only in the nuclear periphery, but also deep within the nucleus [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>We performed two-color immunostaining of NUP153 (as a marker for NPCs) and lamin B (as a marker for the lamina) in bovine embryos and recorded light optical serial sections from embryonic nuclei with structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM). This approach yields a lateral resolution of about 100 nm and an axial resolution of about 300 nm. With conventional confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) the corresponding resolution limits are 200 nm and 600 nm, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Accordingly, 3D-SIM provides roughly an eight-fold improvement of the volumetric resolution. Using this novel experimental approach we studied bovine embryos during preimplantation development with the main focus on changes in the nuclear envelope, its underlying lamina and the distribution of NPCs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Bovine oocytes for <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization were obtained from cows slaughtered for meat production at the slaughterhouse M&#x000fc;nchner Schlachthof Betriebs GmbH, Munich, Germany in compliance with EU regulations.

Our results shed new light on the mechanisms involved in the distribution of NPCs, the role of nuclear invaginations covered with NPCs in nuclear import and export functions and changes of the nuclear envelope and its underlying lamina to fit massive changes of nuclear size. Current evidence does not suffice to provide a coherent scheme of the remodeling of the nuclear envelope and lamina in nuclei during bovine preimplantation development.</p><sec id="sec020"><title>Contacts of chromatin with the lamina control the insertion of NPCs into the nuclear envelope</title><p>Disassembly of the nuclear envelope at the end of prophase and reassembly of its membranes at the end of mitosis from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are accompanied by a corresponding disassembly and reassembly of NPCs into sub-complexes and individual nucleoporins [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In mitotic cells we found most NUP153 distributed as punctuate fluorescent spots throughout the cytoplasm suggesting their presence in small complexes together with other constituents of NPCs or even to some extent as individual proteins. A prominent enrichment of NUP153 was noted at the periphery of mitotic chromosomes. This enrichment suggests the presence of chromatin binding sites for constituents of NPCs, such as nucleoporins. An active localization at specific chromatin sites is indicated by the fact that attachments of chromatin at the lamina-envelope system generally occur in a highly non-random manner via lamina associated chromatin domains (LADs) [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Some enrichment of NUP153 was also detected in the interior of chromatids. The reduced number and/or signal intensity of NUP153 in the interior might indicate either a reduced amount of NUP153 or a reduced clustering.</p><p>Bas van Steensel and co-workers [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] visualized the fate of LADs in single cells and found that only about 30% of LADs are in intermittent molecular contact with the nuclear lamina. Upon mitosis, LAD positioning was stochastically reshuffled. This observation indicates that the fraction of chromatin connected to the lamina can change from one cell cycle to the next. Another recent study [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] revealed a homogenous folding state of mitotic chromosomes, which was explained by a model based on a linearly organized, longitudinally compressed array of consecutive chromatin loops. In line with these observations we speculate that binding sites for NPC constituents may be distributed throughout a chromatid and that the fraction of these binding sites exposed at the chromatid periphery may change between subsequent mitoses.</p><p>Reconstitution of the nuclear envelope starts with tubules or sheet-like structures of double membranes derived from the ER which expand along chromatin surfaces, fuse into larger segments and finally enclose the mass of chromatids to form a complete new envelope [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A current model argues that certain NPC constituents at chromatin surfaces mature into NPCs when they become engulfed by growing ER sheets [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, it is not obvious how large areas of the nuclear envelope can be formed without a direct contact with chromatin. At this point we do not know whether the postmitotic daughter nuclei increased in volume only after a complete nuclear envelope had formed around the relatively small volume of closely associated chromatids present at telophase or whether daughter nuclei were very large from the beginning. According to the first scenario the nuclear envelope was able to form along the surface of closely packaged chromatids and expanded only thereafter together with the expanding nuclear volume. Accordingly, lamin B required for the expanding lamina was imported via already existing NPCs. Areas of the nuclear envelope lacking NPCs may indicate that these parts quickly lost contact with chromatin. The second scenario would imply that it is possible to reassemble large parts of the nuclear envelope at sites located initially remote from chromatin.</p><p>In addition to the NPCs formed during reassembly of the nuclear envelope, many more NPCs must be assembled during interphase to approximately double their number before the onset of the next mitosis [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The mechanisms for the formation of these additional NPCs may differ from the mechanism for postmitotic NPC assembly [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our data indicate that the interphase formation of NPCs in large pre-MGA nuclei occurred only in parts of the nuclear envelope where the corresponding lamina was in direct contact with chromatin, but was absent in parts of the envelope without such contacts. After MGA both contact sites of chromatin with the lamina and NPCs became much more uniformly distributed.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Role of nuclear envelope remodeling in nuclear volume reduction</title><p>Intranuclear envelope segments and vesicles were previously described as intranuclear annulate lamellae in electron microscopy studies of oocytes of numerous species [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], as well as in nuclei of mouse preimplantation embryos [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Based on our quantitative analysis, we hypothesize that nuclear envelope invaginations without NPCs, as well as isolated intra- and extranuclear segments of the lamina and nuclear envelope, respectively, are part of a mechanism for nuclear envelope reduction during interphase, which accompanies nuclear volume reduction during preimplantation development (interphase hypothesis). As an alternative or in addition to this hypothesis, isolated lamin B and/or NUP153 immunopositive segments and vesicle-like structures may form during mitosis either during the breakdown of the nuclear envelope or during the nuclear envelope reconstitution at late telophase/early G1 phase (mitosis hypothesis). However, both a maximum of NUP153-/lamin B+ invaginations and of NUP153+/lamin B- extrusions from the nuclear envelope were observed in nuclei at the 8-cell stage. Cells at this stage show the longest interphase length of all stages, and consequently the lowest mitotic rate, during bovine preimplantation development [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This supports the interphase hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Role of nuclear envelope remodeling in nuclear import/export functions</title><p>Our data indicate a particularly high demand for NPCs in embryos preparing for and passing through MGA. During the first cell cycles preceding MGA, such a need may result from the necessity to re-import into newly formed daughter nuclei large amounts of maternally derived proteins or proteins synthesized <italic>de novo</italic> from maternal mRNAs. Invaginations in large nuclei at early preimplantation development covered with NPCs may also help to improve nuclear import and export functions by reducing the average distances of NPCs to chromatin in need of transcription, replication or repair but embedded deep in the nuclear interior [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>As already noted above (see <xref rid="sec010" ref-type="sec">Results</xref>), the clustering of NPCs prevented precise counts of individual nuclear pores even with the improved resolution of 3D-SIM (ca. 100 nm lateral and ca. 300 nm axial). This problem can be overcome by the application of other approaches of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy with still higher resolution (for review see [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]) or alternatively by use of electron microscopy (for review see [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]). One has to take into account that a quantitative determination of NPCs in fixed cells provides only snapshots. New approaches of live cell super-resolution imaging [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] have started to open future avenues for an understanding of the dynamics of NPC formation and distribution. A particularly high need for the synthesis of NPCs was further supported by our RNA-Seq data combined with microscopic observations, which revealed that <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of nucleoporin mRNAs was initiated at MGA but preceded by large deposits of maternal mRNAs and cytoplasmic NUP153 protein clusters.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>The changing distribution of cytoplasmic NUP153 positive clusters</title><p>Our microscopic observations demonstrate the presence of NUP153 positive clusters in the cytoplasm of pre-MGA blastomeres.

In contrast, NUP153 positive nuclear extrusions and vesicle-like structures exclusively located in close proximity to the nuclear envelope observed at and shortly after MGA may reflect a mechanism of nuclear envelope reduction, which occurs in line with nuclear volume reduction during preimplantation development.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Import/export functionality of NPC connections with the interchromatin compartment</title><p>In the absence of nuclear envelope invaginations, import/export functions are restricted to NPCs except for occasional observations of ribonucleoprotein particle export based on nuclear envelope budding [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In an envelope smoothly surrounding the nuclear periphery transcription factors entering the nucleus need to overcome distances of several &#x003bc;m in order to reach specific targets located in the nuclear interior. Considering the functional benefits of nuclear envelope invaginations covered with NPCs [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], one wonders why nuclear invaginations decreased in post-MGA embryos and were rarely detected in blastocyst nuclei and as a more general consideration, why such invaginations did not evolve as a structural feature of nuclei in all cell types and under all functional conditions? For an answer it is important to consider the role of NPCs not in isolation but in context with their connection to the interchromatin compartment (IC) [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The IC starts with channels at nuclear pores [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. These channels penetrate the layer of dense chromatin beneath the lamina and form a three-dimensionally interconnected channel system in the nuclear interior. The IC occupies the nuclear space between chromatin domain clusters (CDCs), which form the building blocks of chromosome territories [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Current evidence demonstrates that essential nuclear functions like transcription, DNA replication and repair occur in the periphery of CDCs, called the perichromatin compartment (PR) [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>The potential functional roles of the interconnected NPC-IC system in nuclear import/export have not yet been fully explored. Several lines of experimental evidence, however, suggest a role of the IC in guiding imported proteins, such as proteins involved in transcription, DNA replication, repair and chromatin modifications, towards chromatin embedded deep in the nuclear interior, as well as for the export of ribonucleoprotein particles carrying messenger RNAs towards NPCs. Mor et al. [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] have described evidence in favor of the hypothesis that interchromatin channels ensure &#x0201c;a steady and continuous wave of mRNPs travelling towards the NPC.&#x0201d; The observation that green fluorescent protein (GFP) diffuses normally within the IC but shows an anomalous diffusion in compact chromatin [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] is in line with the hypothesis that individual proteins may preferentially move within IC channels. This hypothesis is further supported by high resolution fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) of the mobility of inert monomers, trimers and pentamers of GFP, as well as GFP fusions with other proteins in nuclei of living cells [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Larger nuclear particles with a diameter of 100 nm show an obstructed diffusion in distinct corralled regions surrounded by dense chromatin regions [<xref rid="pone.0124619.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec025"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we argue that the NPC-IC system suffices in nuclei of many cell types to accomplish the needs of nuclear import/export functions even for chromatin embedded deep in the nuclear interior. An additional system of nuclear invaginations covered with NPCs may only be needed in case of extraordinary import/export demands. The case of nuclear envelope remodeling during bovine preimplantation development provides an example for the requirement of nuclear envelope invaginations in the very large nuclei at early preimplantation development but not in the much smaller nuclei at later stages.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec026"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0124619.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Changes of nuclear pore distributions during bovine preimplantation development.</title><p>Midplane sections recorded with confocal laser scanning microscopy (A, B) and 3D-SIM (C-I) from representative nuclei with DAPI-stained DNA (A1&#x02013;I1), immunostained lamin B (A2-I2) and NUP153 (A3-I3), as well as overlays of DAPI (grey), lamin B (green) and NUP153 (red) (A4-I4). <bold>Panel A</bold>.
