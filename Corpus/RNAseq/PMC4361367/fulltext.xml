This broad range of functions has stimulated much recent work on mechanisms that regulate the trafficking of proteins to and from the ciliary compartment [Hsiao et al., <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>]. Here we focus on the assembly pathway of axonemal outer dynein arms (ODAs), because they are the most abundant structural components of motile ciliary axonemes (next to tubulin itself), rely on intraflagellar transport (IFT) for their assembly [Hou et al., <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Ahmed et al., <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>] and thus serve as an easily assayed cargo for revealing essential properties of this trafficking machinery. In addition, loss of ciliary motility in the majority of human primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) cases has been linked to defects in axonemal dynein ATPase assembly [Lobo et al., <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>]. The genetic defects underlying these assembly errors occur in genes that encode dynein subunits themselves [Pennarun et al., <xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Olbrich et al., <xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Loges et al., <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>], axonemal docking site proteins [Panizzi et al., <xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Jerber et al., <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Hjeij et al., <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>], or proteins involved in cytoplasmic pre-assembly and transport of this ca. 2 mDa dynein motor [Omran et al., <xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Duquesnoy et al., <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Loges et al., <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Horani et al., <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Kott et al., <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Mitchison et al., <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Hjeij et al., <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Horani et al., <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Moore et al., <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Tarkar et al., <xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Zariwala et al., <xref rid="b61" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Onoufriadis et al., <xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>]. Thus the identification of conserved proteins important for ODA assembly provides new candidate genes for human PCD.</p><p>Most dynein assembly proteins were first identified by taking advantage of genetic analysis in the haploid unicellular alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, in which we and others have characterized nearly twenty loci needed for ODA assembly (<italic>oda</italic> loci). Most <italic>Chlamydomonas oda</italic> loci have been cloned, and their molecular identification and functional characterization have formed the basis for understanding the roles of their vertebrate homologs in the overall pathway of axonemal dynein assembly. The <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> ODA complex, as typical of ciliary ODA motors, consists of over 15 subunits, including three catalytic heavy chains, two intermediate chains, and at least 10 light chains. Although many <italic>oda</italic> loci encode one of these subunits, several encode assembly factors and have been useful in understanding the pathway of axonemal dynein assembly [Koutoulis et al., <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Takada et al., <xref rid="b52" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Casey et al., <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Wirschell et al., <xref rid="b57" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Freshour et al., <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Omran et al., <xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Mitchison et al., <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Dean and Mitchell, <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>]. We have now determined the molecular identity of one assembly locus that had not been previously cloned, <italic>oda8</italic>.</p><p>Over 25 years ago [Kamiya, <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>], analysis of genetic interactions among the many loci needed for assembly of ODAs in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> divided all loci identified at that time into three groups, on the basis of their non-complementation in temporary zygotic diploids (dikaryon analysis; see [Dutcher, <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>]). One group of such interacting loci is now known to encode subunits of the doublet-associated ODA docking complex (ODA-DC) [Fowkes and Mitchell, <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>], and a second group includes loci that encode either dynein arm subunits [Fowkes and Mitchell, <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>] or cytoplasmic proteins needed for dynein arm subunit stability and pre-assembly in the cytoplasm [Omran et al., <xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Duquesnoy et al., <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Mitchison et al., <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>]. The third group includes three loci, <italic>oda5, oda8</italic>, and <italic>oda10</italic>. Kamiya [<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>] reported poor complementation in dikaryons formed between <italic>oda5</italic> and <italic>oda10</italic> gametes and between <italic>oda8</italic> and <italic>oda10</italic> gametes, and somewhat reduced complementation between <italic>oda5</italic> and <italic>oda8</italic> gametes, whereas all three of these mutants fully complement with any of the other <italic>oda</italic> mutations analyzed. <italic>ODA5</italic> [Wirschell et al., <xref rid="b57" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>] and <italic>ODA10</italic> [Dean and Mitchell, <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>] both encode axonemal coiled-coil proteins with weak similarity to <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> DC subunits. The ODA5 protein was hypothesized to interact with ODA10 and form an accessory DC for doublet attachment of ODAs, and ODA8 was hypothesized to interact with this accessory complex [Wirschell et al., <xref rid="b57" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>], but we have recently determined that ODA10, unlike the ODA-DC, is not essential for dynein attachment to axonemal binding sites [Dean and Mitchell, <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>]. ODA5 and ODA10 assemble independently of the ODA-DC in flagella [Wirschell et al., <xref rid="b57" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Dean and Mitchell, <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>] and the ODA-DC also assembles normally in the flagella of <italic>oda5, oda8</italic> or <italic>oda10</italic> mutant strains [Takada and Kamiya, <xref rid="b51" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Wakabayashi et al., <xref rid="b56" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Wirschell et al., <xref rid="b57" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Owa et al., <xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>], so the failure of dynein assembly in these three mutants is clearly not due to lack of the ODA-DC. Here we report on the molecular identity of the <italic>ODA8</italic> locus, examine the basis of the genetic interaction of <italic>oda8</italic> with <italic>oda5</italic> and <italic>oda10</italic>, and clarify the stage of dynein assembly affected by these mutations. ODA8 has properties consistent with a role in the maturation and transport of ODA complexes during flagellar assembly, and depends on ODA5 and ODA10 for this function. We conclude that it belongs in a new category of assembly factors, those needed for cytoplasmic maturation of axonemal outer arm complexes into assembly-competent cargos for IFT-dependent transport, and into binding-competent complexes for attachment to doublet microtubules.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>ODA8 is an LRR Protein With a Conserved Dynein Assembly Function</title><p>The <italic>Chlamydomonas ODA8</italic> locus is defined by three allelic mutations that disrupt assembly of flagellar ODAs and map to the right arm of chromosome 1 [Kamiya, <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>]. To identify the <italic>ODA8</italic> gene, we tested molecular markers for proximity to <italic>oda8</italic> by following marker segregation in products from a genetic cross between an <italic>arg7, oda8</italic> strain and a polymorphic wild type strain. In six products with crossovers between <italic>arg7</italic> and <italic>oda8</italic>, crossovers were also observed between <italic>oda8</italic> and markers PBT302, GBP1 and RB47, but no crossovers were seen between <italic>oda8</italic> and CNA73 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>A). Based on our previous analysis of the relationship between genetic distance and physical distance in this region [Freshour et al., <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>], sequences within 200 kb of CNA73 were considered as candidates for <italic>ODA8</italic>, and genes in this interval were examined for characteristics of flagellar genes. Only one gene, located 100 kb telomeric to CNA73, was identified as a likely candidate based on the appearance of homologs only in organisms with motile cilia. This gene was designated as <italic>MOT37</italic> (Protein ID: 146778) by the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> genome project [Merchant et al., <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>]. Transformation of a 17.5 kb BAC clone (PTQ12187) that spans <italic>MOT37</italic> into an <italic>oda8</italic> strain fully rescued the motility and dynein assembly defects back to wild type, as did introduction of plasmids containing only the <italic>MOT37</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>B). As further confirmation that the <italic>oda8</italic> phenotype resulted from a mutation in <italic>MOT37</italic>, we sequenced fragments of the <italic>MOT37</italic> gene that were amplified from mutant DNA, and identified a frame-shift mutation in codon 35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>C) that results in a premature translational stop. Since less than 5% of the full length protein would be produced by this truncated coding region, the <italic>oda8-1</italic> allele should be considered a null mutation.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Molecular identification of the <italic>oda8</italic> locus.</p><p>(A) To positionally clone <italic>ODA8</italic>, based on its map location on the right arm of chromosome 1, the segregation of markers GBP1 and CNA73 was followed in six meiotic products with crossovers in the <italic>ARG7-ODA8</italic> interval.

Our analyses confirm the most recent sequence assembly (v5.0) and gene structure predictions for this gene, reported at Phytozome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phytozome.net">http://www.phytozome.net</ext-link>) as Cre01.g043650.t1, and show that the gene encodes a 921 residue leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein homologous to vertebrate LRRC56. No functional studies of LRRC56 members have been previously reported. Based on current nomenclature for dynein-related proteins in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> with LRRs, this gene is now formally designated <italic>DLU2</italic> [Hom et al., <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>]. For continuity, and to retain an association with its role in outer arm dynein assembly, we will refer to the locus as the <italic>ODA8</italic> locus and the encoded protein as ODA8. Two other LRR proteins have known roles in outer row dynein function, LC1 and ODA7. LC1 is a dynein light chain associated with an ODA heavy chain, HC&#x003b3; [Benashski et al., <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>], and is known to be essential for ODA assembly in trypanosomes [Baron et al., <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>] and ciliates [Kutomi et al., <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>], whereas ODA7 is a cytoplasmic factor essential for correct cytoplasmic pre-assembly of outer arm dynein [Duquesnoy et al., <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Mitchison et al., <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>]. However, the LRRC56 family does not appear to be closely related at the primary sequence level to either of these other LRR families.</p><p>Phylogenomic analyses can reveal potential roles of otherwise uncharacterized genes by showing retention or loss that coincides with that of other genes or characteristics [Briggs et al., <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>]. Such a plot for <italic>LRRC56/ODA8</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref> and Supporting Information Table I) shows that homologs are lost from organisms that lack motile cilia and retained in organisms with motile cilia, as expected, but with two notable exceptions. First, no ODA8 homologs are found in organisms that show secondary loss of ODAs, such as the mosses <italic>Selaginella moellendorffii</italic> and <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic>, consistent with a dedicated role in ODA assembly or function. Second, ODA8 homologs are also missing from organisms that retain outer arms but that do not require IFT for ciliary assembly, such as the diatom <italic>Thalassiosira pseudonanna</italic> or the apicomplexans <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> and <italic>Eimeria tenella</italic>. A similar pattern is seen for genes encoding IFT-associated outer arm dynein assembly adaptor WDR69/ODA16, but not for a docking complex subunit (DC2). We therefore sought to characterize the phenotype of <italic>oda8</italic> mutant cells and the biochemical properties of the ODA8 protein to see if they supported a hypothesized role for this gene product in IFT-dependent dynein assembly or alternatively, if the ODA8 protein functioned as previously hypothesized by interacting with ODA5 and ODA10 as part of an accessory DC on the surface of doublet microtubules [Kamiya, <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>, Fowkes and Mitchell, <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>, Wirschell et al., <xref rid="b57" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>].</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Phylogenomic distribution of ODA8/LRRC56 gene orthologs.</p><p>The presence of orthologs of genes important for ciliary assembly (IFT-A and IFT-B proteins), ODA assembly (ODA-DC2, ODA16 and ODA8) and axonemal dynein subunits (ODA, IDA-I1) is diagrammed in selected organisms spanning diverse eukaryotic clades.

This construct can rescue <italic>oda8</italic> mutant strains to wild type swimming velocity (150 &#x000b5;m/s for wild type (sd&#x02009;=&#x02009;38, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;37), 58 &#x000b5;m/s for <italic>oda8</italic> (sd&#x02009;=&#x02009;18, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;27), and 148 &#x000b5;m/s (sd&#x02009;=&#x02009;30, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;19) for <italic>oda8</italic> rescued with the tagged gene), normal flagellar beat frequency and wild type ODA assembly levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figs. 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>B). When such tagged cells (hereafter <italic>WT*</italic> cells) were deflagellated and the relative abundance of ODA8 in flagella vs. deflagellated cell bodies (CB) was examined, about 50-fold more protein was found in cytoplasmic fractions than in flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>C). This distribution is similar to that of IFT-associated assembly factor ODA16 and IFT-B subunit IFT46, but unlike that of axonemal ODA intermediate chain subunit IC2 or cytoplasmic protein NAB1. Based on this distribution, ODA8 is likely to have a specific function in both cytoplasmic and flagellar compartments.</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>ODA8 distribution is similar to that of transport factors.</p><p>(A) HA-tagged ODA8 expressed from an integrated transgene rescues the beat frequency (bf) of <italic>oda8</italic> cells to wild type levels (&#x0223c;60 Hz), and the expressed protein migrates at &#x0223c;104 kDa on blots of transformant <italic>oda8::ODA8HA (WT*)</italic> whole cell protein samples.

Samples of whole cells (WC), deflagellated CB and flagella (FL) from equal numbers of cells (1:1) and with flagella at 50-fold excess (50:1) were probed with the indicated antibodies. ODA8HA abundance ratios are similar to those of IFT-B subunit IFT46 and IFT-associated transport factor ODA16, not those of ODA subunits such as IC2. Anti-NAB1, which recognizes a 26 kDa cytoplasmic protein, was used as a loading control in A and C.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cm0072-0016-f3"/></fig><p>To test the prediction that ODA8 is dependent on ODA5 and ODA10 for its flagellar localization, we constructed strains that carry <italic>oda5</italic> or <italic>oda10</italic> mutations, as well as the <italic>oda8</italic> mutation, and that express the ODA8HA transgene (designated <italic>oda5*</italic> and <italic>oda10*</italic>).

Flagella of <italic>oda6, oda8</italic> cells expressing ODA8HA (<italic>oda6*</italic>), which lack ODAs due to the <italic>oda6</italic> mutation (a null mutation in the IC2 gene) do not show a reduction in the amount of ODA8HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>B) confirming that the reduced level of ODA8HA in <italic>oda5*</italic> and <italic>oda10*</italic> flagella is specifically due to the <italic>oda5</italic> and <italic>oda10</italic> mutations and not due to absence of outer arm dynein. To see if the reduced levels of ODA8HA in <italic>oda5*</italic> and <italic>oda10*</italic> flagella could be due to instability of ODA8 in the absence of ODA5 or ODA10, we blotted cytoplasmic extracts of the <italic>oda5*</italic> and <italic>oda10*</italic> strains and probed for HA.

Instead, the ODA5 and ODA10 proteins must play a role in the transport and/or anchoring of ODA8 in flagella.</p><fig id="fig04" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Interacting mutants alter ODA8 distribution.</p><p>(A) Blots of flagella from <italic>WT</italic>* and from doublet mutant <italic>oda5, oda8</italic> and <italic>oda10, oda8</italic> strains that express ODA8HA (<italic>oda5*</italic> and <italic>oda10*</italic>) were probed with antibodies to HA and IC2.

When flagellar membranes were removed by treatment with 0.8% non-ionic octylglucoside detergent (OG), over half of ODA8HA became soluble but a substantial fraction remained with the axonemal pellet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>A, OG lanes). When this pellet was treated serially with two additional OG treatments, no additional ODA8HA appeared in supernatant fractions. Thus ODA8HA is present in both detergent soluble (membrane&#x02009;+&#x02009;matrix) and insoluble (axonemal) pools of flagellar proteins. To test if ODA8HA in the membrane&#x02009;+&#x02009;matrix fractions is associated with the membrane, matrix or both, flagella from <italic>WT*</italic> cells were treated to freeze/thaw cycles, which physically disrupt membrane integrity and release matrix proteins without solubilizing most of the membrane proteins.

Subsequent treatment of the F/T pellet with detergent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>A, F/T+OG lanes) failed to release additional ODA8HA.

If such a modification occurred during transport to flagellar assembly sites, or at the time of final assembly onto doublet microtubules, ODA complexes in the cytoplasm might have axonemal binding properties that were not yet affected by lack of ODA8. In wild type cytoplasm, ODAs have pre-assembled into complexes that contain all five major ODA subunits [Fowkes and Mitchell, <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>], and these complexes can bind to <italic>oda2</italic> mutant axonemes (which lack ODAs due to an outer arm dynein heavy chain defect) <italic>in vitro</italic> [Ahmed et al., <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>B, dynein from <italic>oda8</italic> mutant cytoplasm contains normal or slightly elevated levels of the major outer arm dynein subunits, consistent with our previous analyses [Fowkes and Mitchell, <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>]. To see if these proteins are assembled into a form that can bind to outer doublet docking sites, extract samples containing equal amounts of ODA subunits were incubated, at a 2:1 stoichiometric ratio, with axonemes from <italic>oda8</italic> or from ODA heavy chain mutant <italic>oda2</italic>. After 1 h on ice, axonemes were pelleted, resuspended briefly in buffer, re-pelleted, and prepared as gel samples. Immunoblots of these samples showed much less IC2 bound from <italic>oda8</italic> cell extracts than from wild type cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>C). Multiple experiments produced a range of values for the relative amount of IC2 bound from <italic>oda8</italic> extracts that varied from 8% to 25% of the wild type levels, based on quantification of signals by either densitometry of films or direct measurement of chemiluminescent signals using a digital detector. In contrast, little difference was seen between binding to <italic>oda2</italic> vs. <italic>oda8</italic> axonemes, regardless of the source of extract. These results suggested that ODA8 might play a role during the maturation of dynein in the cytoplasm into an assembly-competent complex, and prompted a re-examination of the assembly state of ODA proteins in <italic>oda8</italic> cytoplasm.</p><p>We reported previously that at least five ODA subunits (three heavy chains and two intermediate chains) have pre-assembled in the <italic>oda8</italic> cytoplasm, based on their co-immunoprecipitation with an antibody to one heavy chain, HC&#x003b2; [Fowkes and Mitchell, <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>]. More recently, however, analysis of the assembly state of ODAs in the cytoplasm of the <italic>Chlamydomonas pf22</italic> mutant (which is defective in a cytoplasmic assembly factor) led to the unanticipated result that our anti-HC&#x003b2; monoclonal antibody was unable to interact with its target epitope in non-denatured extracts of this mutant strain, even though HC&#x003b2; is present in the cytoplasm at normal abundance [Mitchison et al., <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>]. In that study, we used an IC2 subunit modified to contain a single internal HA tag as an alternative target for IP purification of ODA complexes. To improve IP purifications and further assure that the IP tag has no affect on dynein assembly or function, we have now created another tagged IC2 gene construct, driven by a cloned copy of the endogenous IC2 promoter, in which three MYC epitopes were appended to the 3' end of the IC2 coding region. Cells that express this gene in an IC2 null background (<italic>oda6</italic>) showed wild type levels of IC2 assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>D), and normal flagellar motility, consistent with a recent report of a similarly tagged IC2 gene [Oda et al., <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>]. We then introduced the <italic>oda8</italic> mutation into this IC2-MYC tagged strain and used an anti-MYC monoclonal antibody to IP the IC2-MYC protein from cytoplasmic extracts. IP of IC2 from <italic>oda8</italic> cytoplasm resulted in co-precipitation of IC1 and all three ODA heavy chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>E). The amount of IC1 co-precipitated was identical in wild type and <italic>oda8</italic> samples, however, the amount of each heavy chain co-precipitated from <italic>oda8</italic> cytoplasm was reduced to about half of its wild type level. Therefore, ODA subunits in <italic>oda8</italic> cytoplasm either have not fully assembled, or they have assembled into complexes that partially dissociate during the immunopurification wash steps. Taken together, these data show that ODA complexes in <italic>oda8</italic> cytoplasm have not pre-assembled to the same extent as in wild type cytoplasm, and cannot bind with normal affinity to axonemal docking sites. Therefore at least one function for the ODA8 protein involves a step in the cytoplasm that must be completed in order for assembled dynein complexes to interact productively with binding sites on axonemes, either <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we provide evidence that the <italic>Chlamydomonas DLU2</italic> gene, previously identified by comparative genomic analysis as <italic>MOT37</italic> [Merchant et al., <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>] and as encoding a homolog of vertebrate LRRC56, is mutated in <italic>oda8</italic>. The distribution of this gene is not uniform among all organisms with motile cilia or flagella. Instead, LRRC56 homologs have been lost both in species that do not have ODAs and also in species that retain ODAs but that do not depend on IFT for axonemal assembly, supporting a role for this protein in IFT-based dynein transport. Further support for this view comes from analysis of amoeboid to flagellate transformation in <italic>Naegleria</italic>, where expression studies identified an ODA8 homolog (Friggin) as the product of a gene upregulated early during ciliogenesis, along with some axonemal and many centriole-associated proteins [Fritz-Laylin and Cande, <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>]. When expressed exogenously in cultured HeLa and U2OS cell lines, Friggin associated specifically with mother centrioles, a pattern that may reflect an IFT-related localization, since IFT proteins are also enriched around basal bodies [Cole et al., <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>] and mother centrioles [Goetz et al., <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>].</p><p>The overall fractionation of ODA8 between the flagellar and cytoplasmic compartments in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> is typical of IFT subunits, and of IFT-associated ODA assembly factor ODA16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>C), supporting the possible involvement of ODA8 in an IFT-dependent step in ODA assembly. However, the distribution of ODA8 during flagellar fractionation departs from that of typical IFT proteins, as about half of ODA8 remains axoneme-associated whereas most IFT subunits [Cole et al. <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>] and ODA16 [Ahmed and Mitchell, <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>] fractionate as matrix components. IFT proteins and ODA16 both have a very characteristic distribution by immunofluorescence analysis, with a high concentration of protein around basal bodies and a patchy distribution along flagella. Unfortunately the apparently much lower absolute concentration of ODA8HA has so far prevented use of this approach to determine whether ODA8 has a similar distribution. ODA16 supports ODA assembly through a specific interaction with an IFT-B protein, IFT46 [Hou et al., <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Ahmed et al., <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>], and has been described as an adaptor protein to aid ODA transport by IFT, although an actual direct interaction between ODA complexes and ODA16, or between ODA complexes and IFT complexes, has not yet been observed, and so the exact role of ODA16 in promoting ODA trafficking remains to be explored. ODA8 does not appear to function in precisely the same process as ODA16, however, as we [Ahmed and Mitchell, <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>] have shown that <italic>oda16</italic> complements in dikaryons with <italic>oda5</italic>, <italic>oda8</italic> and <italic>oda10</italic> mutations. In addition, the flagellar abundance of ODA16 was not altered by the loss of ODA8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>A), thus the ODA assembly defect in <italic>oda8</italic> flagella is not directly due to a disruption of the interaction between ODA16 and IFT particles. Finally, our previous result that dynein from the cytoplasm of <italic>oda16</italic> cells binds similarly to dynein from wild type cytoplasm onto <italic>oda2</italic> axonemes <italic>in vitro</italic> [Ahmed et al., <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>], whereas dynein from <italic>oda8</italic> cytoplasm does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>C), also shows that the role of ODA8 is different from the role of ODA16, and suggests that ODA8 functions at an earlier step than ODA16 in the pathway of dynein assembly. One other ODA assembly factor has been localized to the matrix compartment, FBB18, but unlike ODA8 or ODA16, FBB18 accumulates to higher than wild type levels in mutants with impaired motility, including various <italic>oda</italic> strains [Austin-Tse et al., <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>]. It thus appears that late stages of ODA assembly require several factors that may work independently of each other, and that define previously uncharacterized steps in ODA assembly.</p><p>Localization of ODA8 to flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>C) and the dependence of this flagellar localization on the <italic>ODA5</italic> and <italic>ODA10</italic> gene products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>A) are both consistent with a function for ODA8 in dynein assembly that could depend upon a physical interaction with ODA5 and ODA10 [Kamiya, <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Fowkes and Mitchell, <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Wirschell et al., <xref rid="b57" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Dean and Mitchell, <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>]. However, distribution of ODA8 nearly equally between axonemal and matrix fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>A) departs from those expectations, as neither ODA5 [Wirshcell et al., 2004] nor ODA10 [Dean and Mitchell, <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>] appear in matrix fractions. In addition, ODA10 (unlike ODA8) shows nearly equal abundance in flagella and cytoplasm [Dean and Mitchell, <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>], and a very low level of ODA8 is still present in flagella of <italic>oda5</italic> and <italic>oda10</italic> mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>A). Since ODA8 is present in near-normal levels in flagella of outer arm dynein subunit mutant <italic>oda6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>B), the near-absence of ODA8 from <italic>oda5</italic> and <italic>oda10</italic> flagella is not due to absence of outer arm dynein in flagella but due more specifically to the <italic>oda5</italic> and <italic>oda10</italic> mutations. These findings can be reconciled if interaction between ODA8 and an ODA5/10 complex occurs primarily in the cytoplasm rather than in the flagellum.</p><p>Binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>A) indicate that strong attachment of ODAs to axonemes under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions does not need ODA8, even though ODA8 is essential for normal assembly of ODAs onto axonemes <italic>in vivo</italic>. We [Dean and Mitchell, <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>] have shown that ODA10, although extracted from axonemes by half molar salt along with dynein, separates from dynein during sucrose gradient sedimentation and is also not needed for <italic>in vitro</italic> binding of outer arm dynein to axonemes. One possible explanation of these binding results would be that dynein is modified during <italic>in vivo</italic> assembly into a form that no longer requires ODA8 or ODA10 for axonemal re-binding. Such a modification could conceptually be done in the cytoplasm, during transport to the flagellar assembly sites, or at the time of final assembly onto doublet microtubules. Based on the greatly reduced ability of dynein present in <italic>oda8</italic> cytoplasmic extracts to bind onto axonemes, and on the reduced level of heavy chains seen to co-IP with intermediate chains from cytoplasmic extracts of <italic>oda8</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>C), we conclude that the initial role of ODA8 occurs during maturation of dynein in the cytoplasm and before its transport into the flagellar compartment. As discussed above, the presence of some ODA8 in flagellar matrix fractions, the similarity of its distribution between flagella and CB to that of IFT proteins, and the phylogenomic distribution of ODA8 homologs, all argue that this protein may also function during IFT-dependent ODA assembly steps, which could include attachment of ODAs to IFT complexes at the flagellar base as well as co-transport with ODAs during their IFT-dependent entry into flagella.</p><p>Our working hypothesis is that ODA8 functions as an assembly factor in the cytoplasm and enables dynein to attain a form that is competent for transport and binding, and in turn ODA5 and ODA10 are needed for ODA8 function, and aid ODA8 transport to the flagellar compartment. A diagram that summarizes these relationships, and further speculates on specific functions of other dynein assembly factors, is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8</xref>. Here we hypothesize that the ODA5/10 complex, which likely resembles the ODA-DC, could act as a scaffold to aid interaction of ODA8 with an unstable ODA intermediate and generate a stable ODA complex in the cytoplasm. This step could occur earlier in the assembly process than shown in the diagram and still be consistent with available data. The presence of ODA8 is hypothesized to be essential for interaction of ODA complexes with IFT particles, which in turn depends on the exposed N-terminal domain of IFT46 [Hou et al., <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Taschner et al., <xref rid="b54" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>], represented by a hook on the IFT complex in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8</xref>. IFT transport is enhanced by IFT46-interacting adaptor ODA16 [Ahmed et al., <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>], which depends on IFT but not on ODA8 for flagellar localization. Other cytoplasmic factors that may function during early steps include Rvbl1/2 (Pontin/Reptin) [Zhao et al., <xref rid="b62" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>], HEATR2 [Horani et al., <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>], LRRC6 [Kott et al., <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Horani et al., <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Moore et al., <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Zariwala et al., <xref rid="b61" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Zhao et al., <xref rid="b62" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>], ZMYND10 [Moore et al., <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Zariwala et al., <xref rid="b61" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>] and DYX1C1 [Tarkar et al., <xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>], but only HEATR2 function has been assessed in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and the stage at which it functions has not been determined. Difficult to reconcile with this model is the observed independent transport of ODA5, ODA8 and ODA10 into flagella in the absence of ODAs, and of ODA5 and ODA10 in the absence of ODA8. Additional work will be needed to determine whether ODA8 physically interacts with ODA5 or ODA10, either in the cytoplasm or the flagellum, and whether ODA8 plays a direct role in IFT-mediated ODA transport.</p><fig id="fig08" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Diagram summarizing hypothesized steps in ODA assembly and transport, and a proposed role for ODA8.</p><p>Initial synthesis of ODA subunits and dimerization of intermediate chains is followed by folding and co-assembly of heavy chains with intermediate chains, dependent on the action of ODA7 [Duquesnoy et al., <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>] and PF13 [Omran et al., <xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>]. Several other cytoplasmic dynein assembly factors may function at this step. Exposure of a heavy chain epitope in a PF22-dependent step [Mitchison et al., <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>] is modeled as chaperone removal. ODA8 transforms an assembled, but unstable intermediate into a stable cytoplasmic storage form, which is then able to interact with IFT particles, aided by IFT-associated assembly factor ODA16. An ODA5/10 complex is hypothesized to interact with ODAs in the cytoplasm and aid ODA8 function. Once ODAs are transported to flagella, they are released from IFT particles, dissociate from ODA5/10 and ODA8, and bind through interaction of the IC dimer with ODA-DC complexes that have assembled independently on A-tubules of outer doublets.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cm0072-0016-f8"/></fig><p>ODA8/LRRC56 represents an addition to a rapidly expanding list of factors needed for ODA assembly.

Relatively less is known about specific interactions of axonemal assembly cargos with IFT particles [Bhogaraju et al., <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>], but the analysis of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> assembly defective mutants suggest that the IFT-associated DYF13 protein may aid transport of several inner dynein arms, and possibly other motility-related proteins [Ishikawa et al., <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>] and additional loci are important for trafficking of I1 inner dynein arms [Viswanadha et al., <xref rid="b55" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>], and radial spokes [Alford et al., <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>], and the LC8 protein has been specifically implicated in late stages of radial spoke assembly and binding onto axonemal docking sites [Diener et al., <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Gupta et al., <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>]. Continued analysis of these assembly pathways should ultimately identify common themes in IFT-dependent flagellar assembly.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Strains and Culture</title><p><italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> wild-type strains 137c, RFLP strain S1D2, and mutant strains <italic>arg7</italic>, <italic>oda5</italic>, <italic>oda6</italic>, <italic>oda8</italic>, and <italic>oda10</italic> were obtained from the Chlamydomonas Genetics Center (Univ. Minn., St. Paul, MN). Mutant strains <italic>pf28</italic> (an allele of <italic>oda2</italic>) and <italic>oda16</italic> were generated in previous studies and are available from the Genetics Center. Double mutant strains were created by standard crosses and tetrad analysis. Additional crosses were used to introduce epitope tagged genes (ODA8HA, IC2MYC) into these mutant backgrounds. All strains were maintained on agar solidified minimal M medium supplemented as needed with 0.05% <sc>l</sc>-arginine. For high-density liquid cultures and for transformation experiments, cells were grown on acetate-enriched minimal medium.</p></sec><sec><title>Cloning and Epitope Tagging</title><p>To initiate a walk to the <italic>ODA8</italic> locus, strain <italic>oda8arg7</italic> was crossed with wild type strain S1D2, and random <italic>oda8</italic> progeny were selected on minimal medium. All selected strains contain a crossover between the <italic>ARG7</italic> and <italic>ODA8</italic> loci, which are separated by about 15 cM on chromosome 1. DNA prepared from these strains was used for genomic Southern blots or for amplification with marker-specific primers to map the relative positions of molecular markers and <italic>oda8</italic>. All markers used (CNA73, GBP1 and PBT302) have been previously described [Kathir et al., <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>].</p><p>Genomic sequences surrounding the CNA73 marker, as reported in the JGI <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> genome sequence version 2.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.jgi-psf.org/chlre2/chlre2.home.html">http://genome.jgi-psf.org/chlre2/chlre2.home.html</ext-link>), were examined to identify candidate <italic>ODA8</italic> genes, and a BAC clone spanning the MOT37 gene was used to transform an <italic>oda8arg7</italic> strain. After determining that 17.5 kb BAC clone PTQ12187 (= 32F23 in plate/well nomenclature) could rescue the <italic>oda8</italic> mutation, smaller genomic clones were isolated by hybridization screening of a phage genomic library in EMBL4 with a BAC fragment. An 8.9 kb <italic>Bam HI-Bam HI</italic> fragment and a 6.8 kb <italic>XmaI-BamHI</italic> fragment that spanned the predicted gene were subcloned from a phage into pBlusescript II (Stratagene) to create pODA8B-B and pODA8X-B. The intron/exon structure of this gene was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (primer sequences available on request) and by examination of RNA-Seq data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genomes.mcdb.ucla.edu/Cre454/">http://genomes.mcdb.ucla.edu/Cre454/</ext-link>).</p><p>To add seqeunces encoding three copies of the HA epitope tag to the C-terminus of the <italic>ODA8</italic> coding region, the 3'portion of the gene was cloned as a 2.9 kb <italic>Sph</italic>I-<italic>Hin</italic>dIII fragment into vector pSP72 and a <italic>Stu</italic>I restriction site was introduced near the end of the coding sequence using a QuickChange Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The 3' UTR was remove by <italic>Stu</italic>I-<italic>Hin</italic>dIII digestion and replaced by a 735 bp <italic>Stu</italic>I-<italic>Hin</italic>dIII fragment from plasmid pGenLinkerHA, spanning three HA epitopes and the 3' end of the <italic>PsaD</italic> gene [Duquesnoy et al., <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>]. The 5' end of the <italic>ODA8</italic> gene was then introduced between <italic>Eco</italic> RI and <italic>Sph</italic>I sites to create plasmid pODA8HA.</p><p>Constructs encoding IC2 tagged with one copy of the HA epitope, which are expressed from the native IC2 promoter, have been previously described [Mitchison et al., <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>]. To create an IC2 with three copies of the Myc epitope at the C-terminus, the IC2-HA construct was opened at a unique <italic>BamHI</italic> site near the stop codon, and a fragment encoding three copies of a Myc epitope in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> codon bias, synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA), was inserted using a Gibson overlap cloning kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). A 1038 bp <italic>NdeI &#x02013; NheI</italic> restriction fragement spanning the HA epitope was removed and replaced with the identical length fragment from an untagged copy of the gene. As expressed, the last 15 residues of IC2 are replaced by a 9 amino acid linker followed by the three Myc epitopes.</p><p>Flagellar beat frequency of strains expressing transgenes was measured by tuning the flash rate of a stroboscopic illumination source while imaging cells under darkfield with a Zeiss Axioskop (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Swimming speed was determined from video files collected at 30 fps with a 10x objective under darkfield illumination, using CellTrak 1.5 software (Motion Analysis, Santa Rosa, CA).</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence Comparisons</title><p>To identify ODA8 orthologs, <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> protein sequences were used for BLASTp searches of representative eukaryotic genomes at NCBI including <italic>Dictyostelim discoideum, Batrachochytrium dendrobatitis, Homo sapiens, Ciona intestinalis, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Selaginella moellendorffi, Physcomitrella patens, Ostreococcus lucimarinus, Plasmodium flaciparum, Eimeria tenella, Thalassiosira pseudonanna, Phytophthora infestans</italic>, and <italic>Naegleria gruberi</italic>. The highest hits were used for a reciprocal BLASTp screen of the <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> genome to identify orthologs. Weak hits with the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> sequence were also tested against the <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> genome. When no significant hit was found in a selected genome, the initial BLASTp search was repeated with the genomes of closely related genera (when available) to account for potential errors in genomic sequence assemblies. All results were categorized as significant (showing the presence of an ortholog) only if a single high-scoring sequence was observed and it generated a reciprocal best hit in the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> genome. The E-value scores are reported in Supporting Information Table I. Sequences with relatively weak <italic>E</italic>-value scores were still selected as orthologs if they generated a reciprocal best hit in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, but their greater sequence divergence was noted through color coding of results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref> and Supporting Information Table I.</p></sec><sec><title>Flagellar Isolation and Fractionation, and ODA Binding Assays</title><p>Cells grown in liquid meduim were concentrated on a Pellicon filtration apparatus (Millipore Corp, Bedford, MA) and deflagellated by treatment with dibucaine as previously described [Witman <xref rid="b58" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>]. All subsequent steps were at 4&#x000b0;C or on ice. Flagella were purified by differential centrifugation and rinsed once in HMDEK (30 mM Hepes, 5 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EGTA, 25 mM potassium acetate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4) before preparation for SDS-PAGE (or further fractionation). To remove membranes, flagella were resuspended in HMDEK and then mixed with an equal volume of HMDEK containing a detergent, either nonidet-P40 (Fluka) or octylglucopyranoside (Sigma) as indicated in the &#x0201c;Results&#x0201d; section. After trituration with a micropipet, samples were pelleted in a microfuge at top speed for 10 min. For gel analysis pellets were resuspended to the same volume as supernatant solutions and mixed with an equal volume of 2&#x000d7; SDS sample buffer. For dynein extraction, demembranated axonemes were resuspended in HMDEK supplemented with the indicated concentrations of salts. All extractions proceeded for 30 min on ice, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at top speed (16,000<italic>g</italic>) in a microfuge. Salt extracts were dialyzed vs. HMDEK and clarified (16,000<italic>g</italic>, 20 min) before further use in binding assays.</p><p>To compare the abundance of proteins in CB and flagella, cells were deflagellated by pH shock [Lefebvre, <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>]. Whole cell (WC) and cell body samples for blotting were precipitated with acetone and dissolved in 1&#x000d7; SDS sample buffer. Soluble cytoplasmic extracts for blotting and immunoprecipitation were prepared by glass bead homogenization of protoplasts, as previously described [Ahmed and Mitchell, <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>].</p><p>Dynein binding assays were performed in HMDEK by mixing a fixed volume of axonemes with a fixed volume of an ODA containing extract. All extracts for a given experiment were adjusted to the same concentration of the ODA IC2 subunit, based on preliminary blot analysis. Because the two intermediate chains (IC1 and IC2) of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> ODA complexes interact as a heterodimer [Mitchell and Rosenbaum, <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>], form the main interaction site of ODA complexes with axonemal binding sites [King et al., <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Owa et al., <xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>], but fail to bind tightly to axonemes unless tightly complexed with both beta and gamma heavy chains [Takada and Kamiya, <xref rid="b51" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>], the amount of IC2 bound was used as a measure of ODA binding. After incubation for 1 h on ice, axonemes were pelleted and prepared directly for SDS-PAGE, or washed in HMDEK before sample preparation, as noted in the Results section. Blots of bound proteins were probed for IC2.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitation and Blotting</title><p>Dynein heavy chains (average <italic>M</italic><sub>r</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;500,000) and Benchmark Protein Ladder (Life Technologies) were used as protein size standards. For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp). Rabbit anti-NAB1 was purchased from Agrisera (Vannas, Sweden). Affinity-purified rabbit anti-HC&#x003b1; [Fowkes and Mitchell, <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>] and anti-ODA16 [Ahmed and Mitchell, <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>], and mouse monoclonal anti-HC&#x003b2;, anti-IC1 and anti-IC2 [Mitchell and Rosenbaum, <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>] have been previously described. Monoclonal anti-HC&#x003b3; [King et al., <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>] was provided by Steven King (Univ.

HA epitopes were detected with rat monoclonal 3F10 (Roche), Myc epitopes with mouse monoclonal 9E 10 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Univ. Iowa) and acetylated tubulin with mouse monoclonal 6-11B-1 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Antibodies were detected with peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (Sigma) using Clarity Western ECL reagents (BioRad, Hercules, CA) and detected either by radiography on film, or with a digital camera on a Chemidoc MP Imager (Bio-Rad). Relative band intensity was determined using Chemidoc software. For immunoprecipitations, extracts were diluted with HMDEK50 buffer (HMDEK with the concentration of KAc increased to 50 mM) to provide equal concentrations of the target antigen, and pre-cleared with un-derivitized agarose beads. IC2-MYC was precipitated by incubation of extracts for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C with Anti-Myc 9E 10 pre-coupled to agarose beads (Sigma), washed, and released from beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Blotted proteins were detected with True Blot secondary antibodies (Rockland Immunochemicals, Limerick, PA).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Initial mapping work was completed with contributions from William Houser, Kimberly Brown and Ruth Yokoyama.
