However, previous reports have described Foxp3 expression in other cell types including some subsets of macrophages, although there are conflicting reports and Foxp3 expression in cells other than Treg is not well characterized. We performed detailed investigations into Foxp3 expression in macrophages in the normal tissue and tumor settings. We detected Foxp3 protein in macrophages infiltrating mouse renal cancer tumors injected subcutaneously or in the kidney. Expression was demonstrated using flow cytometry and Western blot with two individual monoclonal antibodies. Further analyses confirmed Foxp3 expression in macrophages by RT PCR, and studies using ribonucleic acid-sequencing (RNAseq) demonstrated a previously unknown Foxp3 messenger (m)RNA transcript in tumor-associated macrophages. In addition, depletion of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells using diphtheria toxin in Foxp3<italic><sup>DTR</sup></italic> mice reduced the frequency of type-2 macrophages (M2) in kidney tumors. Collectively, these results indicate that tumor-associated macrophages could express Foxp3.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Program Grant #1013667 from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia, and by Project Grant #1006209 from the Cancer Council of Victoria.

In these latter studies, the authors were unable to detect Foxp3 in naive or activated macrophages, but a detailed investigation in the tumor setting was not performed. Nevertheless, Foxp3 expression in other cell types remains highly controversial and is still fiercely debated. In the present study we confirmed a lack of expression of Foxp3 in normal macrophages, but we observed Foxp3 expression in macrophages infiltrating mouse renal cell carcinoma tumors. Using multiple assays, our observations indicate that Foxp3 can be expressed in tumor-associated macrophages.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell Lines, mice and tumors</title><p>BALB/c wild-type (WT), SCID mice and Foxp3<italic><sup>DTR</sup></italic> mice were bred and maintained at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre.

To further characterize the M2 macrophages infiltrating IK tumors in our tumor model, we investigated the expression of several markers associated with immunosuppression including Foxp3. We initially performed flow cytometry with a routinely used anti-Foxp3 antibody, clone FJK-16S (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), which recognizes an epitope between amino-acids (AA) 75 and 125 of the Foxp3 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108670-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>). Our analysis revealed that M2 cells, gated on F4/80<sup>hi</sup>/CD11b<sup>int</sup>, were mainly positive for Foxp3 expression in both SC and IK Renca tumors compared to F4/80<sup>int</sup>/CD11b<sup>hi</sup> type-1 macrophages (M1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108670-g001"><bold>Figure 1B, C</bold></xref>).

To prevent contamination in the fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) coming from TReg cells, we initially gated on CD45.2<sup>+</sup>/TCR<sup>neg</sup> cells. Flow cytometric analysis using clone NRRF-30 demonstrated again that the majority of M2 and some M1, infiltrating IK tumors, express Foxp3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108670-g001"><bold>Figure 1D, E</bold></xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0108670-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0108670.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Foxp3 protein detected in macrophages using two different Foxp3 antibody clones recognizing different epitopes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of Foxp3 protein with different known domains in Foxp3 protein: Zn f (Zinc finger), L Z (leucine zipper), FKH (Forkhead domain), N and C (respectively N terminal and C terminal extremities of the protein) and the amino-acid epitopes 1 to 75 for anti-Foxp3 antibody clone NRRF-30 and 75 to 125 for anti-Foxp3 antibody clone FJK16S (according to eBioscience datasheet).

This result was repeated in Western blots on M2 cells, performed using the other antibody with a discrete epitope, clone NRRF-30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108670-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). Together, these results suggest that M2 macrophages could potentially express Foxp3 protein. We hypothesize that the heavier size of the Foxp3 protein in the M2 compared to CD4<sup>+</sup> cells could be due to post-translational modifications. Alternatively, it is possible that a variant mRNA was responsible for the 65 KDa protein in macrophages.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Foxp3 detection is specific for macrophages in tumor-bearing mice</title><p>In order to assess whether Foxp3 expression was specific for macrophages from Renca tumors, we performed flow cytometric analysis on macrophages and other cell subsets from normal kidney, bone marrow (BM) and spleen harvested from na&#x000ef;ve mice and IK tumor-bearing mice. TRegs were stained as a positive control, and we always detected Foxp3 expression in these cells isolated from all organs, demonstrating that Foxp3 antibody staining was effective in all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108670-g002"><bold>Figure 2A, B</bold></xref><bold> first line</bold>). We readily detected Foxp3 expression in macrophages (F4/80<sup>+</sup>/CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells) from IK tumors at lower level than TRegs. In addition, low level Foxp3 staining was observed in macrophages from BM or spleen in tumor-bearing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108670-g002"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref><bold> second line</bold>).

Furthermore, we did not detect any Foxp3 expression in other myeloid cells (F4/80<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells) or in dendritic cells (DCs) or B cells from organs in na&#x000ef;ve or IK tumor-bearing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108670-g002"><bold>Figure 2A, B</bold></xref>).

We compared FACS staining using the previous isotype control, clone eBr2a, and another isotype control clone (clone R35-95, BD Bioscience) on TRegs from na&#x000ef;ve spleen and myeloid cells from na&#x000ef;ve BM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108670-g002"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref>).

We provide evidence of Foxp3 expression at the protein level using antibody-based detection techniques. Two different antibodies, available commercially, with non-overlapping epitopes on the Foxp3 protein (clone FJK-16S AA75-AA125 and clone NRRF-30 AA1-AA75), recognise Foxp3 in Renca tumor infiltrating macrophages, mainly in the M2 population. In addition, a protein blast between sequence AA1 to AA125 of Foxp3 protein and the entire <italic>UniProt</italic> database from multiple animal species (<italic>NCBI Blast</italic>: Protein Sequence) did not identify any significant homology between other proteins and AA1 to AA125 of the Foxp3 protein. Finally, Foxp3 protein was not observed in myeloid cells other than macrophages, supporting the idea of a specific Foxp3 protein detection in tumor-associated macrophages.</p><p>Surprisingly, we identified that the Foxp3 protein present in macrophages, exhibited a molecular weight of approximately 65 KDa, higher than the 54 kDa normally expected. We hypothesise that this apparent larger size of the Foxp3 protein may involve some post-translational modifications. Indeed, some post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination or sumoylation, that often occur on transcription factors <xref rid="pone.0108670-Hochstrasser1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108670-GeissFriedlander1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, could potentially explain the extra 10 to 15 kDa of Foxp3 in the macrophages.</p><p>The initial <italic>JEM</italic> retracted article described the expression of Foxp3 in macrophages infiltrating various organs in a naive context <xref rid="pone.0108670-XX1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The controversy concerning expression of Foxp3 in cells other than Treg continued in other studies, but the tumor setting was minimally investigated <xref rid="pone.0108670-Mayer2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108670-Put1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In line with these two latest studies, we did not detect Foxp3 in macrophages from naive spleen, BM and kidney. However, when we investigate a Renca kidney tumor setting, we detected Foxp3 expression in macrophages infiltrating the tumors.</p><p>Foxp3 expression following a M2-phagocytosis of the protein expressed by the surrounding tumoral TRegs appears unlikely as we still detected Foxp3 in M2 from SCID mice that lack TRegs. Furthermore, M2 were depleted from the IK tumors in the Foxp3<italic><sup>DTR</sup></italic> mouse model, implying that in those mice, Foxp3 and DTR were expressed by M2. Nonetheless, we were not able to detect any GFP expression in M2, although all Foxp3-expressing cells from Foxp3<italic><sup>DTR</sup></italic> mice should express GFP. We observed that the lack of Tregs, at tumor initiation, did not affect M2 infiltration in IK tumors from SCID mice. However, at this stage, we cannot exclude the possibility that depletion post-tumor development of TRegs that were present at tumor initiation was influencing the macrophage profile in the tumor, potentially explaining the lower level of M2 in IK tumors in Foxp3<italic><sup>DTR</sup></italic> mice. Furthermore, the lower level of Foxp3 expression in macrophages compared to TRegs that we observed, would involve a lower level of DTR-eGFP protein in the cells. This could make GFP expression hard to detect in macrophages and also explain a lower depletion of M2 cells compared to TRegs.</p><p>In addition to detection of Foxp3 at the protein level, we demonstrated, using two sensitive molecular techniques, the presence of Foxp3 mRNA in renal tumor infiltrating macrophages. The Foxp3 transcript detected in the macrophages was previously unknown and exhibited a shorter sequence than previously known Foxp3 mRNA. At this stage, we do not rule out that an alternate start codon within the new variant of Foxp3 mRNA could explain the extra weight of the macrophage Foxp3 protein. Interestingly, we detected low level of Foxp3 mRNA in Renca tumor cells isolated from <italic>in vivo</italic> solid tumors but not from <italic>in vitro</italic> tissue culture though we do not know yet which isoform it was. Some reports in the literature suggest a potential oncogenic and tumor escape function of Foxp3 in tumor cells <xref rid="pone.0108670-Hinz1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108670-Ebert1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However we didn't detect any Foxp3 protein in those tumor cells, suggesting that Foxp3 message detected using RT-PCR may have been due to contaminating macrophages or TRegs present in the <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor FACS-isolated sample.</p><p>Taken together, our results strongly suggest that Renca tumor-associated macrophages, in particular those with a M2 profile, express mRNA and a potentially post translationally-modified protein for Foxp3. We also attempted some analyses using mass spectrometry to confirm the status of Foxp3 protein in the macrophages and its level of post-translational modification. Unfortunately, none of three Foxp3-specific antibodies (eBioscience, BD Bioscience and Abcam) that we used, were effective for Foxp3 protein immunoprecipitation necessary for sample isolation for mass spectrometry analysis. Furthermore, being unable to immunoprecipitate the Foxp3 protein, we were also unable to probe for the ubiquitin or SUMO modifications on Foxp3. Consequently, there remain some unanswered questions regarding the exact nature of the Foxp3 protein detected in macrophages, which seems heavier than the Foxp3 present in TRegs. Finally, some functional and mechanistic insight needs to be performed, to reveal whether macrophage-expressed Foxp3 has immunosuppressive activity.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above considerations of the nature and function of the protein, the main purpose of the present study was to clearly determine if Foxp3 could be expressed in macrophages under some circumstances. Using diverse analytical techniques such as flow cytometry, Western blot, RT-PCR and RNAseq, we confirmed that Foxp3 could be expressed in macrophages in the tumor context. This raises the possibility that Foxp3 could be an interesting candidate to target to improve therapies for tumors containing M2 infiltrating macrophages.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0108670-Fontenot1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Fontenot</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gavin</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Rudensky</surname><given-names>AY</given-names></name> (<year>2003</year>) <article-title>Foxp3 programs the development and function of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells</article-title>. <source>Nat Immunol</source><volume>4</volume>: <fpage>330</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>336</lpage>.<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12612578</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0108670-Hori1"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Hori</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Nomura</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sakaguchi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name> (<year>2003</year>) <article-title>Control of regulatory T cell development by the transcription factor Foxp3</article-title>. <source>Science</source>
