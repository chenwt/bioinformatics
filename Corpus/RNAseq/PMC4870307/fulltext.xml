However, it has remained unclear whether cells might modulate the relative timing of these pulses to control gene expression. Here, using quantitative single-cell time-lapse imaging of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, we show that the pulsatile transcription factors Msn2 and Mig1 combinatorially regulate their target genes through modulation of their relative pulse timing. The activator Msn2 and repressor Mig1 pulsed in either a temporally overlapping or non-overlapping manner during their transient response to different inputs, with only the non-overlapping dynamics efficiently activating target gene expression. Similarly, under constant environmental conditions, where Msn2 and Mig1 exhibit sporadic pulsing, glucose concentration modulated the temporal overlap between pulses of the two factors. Together, these results reveal a time-based mode of combinatorial gene regulation. Regulation through relative signal timing is common in engineering and neurobiology, and these results suggest that it could also function broadly within the signaling and regulatory systems of the cell.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">In order to respond to environmental conditions, cells make extensive use of combinatorial gene regulation, in which two or more transcription factors co-regulate common target genes. Most analysis of combinatorial regulation presumes that the concentrations of transcription factors in the nucleus are regulated in a continuous (non-pulsatile) manner<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. However, recent work has identified a large and growing list of transcription factors that activate in pulses<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. In such systems, a single pulse begins when many molecules of a given transcription factor are activated simultaneously, and ends when they are deactivated. Such pulses can occur repetitively, even under constant conditions. Pulsatile regulation has been observed in bacteria<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, yeast<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, and mammalian stress response and signaling pathways<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. In these systems, inputs typically modulate the pulse frequency, amplitude, and/or duration of individual transcription factors to regulate genes. However, despite analysis of many individual pulsatile transcription factors, the interactions between multiple pulsatile systems in the same cell have not yet been explored and analyzed.</p><p id="P3"><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> provides an ideal model system to analyze such dynamic transcription factor interactions. It contains several well-characterized pulsatile systems that control core cellular functions. In particular, the general stress response transcription factor Msn2, and its paralog, Msn4, activate hundreds of target genes in response to diverse stresses including ethanol, heat, oxidative stress, salt, and glucose starvation<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Similarly, the repressor Mig1, along with its paralog Mig2, control many target genes, especially those involved in metabolism, in response to changes in glucose concentration<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Together, Msn2 and Mig1 co-regulate over 300 target genes (according to Yeastract<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>). Both Msn2 and Mig1 are activated by dephosphorylation, which leads to nuclear localization<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Previous work has shown that Msn2 nuclear localization can occur in a pulsatile fashion in response to various inputs<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Mig1 is known to quickly localize to the nucleus in response to an increase in glucose levels<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>, and can also exhibit pulsatile activation<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Two stages of dynamic pulsing</title><p id="P4">To analyze Msn2 and Mig1 dynamics in the same cell, we constructed strains expressing fusions of Msn2 and Mig1 proteins to the distinguishable fluorescent proteins<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> mKO2 and mCherry, respectively (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). To simplify the analysis, we knocked out their paralogs Msn4 and Mig2 (Methods). We attached single cells to the glass surface of a microfluidic channel, maintaining a constant flow of media, while acquiring time-lapse movies. By analyzing individual cells in these movies, we could track the nuclear localization dynamics of both proteins over time (Methods).</p><p id="P5">We first analyzed the effects of glucose reduction, which is known to induce changes in nuclear localization for both transcription factors<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. In response to a sudden step from 0.2% to 0.1% glucose, both proteins exhibited pulses of nuclear localization, but did so with different timing (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Msn2 localized to the nucleus immediately, while Mig1 exited the nucleus. Subsequently, in many cells (75%), Msn2 exited the nucleus followed by the re-entry of Mig1 (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Video 1</xref>). This transient response terminated within &#x0223c;30 min (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, bottom). We describe events like this in which Msn2 and Mig1 pulses are temporally separated, as non-overlapping (see <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, top and Methods). After this event, Msn2 and Mig1 exhibited sporadic pulsing that was unsynchronized between cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Video 1</xref>). During this steady-state period, we observed both overlapping (i.e., coincident) events, in which Msn2 and Mig1 pulses overlap, as well as non-overlapping events in which Msn2, but not Mig1 localized to the nucleus (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, top and Methods).</p><p id="P6">These data provoke two interrelated questions about whether and how relative pulse timing could function in combinatorial regulation (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>): First, do inputs modulate the relative timing of transcription factor pulses, either during the transient response to a change in conditions, or during the subsequent period of repetitive pulsing? Second, if so, how does such pulse timing modulation affect downstream combinatorial gene regulation?</p><p id="P7">To address these questions, we constructed strains containing synthetic target promoters incorporating binding sites for either or both transcription factors (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). These promoters drove expression of a transcriptional reporter consisting of 24 binding sites for a separately expressed PP7 RNA binding protein fused to GFP<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). These strains enabled us to simultaneously follow localization dynamics of Msn2 and Mig1 and downstream target expression in the same cell.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Relative pulse timing in the transient response</title><p id="P8">We first analyzed transient responses to changes in various input conditions (i.e., different Msn2 stressors) other than the known common input glucose (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Addition of 100mM NaCl produced transient non-overlapping pulses of Msn2 and Mig1 in single cells and in population averages (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a&#x02013;c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Video 2</xref>) that were similar to those observed in the transient response to glucose reduction (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Addition of 2.5% ethanol also activated both transcription factors. But in contrast to NaCl, it did so with overlapping, rather than non-overlapping, pulses (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1d&#x02013;f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Video 3</xref>). The difference in relative timing between NaCl and ethanol was also apparent in cross-correlation analysis (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1g</xref>). Together, these results indicate that distinct inputs can generate opposite relative timing in the transient responses of Msn2 and Mig1.</p><p id="P9">We hypothesized that control of temporal overlap could provide a mechanism for combinatorial gene regulation. Non-overlapping pulse dynamics, in which the activator Msn2 is active, but the repressor Mig1 is not, could activate combinatorial target genes more efficiently than overlapping pulses, in which the two proteins are simultaneously bound to the same target promoter. Indeed, while both NaCl and ethanol led to activation of an Msn2-specific target promoter, only the non-overlapping dynamics of NaCl efficiently induced target expression (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d&#x02013;e</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a&#x02013;f</xref>). Moreover, we observed similar timing-mediated regulation with other stresses. Heat shock and oxidative stress (from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) induced non-overlapping and overlapping dynamics, respectively (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1h&#x02013;i</xref>). As with the other stresses, both non-overlapping and overlapping dynamics activated an Msn2-specific target promoter, but only non-overlapping dynamics efficiently activated the combinatorial target promoter (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). As expected, the dependence of expression from the synthetic combinatorial target promoter on relative timing required both Msn2 and Mig1 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). In addition, these effects were not specific to the synthetic target promoter, as expression of <italic>GSY1</italic><sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>, an endogenous target of Msn2 and Mig1, exhibited similar dependence on relative timing in response to stresses, as shown by both single cell analysis and qPCR data (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2b&#x02013;e</xref>). In fact, further genome-wide analysis revealed 30 additional endogenous targets that exhibited a similar pattern of gene regulation during transient responses to NaCl and ethanol (Methods, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2f&#x02013;k</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Discussion</xref>), suggesting that relative timing-dependent regulation applies to multiple endogenous target genes, as well as to the synthetic promoter. Together, these data indicate that during transient stress responses, cells regulate gene expression by modulating the relative pulse timing between Msn2 and Mig1.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Regulation by relative pulse timing at steady-state</title><p id="P10">We next asked whether relative pulse timing could also function in constant environmental conditions where both transcription factors pulse sporadically and repetitively. Because such pulsing is not synchronized among cells, it could only be analyzed with single-cell movie data. We observed both overlapping and non-overlapping pulse events under constant conditions (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3a&#x02013;b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Video 4&#x02013;5</xref>). To better understand the effects of each type of event on gene expression, we adapted the technique of pulse-triggered averaging from neurobiology (usually called spike-triggered averaging)<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3c</xref>). We identified Msn2 pulses, and sorted them into two groups depending on whether or not a Mig1 pulse overlapped temporally with the Msn2 pulse (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, Methods). We then averaged the Msn2 and Mig1 dynamics over a time window around the Msn2 pulse peaks, for both overlapping and non-overlapping events. By construction, the resulting pulse-triggered averages showed opposite overall dynamic relationships between the two proteins (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b&#x02013;c</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Pulse-triggered averaging enabled us to analyze the dependence of target gene expression on Msn2 pulsing and, more specifically, on its temporal relationship with Mig1, averaged over variability in both pulsing behavior and downstream transcriptional responses (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Discussion</xref> about the multiple layers of variability in this system). Both overlapping and non-overlapping pulses led to subsequent increase in the mean expression of the pure Msn2 synthetic target promoter (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4a&#x02013;c</xref>). However, only the non-overlapping events showed activation of the synthetic combinatorial Msn2-Mig1 promoter or the natural combinatorial target gene, <italic>GSY1</italic> (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d&#x02013;e</xref>). Moreover, deletions of the zinc-finger DNA binding domains of either Msn2 or Mig1 eliminated the relative timing-dependence of <italic>GSY1</italic> expression, indicating that DNA-binding of both proteins is necessary for relative timing-dependent regulation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4d</xref>). Together, these results show that relative timing between Msn2 and Mig1 pulses regulates gene expression under steady-state pulsatile conditions.</p><p id="P12">Thus far, we have simplified the analysis of relative pulse timing by classifying events as either overlapping or non-overlapping. However, cross-correlation analysis revealed more complexity in the dynamics. For example, we observed a peak at a positive time lag of &#x0223c;2&#x02013;4 min, corresponding to sequential activation of Msn2 followed by Mig1 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4f&#x02013;i</xref>, also evident in <xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c, f</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Discussion</xref>). More generally, the data showed a continuous distribution of time intervals between a given Msn2 pulse and its previous, or subsequent, Mig1 pulse. To better understand how these dynamics impact target gene expression, we analyzed the dependence of mean expression level on the continuous time interval between Msn2 and Mig1 pulses (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5a&#x02013;b</xref>). Mean gene expression is minimal when Msn2 and Mig1 pulse simultaneously, but Mig1 pulses occurring within ~4&#x02013;5 minutes before or after Msn2 pulses also suppress mean expression. These results are consistent with a model in which Mig1 pulses can both terminate continuing expression from preceding Msn2 pulses, and also establish promoter states with reduced tendency to activate in response to Msn2, possibly due to residual binding of Mig1 itself or to Mig1-induced effects on promoter states. As expected, these extended timing effects required both Msn2 and Mig1 binding sites on the target promoter, as well as DNA-binding activities of both proteins (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5d&#x02013;e</xref>). These characteristic timescales for Msn2-Mig1 pulse interactions establish the degree of simultaneity necessary for pulses to function as overlapping events.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Modulation of relative pulse timing</title><p id="P13">Having established the effect of relative pulse timing on gene expression, we next asked whether and how inputs affect relative timing. We acquired time-lapse movies of Msn2 and Mig1 nuclear localization across a range of glucose concentrations (from 0.4% to 0.0125%), where both Msn2 and Mig1 exhibited sporadic nuclear localization pulses (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7b&#x02013;e</xref>). The frequencies of pulses for both proteins, and the mean duration of Mig1 pulses, all varied systematically with glucose concentration (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>), while mean pulse amplitudes remained approximately constant (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>). Interestingly, however, averaged cross-correlations between Msn2 and Mig1 nuclear localization traces showed features (e.g. the peak at time lag zero) that depended strongly on glucose concentration (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). Furthermore, the percentage of Msn2 pulses that overlap with Mig1, which we define as the overlap fraction, changed systematically with glucose concentration (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref> and <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8a</xref>). Together, these results indicate that glucose concentration modulates the relative pulse timing between Msn2 and Mig1.</p><p id="P14">To better understand the effect of glucose concentration on relative pulse timing, it is helpful to distinguish between passive and active types of modulation. Passive modulation arises from changes in the frequency and/or duration of Mig1 pulses, and occurs even if Msn2 and Mig1 dynamics are independent. By contrast, active modulation would require mechanisms that specifically enhance or reduce the fraction of overlapping events.</p><p id="P15">Passive modulation appears to dominate at lower glucose concentration, but both passive and active modulation occur at higher glucose concentrations. At very low glucose levels (&#x0003c;0.05%), the observed overlap fraction agreed with expectations based on passive modulation only (Methods, lower right of <xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref> and <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8a</xref>). However, at higher glucose levels (&#x02265;0.05%), where pulse frequencies became less glucose-dependent (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>), the observed overlap fraction exceeded the value expected from passive modulation, and increased systematically with glucose concentration (upper left corner of <xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref> and <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8a</xref>), indicating a substantial role for active modulation. Moreover, including the active component of modulation improved the ability of a simple model to explain the dependence of target gene expression on glucose (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8b&#x02013;d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Discussion</xref>). We also found that relative pulse timing could be further modulated by other inputs such as NaCl and ethanol (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Discussion</xref>). These results show that under steady-state conditions, input identity (type of stress) and level (e.g. glucose concentration) together modulate relative pulse timing, through both passive and active mechanisms, to control target gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Mechanism for relative pulse timing modulation</title><p id="P16">Relative pulse timing modulation represents a distinct mode of gene regulation that operates in both steady-state and transient conditions (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Discussion</xref>). What mechanisms could enable cells to actively control relative pulse timing? One possibility involves regulatory components that specifically generate overlapping pulses of Msn2 and Mig1. Previous work has shown that Glc7, the catalytic component of PP1 phosphatase, can indirectly regulate both Msn2 and Mig1 nuclear localization<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>, making it a candidate for an active regulator of overlapping pulses (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10a</xref>). We constructed a strain in which the wild-type <italic>GLC7</italic> promoter was replaced with a Cu<sup>2+</sup>-inducible promoter in the native locus. In this strain, reducing expression of <italic>GLC7</italic> below wild-type levels abolished active modulation, making the measured overlap fraction equal to that expected by chance (overlap of red solid and dashed lines in the left panel of <xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). This effect can also be seen in the Msn2-Mig1 cross-correlation at time lag zero, which is reduced at higher glucose concentrations (compare red and black lines in <xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>, right). Restoring <italic>GLC7</italic> expression close to wild-type levels restored active modulation (blue lines, <xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Together, these data (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref><xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">and Extended Data Fig. 10</xref>) support a role for Glc7 in active modulation by glucose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Discussion</xref>). Other phospho-regulatory components may also contribute to active modulation in these and other conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S6"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">What functions could relative pulse timing modulation provide for the cell? One of the most fundamental concepts in combinatorial regulation is that cooperative interactions between transcription factors can increase their probability of simultaneous binding to a promoter, to implement cis-regulatory logic<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. By controlling the fraction of time that two transcription factors are simultaneously active, relative pulse timing modulation could provide similar effects in <italic>trans</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note</xref> and <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10f&#x02013;h</xref>). In addition to its functionality, a number of basic issues about timing-dependent regulation remain to be understood. For example, what accounts for variability among cells in their transcription factor dynamics and the apparently stochastic response of target promoters to those dynamics? What features of target promoters, such as the kinetic parameters that govern their activation, determine whether and how they respond to timing-based regulation?</p><p id="P18">Relative timing between signals plays many important roles throughout science and engineering. In neuroscience, the relative timing of action potentials at pre- and post-synaptic neurons controls the strength of synaptic connectivity through spike timing dependent plasticity<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. In communications, modulating the phase of a periodic signal relative to a reference signal is widely used to encode information<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. Cells appear to have evolved a related strategy by encoding aspects of the extracellular environment in the relative timing with which different transcription factors pulse. The unsynchronized nature of these pulses has made relative pulse timing modulation rather difficult to detect and characterize previously. However, pulsatile dynamics (both periodic and aperiodic) are now being discovered in a growing list of central signaling and regulatory pathways<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, which are known to interact, or crosstalk, with one another. It will therefore be critical to more systematically map the temporal organization of cellular pathways, and determine principles that can explain both the mechanisms and functions of relative pulse timing modulation in living cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Strain construction</title><p id="P19">Standard protocols were used for molecular cloning.

The microfludic device was fabricated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with a Sylgard 184 silicone elastomer kit (DOW Corning) and bonded with 24mm &#x000d7; 50mm glass coverslip (Gold Seal No. 1.5) after air-plasma cleaning (Harrick Plasma PDC-32G). The channels were cleaned by brief incubation with 2M NaOH, followed by washes with 100% ethanol and water. A 15 mg/mL concanavalinA (Sigma #C7275) solution was incubated in the channels for about 10min to coat the surface for adhering single yeast cells. Channels were washed with media prior to cell loading. Overnight yeast cultures were diluted back to OD600 = 0.1 with 2mL of fresh media (0.2% glucose, -Ura) and were allowed to grow for another &#x0223c;3hrs. Cells were briefly concentrated by centrifuge and loaded into the channel. Cells were incubated in the channels for 5min. The device was then loaded onto a sample stage on the microscope. Two Inlets of a channel were connected with tubings (Weico Wire&#x00026;Cable #TT-30) to two different media solutions in 10mL syringes (BD #309604) containing different glucose or stimulant concentrations. These syringes were driven with separate syringe pumps (Harvard Apparatus Pump 11 elite) which were controlled by Micro-Manager. Outlet of the channel was connected to a waste container. Media flow rate was maintained at 5&#x003bc;L/min throughout the movie except for during media change (at 50 &#x003bc;L/min for 2min).</p><p id="P28">It should be noted that the starting glucose concentration and the time before media switching differed in different experiments. For the transient glucose shift experiment (i.e., <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), cells were in the channel with flowing 0.2% glucose for more than 2hrs before switching to 0.1% glucose (acquisition of fluorescent images started 30min prior to switching).

Acquisition of fluorescent images started 110 min after the switching (i.e., steady-state). For cooper inducible <italic>GLC7</italic> experiments, cells were cultured with the minimal media without the addition of cooper until they were switched to a media containing 10 &#x003bc;M CuSO<sub>4</sub> for 110 min prior to the acquisition of fluorescent images.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Image analysis for extracting single-cell traces</title><p id="P29">Single-cell traces were extracted from fluorescence images based on cell tracks obtained from bright-field images. All analysis were implemented with home-made Matlab codes (with some modules obtained online as cited below). More specifically, a slightly defocused bright-field image was taken at each frame for segmentation and tracking purposes. Segmentation was performed by circular Hough transformation (CircularHough_Grd function from Mathworks File Exchange). Segmented cell masks were first aligned across the entire movie frames to roughly correct for X-Y stage drifts (in order to enhance tracking accuracy). The masks were then fed into a tracking algorithm (u-track<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>) to obtain final cell tracks. Tracks of cell masks were filtered by manually examining three frames along each individual track. Bad tracks due to segmentation or tracking errors and tracks of dead cells/debris were discarded and removed from further analysis. These filtered single-cell tracks were used to extract fluorescence traces.</p><p id="P30">For analysis with fluorescence images, z-stack GFP images (for real-time transcription) were first z-projected (maximal intensity). Fluorescent images were then background subtracted (with background images acquired with media only) and corrected for field flatness caused by uneven illumination (by image taken with fluorescein). Nuclear localization was calculated by the difference between the mean intensity of the top five pixels and the median intensity of all pixels. Single-cell nuclear localization traces for mKO2 and mCherry were then obtained with tracks obtained above. Real-time transcriptional activity (i.e., PP7-2xGFP signal) was determined by the intensity of the brightest pixel in the cell subtracted by its local background. For the time when transcription is active, the brightest pixel coincides well with the transcription hotspot. Both nuclear localization and transcription activity measurements are robust as justified by manual examination of the extracted traces side-by-side with fluorescence images.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Single-cell trace analysis and pulse-triggered averaging analysis</title><p id="P31">Single-cell traces were first baseline-subtracted and nuclear localization pulses were identified. These pulses were then characterized and used for pulse-triggered averaging analysis. More specifically, calculation of the baselines for mKO2 and mCherry traces are based on a measure for the degree of nuclear localization. In this method, pairwise spatial distance summed over the top 10 brightest pixels in individual cells was used to determine if a given fluorescence signal is nuclear localized or not at a given frame. Nuclear localization scores from frames with the summed distance above a predefined threshold were used to estimate the baseline by a polynomial fit. In case this method failed (i.e., baseline varies too much along a trace), baseline was estimated by fitting nuclear localization values that were below an empirically defined threshold. Baseline for GFP signal was estimated by polynomial fitting the GFP signals that were below an empirically defined threshold. Baseline subtraction procedures were justified by manual examination of the subtracted traces side-by-side with fluorescence images.</p><p id="P32">Nuclear localization pulses were identified in both Msn2 and Mig1 traces. Pulse identification was based on iPeak (from Mathworks File Exchange). Shoulder peaks were filtered out and combined with neighboring peaks (with higher amplitude). The remaining peaks were filtered based on an amplitude threshold (at least 20% above the baseline values) as well as the summed pairwise distance (below a predefined threshold) and were then defined as peaks of the pulses. Width of the pulses was measured for left and right portions of the pulses separately (first fitted with spline and then measured at half of the pulse amplitude or the amplitude threshold, whichever is smaller). For pulse-triggered averaging analysis, a 21min window around the peak of each Msn2 pulse (i.e., 10min on each side) was used for sorting the type of relative timing. This time window was chosen based on the frequency of Msn2 pulses. Within this window, all Mig1 pulses were identified. If the peak of a triggered Msn2 pulse fell into the span (defined by pulse width) of a Mig1 pulse, it was classified as an overlapping event. Otherwise, it was classified as a non-overlapping event. A more detailed classification based on the distance between the peak of Msn2 pulse and the edge (defined by pulse width) of the Mig1 pulse (if multiple Mig1 pulses occur within the window, the one with maximum pulse amplitude was chosen for this classification) can also be done as shown in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>. Overlapping and non-overlapping events were averaged separately. Note that a larger time window (i.e., a 26min window with 10min on the left of the peak and 15min on the right) was chosen for averaging in <xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> in order to capture and measure the prolonged transcriptional responses in the GFP dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Cross-correlation analysis</title><p id="P33">Several figures include cross-correlation analysis (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>, <xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1g</xref>, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7g</xref>, <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">9d</xref>).

In this protocol, cells were exposed to defined stimulants for 10 min and RNA was extracted for two-step RT-qPCR (reverse transcription followed by qPCR). Note that the concentrations of salt, ethanol, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were doubled when compared to the microfluidic single-cell assay (i.e., 200mM vs. 100mM NaCl, 5% EtOH vs. 2.5% EtOH, 0.5mM vs. 0.25mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). More detailed protocol is described as following. Overnight cultures were diluted to OD600 = 0.075 with 20mL of 0.2% glucose (-Ura) in 250mL flask and allowed to grow until the OD600 reached above 0.2 (about 3&#x02013;4hrs). For transient stress experiments, cultures were then diluted back to OD600 = 0.2 with 20mL of 0.05% glucose in 250mL flask and allowed to grow for another 2hrs. Cultures were split into 14mL polypropylene tubes (4mL each). Stresses were applied by mixing highly concentrated stock solutions (such as 5M NaCl, 100% ethanol, 0.83M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) with the culture or by moving the culture tubes to a 37&#x000b0;C shaking incubator (for heat shock). Precisely after 10min of stress application, each culture was mixed with 6mL pre-chilled methanol (with dry ice/ethanol bath) in a 50mL falcon tube to rapidly fix the cells. For steady-state experiments, cells were diluted to OD600 = 0.1 with 4mL fresh media of designated condition (different glucose concentration with or without additional CuSO4) in 50mL falcon tube. Cultures were allowed to grow for 2hrs and cells were mixed quickly with cold methanol as above. After &#x0003e;1hr in cold methanol, cells were collected by centrifuging at 4&#x000b0;C and washed with ice cold water.

Input modulates the regulator concentration (left) versus the fraction of regulator ON time (right). <bold>g</bold>, Modulation of relative pulse timing in time-based regulation results in changes in the effective protein-protein cooperativity. Increasing protein-protein cooperativity in concentration-based regulation changes the probability of co-binding of TF<sub>A</sub> and TF<sub>B</sub> (left). Increasing overlapping pulsing in time-based regulation leads to qualitatively similar changes in the probability of co-binding (right). Protein cooperativity parameter
