The current paradigm suggests that heterochromatic silencing can spread beyond the borders of TEs and influence the chromatin state of neighboring low-copy sequences. This would allow TEs to condition obligatory or facilitated epialleles and act as controlling elements. The maize genome contains numerous families of class I TEs (retrotransposons) that are present in moderate to high copy numbers, and many are found in regions near genes, which provides an opportunity to test whether the spreading of heterochromatin from retrotransposons is prevalent. We have investigated the extent of heterochromatin spreading into DNA flanking each family of retrotransposons by profiling DNA methylation and di-methylation of lysine 9 of histone 3 (H3K9me2) in low-copy regions of the maize genome. The effects of different retrotransposon families on local chromatin are highly variable. Some retrotransposon families exhibit enrichment of heterochromatic marks within 800&#x02013;1,200 base pairs of insertion sites, while other families exhibit very little evidence for the spreading of heterochromatic marks. The analysis of chromatin state in genotypes that lack specific insertions suggests that the heterochromatin in low-copy DNA flanking retrotransposons often results from the spreading of silencing marks rather than insertion-site preferences. Genes located near TEs that exhibit spreading of heterochromatin tend to be expressed at lower levels than other genes. Our findings suggest that a subset of retrotransposon families may act as controlling elements influencing neighboring sequences, while the majority of retrotransposons have little effect on flanking sequences.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Transposable elements comprise a substantial portion of many eukaryotic genomes. These mobile fragments of DNA can directly mutate genes through insertions into coding regions but may also affect the gene regulation through nearby insertions. There is evidence that the majority of transposable elements are epigenetically silenced, and in some cases this silencing may spread to neighboring sequences. This spreading of heterochromatin could create a significant fitness tradeoff between transposon silencing and gene expression. The maize genome has a complex organization with many genes flanked by retrotransposons, providing an opportunity to study the interaction of retrotransposons and genes. To survey the prevalence of heterochromatin spreading associated with different retrotransposon families, we profiled the spread of heterochromatin into nearby low copy sequences for 150 high copy retrotransposon families. While many retrotransposons exhibit little to no spreading of heterochromatin, there are some retrotransposon families that do exhibit spreading. Genes located near retrotransposons that spread heterochromatin have lower expression levels. The families of retrotransposons that spread heterochromatin marks to nearby low-copy sequences may have increased fitness costs for the host genome due to their suppression of genes located near insertions.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) at the University of Texas at Austin provided HPC and storage resources.

Whole genome profiling of DNA methylation in Arabidopsis <xref rid="pgen.1003127-Cokus1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> found that the level of DNA methylation often had sharp boundaries at the edge of repeats although some inverted repeats did exhibit spreading.

Many model organisms have relatively small, compact genomes with relatively few retrotransposons. Since these genomes do not have a number of moderate-high copy retrotransposon families it can be difficult to assess the variation in spreading of heterochromatin to neighboring low-copy sequences. The maize genome is more representative of the organization of sequences observed within most flowering plants and is similar to the organization of many mammalian genomes as well. There are a large number of distinct families of retrotransposons within the maize genome and many of these families are moderate to high copy number <xref rid="pgen.1003127-SanMiguel1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1003127-Du1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.

We were interested in further documenting the extent of heterochromatin spreading from maize retrotransposons to neighboring sequencings. Genomic profiling of DNA methylation and H3K9me2 found that heterochromatic spreading is only observed for a small number of specific retrotransposon families. These families tend to be enriched in pericentromeric regions of chromosomes. The analysis of haplotypes lacking specific retrotransposon insertions provides evidence that the adjacent heterochromatin is the result of spreading rather than insertion site bias.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Heterochromatin spreads from some retrotransposons within the maize genome</title><p>DNA methylation and chromatin modifications were profiled for low-copy sequences in the maize genome using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (meDIP) and chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with antibodies specific for H3K9me2 or H3K27me3, respectively. The fractions of the genome enriched for DNA or histone modifications were hybridized to a high-density microarray containing &#x0223c;2.1 million long oligonucleotide probes derived from the unmasked, non-repetitive fraction of the maize genome. The probes are spaced every 200 bp in the low-copy portions of the maize genome and can provide a profile for the chromatin state in these regions <xref rid="pgen.1003127-Eichten1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Our analyses focused on a subset of &#x0223c;1.4 million probes that are single-copy (no other sequences with at least 90% identity within maize genome sequence). While this approach does not provide information on the chromatin state within repetitive sequences it can assess how retrotransposons impact neighboring sequences <xref rid="pgen.1003127-Eichten1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. An independent whole-genome bisulphite sequencing dataset (&#x0223c;7&#x000d7; coverage) was used to further confirm the patterns that we observed in the meDIP-chip experiments. This independent approach was able to assess DNA methylation within retrotransposons as well as low-copy sequences. The enrichment for sequences associated with H3K9me2 was validated using a set of known sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003127.s001">Figure S1A</xref>) and several sequences identified by the profiling experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003127.s001">Figure S1B</xref>).</p><p>A large number of class I TEs (retrotransposons) have been identified within the maize genome <xref rid="pgen.1003127-Baucom1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.

We assessed whether heterochromatic chromatin modifications would be enriched in the single-copy regions that flank these retrotransposons. The chromatin state of sequences adjacent to any specific insertion of a retrotransposon is influenced by regulatory and insulator sequences as well as any potential effects of nearby retrotransposons. By assessing the average level of chromatin modifications near all of the retrotransposons of the same family it is possible to identify whether retrotransposon families vary in their influence on local chromatin state. Single-copy probes that are located within 4 kb of all retrotransposons were identified and used to assess the level of chromatin modifications in 200 bp bins of low-copy sequences adjacent to superfamilies, such as gypsy or copia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003127.s003">Figure S3</xref>) and individual families of retrotransposons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003127-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

Because the meDIP-chip profiling of DNA methylation has a resolution of 300&#x02013;500 bp it is likely that some of the apparent increase in DNA methylation levels very close to retrotransposons represents DNA methylation within the repeats themselves.</p><fig id="pgen-1003127-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1003127.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Heterochromatin spreading is restricted to some retrotransposon families.</title><p>The 144 families of class I retrotransposons represented by at least 1000 probes within the adjacent 4 kb were identified and the average level of H3K9me2, 5-methylcytosine and K3K27me3 enrichment was determined for 200 bp bins. The average values are calculated from both sides of annotated elements collapsed. (A) The relative level of DNA methylation in each 200 bp bin is shown for each of the 144 families.

To identify retrotransposon families associated with significant levels of spreading of heterochromatic chromatin modifications in adjacent low-copy sequences we compared the distribution of methylation levels in each 200 bp bin with a set of randomly permuted data (10,000 randomly assigned &#x0201c;insertions&#x0201d;) and defined whether each 200 bp bin had significantly higher levels of a chromatin modification than random genomic sequences. Retrotransposon families that exhibit significant (p&#x0003c;0.001) enrichment for a chromatin modification for each bin up through at least 800 bp were classified as spreading families. There are 39 retrotransposon families that exhibit significant enrichments of DNA methylation and H3K9me2 within each of the first four 200 bp bins adjacent to their insertion sites. These families will hereafter classified as &#x0201c;spreading (both)&#x0201d; families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003127-g001">Figure 1A&#x02013;1B, 1E&#x02013;1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003127.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Another 10 retrotransposon families had significant levels of H3K9me2 but did not have at least 800 bp of significant enrichment for DNA methylation. These families will hereafter be classified as &#x0201c;spreading (H3K9)&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003127.s013">Table S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003127-g001">Figure 1A&#x02013;1B, 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003127.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Many of these H3K9 only spreading families have elevated levels of DNA methylation in these same regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003127.s004">Figure S4</xref>), but do not pass the significance threshold for all bins within the adjacent 800 base pairs. The remaining 95 retrotransposon families did not exhibit significant enrichment for either DNA methylation or H3K9me2 (example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003127-g001">Figure 1H</xref>). There was no evidence for significant enrichment of H3K27me3 in regions near any retrotransposon families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003127-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The initial classification of retrotransposon families was based upon chromatin profiles from B73 seedling tissue. However, very similar patterns were observed for other genotypes and tissues.

The level of DNA methylation is higher in sequences flanking spreading (both) retrotransposon families than for sequences flanking spreading (H3K9) retrotransposons. The sequences flanking the non-spreading families have DNA methylation levels that are similar to randomly selected genomic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003127-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). The analysis of internal (within the repeat itself) DNA methylation levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003127.s002">Figure S2</xref>) reveals that the levels of CG methylation within retrotransposons with, or without spreading are similar. However, the spreading (both) and spreading (H3K9) retrotransposon families have slightly elevated levels of CHG methylation at internal sequences. Interestingly, the non-spreading retrotransposon families tend to have higher levels of internal CHH methylation than do spreading families (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003127.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The relative levels of H3K9me2 within retrotransposons was assessed by qPCR for 10 of the families, including six spreading (both) and four non-spreading families (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003127.s008">Figure S8</xref>).

The elevated levels of DNA methylation and/or H3K9me2 in low copy sequences flanking the insertion sites observed for a subset of the retrotransposon families are largely confined to the region within 800&#x02013;1,600 bp of the insertion site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003127-g001">Figure 1A&#x02013;1B</xref>). A closer examination of the levels of DNA methylation and H3K9me2 near each spreading family indicates a fairly sharp drop to non-significant levels of the modifications within 2 kb of the insertion site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003127-g001">Figure 1E&#x02013;1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003127.s004">Figures S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003127.s005">S5</xref>) for spreading families.

Empty sites were defined as being those as which at least three Mo17 sequence reads cover a low-copy sequence flanking an insertion but do not align to the retrotransposon itself and for which no Mo17 reads cover the junction between the low-copy sequence and the retrotransposon. In total, 668 empty sites were identified for the spreading (both) retrotransposon families and 29 empty sites for the spreading (H3K9) retrotransposon families for which we had DNA methylation data in the unique regions flanking the insertion. The lack of the specific insertion in Mo17 was confirmed at 13 of the 14 empty sites that were tested using site-specific PCR primers to confirm the presence/absence of specific insertions. This suggests that there is a low false-positive rate in the identification of empty sites in Mo17. However, given the low coverage of the WGS data and challenges associated with aligning polymorphic sequences it is likely that many of the true empty sites were not identified in this analysis.</p><p>The level of DNA methylation at the probe nearest to the empty site was used to assess relative DNA methylation levels with (B73) and without (Mo17) each insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003127-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The low-copy DNA flanking many of the empty sites showed differences in DNA methylation levels between B73 and Mo17 in 34.7% of the empty sites flanking spreading (both) retrotransposons and in 43.5% of the empty sites flanking spreading (H3K9) retrotransposons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003127-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Over 95% of the empty sites with differential methylation had higher DNA methylation levels in B73 (the genotype with the insertion) than in Mo17. While 35&#x02013;43% of the probes flanking the empty sites for spreading retrotransposons had variable DNA methylation in B73 and Mo17, only 3% of genome-wide probes assayed show significantly different levels of DNA methylation in B73 and Mo17 and these differences include equal frequencies of higher methylation levels in each genotype. This suggests that the insertion of the retrotransposon conditioned higher levels of DNA methylation and was responsible for the observed DNA methylation polymorphisms. In contrast, DNA methylation levels were similar (and frequently quite high) between B73 and Mo17 when the retrotransposon insertion was present in both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003127-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Closer inspection of several of the empty sites provides evidence for enrichment of DNA methylation or H3K9me2 in regions flanking the sites in B73 but these modifications were not observed in the Mo17 haplotype that lacks the retrotransposon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003127-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

Hence, the pericentromeric enrichment is insufficient for heterochromatin spreading.

RNAseq was used to estimate transcript abundance in three tissues of B73 and Mo17 including the identical leaf tissue samples used for profiling DNA methylation levels. All maize genes were annotated to identify the first retrotransposon 5&#x02032; of the transcription start site and to determine the distance between the retrotransposon and the transcription start site. Genes that are located near retrotransposons that exhibit spreading (both or H3K9) have significantly (p&#x0003c;0.001) lower expression levels in all genotypes and tissue examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003127-g005">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003127.s012">Figure S12A</xref>). This reduction in expression is most severe when we examine genes with retrotransposons inserted within 500 bp of the transcription start site. As the distance between the insertion site and the transcription start site increases there is less evidence for an effect on expression levels, suggesting a limited range within which retrotransposons can influence gene expression.

However, it has not been clear whether all TEs have similar effects on neighboring chromatin or whether there are family-specific attributes that affect the spreading of heterochromatin. A recent study analyzed several families of retrotransposons in mouse and found that there is variation in the level of heterochromatin spreading <xref rid="pgen.1003127-Rebollo1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and there have been suggestions of variation in the effects of different repetitive elements on nearby gene expression in Arabidopsis <xref rid="pgen.1003127-Hollister1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003127-Hollister2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The complex organization of the maize genome with interspersed TEs and genes provides the opportunity to examine differences among class I retrotransposon families. The chromatin state of any low-copy region of a genome is likely influenced by nearby sequences including regulatory elements and insulator elements. In addition, it is quite likely that TEs will exert an influence on the chromatin state. By examining the average level of chromatin modifications in low-copy sequences neighboring families of retrotransposons we found evidence for heterochromatic spreading from a subset of the moderate to high-copy retrotransposon families in maize. Even in these families the heterochromatic marks spread only 600&#x02013;1,000 base pairs from the retrotransposon. It is worth noting that there may be other mechanisms through which retrotransposons influence flanking regions. Our assessment is based upon only two chromatin marks, H3K9me2 and DNA methylation. These marks are frequently associated with heterochromatin, but there may be other specific types of chromatin marks that spread from these and transposon families.</p><p>There is also evidence that differences in interspecific variation in transposon insertions contributes to gene expression diversity between related species <xref rid="pgen.1003127-Hollister1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003127-Hollister2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Here we provide evidence that transposon insertions can also contribute to differences in DNA methylation patterns and gene expression levels within a species. Many TE insertions are exhibit presence/absence variation among maize haplotypes <xref rid="pgen.1003127-Du1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1003127-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The retrotransposons that cause spreading of heterochromatin are expected to result in obligatory epigenetic variation in the low-copy sequences that flank insertions. Indeed, we found that the levels of DNA methylation and H3K9me2 were quite different in B73 and Mo17 at regions that exhibit presence/absence variation for an insertion of a retrotransposon from one of the spreading families. Specifically, these retrotransposons with spreading of heterochromatin may contribute to obligatory and facilitated epialleles, as defined by Richards <xref rid="pgen.1003127-Richards1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, among different genotypes. Genomic resequencing is often used to identify SNPs as a means to explain phenotypic variation. However, it might be important to also use resequencing data to identify retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms, especially for the retrotransposon families that exhibit spreading of heterochromatic marks. The polymorphism for these insertions may lead to functional variation in the expression of nearby genes.</p><p>Barbara McClintock proposed the concept that transposons could serve as &#x0201c;controlling&#x0201d; elements that would influence nearby genes <xref rid="pgen.1003127-McClintock1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1003127-Comfort1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and this could be extended to include the potential for retrotransposons to influence nearby genes as well. There are examples in which transposons contain regulatory elements or cryptic promoters that can influence the expression of nearby genes <xref rid="pgen.1003127-Feschotte1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003127-Kashkush1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. There is also evidence that some transposons can act as controlling elements by &#x0201c;seeding&#x0201d; heterochromatin that spreads to adjacent low copy sequences <xref rid="pgen.1003127-Richards1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1003127-Lisch2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Here we have shown that this activity is not a generic feature of all retrotransposons but is instead limited to a subset of retrotransposons. Hollister and Gaut <xref rid="pgen.1003127-Hollister1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> provide evidence that the presence of heavily silenced TEs near genes may lead to reduced expression and result in fitness consequences. This would suggest that many TEs would evolve to have minimal effects on neighboring genes to reduce their fitness costs. There is evidence that some <italic>Drosophila</italic> retrotransposons contain insulator elements that reduce the spreading of chromatin states <xref rid="pgen.1003127-Gdula1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Alternatively, studies at the <italic>bns</italic> locus in Arabidopsis have suggested the presence of an active mechanism to prevent the spreading of heterochromatin from retrotransposons <xref rid="pgen.1003127-Saze2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. It might be expected that different families of TEs would vary in their ability to limit potential spreading of heterochromatin through the presence of insulators or the recruitment of factors that limit spreading. Hollister and Gaut <xref rid="pgen.1003127-Hollister1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> noted heterogeneity among families of Arabidopsis class I retrotransposons for their distance to the nearest gene and suggested that this may reflect family specific differences in heterochromatin spreading. The analysis of the large families of retrotransposons in maize permitted us to identify several families of retrotransposons with high levels of spreading. These retrotransposon families may be considered as bad &#x0201c;neighbors&#x0201d; for genes. Indeed we find that many genes located near retrotransposons with spreading tend to be silenced or expressed at lower levels. We might predict that insertions of retrotransposons from these families will be more strongly selected against when inserted near genes, especially if they affect gene expression. Therefore, our observed expression differences will only report effects that have been tolerated during natural and artificial selection of maize lines. Consistent with this possibility, our observation that these retrotransposon families are enriched in relatively gene-poor pericentromeric regions may reflect selection against insertions of these retrotransposons when they are near genes.

For each replication and genotype, whole genome amplification was conducted on 50&#x02013;100 ng IP DNA and also 50&#x02013;100 ng of sonicated DNA (input control) using the Whole Genome Amplification kit (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, Cat # WGA2-50RXN). For each amplified IP input sample, 3 ug amplified DNA were labeled using the Dual-Color Labeling Kit (Roche NimbleGen, Cat # 05223547001) according to the array manufacturer's protocol (Roche NimbleGen Methylation UserGuide v7.0). Each IP sample was labeled with Cy5 and each input/control sonicated DNA was labeled with Cy3. H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 profiling were performed on three replicates of B73 and Mo17 seedlings using antibodies specific for H3K27me3 (#07-449) and H3K9me2 (#07-441) purchased from Millipore (Billerica, USA). For each replicate, 1 g of plant material was harvested on ice, rinsed with water, and crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 minutes under vacuum. Cross-linking was quenched by adding glycine solution to a final concentration of 0.125 M under vacuum infiltration for 5 minutes. Treated tissue was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;800 C until chromatin extraction. Chromatin extractions were performed using EpiQuik Plant ChIP Kit (Epigentek, Brooklyn, USA) according to manufacturer's recommendations. Extracted chromatin was sheared in 600 &#x000b5;l of the EpiQuik buffer CP3F with 5 10-second pulses on a sonicator. To test and optimize sonication conditions, cross-linking was reversed in a sample of sheared chromatin and the resulting products were analyzed on agarose gel. Sonication conditions were optimized to yield predominantly 200&#x02013;500 bp DNA samples. Chromatin immunoprecipitations, reverse cross-linking, and DNA cleanup was performed using EpiQuik Plant ChIP Kit (Epigentek) according to manufacturer's recommendations. For each genotype, antibody, and replicate, 50&#x02013;100 ng of input and immunoprecipitated (IP) DNA was amplified with a whole genome amplification kit (WGA2, Sigma, St. Louis, USA). The amplification of no antibody control (negative control) was always 5&#x02013;10 fold less efficient confirming specificity of immunoprecipitation. For each amplified IP and input sample, 3 ug of amplified DNA were labeled using the Dual-Color Labeling Kit (Roche NimbleGen, Cat # 05223547001) according to the array manufacturer's protocol (Roche NimbleGen Methylation User- Guide v7.0). Each IP sample was labeled with Cy5 and each input/control sonicated DNA was labeled with Cy3. Samples were hybridized to the custom 2.1 M probe array (GEO Platform GPL13499) for 16&#x02013;20 hrs at 42 C. Slides were washed and scanned according to NimbleGen's protocol. Images were aligned and quantified using NimbleScan software (Roche NimbleGen) producing raw data reports for each probe on the array. The histone modification and methylation mutants array data can be obtained from GEO accession (GSE39460). The resulting microarray data were imported into the Bioconductor statistical environment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioconductor.org/">http://bioconductor.org/</ext-link>). Microarray data channels were assigned the following factors: B73 immunoprecipitation, Mo17 immunoprecipitation, B73 input, or Mo17 input depending on sample derivation. Non-maize probes and vendor-supplied process control probes were configured to have analytical weights of zero. Variance-stabilizing normalization was used to account for array-specific effects. Factor-specific hybridization coefficients were estimated by fitting fixed linear model accounting for dye and sample effects to the data using the limma package <xref rid="pgen.1003127-Smyth1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>.

Each probe was only associated with the closest repeat and all probes located within 5 kb of a repeat were retained for further analyses. The probes were assigned based on distance to the retrotransposon and include both upstream (5&#x02032;) and downstream (3&#x02032;) sequences together.
