Decidual tissue development requires a highly regulated control of the extracellular tissue remodeling; however the mechanism of this regulation remains unknown. Through systematic expression studies, we detected that Cbx4/2, Rybp, and Ring1B [components of polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1)] are predominantly utilized in antimesometrial decidualization with polyploidy. Immunofluorescence analyses revealed that PRC1 members are co-localized with its functional histone modifier H2AK119ub1 (mono ubiquitination of histone-H2A at lysine-119) in polyploid cell. A potent small-molecule inhibitor of Ring1A/B E3-ubiquitin ligase or siRNA-mediated suppression of <italic>Cbx4</italic> caused inhibition of H2AK119ub1, in conjunction with perturbation of decidualization and polyploidy development, suggesting a role for Cbx4/Ring1B-containing PRC1 in these processes. Analyses of genetic signatures by RNA-seq studies showed that the inhibition of PRC1 function affects 238 genes (154 up and 84 down) during decidualization. Functional enrichment analyses identified that about 38% genes primarily involved in extracellular processes are specifically targeted by PRC1. Furthermore, ~15% of upregulated genes exhibited a significant overlap with the upregulated <italic>Bmp2</italic> null-induced genes in mice. Overall, Cbx4/Ring1B-containing PRC1 controls decidualization via regulation of extracellular gene remodeling functions and sheds new insights into underlying molecular mechanism(s) through transcriptional repression regulation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Uterine stromal cells transform into morphologically and functionally distinct cells called decidual cells (decidualization).

The canonical silencing mechanism is mediated by H3K27me3, which recruits PRC1 on the chromatin via chromodomain containing protein (CBX) for repression function during cellular proliferation and differentiation events<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. PRC1 consists of at least five protein families, including CBX (Cbx2/4/6/7/8), RING1/2 (Ring1A/B), PCGF (Bmi1, Mel18, and PCGF1/6), PHC (Phc1/2/3), and RYBP/YAF2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>.

Because these changes are required for successful progression of early pregnancy, our objective was to investigate the roles of PRC1 during the early embryonic-attachment and decidualization phases in mice. In this study, we observed that several PRC1 members (Cbx4, Cbx2, Ring1B, and Rybp) and related histone modifications (H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3) were significantly upregulated during decidualization with polyploidy development. Based on small molecular inhibition of PRC1 or molecular suppression of <italic>Cbx4</italic>, we revealed perturbation of decidualization with reduced polyploidy development and pregnancy failure. Utilizing the RNA-seq studies following inhibition of PRC1, we identified PRC1 dependent genes that primarily implicate extracellular regulatory functions during decidual development. Furthermore, we revealed that 24 up genes after PRC1 inhibition were significantly overlapped with defective decidualization upregulated genes in Bmp2 knock-out mice, suggesting certain PRC1 suppressed genes are also controlled by BMP2-mediated downregulation during decidualization. Overall, PRC1 is a critical regulator of decidualization and polyploidy development through transcriptional repression regulation of extracellular genes.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>PRC1 members are differentially and spatiotemporally expressed in the periimplantation uteri</title><p>In order to assess the role of PRC1 regulators in early pregnancy, we first analyzed expression of mRNAs for PRC1 members in the periimplantation uteri by RT-qPCR.

In contrast, all members of PCGF and PHC, with an exception for <italic>Mel18</italic> on D7, were induced at the IS on both D5 and D7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D,E</xref>, respectively).</p><p>These genes were also differentially regulated during experimental decidualization.

Next, spatiotemporal expression, was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or immunofluorescence (IF) studies, as described in &#x0201c;Materials and Methods&#x0201d;. Cbx2, Cbx4, Rybp, and Ring1B were detected in luminal and glandular epithelial cell nuclei on D4, although a weak nuclear signal was also noted primarily in sub-luminal stromal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C,D</xref>). However, following the onset of implantation on D5, the expression of Cbx2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>) and Ring1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D</xref>) was observed throughout the endometrial stromal cell nuclei, while a strong expression for Cbx2 was also present in the luminal and glandular epithelial cell nuclei. In contrast, Cbx4 and Rybp staining did not reveal much expression in the endometrial cells, although a sub-set of stromal or muscle cells expressed Cbx4 or Rybp, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>). On this day, embryos were also positive for Cbx2 and Rybp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>). However, at the IS on D7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C,D</xref>), the expression for all these members was predominantly detected in the secondary decidual zone (sdz) cells with polyploidy, but primarily downregulated in the primary decidual zone (pdz). In the mesometrial (M) decidual bed, Cbx2, Cbx4, and Rybp were mostly undetected, although Ring1B exhibited weak signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C,D</xref>). On this day, trophoblast giant cells and the embryo proper also had expression for all of the above members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C,D</xref>). In contrast, at the inter-implantation sites (IIS) on D7, these regulators were mostly absent with an exception for Rybp, which exhibited somewhat weak staining in epithelial and sub-epithelial stromal cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1A</xref>). No staining was noted in the antimesometrial (AM) location when D7-IS sections were incubated with normal rabbit or mouse IgG as controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1B</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that PRC1 members are differentially and spatiotemporally controlled during early pregnancy, with a striking up-regulation in polyploid decidual cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 are colocalized with Cbx4/2 and Ring1B in the polyploid decidual cells</title><p>Because functional activation of PRC1 leads to monoubiquitination of H2A on K119 and because this modification depends on H3K27me3 for canonical repressive mechanism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, we next measured uterine levels of H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 during early pregnancy. Based on western blot analyses, we detected both H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 on D4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A,B</xref>). However, following implantation on D5, both were induced at the IS, and this up-regulation was maintained through D6-8 IS rather than their corresponding IISs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A,B</xref>). The analysis of deciduoma tissues revealed that both marks were upregulated as compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A,B</xref>). We next analyzed cell specific expression of H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 by IHC studies. On D4, both were detected in all uterine cell types, although with a scattered distribution in muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>). This pattern of expression was somewhat maintained at D5-IS, although H2AK119ub1 was mostly undetected in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>). However, on D7-IS, both were distributed in sdz with polyploid cells, but the signal was undetected in pdz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>). In the M-pole, both were detected in decidual cells, but exhibited low or undetected expression in luminal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Trophoblast giant cells (tgc) and the embryo proper also expressed both on this day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>). At the D7-IIS, detectable levels were observed primarily in epithelial and stromal cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2A</xref>), yet no signals were revealed when D7-IS sections were incubated with normal mouse IgG as a control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2B</xref>). We next examined the functional relationship between H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3, in conjunction with PRC1 members, by dual IF studies at the D7-IS. Our analyses revealed a co-localization of H2AK119ub1 either with H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref>) or Ring1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>), as well as co-localization of Cbx4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>) or Cbx2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref>) together with H3K27me3 in polyploid decidual cells. The expression of Ring1B, Cbx4, H2AK119ub1, and H3K27me3 was induced in isolated polyploid, as compared to non-polyploid decidual cells following an experimental decidualization on D7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that PRC1-dependent activation mark H2AK119ub1 is spatiotemporally and coordinately controlled with H3K27me3 in periimplantation uteri with particular emphasis in polyploid decidual cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Inhibition of PRC1 minimally affects embryo-uterine attachment during early pregnancy</title><p>To examine the importance of the PRC1 function in early pregnancy, we applied a small-molecule inhibitor (PRT4165) of PRC1 in initial implantation events, specifically during the progression of embryo-uterine attachment and uterine decidualization. PRT4165, a known and potent inhibitor of H2AK119ub1, also inhibits Ring1A/B-containing PRC1 activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. We first introduced the inhibitor during the preimplantation period on D3 and D4 (<italic>schedule A</italic>), as described in the &#x0201c;Materials and Methods&#x0201d;, to examine the embryo-uterine attachment reaction, monitored on D5 by blue-dye injection method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Our analyses revealed that there were no significant alterations in the number of embryo attachment reactions and the weights of IS between the vehicle (control) or PRT4165 (4 or 8&#x02009;mg/kg) treated groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4A,B</xref>). The analyses of IS morphology, proliferation status, and expression of implantation markers revealed no significant difference between the drug- and control-treated groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4C&#x02013;F</xref>). Mice treated with the drug or control did not show any alteration in the number of pups. However, our analysis of H2AK119ub1 expression at the IS revealed its significant downregulation by PRT4165 as compared to control, suggesting PRC1 activity was indeed affected by the drug treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4G</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that PRC1 plays a minimal role in early embryo-uterine attachment during implantation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Inhibition of PRC1 causes disruption of decidualization and polyploidy development during early pregnancy</title><p>To analyze the role of PRC1 during the post-implantation period, we administered PRT4165 in mice during decidual progression on D5-7 (<italic>schedule B</italic>), as described in the &#x0201c;Materials and Methods&#x0201d;. Our analyses of implantation progression on D8-IS revealed a significant reduction in weight, but not in number, following addition of the drug at 4mg/kg, as compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A,B</xref>). In contrast, at a higher dose (8 mg/kg) of drug treatment, the inhibitory effect dramatically impacted the progression of decidualization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>); the presence of tissue debris (shown by **) within the lumen and the appearance of newly formed epithelial cell layer surrounding the lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D</xref>) suggests that a rapid regeneration of the endometrium follows the loss of decidualization. The drug treatment at both doses resulted in a complete loss of pups, as compared to the control (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6 for each group) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>), suggesting that PRC1 function during decidualization is critical to supporting successful pregnancy. The histological analyses of D8-IS revealed that compared to the control, the drug treatment at 4&#x02009;mg/kg resulted in significant disruption of regional decidualization; the decidual bed in M-pole was bigger with a concomitant decrease in sdz (lateral and AM locations) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D,E</xref>). The above defects were not associated with any disturbances in ovarian E2 and P4 levels in serum or ovarian corpora luteal structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5A,B</xref>, respectively).</p><p>Since successful decidualization requires coordinated progression of stromal cell proliferation and differentiation at the site of implantation, we first analyzed the aspects of proliferation at D8-IS, after the drug treatment at 4&#x02009;mg/kg, as compared to the control.

The highlight of the present investigation is that specific PRC1 subunits (Cbx2/4, Ring1B, and Rybp) exhibit distinct upregulation during decidualization with polyploidy. The functionally active PRC1 in polyploid decidual cells is revealed by detection of H2AK119ub1 via its co-localization together with PRC1 subunits or H3K27me3, an upstream canonical regulator of PRC1 function. Strikingly, inhibition of PRC1 function or perturbation of <italic>Cbx4</italic> expression resulted in decidual disruption with loss of polyploidy and pregnancy failure. Based on RNA-seq studies, we identified PRC1-dependent target genes that control multiple signaling networks primarily directed towards extracellular functions, including matrix remodeling, proteolytic function, cell adhesion, cellular transport, and immune regulation during decidual progression.</p><p>In the receptive uterus on D4 in mice, stromal cells experience proliferation, while epithelial cells follow differentiation, under the coordinated control of both ovarian estrogen and progesterone. Following the embryonic attachment, which occurs on D4 24:00&#x02009;h, stromal cells at the site of implanting embryo exhibit rapid proliferation that persists until D5 morning. The first sign of stromal differentiation, formation of pdz, occurs in close proximity to the implantation chamber toward the AM-pole in the afternoon on D5<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. PDZ is avascular and epithelioid in nature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>; however, terminal differentiation of stroma with decidual polyploidy forms the secondary decidual zone (sdz), which occurs through continuous proliferation and differentiation next to the pdz on D6 through D8. SDZ develops both at the lateral and AM-pole locations of the decidual bed. In contrast to sdz development, stromal cells in the M-pole continue to proliferate and differentiate to form the non-polyploid decidual zone, a presumptive site for placentation.</p><p>Previously, studies based on biochemical purification or genome-wide localization have implicated that at least six various combinations of PRC1 subunits direct H2AK119ub1 marks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. In this regard, the presence of RYBP, in RING1A/B/PCGF-containing complex, appears to support RING1/2 toward H2AK119ub1, but also prevents incorporation of CBX/PHC in PRC1 core complex, indicating the inhibition of canonical acitivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Although the canonical activity depends on PRC1 recruitment via Cbx proteins downstream of PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 marks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, recent studies have also documented that H2AK119ub1 creates a binding site for Jarid2&#x02013;Aebp2&#x02013;containing PRC2 and promotes H3K27me3 on H2AK119ub1 nucleosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, thus suggesting a mutually interactive relationship. In contrast, studies have also shown that PRC1 can have independent functions via RYBP-containing PRC1 complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. However, the specific composition and function of PRC1 variants in tissue biology remain poorly defined.</p><p>Here, we observed that a full complement of all five members of PRC1 was detected at the IS on D5 and D7, as compared to D4. The analyses of PRC1 composition, based on cell-specific expression revealed that at least Cbx2/4, Ring1B, and Rybp may be needed in uterine epithelial cells on D4. They also become predominantly localized in decidual polyploid cells at the D7-IS, suggesting that these regulators may participate not only in epithelial differentiation prior to implantation on D4, but also later in terminal differentiation for decidual polyploidy in the post-implantation uterus. The detection of H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 in epithelial and decidual polyploid cells suggests that the PRC1-mediated repressive function supports differentiation for these cell types. However, a weak expression in sub-luminal stroma on D4 or lack of detection in M-pole of the above PRC1 proteins on D7-IS, as opposed to a distinct wide-spread stromal/decidual expression of H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 on these days, suggests that these cells may utilize a different PRC1 complex for proliferation or differentiation functions, respectively. However, on D5-IS, throughout endometrial stromal expression of H2AK119ub1, H3K27me3, Cbx2, and Ring1B (with exceptions include Cbx4 and Rybp), suggests that the later members play limited roles during the initial decidual progression. The upregulation of Cbx2/4 specifically in polyploid decidual cells on D7 is interesting, since studies have shown that the cellular differentiation commitment is orchestrated by a combination of Cbx2 and Cbx4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. It has also been suggested that the presence of Cbx7 opposes differentiation progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Our observation of <italic>Cbx7</italic>&#x02019;s downregulation at D7-IS may support the above notion.</p><p>The downregulation of <italic>Phc1-3, Mel18, Pcgf1, and Pcgf6</italic> in experimental decidualization, as opposed to their upregulation during implantation, and induced expression of H2AK119ub1 in isolated deciduomal polyploid cells, compared to that of non-polyploid cells, suggests that these PHCs and PCGFs play limited roles in PRC1-mediated functions during deciduomal polyploidization. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that differential gene regulation during implantation-induced decidualization vs. experimental decidualization has been reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. However, the coordinated regulation of H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub1 in polyploid decidual or deciduomal cells suggests that canonical PRC1 silencing mechanism plays a major role during decidual polyploidization, although a different combination of PRC1 may be utilized.</p><p>To evaluate the role of PRC1 in early pregnancy, we observed that the inhibition of PRC1 was unable to show any aberration with the embryonic attachment, but instead exhibited disruption of decidual development and the failure of pregnancy. Specifically, we noted that PRC1 inhibition (at a lower dose of the drug) leads to abrogation of regional decidualization, primarily due to enhanced cell cycle activity for diploid cells in the M-pole and increased inhibition of cell cycle progression and polyploidy development in the sdz. These results indicate that the M-pole specific decidual bed (a presumptive site for placentation) may be developmentally interlinked with the sdz at the site of implantation. A similar conclusion has recently been shown by the genetic deletion of FoxM1, a regulator of cell cycle progression in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. The above decidualization defect was strongly correlated with dysregulation of expression for decidual genes (<italic>Alp1, Bmp2, p21, p57, Hoxa10</italic>, and <italic>Hoxa11</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>, suggesting that the alteration of selective decidual genes is responsible for the disruption of normal decidual development. The inhibition of PRC1 also results in aberration with increased expression of downregulated genes (<italic>Bcl3, Nr5a1</italic>, and <italic>Gm7257</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref> in the decidual bed, indicating PRC1-mediated regulation of both positive and negative genes is necessary for an appropriate control of uterine decidualization. It is also interesting to note that the loss of decidual growth by PRC1 inhibitor at a higher dose was rapidly restored with the epithelial cell lining surrounding the degenerated mass of decidua, suggesting that the inhibition of PRC1 is not detrimental to epithelial cell regeneration. Previously, studies have shown that decidual regression is coordinately balanced by the remarkable regeneration capacity of the endometrium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. In the regard, it is worth mentioning that the adult endometrial stem/progenitor cells, as likely contributors, have been identified in human and mouse endometrium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>.</p><p>Our analysis of expression revealed that both Cbx4 and Cbx2 were detected with a similar expression pattern in the uterus during the periimplantation period, and since both can participate in the PRC1 complex, we just arbitrarily chosen <italic>Cbx4</italic> in our subsequent suppression studies to evaluate its role in decidualization.

These results were also consistent with inhibition of H2AK119ub1, suggesting that this inhibition plays a central role in PRC1 function during successful decidualization and polyploidy development.</p><p>It has been well recognized that the decidual tissue development at the site of implantation critically controls invasion of trophoblast cells into the uterine endometrium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>, which requires a highly regulated control of the extracellular tissue remodeling in decidual bed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>; however the mechanism of this regulation remains unknown.

During uterine decidualization and polyploidization, the strict control of immune gene expression has been shown<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Interestingly, after inhibition of PRC1 during decidualization in mice, we observed alteration of 28 immune regulatory genes. In addition, we also noted that PRC1 inhibition causes alteration of 32 genes associated with endoplasmic reticulum part. Interestingly, a network appears to suggest that many of these genes are connected to exopeptidase and transport regulatory activities, which further suggests that PRC1 regulates a program related to tissue remodeling. Overall, we believe that our identified PRC1-dependent gene networks will provide new molecular insights about the mechanism of PRC1 functions during decidualization.</p><p>Previously, studies have shown that BMP2, an exclusive marker of uterine stromal/decidual cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, plays a critical role in decidualization in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> and humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Our study revealed that 24 PRT4165-dependent upregulated genes were also upregulated by BMP2 deletion during decidualization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, suggesting that PRC1 may be involved in suppression of these genes by BMP-dependent pathways.
