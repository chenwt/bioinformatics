Many emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases are zoonoses derived from wildlife, particularly bats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Bats are now recognized as a major reservoir of zoonotic agents. High profile examples include the henipaviruses (Hendra and Nipah) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronavirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], Ebola virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and most recently the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The significance of bats as a reservoir for zoonotic viruses was first recognized with the emergence of Hendra virus (HeV) in northern Australia in 1994. In two independent spillover events, HeV claimed the lives of 15 horses and two humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Approximately four years after HeV emerged, a related paramyxovirus, designated Nipah virus (NiV), emerged in farmed pigs in Malaysia. Between 1998 and 1999, this virus claimed the lives of 105 humans and resulted in the culling of over one million pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. NiV outbreaks occur annually in Bangladesh with cases of direct human-to-human transmission also reported. Bats of the <italic>Pteropus</italic> genus are the natural reservoir of both HeV and NiV.</p><p>Despite the fact that many of the zoonotic viruses harbored by bats are highly pathogenic to their spillover hosts, bats remain clinically unaffected and rarely display any signs of disease. Some rabies-like viruses are the notable exception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The mechanism by which bats control viral replication remains largely unknown. Despite the absence of clinical disease, bats are capable of shedding virus and triggering subsequent zoonotic transmission. This situation implies bats are capable of controlling viral replication, but not eliminating it. Studies on Ebola have demonstrated that bat lung fibroblasts (derived from the Mexican free-tailed bat) are capable of maintaining a low-level persistent infection with wild-type Ebola Zaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Recent studies have demonstrated that genes involved in innate immunity have evolved rapidly under positive selection within the Australian black flying fox (<italic>Pteropus alecto</italic>), indicative of co-evolution between virus and host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, in-depth knowledge about the antiviral response of bats is still lacking, as are the reagents necessary to study these non-model species. The present study addresses this knowledge gap by comparing the response of <italic>P. alecto</italic> with humans following HeV infection. As the natural reservoir of HeV, <italic>P. alecto</italic> remains clinically asymptomatic. By contrast, zoonotic transmission of HeV to horses and humans is often fatal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Genomic resources are now available for a number of bat species, including whole draft genome sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and <italic>de novo</italic> assembled transcriptomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A draft genome sequence for the <italic>P. alecto</italic> was released in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, to date, no studies have examined the antiviral response of this species - or any other bat species - to infectious viruses at either the transcriptome or proteome level. The study of infectious agents in any non-model organism by high-throughput techniques is severely constrained by the quality and availability of gene model annotations, particularly in the field of proteomics. While the draft <italic>P. alecto</italic> genome was annotated using a combination of homology, <italic>de novo</italic> prediction and transcriptomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], continual refinement is necessary. To circumvent the reliance on high-quality annotation models, we recently developed proteomics informed by transcriptomics (PIT) analysis. This technique collects RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) and quantitative high-throughput proteomics data simultaneously, then uses the transcriptomic data to refine and inform the proteomics analysis. We have previously demonstrated that this combined approach sidesteps the issue of bioinformatics annotation and enables the analysis of any species on a similar footing to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Using stable isotope incorporation of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and RNAseq transcriptomics, we compared the response of kidney cells derived from human and the Australian black flying fox to HeV infection at 8 and 24&#x000a0;h. Because of the paucity of well-characterized primary cell lines from the Australian black flying fox, we chose to utilize immortalized cells lines from bats (known as PaKiT03) and humans (HEK293T). Attempts were made to choose cells that were transcriptionally and phenotypically similar. Both cell lines were derived from the kidney, immortalized using viral antigens, and are supportive of HeV replication.</p><p>We found that the response of HEK293T cells was significantly different to PaKiT03 cells. The HEK293T cells showed little transcriptional or proteomic response to HeV at 8&#x000a0;h post infection (hpi), followed by a global suppression in protein abundance at 24 hpi. By contrast, PaKiT03 cells initially underwent activation of NF-kappa-B (NF-&#x003ba;B) at 8 hpi, followed by the induction of extrinsic apoptosis pathways at 24 hpi. Further analysis of the responses after 48 and 72&#x000a0;h of HeV infection revealed that PaKiT03 cells, but not HEK293T cells, underwent apoptotic cell death. In addition, our study provides proteomic evidence for over 5,000 genes in the <italic>P. alecto</italic> genome, including several hundred previously unannotated genes. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the transcriptional and proteomic response to HeV in any cell type. Furthermore, this study represents the first side-by-side transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of a single virus in two relevant host species. This study generates valuable knowledge concerning the divergent response of a reservoir and susceptible host to a highly pathogenic bat-borne virus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>HeV transcription comparison between cell lines</title><p>Virus nucleocapsid (N) protein was detectable in increasing numbers of cells at 8 and 24 hpi (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A-F).

Differential expression analysis of <italic>de novo</italic> assembled transcripts revealed that the overall response to HeV was distinct between cell lines (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). In the PaKiT03 cells, HeV infection induced the expression of over 200 transcripts at 8 hpi and over 600 transcripts at 24 hpi (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). By contrast, only 8 and 31 transcripts were up-regulated at 8 and 24 hpi in the HEK293T cells (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In both cell lines, many of the transcripts induced at 8 hpi remained up-regulated at 24 hpi. The proteomic response also differed significantly between the two cell lines (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Most notably, in HEK293T cells over 1,500 proteins were down-regulated at 24 hpi, whereas only 213 proteins were down-regulated in PaKiT03 cells at this time point (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Of the 100 proteins that were significantly induced in PaKiT03 cells at 8 and/or 24 hpi, 17 were also significantly up-regulated at the mRNA level (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Many of these proteins have proven roles in innate immunity, including the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta (CEBPD), the interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene ISG20, receptors CD40 and CD44, and complement component C3. By contrast, no proteins were up-regulated at both the protein and mRNA level in the HEK293T cells. Furthermore, with one exception in the PaKiT03 cells (SLC12A2), the proteins down-regulated at 8 and/or 24 hpi were not significantly down-regulated at the mRNA level for either cell line.

We used the RNAseq data to <italic>de novo</italic> derive transcripts for both cell lines. All PaKiT03 and HEK293T Trinity transcripts with &#x0003e;70% similarities to the same human gene were obtained by Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Over 10,000 orthologous transcripts were identified by this strategy (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). We first examined the correlation in baseline mRNA expression (at 0 hpi) between the cell lines (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). Because SILAC is a relative quantification method we could not compare the baseline protein expression between the cell lines. A Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient of 0.75 demonstrated that orthologous transcripts showed similar baseline mRNA expression prior to HeV infection. Despite this, at 8 and 24 hpi the correlation in mRNA expression between orthologous transcripts fell significantly (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). Similarly, at the protein level there was poor correlation in relative protein abundance of orthologous transcripts at 8 and 24 hpi (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C). Moderate agreement in mRNA fold change and relative protein abundance was, however, observed between 8 and 24 hpi within each cell line (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B,C). A heatmap of all orthologous transcripts that were significantly differentially expressed - at one or more time point &#x02013; confirmed that the response was similar at 8 and 24 hpi within each cell line, but differed between cell lines (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an important mechanism by which the host can eliminate virus-infected cells. Apoptosis can be triggered through intrinsic (mitochondrial-dependent) or extrinsic signaling pathways. In the present study, a number of genes/proteins involved in the extrinsic TNF receptor-associated inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis signaling pathway were induced at 24 hpi in the PaKiT03 but not HEK293T cells (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). TRAIL-mediated apoptosis occurs through binding of the trimerized ligand to its functional death receptor (DR4/TNFRSF10A or DR5/TNFRSF10B). This is followed by recruitment of the Fas-associated death domain, mediated through a death domain, which induces the sequential activation of caspase 8 (from its pro-caspase precursor) and caspase 3, ultimately leading to apoptosis-mediated cell death (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A)<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>

Acting as a decoy receptor, TNFRSF11B is capable of inhibiting TRAIL-mediated apoptosis as well as NF-&#x003ba;B activation. In a similar vein, TNFIAP3 also inhibits TRAIL-induced apoptosis in certain cells, through poly ubiquitination of the receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) and inhibition of caspase 8 cleavage.

Apoptosis was assessed by measuring the activity of the caspase 3/7, the cleavage of PARP1 (HEK293T only) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). Both cell lines were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 for 24, 48 and 72&#x000a0;h and apoptosis was measured by a Caspase-Glo&#x000ae;3/7 luminescence assay. Cytopathic effects typical of HeV were observed after 24 hpi and increased at 72 hpi (data not shown). To account for the decrease in cell viability within infected cells, we first measured cell viability using a CellTiter-Glo&#x000ae; luminescence assay and then normalized the caspase 3/7 luminescence to cell viability. As expected, cell viability decreased rapidly after 24 hpi in the HEK293T cells, but not in bat cells.

By contrast, no increase in caspase 3/7 was observed in HEK293T cells at any time point. Furthermore, we observed no cleavage of PARP1 in HEK293T cells at 8 or 24 hpi (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>F). The observation that HeV significantly reduces cell viability of HEK293T cells after 24 hpi meant it was not possible to examine the apoptotic response after this time using either PARP1 Western blotting or TUNEL. TUNEL staining of HeV-infected PaKiT03 cells at 24 and 48 hpi demonstrated an increased number of apoptotic cells at 48 hpi (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A). This is in agreement with results from the caspase 3/7 assay. In most cases, TUNEL-positive cells were also infected with HeV at 48 hpi. TUNEL staining of HeV-infected HEK293T could only be performed at 0 and 8 hpi. After this time point HeV infection caused many cells to detach from the coverslips. TUNEL staining at 0 and 8 hpi revealed no apoptotic HEK293T cells (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B). This finding is consistent with the lack of PARP1 cleavage at 8 and 24 hpi in HEK293T cells. Weak cytoplasmic staining was observed in some HEK293T cells, but given we observed no nuclear staining (as seen in PaKiT03 and the DNase control) we concluded this was the result of non-specific background staining.

The ability of bats to maintain asymptomatic viral infections whilst the same agent often causes fatal infections in human is a typical feature of bat-borne zoonotic viruses. The molecular mechanisms responsible for this dichotomy remain unknown. Despite the absence of clinical disease, the fact that bats can shed and transmit viruses suggests bats are capable of controlling viruses, but not eliminating them all together. Rapid induction of the innate immune processes has been proposed as one possible mechanism for subduing viral replication in bats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Considering the importance of bats as natural reservoirs for many emerging viruses, elucidating the mechanisms by which bats control viral replication will be invaluable to the field of emerging infectious diseases. In addition, system-wide analysis of human responses to infection only provides a picture of the pathways affected during a pathogenic infection. Ideally we would like to have a system-wide comparison between a pathogenic and non-pathogenic response to the same infectious agent. With this in mind, we compared the transcriptome and proteome responses of immortalized kidney cells from human and bat following HeV infection using our recently developed integrated systems-wide approach.</p><p>The PaKiT03 and HEK293T cells examined in this study responded very differently to HeV. Even when only high confidence orthologous transcripts are considered, the transcriptomic and proteomic response was significantly different - despite the similar expression profiles of orthologs at 0 hpi. Human HEK293T cells appeared to show little response at 8 hpi, followed by a largely suppressive response at 24 hpi. PaKiT03 cells, however, demonstrated a strong activation of several immune pathways at 8 and 24 hpi, followed by the induction of extrinsic apoptosis at 24 hpi and beyond.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine programmed cell death within a bat species. Apoptosis plays an integral part of the host-pathogen interaction. Induction of the innate immune response often leads to the activation of apoptotic processes, typically through members of the TNF family. We have demonstrated that, following HeV infection, PaKiT03 cells up-regulated components of the TRAIL-mediated apoptosis pathway. By contrast, the HEK293T cells appeared to either down-regulate a number of pro-apoptotic proteins or up-regulate anti-apoptotic components. Induction of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis following viral infection of human cells has been reported previously. In most cases, viral infection induces the expression of the death receptors DR4 and DR5, which in turn sensitizes the cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Infection of human cells with hepatitis C and mammalian reoviruses induces mRNA and protein expression of the functional TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Paramyxoviruses such as human respiratory syncytial virus have also been shown to induce expression of DR5 and DR4 in human lung cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In the PaKiT03 cells, we observed a greater than two-fold increase in <italic>TNFRSF10A</italic>/<italic>DR4</italic> mRNA expression at 24 hpi. Interrogation of the <italic>P. alecto</italic> genome along with our <italic>de novo</italic> assembled transcriptome suggested that, like mice, bats contain only one functional death receptor. <italic>TNFRSF10A</italic>/<italic>DR4</italic> may therefore act as the sole functional TRAIL receptor in bats.</p><p>The expression of TRAIL is regulated through NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] in response to viral infection. Viruses such as measles and respiratory syncytial virus induce functional TRAIL expression in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Here, we observed a significant increase in TRAIL protein expression at 24 hpi in the bat cells. The activation of NF-&#x003ba;B pathways within the bat cells, including the up-regulation of <italic>CD40</italic>, <italic>NFKB2</italic> and <italic>RelB</italic> transcripts, may have contributed to the increased TRAIL protein expression. Surprisingly, we observed no increase in TRAIL mRNA at 8, 24, 48 or 72 hpi within the PaKiT03. This finding suggests that the regulation of TRAIL protein expression possibly occurs post-transcriptionally. By using previously collected lung and kidney tissue samples from HeV-infected bats, we examined the expression of <italic>TRAIL</italic> and <italic>CD40</italic> mRNA in the context of an <italic>in vivo</italic> infection. While no increase in <italic>CD40</italic> mRNA expression was observed in either kidney or lung, we found an approximately five-fold up-regulation of <italic>TRAIL</italic> mRNA in bat lungs infected with HeV for 60&#x000a0;h. Previous, unpublished data from this trial demonstrated that the HeV antigen could only be detected in the lung tissue at 60 hpi through immunohistochemistry (M. Baker, unpublished data). The coordinated up-regulation of <italic>TRAIL</italic> mRNA at the site of HeV infection within the natural host highlights the importance of TRAIL in HeV infection <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The interaction between TRAIL and its functional receptors is crucial for inducing apoptotic cell death through caspase 8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The treatment of cells with human recombinant TRAIL and subsequent HeV infection demonstrated that HeV sensitizes PaKiT03 cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis at 24 hpi. Presumably, this &#x02018;sensitivity&#x02019; is achieved through the increased expression of <italic>TNFRSF10A</italic>/<italic>DR4</italic> as discussed above. A similar observation was made by Clarke <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], where reovirus infection increased the sensitivity of human cells to apoptosis by increasing the expression of <italic>DR4</italic> and <italic>DR5</italic>. In the present study, HEK293T cells showed no increased susceptibility to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis following HeV infection. Importantly, we showed that this finding is not a general feature of human HEK293T cells. Indeed, when we treated these cells with human recombinant TRAIL and infected them with NBV, we saw an increase in TRAIL-mediated apoptosis (evidenced by increased caspase 3/7 activity). We can therefore conclude that the HEK293T cells are indeed capable of TRAIL-induced cell death, but for unclear reasons this process does not occur in response to HeV.</p><p>Pro-apoptotic components down-stream of the death receptors were also induced in the bat cells, including <italic>BBC3</italic>, <italic>BIRC3</italic> and caspase 13. The latter, also known as evolutionarily related interleukin1&#x003b2; converting enzyme, was originally discovered in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], but was later shown to be of bovine origin and is the likely ortholog of human caspase 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In the present study, a transcript resembling caspase 13 was induced at 8 and 24 hpi in the bat cells. Previous studies have shown that over-expression of caspase 13 in human HEK293 and MCF7 cells successfully induces apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Furthermore caspase 13 appeared to be activated by caspase 8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], suggesting this enzyme may play a role in death receptor-mediated apoptosis pathways, such as TRAIL.</p><p>In principle, the ability of PaKiT03 cells to induce apoptotic cell death following HeV infection could provide a mechanism by which cells can effectively inhibit or subdue viral replication. To determine whether this phenotype was representative of all bat cells we examined HeV-induced apoptosis across three more bat (derived from <italic>P. alecto</italic>) and three more human cell lines. The apoptotic response varied widely between the cell lines. Strong caspase 3/7 responses were observed in HEF and HeLa cells at 24 hpi. The bat fetus cells (PaFeB5) also showed a strong caspase 3/7 response, while the brain (PaBrT03) and lung (PaLuT02) cells were less responsive. While these findings demonstrate that HeV-induced apoptosis is not specific to bat cells, they do highlight the importance of programmed cell death in viral infection more broadly. In agreement, a previous study found NiV partially activates and induces apoptotic cell death of human dendritic cells through up-regulation of caspase 3 and down-regulation of bcl2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Considering the induction of apoptosis in PaKiT03 cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, along with the up-regulation of <italic>TRAIL</italic> mRNA in HeV-infected bat lung tissues, we attempted to examine the apoptotic response of bats to HeV <italic>in vivo.</italic> TUNEL staining of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections revealed no increase in the proportion of apoptotic cells in either the kidney or spleen of HeV-infected bats compared to uninfected controls. In fact, very few apoptotic cells were observed in the kidney in any sample, while numerous apoptotic cells were found in the spleen. Unfortunately, the lung sections (where we might have expected to see the most striking differences) from this trial were not suitable for TUNEL staining, due to artifacts created during euthanasia. While this experiment could not definitively demonstrate HeV-induced apoptosis <italic>in vivo</italic> in bats, future examination of tissues from other HeV model species such as ferret and mice - where a more pronounced viral load is achieved - may help clarify the influence of apoptosis <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>We cannot exclude the possibility that the subtle differences in viral transcription between the bat and human cells are influencing the host response. Viruses utilize a number of strategies for counteracting immune and apoptotic signals. Previous studies have demonstrated that paramyxoviruses can use the accessory proteins from the P/V/C gene to inhibit apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The V protein of mumps virus is also known to block IFN expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. When we compared the HeV transcription profile between the cell lines, there appeared to be fewer transcripts for the P/V/W region in human cells compare to bat cells. Considering the important role of the V protein in immune evasion, this transcriptional variation may influence the host response, particularly in regard to IFN production. Phenotypically, we also observed differences in the cytopathic effect between human and bat cells following HeV infection at 24 hpi. Extensive syncytia were observed in the human but not bat cells. Cell fusion and syncytia are mediated by the HeV-F protein. It is therefore interesting to note that we observed higher abundance of F transcript in the human cells compared to bat cells. Differences in the abundance of F transcript may therefore influence the difference in cytopathic effect observed.</p><p>The induction of IFN-&#x003b2;1 and down-stream ISGs in human cells was unexpected. A number of transfection studies have demonstrated that the henipavirus P gene products (P, V, W and C) can inhibit both the IFN induction and IFN signaling pathways in human cell lines (including HEK293T and 2fTGH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. More recent studies on HEK293T cells, however, have shown that, while productive henipavirus infection can effectively block IFN production after 3 hpi, it only partially blocks IFN signaling, as measured by the expression of ISGs at 24 hpi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Similar studies on a range of <italic>P. alecto</italic> cell types, including lung (PaLuT02), primary kidney (PaKi) and fetus (PaFe and PaFeT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], demonstrated that both IFN production and signaling were blocked by henipavirus infection at 3 and 24 hpi, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. By contrast, our findings demonstrate that in human HEK293T cells IFN production and signaling occur at 24 hpi, thus suggesting the host is capable of overcoming the antagonistic effects of HeV at this later time point. It is worth noting that interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), an important transcription factor responsible for IFN-&#x003b2; induction, was down-regulated at the protein level at 24 hpi in human cells. This finding is somewhat at odds with the induction of IFN-&#x003b2;1 at 24 hpi in human cells. NiV has been shown to block IFN production through the accessory V and W proteins by targeting IRF3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. While HeV may use a similar mechanism, a two-fold reduction in IRF3, as observed in this study, does not appear sufficient to completely abolish IFN production in human cells. IFN antiviral response is also mediated to some degree by the Ras/MAPK pathways. Studies of persistent Ebola virus (Mayinga strain) infection of bat lung fibroblasts found that activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway, which antagonizes the IFN response, was required for productive infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In the present study, we found many of the down-regulated transcripts/proteins in the human cells were mapped to MAPK pathways. Inactivation of these pathways may have contributed to the increased IFN response observed in human cells at 24 hpi.</p><p>It should be acknowledged that this study, although comprehensive, examined only one cell type from both bats and humans. The major differences in response between the bat and human cells may to some degree simply reflect differences in cell type. In any mammal, it is highly likely that not all cell types will respond to viral infection in a similar fashion. Furthermore, mechanisms deduced from cell lines may not reflect what occurs <italic>in vivo</italic>. With this in mind, we stress that caution must be taken when extending conclusions from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies (such as ours) to other cell types, and more generally <italic>in vivo</italic> models. However, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies provide significant insight into host mechanisms at the molecular level, ultimately generating numerous hypotheses that can be investigated within appropriate models <italic>in vivo</italic>. Indeed, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies are necessary (at least in the first instance) when examining a highly pathogenic virus (such as HeV) that requires high levels of bio-containment.</p><p>Turning to the many novel genes and proteins identified, that we uncovered a great many new genes that are also positively identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) re-enforces the power of our PIT-based approach to comprehensively identify, annotate and quantitate changes in human and non-model host species. This is the first time a single virus has been comprehensively analyzed by RNAseq and high-throughput quantitative proteomics in cells lines from two species. For the first time, we can compare at a systems level, the response between a resistant reservoir host (bat) and a susceptible spillover host (human). By identifying the crucial cellular pathways whose differential activation correlates with outcome, we open new opportunities for therapeutic intervention, through testing the many pathway-specific licensed drugs already available. Moreover, our approach enables side-by-side comparison of any mammal with humans to determine how similar or divergent two species are when they are infected with a virus or exposed to a drug (or both). In principle, this could guide better selection of animal models and improve our ability to predict how humans will respond to treatments developed in animal models. Finally, our dataset provides transcriptomic and proteomic evidence of approximately 5,900 genes and proteins. This includes evidence for nearly several hundred genes and proteins not listed in the UniProt dataset for <italic>P. alecto</italic>. This represents a major leap forward in our understanding of the genetic content of bats - significant natural hosts of current and potentially future zoonotic agents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>By application of PIT analysis, we have shown that PaKiT03 and HEK293T cells respond significantly differently to HeV at both the mRNA and protein level. Human HEK293T cells demonstrated little early response followed by a global suppression of mRNA and protein abundance. Bat PaKiT03 cells, by contrast, demonstrated a robust innate immune response, which led to the execution of extrinsic TRAIL apoptosis pathways. At 48 and 72 hpi, PaKiT03 cells, but not HEK293T cells, demonstrated a significant increase in apoptotic cell death. However, when further cell lines from bats and humans were examined, we found that at least some human lines (HEF and HeLa) were susceptible to HeV-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, examination of tissue samples from HeV-infected bats failed to reveal widespread apoptosis at least for the spleen and kidneys. Notwithstanding this, we have shown how to compare the response of two distinct species to the same infectious agent using RNAseq and high-throughput quantitative proteomics. We have used this analysis to highlight the potential to identify and test pathways that in principle could have a significant bearing on the outcome of disease. We believe this approach will enable the identification and investigation of pathways that contribute at a molecular level to the devastating differential pathogenicity of zoonotic bat viruses when they infect humans.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec19"><title>Cell culture and SILAC</title><p>The <italic>P. alecto</italic> immortalized kidney derived cell line PaKiT03 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and the human immortalized embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T were predominantly used in this study.

ORFs (from start codon to stop codon) were translated in all frames from the Trinity-derived transcripts and ORFs over 66 amino acids long were compiled into a table together with the transcript they came from. This list of ORFs was searched using BLAST to find the closest homolog in the human UniProt list. This process was repeated for both the human and the bat list of transcripts. Finally, for each entry in the human UniProt list of proteins we selected the best match from the Trinity-derived ORFs for each species. In this way we were able to generate a master list of transcripts and ORFs that were the best matches to the human UniProt list of proteins. This approach allowed us to connect orthologous genes and ORFs from the human Trinity-derived transcripts to the <italic>P. alecto</italic> Trinity-derived transcripts and ORFs.

Differential expression was calculated relative to uninfected T0, normalized to GAPDH using the relative expression software tool REST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Protein quantity was determined for SDS boiled lysates using the EZQ Protein Quantitation Kit (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. For each sample a total of 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of protein lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk powder for 1&#x000a0;h. Membranes were washed three times (10&#x000a0;min each) with Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (TBST), and then incubated for 1&#x000a0;h with primary antibody diluted in TBST. The following primary rabbit antibodies were used: CD40 (1:5,000, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, USA), A20 (1:1,000, Cell Signaling, Danvers, USA) and &#x003b2;2-tubulin (1:2,000, Cell Signaling). Membranes were washed three times with TBST and then incubated for 1&#x000a0;h with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in TBST. Membranes were finally washed twice with TBST, once with TBS and developed with ECL-Plus chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher) as per the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Membranes were scanned at 473&#x000a0;nm on a Typhon FLA9000 gel imaging scanner (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK).</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Apoptosis and viability assay</title><p>The Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay (Promega, Madison, USA) was used to determine the activity of caspase 3/7. Cell viability was determined using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega). For both assays, approximately, 30,000 cells/well were seeded into white 96-well plates. Cells were infected with HeV or NBV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] for 24, 48 and 72&#x000a0;h at an MOI of approximately 5. Both assays were performed exactly as per the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions, in triplicate. TRAIL stimulation with performed using Super<italic>Killer</italic>TRAIL (AdipoGen, San Diego, USA) at 500&#x000a0;ng/ml diluted in media. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare the caspase 3/7 luminescence over the control.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>TUNEL staining</title><p>TUNEL was used to identify apoptotic PaKiT03 and HEK293T cells following viral infection. Approximately 1.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> cells were seeded onto 15&#x000a0;mm diameter coverslips in individual wells of a 24-well plate. Cells were either mock or infected for 8, 24 or 48&#x000a0;h with HeV/1994/Australia strain at an MOI of 5. Media was removed and cells were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1&#x000a0;h. Cells were then gently washed three times in PBS. Staining was performed using a Click-iT TUNEL Alexa Fluor&#x000ae; 488 kit as per the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (Life Technologies). Optional immunofluorescence was performed against the HeV-N protein as described above except a secondary Alexa Fluor 568 Goat Anti-Rabbit antibody (Life Technologies) was used.</p><p>Colormetric TUNEL staining was performed on Australian black flying fox spleen and kidney tissue sections from a previous unpublished experimental HeV infection. Following routine histological processing and paraffin embedding, blocks were sectioned at 4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m on to positively charged slides and placed in a 37&#x000b0;C oven to dry. Sections were placed in a 60&#x000b0;C incubator for 10&#x000a0;min prior to de-waxing and rehydration through a series of graded alcohols to water. The TUNEL staining for apoptotic cells was carried out as per the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions for tissue sections using the DeadEnd Colorimetric TUNEL System (Promega) with the exception of a substitution of 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazol for 3,3&#x02032;-diaminobenzidine as the chromogen. The sections were subsequently counterstained with Lillie-Mayer&#x02019;s hematoxylin to enable visualization of the morphological structure of the tissue.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec32"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13059_2014_532_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1</label><caption><p>
