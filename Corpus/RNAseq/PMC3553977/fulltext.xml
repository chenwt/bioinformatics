This article describes miRDeep*, our integrated miRNA identification tool, which is modeled off miRDeep, but the precision of detecting novel miRNAs is improved by introducing new strategies to identify precursor miRNAs. miRDeep* has a user-friendly graphic interface and accepts raw data in FastQ and Sequence Alignment Map (SAM) or the binary equivalent (BAM) format. Known and novel miRNA expression levels, as measured by the number of reads, are displayed in an interface, which shows each RNAseq read relative to the pre-miRNA hairpin. The secondary pre-miRNA structure and read locations for each predicted miRNA are shown and kept in a separate figure file. Moreover, the target genes of known and novel miRNAs are predicted using the TargetScan algorithm, and the targets are ranked according to the confidence score. miRDeep* is an integrated standalone application where sequence alignment, pre-miRNA secondary structure calculation and graphical display are purely Java coded. This application tool can be executed using a normal personal computer with 1.5 GB of memory. Further, we show that miRDeep* outperformed existing miRNA prediction tools using our LNCaP and other small RNAseq datasets. miRDeep* is freely available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.australianprostatecentre.org/research/software/mirdeep-star">http://www.australianprostatecentre.org/research/software/mirdeep-star</ext-link>.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Micro RNA (miRNA) is a class of small, non-protein&#x02013;coding RNA (ncRNA) that is important in normal physiology, which includes development and tissue-specific processes in many eukaryotic systems. Mature miRNAs are typically generated from longer primary and precursor miRNA or from intronic RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B2">2</xref>). miRNA typically mediate its biological effects through translation inhibition or, in some instances, by RNA degradation through the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B3">3</xref>). It is thought that, similar to other diseases, dysregulated miRNA expression in prostate cells can lead to prostate cancer progression. Indeed, 26 miRNAs have been found to be deregulated in prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B4">4</xref>). The prostate is regulated by the male hormones, androgens, and the action of androgens is mediated by its cognate receptor, the androgen receptor (AR), which is a ligand-dependent transcription factor. Concomitantly, androgens are also important in prostate cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B5">5</xref>). Consequently, much research in the prostate cancer field has focused on genes that are targeted by the AR signaling axis in this disease. However, other than the TMPRSS2&#x02013;ERG fusion gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B6">6</xref>), which appears to be overexpressed in many prostate cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B7">7</xref>), the other bona fide AR target genes that are important in prostate cancer progression remain elusive. Two recent microarray studies suggest that at least 27 known miRNAs are androgen regulated in prostate cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B9">9</xref>), although this number is likely to increase as data emerge from next-generation sequencing platforms that have already identified many novel prostate expressed miRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B10 gks1187-B11 gks1187-B12">10&#x02013;12</xref>).</p><p>The advent of high-throughput sequencing technology has provided researchers an unbiased opportunity to systematically identify most, if not all, of the miRNA that are expressed in the transcriptome. Thus, determining levels of known and novel miRNA from small RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data is an important issue in the era of next generation sequencing. Although there are several miRNA profiling applications such as miRanalyzer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B13">13</xref>), miRTRAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B14">14</xref>) and MIReNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B15">15</xref>), these methods rely on known miRNAs and a user&#x02019;s training data. Consequently, these results largely depend on known miRNA data and the classification algorithm. In miRDeep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B16">16</xref>), prediction of miRNA from sequenced reads is output as a probability from the log odds ratio. More recently, miRDeep2 was developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B17">17</xref>), which offers similar improved mature miRNA prediction algorithms as those used in our miRDeep* tool. Indeed, miRDeep2 has shown great predictive ability of bona fide miRNA by comparing between datasets where the miRNA biogenesis pathway was or was not active. miRDeep2 has also adopted other improved functionalities such as a graphics output of the predicted secondary structure of pre-miRNA. However, miRDeep2 and other similar miRNA prediction tools are dependent on other software such as pre-miRNA secondary structure prediction and/or genome mapping. Consequently, we have developed miRDeep*, which is an integrated tool that can be used to identify novel miRNA from raw RNAseq reads, as well as quantifying miRNA expression. Further, miRDeep* offers a user-friendly graphical output that displays the location of the sequenced reads in the pre-miRNA hairpin structure. All components of miRNA identification in this application, such as sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B19">19</xref>) and RNA folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B20">20</xref>), is purely Java coded. In addition, miRDeep* incorporates the widely used TargetScan program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B21 gks1187-B22 gks1187-B23">21&#x02013;23</xref>). The targets of both known and novel miRNA are predicted using one click. Finally, miRDeep* is compatible for use with other species to identify both novel and known miRNAs from raw small RNAseq data.</p><p>In this study, we have used the Illumina Genome Analyser II to sequence the androgen-regulated small RNA transcriptome of LNCaP prostate cancer cells. We demonstrate using this dataset that miRDeep* has higher precision in detecting novel miRNA from the total number of predictions when compared with other available miRNA prediction tools, such as miRDeep, miRDeep2, miRanalyzer, miRTRAP and MIReNA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The LNCaP prostate cancer cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection.

For steroid treatment experiments, cells were cultured until approximately 70% confluent and then maintained in media containing 10% charcoal-stripped serum (HyClone, Denver, CO) for 48 h, followed by the addition of 1 nM R1881 or ethanol (Mock control) for an additional 48 h.</p></sec><sec><title>Small RNAseq</title><p>RNA was isolated using the miRVana RNA isolation kit (Life Technologies).

Genomic mapping is one of the most time-consuming procedures. To reduce mapping time, all sequence reads that are the same are first aggregated, and representative reads are then mapped to the genome. Moreover, reads that are outside the range of miRNA length (18&#x02013;23 nucleotides) are excluded before genomic mapping. Mapped reads are then output in a SAM format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B25">25</xref>). Alternatively, pre-generated SAM files by other genomic tools can be used for integration into the miRDeep* pipeline.

However, miRDeep* adopts a different strategy to excise the potential precursor locus range. In miRDeep, if the coverage region is greater than 30 bp, then both sides of the coverage region are extended by 22 bp for the precursor miRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1187-F1">Figure 1</xref>b; Case 1). However, if the coverage region is less than 30 bp, then one side of the coverage is extended by 22 bp and the other side is extended to ensure that the potential miRNA precursor totals 110 bp in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1187-F1">Figure 1</xref>b; Case 2). The highest expressed read is considered as the mature miRNA.</p><p>In miRDeep*, the highest expressed read at the potential miRNA locus is also considered as the mature miRNA. One side of the read is extended by 22 bp (for miRNA offset RNA), and the other side of the read is extended by 15 bp (to account for the loop region) and the mature RNA* that has the same number (<italic>n</italic> [base pairs]) of nucleotides as the mature miRNA, as well as by 22 bp for the miRNA offset RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1187-F1">Figure 1</xref>d). Consequently, miRDeep* can prevent some false negatives that might arise from improper precursor regions that can be selected for miRDeep. This strategy is similar to that of the recently published miRDeep2 algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1187-F1">Figure 1</xref>c).</p></sec><sec><title>miRDeep* application and interface</title><p>This application tool has been developed in the platform-independent computer language, Java. As a result, it can run in Linux, MS Windows and MacOS. To further reduce the memory requirement for miRDeep*, we have implemented a compact Java version of the Bowtie alignment algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B18">18</xref>) where the index files are loaded chromosome by chromosome, instead of loading the entire chromosome index at once.</p><p>Using this approach, it takes about 1 h to align 3 million reads using a PC comprising 2.5 GHz CPU and 4.00 GB memory (RAM). From the raw data (FastQ format), miRDeep* will identify novel miRNAs and also generate all expression data for known and novel miRNAs.</p><p>The miRDeep* interface has four parts:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>User input parameters: The Illumina Deep sequencing platform adapters are the default adapter sequence for miRDeep*. The default length of miRNAs is set at 18&#x02013;23 nucleotides. Low-quality reads are filtered out at the alignment stage. A read with more than a 20 phred score (which represents 99% base call accuracy) is considered to be a good read. We also filter out multi-mapping reads with alignments to more than 100 genomic loci. This parameter can be changed at the user&#x02019;s discretion. miRDeep* uses other mapped reads at that loci to determine the strength of the prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1187-F2">Figure 2</xref>). Reads mapping to tRNA, sno-RNA and piRNA are also excluded. Currently, miRDeep* is unable to handle technical or biological mismatches. The score is based on the probabilistic score of the potential miRNA precursor that was previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B27">27</xref>). miRDeep* also incorporates a tick box for to allow miRDeep* users to alternatively use the original miRDeep algorithm.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Input file area for raw data (FastQ), pre-aligned files (SAM or BAM) or results (generated by miRDeep*) files: In the first step, input reads are converted to FastQ format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B25">25</xref>) for genomic alignment. We have implemented our small memory consuming Bowtie algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B18">18</xref>) for the alignments because miRDeep* is targeted at ordinary PCs with limited memory capacities.

MiRTRAP predicted similar number of miRNAs with miRDeep2, but the precision is lower than miRDeep. MIReNA predicted a small number of miRNAs, but a few of them are not in miRBase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B36">36</xref>). Both the precision and recall of MIReNA are lower than miRDeep*.

However, one of these novel miRNAs (novel 5) could not be amplified, including the synthesized positive control oligonucleotide. Consequently, further validation was only carried out for the other four novel miRNA predicted by miRDeep*. The highly expressed hsa-miR-29a, an androgen-regulated miRNA in prostate cancer cells, and hsa-let-7a-2 expression were also assessed by SL-RT TaqMan PCR.

Indeed, the mechanisms through which miRNA mediate the post-transcriptional effects appear to extend beyond the classical translational repression and RNA degradation pathways. Recent studies have discovered that miRNA might also be involved in regulating the actions of ribonucleoprotein complexes in a mechanism that is independent of the canonical RISC pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B1">1</xref>). The levels of a number of miRNA have been reported to be deregulated in many complex diseases, such as cancer, and at least 26 altered miRNA profiles have already been described in prostate cancer alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B4">4</xref>). In fact, a recent study has identified a panel of miRNA, which can be used to differentiate between normal and prostate cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B39">39</xref>). These recent discoveries highlight the importance of identifying miRNA that are expressed in normal and disease contexts so that therapeutic and disease management strategies can be employed.</p><p>We have taken advantage of the recent advances made in next-generation RNAseq to profile the androgen-regulated small-RNA transcriptome in prostate cancer cells. We investigated the miRNA expression profile in our small RNAseq dataset on the basis of the importance of miRNA in prostate cancer, and the role of androgens in prostate cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B40">40</xref>). However, to use the existing miRNA prediction tools&#x02014;miRDeep and its varieties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B42">42</xref>)&#x02014;we have to pre-process the data using several other application tools such as a read alignment tool and a RNA secondary structure tool. Moreover, some miRNA, such as miR-25 and miR-200a, were found to be highly expressed in our LNCaP dataset by miRDeep* but were not detected by miRDeep due to improper excision of the pre-miRNA region in those algorithms. Importantly, Martens <italic>et al.</italic>, discovered novel miRNA in their study, and miRDeep* was able to detect seven of these novel miRNA in our LNCaP small RNAseq data.</p><p>miRDeep* is a standalone, one-click, integrated, RNAseq-based miRNA prediction tool. This application does not require any pre-installed computational tools, such as a RNA secondary structure tool or a genome alignment tool. These tools are built into miRDeep* using pure Java coding. Therefore, this application can be easily executed on any platform (Linux, Windows and MacOS). Although there are several RNAseq-based miRNA computational tools, we provide the first truly intuitive and most user-friendly tool that has a graphics display output showing the RNAseq reads relative to the pre-miRNA secondary structure. This display also illustrates miRNA isoforms, including the copy numbers for each variant. This application also accepts aligned reads in SAM/BAM format as input files. One of the major advantages of miRDeep* in reducing analysis time is that, unlike other web-based algorithms, miRDeep* is a standalone application where all the data are readily accessible to the user, making it easy to adjust the source code and to change the miRNA prediction strategy. Moreover, miRDeep* is not affected by other users because this standalone application runs on a local machine. Sequence alignment and RNA secondary structure modeling of 3 million reads takes only 3 h to perform on miRDeep* using a PC windows XP with 2.5 GHz CPU and 4 G RAM, whereas a similar analysis can take up to 12 h using the web-based miRanalyzer and miRTRAP and MIReNA.</p><p>Many of the current small RNAseq-based miRNA prediction tools have been influenced by the highly effective miRDeep tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B43">43</xref>). For example, deepBase that has a repository of 2038 predicted miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B44">44</xref>) used 185 publically available small RNAseq experiments and the miRDeep algorithm to compile the database. seqBuster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B45">45</xref>) provides a web-based and standalone application to analyse known miRNA variants. miRanalyzer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B46">46</xref>) is a web-based application that finds known and novel miRNAs from sequence data and uses a random forest machine learning algorithm to predict novel miRNAs. miRNAKey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B47">47</xref>) and DSAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1187-B48">48</xref>) determine the differential known miRNA expression from deep sequence data. More recently, the miRDeep2 program was introduced, which improved on the original miRDeep algorithm as well as other functions such as graphical output. Coincidentally, we were independently developing miRDeep* in parallel with miRDeep2, using similar algorithms to identify the precursor miRNA, and extra functionalities such as a graphical output. However, miRDeep* has slightly different approaches including a dynamic graphical output as opposed to miRDeep2&#x02019;s static output.</p><p>We have benchmarked miRDeep* against miRDeep, miRDeep2, miRTRAP, mIReNA and miRanalyzer using the same small RNAseq reads. Our analyses was carried out under no <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge that the dataset was derived from human prostate cancer cells and so attempted to find all possible miRNAs. miRanalyzer was able to detect approximately 5-fold more miRNA from the same dataset compared with miRDeep*, miRDeep2 and miRDeep; however, the precision for miRanalzer was only &#x0223c;20%. miRDeep* had slightly better precision (less than 10%) and recall (less than 5%) compared with miRDeep. Interestingly, miRDeep2 had lower precision compared with the original miRDeep for our dataset. However, the recall of miRDeep2 was much better than miRDeep* (mock: &#x0223c;27%; R1881: &#x0223c;18%) and miRDeep (mock: &#x0223c;30%; R1881: &#x0223c;23%). The improved predictive ability of miRDeep* was further supported by using a dataset whereby the classical miRNA biogenesis pathway was turned off through Dicer knock-down. Using this dataset, bona fide mature miRNA are less likely to be predicted in cells where Dicer was knocked out. Our results demonstrated that miRDeep* is less likely to result in false-positive predictions of miRNA compared with miRDeep2. MiRTRAP detected similar numbers of miRNA from the same dataset with miRDeep2, but its precision was lower than miRDeep2. However, miRTRAP has a better performance than MIReNA in terms of precision and recall in our datasets. Finally, we have analysed seven other small RNAseq datasets from breast cancers using miRDeep* and found that the performance (precision and recall) is similar to the results from our LNCaP datasets.</p><p>Of the four miRNAs chosen for validation by SL-RT TaqMan PCR, one (novel 4) was predicted solely by miRDeep*. Thus, miRDeep* is both more precise at predicting miRNA from small RNAseq reads and having greater capacity to detect novel miRNA compared with miRDeep and miRDeep2. Moreover, miRDeep* is able to predict miRNA that are formed from the classical pri- and pre-miRNA biogenesis pathways as shown by the detection of pre-miRNA in our validation experiments.</p><p>In conclusion, we have developed miRDeep* that is a useful tool for predicting novel miRNA from small RNAseq. miRDeep* is the first application for predicting miRNAs without any pre-installed software and has better predictive capabilities compared with miRDeep and miRDeep2. miRDeep* also offers numerous user-friendly and functional advantages, such as full Java coding, which makes it suitable for use with many operating systems, as well as displaying RNAseq reads and the number of reads relative to the predicted pre-miRNA. Importantly, this tool provides the target prediction for both known and novel miRNAs, unlike most tools, which do not provide target prediction for novel miRNAs. Given the role of miRNA in many biological contexts, including prostate cancer, we propose that miRDeep* will be an extremely useful tool for researchers.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks1187/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online: Supplementary Tables 1&#x02013;7.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><funding-source>Queensland Smart Futures Premier&#x02019;s Fellowship</funding-source> (to C.C.N.); Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia (<award-id>PCFA PG25</award-id>), <funding-source>Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing</funding-source>.
