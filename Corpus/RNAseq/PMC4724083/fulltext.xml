An increasingly accepted measure of feed efficiency is residual feed intake (RFI). Currently, the molecular mechanisms underlying RFI are largely unknown. Additionally, to incorporate RFI into animal breeding programs, feed intake must be recorded on individual pigs, which is costly and time-consuming. Thus, convenient and predictive biomarkers for RFI that can be measured at an early age are greatly desired. In this study, we aimed to explore whether differences exist in the global gene expression profiles of peripheral blood of 35 to 42&#x000a0;day-old pigs with extremely low (more efficient) and high RFI (less efficient) values from two lines that were divergently selected for RFI during the grow-finish phase, to use such information to explore the potential molecular basis of RFI differences, and to initiate development of predictive biomarkers for RFI.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We identified 1972 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (<italic>q</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.15) between the low (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15) and high (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;16) RFI groups of animals by using RNA sequencing technology. We validated 24 of 37 selected DEGs by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) in a joint analysis of 24 (12 per line) of the 31 samples already used for RNA-seq plus 24 (12 per line) novel samples from the same contemporary group of pigs. Using an analysis of the 24 novel samples alone, only nine of the 37 selected DEGs were validated. Genes involved in small molecule biosynthetic process, antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, and steroid biosynthetic process were overrepresented among DEGs that had higher expression in the low versus high RFI animals. Genes known to function in the proteasome complex or mitochondrion were also significantly enriched among genes with higher expression in the low versus high RFI animals. Alternatively, genes involved in signal transduction, bone mineralization and regulation of phosphorylation were overrepresented among DEGs with lower expression in the low versus high RFI animals. The DEGs significantly overlapped with genes associated with disease, including hyperphagia, eating disorders and mitochondrial diseases (<italic>q</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1E-05). A weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified four co-expression modules that were differentially expressed between the low and high RFI groups. Genes involved in lipid metabolism, regulation of bone mineralization, cellular immunity and response to stimulus were overrepresented within the two modules that were most significantly differentially expressed between the low and high RFI groups. We also found five of the DEGs and one of the co-expression modules were significantly associated with the RFI phenotype of individual animals (<italic>q</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The post-weaning blood transcriptome was clearly different between the low and high RFI groups. The identified DEGs suggested potential differences in mitochondrial and proteasomal activities, small molecule biosynthetic process, and signal transduction between the two RFI groups and provided potential new insights into the molecular basis of RFI in pigs, although the observed relationship between the post-weaning blood gene expression and RFI phenotype measured during the grow-finish phase was not strong. DEGs and representative genes in co-expression modules that were associated with RFI phenotype provide a preliminary list for developing predictive biomarkers for RFI in pigs.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12864-016-2395-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Sus scrofa</italic></kwd><kwd>Feed efficiency</kwd><kwd>Residual feed intake</kwd><kwd>Blood transcriptome</kwd><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Agriculture and Food Research Initiative</institution></funding-source><award-id>NIFA-AFRI-2011-68004-30336</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dekkers</surname><given-names>Jack C.

While many non-genetic strategies have been developed to improve feed efficiency of pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], improving feed efficiency by genetic selection can be a sustainable alternative. An increasingly popular measure of FE is residual feed intake (RFI), which is the difference between the actual and expected feed intake of an animal for production and maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Importantly, RFI is moderately heritable and responds well to genetic selection in pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Over the last decade, significant efforts have been made to understand the molecular, genetic and physiological basis of RFI in pigs. Researchers have found many interesting differences across multiple tissues between pigs with divergent RFI phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For example, as compared to high RFI pigs (less efficient), low RFI pigs (more efficient) have altered feeding behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], slightly lower growth rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], less back fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], lower protein turnover rate in the muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], altered mitochondrial protein profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], less mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and lower levels of leptin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and juvenile IGF-1 in circulating blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. To explore the genetic basis of RFI in pigs, several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Some chromosomal regions tagged by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been found to be associated with RFI, but these associations were not consistent across studies and explained only small portions of the genetic variance for RFI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The wide range of differences across multiple tissues between lines of pigs with divergent RFI and the lack of SNPs with major effects on RFI suggest that RFI is a highly polygenic, quantitative trait with multiple tissues contributing to its variation.</p><p>Global gene expression profiling technologies have also been used to explore the molecular basis of RFI in pigs. By profiling the transcriptomes of the adipose tissue of two lines of pigs divergently selected for RFI with gene expression microarrays, Lkhagvadorj <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] found that genes involved in the lipid metabolic pathway were overrepresented among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that had lower expression in low versus high RFI pigs, and genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and response to stress were overrepresented among the DEGs that had higher expression in low versus high RFI pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. They also found the leptin-related gene network to be different between the two lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Recently, Vincent <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and Jing <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] profiled the transcriptome of the <italic>longissimus dorsi</italic> (LD) muscle from pigs with divergent RFI by gene expression microarray and RNA-seq, respectively. Using pigs from lines divergently selected for RFI, Vincent <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] found genes involved in protein synthesis and glycolysis, and genes associated with mitochondrial energy/oxidative metabolism had higher and lower expression, respectively, in the low versus high RFI line. Using Yorkshire barrows with extreme phenotypes for RFI, Jing <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] found that genes involved in glycolysis had lower expression in the low versus high RFI group, while genes involved in muscle proliferation and differentiation had higher expression in the low versus high RFI group. Surprisingly, these two studies shared no DEGs and proposed opposite differences in glycolytic activities in the low versus high RFI pigs. Therefore, in consideration of the complexity of RFI and the inconsistency from study to study, the molecular mechanisms underlying RFI in pigs are still largely unclear.</p><p>To incorporate RFI into animal breeding programs for improving feed efficiency, feed intake, body weight gain and back fat depth must be recorded on individual pigs. As it is very expensive and time-consuming to record feed intake on individual animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], convenient and predictive biomarkers for RFI that can be measured at an early age are in demand. In cattle, Chen <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] successfully used 14 DEGs identified in the liver of Angus bulls that were divergently selected for RFI to classify Angus steers from the same divergent RFI lines, and Al-Husseini <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] developed a RFI predictor using 8 of these 14 DEGs and validated it in an independent Angus population. These biomarkers are, however, not very practical because invasive liver biopsies are needed.</p><p>The peripheral blood is an informative tissue not only because it carries a variety of cells directly involved in immunity and inflammation, but also because it interacts with every organ and tissue in the body via bioactive circulating factors, such as nutrients, metabolites, cytokines, hormones and exosomal cargoes, which are released from the same or different organs or tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. These bioactive factors interact with blood cells and thus might modify the gene expression profiles of the blood cells dynamically. Molecular signatures in circulating blood, including gene expression profiles, have been shown to reflect the physiopathological status, growth stage and lifestyle of subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Due to its easy accessibility and informativeness, blood has become a popular sample (direct or as a surrogate) for disease diagnosis, prediction, prognosis, and biomarker discovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Interestingly, the concentration of IGF-1 in serum at a young age has been shown to be different between animals with divergent RFI in poultry and livestock, including pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Blood cell profiles at early growth stages have also been found to be different between livestock with divergent RFI phenotypes, including pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. These results suggest that animals with divergent RFI phenotypes, measured later in life, have early physiological differences in circulating blood that may be reflected in blood gene expression profiles at these early stages.</p><p>In this study, our objective was to determine the blood transcriptomic differences between post-weaning pigs from two lines divergently selected for RFI, to explore potential molecular mechanisms underlying RFI in peripheral blood and to develop a list of candidate biomarkers for RFI prediction. We hypothesized that post-weaning expression levels of some genes in whole blood were correlated with RFI phenotype measured during the grow-finish phase. We identified 1972 DEGs with <italic>q</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.15 and four co-expression modules that were differentially expressed between the low and high RFI groups. A set of selected DEGs were validated by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Several interesting biological processes underlying DEGs and differential co-expression modules were suggested. We also identified several candidate biomarkers for RFI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals, blood sample collection and complete blood count (CBC) test</title><p>The experimental protocols for this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Iowa State University under permit number 11-1-4996-S. All pigs were from parity 2 of generation nine of the two lines divergently selected for residual feed intake: the low and high RFI lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Bunter <italic>et al</italic>. found that the IGF-1 concentration in blood measured between 35 to 42&#x000a0;days of age differed between the two lines and were genetically correlated with RFI measured later during the grow-finish phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. So blood samples were collected from the jugular vein into Tempus&#x02122; Blood RNA tubes (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) for long-term storage at &#x02212;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C from 233 post-weaning piglets of the two lines in this age range. Meanwhile, blood from those animals was also collected into EDTA tubes (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and kept at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C before CBC tests, which were performed on the bleeding day, if possible, or the next morning as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Differences in CBC profiles between the two lines have been published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. At 107.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8.3 (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard deviation) days of age and 42.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.2&#x000a0;kg of body weight (BW), 88 gilts and 78 barrows were randomly assigned to 12 mixed-line, mixed-sex finishing pens with electronic single-space feeders (FIRE, Osborne Industries Inc., Osborne, KS) for feed efficiency test, with 6 pens being randomly assigned to either of two diets: a high-fiber, low-energy diet (HFD) and a low-fiber, high-energy diet (LFD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The animals on feed efficiency test consisted of 21 barrows and 22 gilts from the low RFI line plus 14 barrows and 23 gilts from the high RFI line fed the HFD, and 23 barrows and 23 gilts from the low RFI line plus 20 barrows and 20 gilts from the high RFI line fed the LFD. All pigs had <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to feed and water. Individual feed intake was real-time recorded, body weight was recorded biweekly, and backfat (BF) depth above the 10th rib and loin muscle area were recorded at the end of the test, when the pigs were 227.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.4&#x000a0;days of age and 127.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8.8&#x000a0;kg of body weight. RFI of individual pigs were calculated as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] with modifications and shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Briefly, average daily feed intake (ADFI) was estimated by fitting a quadratic polynomial regression model of the daily feed intake from the on-test day to the off-test day on the number of days on test for each pig; and individual average daily gain (ADG) was estimated as the slope from simple linear regression of bi-weekly BW on the number of days on test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A single trait animal model was used to analyze ADFI with adjustments for fixed covariates of metabolic mid-body weight (average body weight during the test period raised to the power of 0.75, MBW), ADG, BF, deviation of the on-test weight from 50&#x000a0;kg, deviation of the off-test weight from 118&#x000a0;kg, and deviation of the on-test age from 90&#x000a0;days, and the random effect of pen. The RFI value for each pig was estimated as the residual of the fitted model (Young J and Dekkers JCM, unpublished). The growth performance and feed intake data of these animals have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Distribution of RFI values and sample selection for RNA-seq and RT-qPCR assays.

In detail, for the low RFI line, we selected eight samples from animals with extremely low RFI values on the LFD and eight samples from animals with extremely low RFI values on the HFD (designated as low RFI group); while for the high RFI line, we selected eight samples from animals with extremely high RFI values on the LFD and eight samples from animals with extremely high RFI values on the HFD (designated as high RFI group) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Total RNA extraction of the 32 samples was processed in four batches such that for each batch, two samples were randomly selected from each line by diet combination. Within each batch, the processing order of samples was randomized beforehand and followed in all subsequent procedures where blocking was necessary. The total RNA was extracted from blood samples using preserved blood RNA purification kit I (Norgen Biotek Corp, Thorold, Ontario) by following the kit&#x02019;s manual. On-column DNA digestion was performed as described using DNase I (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Globin transcripts (HBB [ENSSSCG00000007978] and HBA [ENSSSCG00000014725]) were depleted by following an RNase H-mediated method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The quantity and integrity of the RNA were determined by using Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) before and after globin depletion. The efficiency of globin depletion of each sample was checked by conventional RT-qPCR with &#x003b2;-actin (ACTB) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as the internal reference genes. The total RNA of one selected blood sample from the low RFI line on the LFD was dropped from this study due to its low RNA quality (original RNA integrity number (RIN) was 7.5, lower than our criterion of RIN&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;8.0 before globin depletion). The average RIN for the 31 remaining samples before and after globin depletion were 9.05&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.31 and 8.26&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.30, respectively.

Briefly, the RNA-seq libraries were constructed using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. For each sample, poly (A)-containing transcripts was enriched with oligo-dT-coated magnetic beads from 0.7 to 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of total RNA with globin transcript depleted. The enriched RNA was fragmented by heat and reverse transcribed with hexamer random primers. For each sample, adapters with unique barcodes were ligated to the end-polished cDNA fragments. The libraries were linearly amplified by PCR, size selected and quantitated. The individual libraries were diluted to 2 nM and pooled in approximately equimolar amounts according to the processing batches mentioned above with eight libraries per pool, except for one pool of seven libraries.

Adapters and low quality bases were trimmed by running Trimmomatic (version 0.32) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] in the paired-end mode with the following options, ILLUMINACLIP:adapters.fa:2:30:10:1:true LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 MINLEN:36, such that the average base quality was not lower than 15 for every sliding window of 4 bases and the minimum length of kept reads was 36 bases. For each set of raw paired-end reads, Trimmomatic outputted a pair of files for the kept paired-end reads, a file for unpaired forward reads (R1), and a file for unpaired backward reads (R2). Trimmed paired-end and unpaired reads were separately aligned to the pig reference genome Sscrofa 10.2 (version 77, Ensembl) using 2-pass rna-STAR (version 2.3.0), using the default settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Read counts per gene per library were summarized by using featureCounts (version 1.4.4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], with the resulting SAM files for uniquely mapped, paired-end and unpaired reads as inputs, separately, and using the pig genome GTF file (version 77, Ensembl) as the genomic annotation reference file. The default settings for other featureCounts options were used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. A final table of read counts per gene of the 31 samples (designated as the count table) was generated by summing up the individual count tables for paired-end and unpaired reads. Prior to differential expression analysis, hemoglobin genes (HBA and HBB) and genes with few reads (average read count no larger than eight, or 28 or more zero read counts across the 31 samples) were removed from the count table to obtain a final count table with 12280 genes. This count table was used for the subsequent differential expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) after further transformation and adjustment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Differential expression analysis</title><p>The statistical programming language R (version 3.1.0) was used for all statistical analyses, unless indicated otherwise. Differential expression analysis was carried out by using the R package &#x0201c;QuasiSeq&#x0201d; (version 1.0-4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. For each of the 12280 genes in the final count table, we used QuasiSeq to fit a full generalized linear model with a negative binomial response and a log link that included an upper-quartile normalization offset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and the fixed effects of RFI group (low and high RFI groups), diet (low and high fiber diets), batch (sample processing batches 1 to 4), and the linear covariates of RFI phenotype (estimated RFI value),pre_conc (RNA concentration before globin depletion), pre_RIN (RIN before globin depletion), post_conc (RNA concentration after globin depletion), post_RIN (RIN before globin depletion), and concentrations of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils. Note that, although blood was collected before pigs were fed the different diets, a diet effect was included in our initial full model because diet affected the component traits that were used to estimate RFI and thus the estimation of RFI. Because not all the variables included in the initial full model may be associated with transcript levels, we used a backward variable selection algorithm to identify the most relevant variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The final model included RFI group, batch, pre_conc, post_RIN, and the concentrations of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes and basophils as independent variables.

Briefly, <italic>log</italic>-counts per million (designated as <italic>log-cpm</italic>) were calculated using the <italic>voom</italic> function of the Bioconductor package &#x0201c;limma&#x0201d; (version 3.20.9) with the upper-quartile normalized counts as input [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The <italic>lmFit</italic> function was used to fit a linear model with <italic>log-cpm</italic> per gene feature as the responsible variable, and RFI group, batch, and the linear covariates of pre_conc, post_RIN, and concentrations of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes and basophils as independent variables. Effects associated with relevant variables (batch, pre_conc, post_RIN, and the concentration of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes and basophils) were subtracted from the original <italic>log-cpm</italic>, to create adjusted transformed gene expression values. The data matrix consisting of adjusted <italic>log-cpm</italic> per gene for the 31 samples (hereafter called the adjusted transformed gene expression matrix) was used as the input for WGCNA. WGCNA was performed by following tutorial I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], with slight modifications as needed. In WGCNA, all correlation coefficients between gene pairs were calculated by using Pearson&#x02019;s method. A soft-thresholding power of seven was used by assuming the topology of the unsigned weighted gene co-expression network was scale-free. The average linkage method was used for all clustering procedures. The function <italic>cutTreeDynamic</italic> was used for identification of modules. Only modules with a minimum of 30 genes were considered. Modules with eigengene correlations no less than 0.75 were merged using the <italic>mergeCloseModules</italic> function with cutHeight&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.25. The eigengene of a module is the first principal component of the gene expression values of that module and can be considered as a representation of the expression profiles of genes in the module [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. We then fitted linear regression models with expression levels of the module eigengenes as the response variable and RFI group as the independent variable. The estimated effect of RFI group and the associated <italic>p</italic>-value for the null hypothesis that the RFI group term was not useful in explaining expression of the eigengene of the module were used to quantify the strength and significance of the association between the eigengene of a module and RFI group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Hierarchical clustering, generation of heat map, and multi-dimension scaling analysis</title><p>The adjusted gene expression matrix was used for hierarchical clustering, heatmap generation, and multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) analyses.

The &#x0201c;classical&#x0201d; algorithm, which treats all GO terms to be independent of each other, and Fisher&#x02019;s exact test were used to estimate significance of such enrichment using the function <italic>runTest</italic>. For GO term enrichment analysis of DEGs (<italic>q</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.15), we analyzed DEGs with higher and lower expression in the low versus high RFI group separately, while for GO term enrichment analysis of WGCNA modules, genes in a whole module were analyzed together. The maximum subset of the 12280 genes that was associated with at least one GO-BP, GO-MF or GO-CC term, respectively, was used as the reference set (also known as background) in the corresponding GO term enrichment analyses.

For IPA-based analysis, 8965 of the 12280 genes could be mapped to IPA identifiers via the gene symbols of pig genes and these genes were used as the reference set.

The cutoff for the log<sub>2</sub> (fold change) was set to 0 and the <italic>q</italic>-value cutoff was set to 0.15. All DEGs were analyzed together, with 1488 of 1972 DEGs mapped to IPA identifiers. For IPAD-based analysis of DEGs, the IPAD web server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] was used. Of the 1972 DEGs (<italic>q</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.15), 1536 genes with human gene symbols were analyzed together.

All pairs of primers corresponding to the 46 DEGs and six internal reference genes were designed and synthesized by the Fluidigm Corporation (Fluidigm, San Francisco, CA), such that the two primers of each pair were separated by exon-exon boundaries and could amplify all isoforms of the target gene if possible (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). The efficiency of each primer pair was tested by conventional RT-qPCR on the DNA Engine Opticon 2 system (BioRad, Hercules, California) by using the standard curve method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] and only primer pairs with amplification efficiency no less than 0.95 were further considered. As for specificity, only primer pairs that gave products with single peaks in melting curve analyses were used for the downstream RT-qPCR assays. This resulted in 37 pairs of primers for DEGs and two for internal reference genes (YWHAZ and RPL32) passing the test (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). The samples we used for RT-qPCR validation of the DEGs included 24 of the 31 RNA samples that we had sequenced by RNA-seq, and another 24 novel samples from gilts from the same contemporary group of pigs, with 6 samples from each line by diet combination. The 24 novel blood samples were selected such that the RFI phenotypes of the corresponding animals were evenly distributed across the distribution of RFI phenotypes that was not covered by the RFI phenotypes of the 24 animals originally selected for RNA-seq (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Detailed information about the 48 samples used for validation of DEGs is in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1. RNA was extracted from the novel samples as above in three batches, with two samples from each line by diet combination per batch. The concentration and quality of 24 novel RNA samples were determined as above. Total RNA without undergoing globin depletion was used for cDNA synthesis. By following the Fluidigm User Guide for Real-Time PCR Analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], Real Time-qPCR was done on a 48.48 dynamic array chip (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) using the Biomarker HD system (Fluidigm, San Francisco, CA).

Thus, to maximize the contrast, we selected blood samples for RNA-seq from gilts of the low RFI line with extremely low RFI values when fed the LFD or the HFD (designated as low RFI group), and from gilts of the high RFI line with extremely high RFI values when fed the LFD or the HFD (designated as low RFI group) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Alignment of RNA-seq reads to the reference genome showed that globin transcripts had been effectively reduced (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3).

Therefore, we decided to account for the concentration of different blood cell types in our analyses so that we could adjust gene expression for these concentration differences. Although the animals were randomly assigned to one of the two diets after the blood samples were collected, we started with a full model that included diet and RFI phenotype (estimated RFI value) and performed backward selection to establish a final model for the following reasons: 1) the samples for RNA-seq were selected based on the RFI phenotype of the animals; 2) the RFI phenotype depended on both line and diet effects; 3) we were interested in identifying genes that might be associated with RFI phenotype. However, after accounting for RFI group (i.e. the low RFI and high RFI groups) and other variables identified via backward selection (batch, pre_conc, post_RIN, and the concentrations of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes and basophils), we found the RFI phenotype, diet, pre_RIN, post_conc and the concentration of eosinophils were not significantly associated with the expression levels of most genes (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05).

To test whether the expression differences we detected were due to differences between the lines, rather than due to the comparison of pigs of the low RFI group to pigs of the high RFI group, we selected another 24 samples from the same parity of the 9th generation of the two RFI lines.

We identified four modules, designated as C1-lightcyan, C2-darkturqoise, C3-skyblue3, and C4-black, whose eigengene expression levels were significantly differentially expressed between the low and high RFI groups (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>: Table S9). The eigengene of a module is a weighted average of the expression profiles of genes in the module, calculated as the first principal component score. The expression levels of the eigengenes for the 31 samples are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>. Among the genes in module C1-lightcyan, those involved in lipid metabolism-related biological processes, such as lipid metabolic process, lipid biosynthesis and steroid biosynthesis were overrepresented (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.006).

We validated 24 of the 37 selected DEGs by RT-qPCR in a joint analysis of 48 samples: 24 of the 31 samples used for RNA-seq plus 24 novel samples from the same population (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Table S7). We validated 22 of the 37 selected DEGs by RT-qPCR when using 24 of the 31 samples that were used for RNA-seq, but only 9 of the 37 selected DEGs were validated when using only the 24 novel samples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Table S7). Our validation rate by RT-qPCR of DEGs detected by RNA-seq was low compared to the high validation rate reported by Wang <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], especially when based on the 24 novel samples. There are several possible reasons for failure to validate some of the 37 DEGs that were detected by RNA-seq by RT-qPCR in this study. First, some of the selected DEGs could be false positives, especially as we selected DEGs with <italic>q</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.15 for validation, although we did not detect an obvious association between the validation rate and the <italic>q</italic> values for the DEGs. Second, the primers used for RT-qPCR maybe did not quantify all isoforms that were measured by RNA-seq. Although the primers were designed to amplify all isoforms, these designs were based on poorly annotated gene models: most of the 37 genes only have one isoform in the Ensembl pig genome annotation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). Third, the 24 novel samples used for RT-qPCR were not the exact biological replicates of the 24 samples used for RNA-seq given their different RFI phenotype. In addition, as observed in other differential expression analyses between low and high RFI groups conducted in poultry, pigs and cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], the magnitude of the differential expression in terms of fold change was generally small for most genes. This could be because the experimental units for the low and high RFI groups were genetically heterogeneous within each group, which cancelled out some differences between extreme individuals of the two groups. In addition, the experiments were conducted without strong external stimuli, thus the expression levels of genes were in their normal physiological range. It was also possible that the differences in gene expression in blood at the post-weaning stage were not as dramatic as during the grow-finish phase when feed efficiency was tested. However, it is possible that small changes in the transcript abundance of some genes involved in metabolism, transcription regulation, and signal transduction, could have significant effects on RFI phenotype. As our differential analysis indicated, a significant portion of genes involved in several biosynthetic processes, signal transduction, and regulation of phosphorylation were differentially expressed between the low and high RFI groups. Lastly, we cannot exclude the possibility that there is a weak or indirect relationship between early blood gene expression and later RFI phenotype. Nevertheless, based on the adjusted global gene expression profiles of all samples, hierarchical clustering and MDS analyses revealed that the post-weaning blood transcriptome was different between the two RFI groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Potential relationship of the DEGs and differentially co-expressed gene modules in blood with RFI</title><p>Although we did not attempt to validate most of the DEGs or the differentially co-expressed gene modules between the two RFI groups due to the generally small fold changes, we found some interesting biological processes and cellular components underlying them, which suggested their potential relationships with RFI phenotype. GO term enrichment analysis of DEGs suggested that genes involved in small molecule (including organic acid, carboxylic acid, and alcohol) biosynthesis, antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen via MHC class I, and steroid biosynthesis were enriched among DEGs with higher expression in the low versus high RFI group. DEGs involved in small molecular biosynthesis included FADS1, FADS2, and ELOVL3. FADS1 and FADS2 are important genes in regulating the synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which have pleiotropic influences on health and diseases by functioning in several pathways, including metabolism and immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Of note, FADS2 also had a higher expression level in the liver in the low RFI versus high RFI group of Nelore steers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. ELOVL3 encodes one of the rate-limiting enzymes in elongation of very long chain fatty acids (with more than 17 carbon atoms). In mice, a proposed physiological function of ELOVL3 is to maintain lipid homeostasis by replenishing the intracellular pool of triacylglycerol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. MAT2B, is one of the genes associated with steroid biosynthesis but had lower expression in the low versus high RFI group. It encodes a regulatory subunit of methionine adenosyltransferase, MAT II, which catalyzes the synthesis of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). SAM is a key methyl donor in transmethylation reaction and polyamine biosynthesis and also functions as a cofactor in key metabolic pathways. Down-regulation of MATIIB expression causes a 6 to10-fold increase in intracellular SAM levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Taken together, the expression difference of genes involved in small molecule biosynthesis and steroid biosynthesis might have significant effects on overall metabolism, immunity and beyond.</p><p>Seven of the 20 genes associated with GO term GO:0002474 (antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen via MHC class I) had higher expression in the low RFI group. These included SLA-3 and TAP1. It has been shown that in post-weaning pigs resistant to <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> F18, SLA-3 has higher expression level than in susceptible pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. TAP1 transports antigens from the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum for loading antigen peptide onto MHC class I molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. In addition, we found 14 of the 15 DEGs associated with GO term GO:0000502 (proteasome complex) to have higher expression in the low versus high RFI group. The only exception was PSMD5, which had lower expression in the low versus high RFI group. It has been shown that overexpression of PSMD5 inhibits assembly and activity of 26S proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], which is an important component in processing and presenting intracellular peptide antigen via MHC class I to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Antigen presenting cells (APC) have both constitutive proteasomes and immunoproteasomes, both of which are important for antigen peptide processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Notably, an immunoproteasome subunit PSMB8 (also known as &#x003b2;<sub>5i</sub>) had the largest difference in expression level among the 15 DEGs that function in the proteasome complex. Given the increased expression levels of non-inhibitory proteasomal components in blood of the low RFI group, it is likely that proteasomal activity is higher in blood from the low versus high RFI group. Taken together, the expression differences of genes involved in antigen processing and peptide antigen presentation suggest that low RFI animals might have a more active system of antigen peptide processing and presentation, which might improve the robustness of their immune system of the low RFI animals. Consistent with this speculation, Dunkelberger <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] recently showed that the low RFI line was less affected by experimental infection with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSv), which mainly infects mature macrophages, derivatives of monocytes. In view of the lower concentration of monocytes in the low RFI line, the putative higher activity of antigen processing and peptide antigen presentation might lead to an increased efficiency of innate immunity in the low RFI pigs. It would be interesting to test the activity of the blood proteasome in more detail in these lines for a role in feed efficiency.</p><p>Another interesting finding was that genes functioning in the mitochondrion were significantly overrepresented among DEGs with higher expression in the low versus high RFI group. Of the 955 blood genes associated with GO-CC term mitochondrion (GO:0005739), 116 were DEGs with higher expression in the low versus high RFI group. Mitochondria play important roles in many biological processes, including fatty acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and steroidogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Importantly, mitochondrial function has been associated with feed efficiency in poultry, cattle and lambs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. As well, it has been shown that the mitochondrial proteome profiles are different between these low and high RFI lines of pigs and the mitochondria from the liver and LD muscle of the low RFI pigs produced less ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Interestingly, we found that four genes involved in detoxification of ROS, GPX3, SOD1 and CAT, had higher expression in the low versus high RFI group. Another interesting gene that functions in mitochondria is G0S2, which is a noncompetitive inhibitor of adipose lipase, a rate-limiting lipase of triglyceride hydrolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. G0S2 had higher expression in the low versus high RFI group. It has been shown that G0S2 can inhibit ROS production in endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. In addition, we found higher expression in blood from the low RFI group for genes that encode 14 mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPL3, 9, 10, 11, 18, 20, 24, 38, 40, 46; MRPS10, 11,15, 27), nine components of mitochondrial complex I (NDUFA4, 8; NDUFB3, 7, 9; NDUFS2, 7; NDUFAB1, NDUFAF3), one component of complex II (SDHA), cytochrome c (CYCS) and four components of complex IV (COA3, COA6, COX5B, COX7C), two components of the complex V (ATP5D, ATP5G3), four key enzymes of the TCA cycle (ACO1, IDH2, IDH3A, SDHA, SUCLG1), four enzymes involved in mitochondrial DNA repair (APEX2, FEN1, OGG1, UNG), and two enzymes involved in nucleotide metabolism (DUT, MTHFD1), and three translocases of the inner/outer membranes (TIMM50, TOMM7, TOMM40). Taken together, it is reasonable to speculate that the low RFI group has more efficient mitochondria and can more efficiently handle oxidative stress.</p><p>Among the 1972 DEGs (<italic>q</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.15), 288 genes were associated with GO:0007165 (signal transduction), and genes involved in signal transduction were significantly enriched among DEGs with lower expression in the low versus high RFI group. DEGs associated with signal transduction were mainly cytokines, receptors and kinases. Signal transduction-related genes with much lower expression in the low versus high RFI group included LRP6, WNT10B, and FZD6. LRP6 belongs to the low-density lipoprotein receptor family and plays a key role in lipoprotein endocytosis and as a co-receptor in Wnt/&#x003b2;&#x02013;catenin signaling. LRP6 is also involved in regulating lipid homeostasis and body fat mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>], while LRP6, WNT10B and FZD6 can function together in the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway. Besides playing important roles in bone metabolism, the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway also takes part in glycolysis and regulates mitochondrial physiology and insulin sensitivity and is thus linked to metabolic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. On the other hand, we found a few genes involved in signal transduction but with much higher expression in the low versus high RFI group, such as IL15 and IRS1. IL15 plays important roles as a pleiotropic cytokine in innate and adaptive immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. IRS1 is an important player in both the insulin signaling and the IGF-1 signaling pathways and IGF-1 is an important anabolic hormone, playing a key role in growth. Note that juveniles from the low RFI line have been shown to have lower serum concentration of IGF-1 and the low RFI line grows only slightly slower than the high RFI line. The higher expression of IRS1 might partially compensate for the lower level of IGF-1 in the low RFI line. It is interesting to investigate the expression and activity of IRS1 in other tissues of the two lines, such as the muscle. The differential expression of many genes associated with signal transduction might be related to differences in metabolism and immune response between the RFI lines. Lastly, we found four co-expression modules to be differentially expressed between the RFI groups, and these modules shared a significant portion of their genes with the list of DEGs. The eigengene expression of module C1-lightcyan was lower in the low RFI group than in the high RFI group. The top highly connected genes in this module were MAT2B, CPT1A, and LRP6. These genes were also differentially expressed between the low and high RFI groups. Since we have already discussed MAT2B and LRP6, we focus on CPT1A herein. CPT1A had lower expression in the low versus high RFI group and plays an important role in importing long chain fatty acids into mitochondria, by catalyzing the primary step of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Inhibition of hypothalamic CPT1A has been shown to decrease feed intake and glucose production in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Thus it will be interesting to investigate its expression in other tissues including the hypothalamus. In addition, GO-BP term analysis showed that genes involved in lipid metabolism-related processes were enriched in module C1-lightcyan. Because low RFI pigs have less body fat and are leaner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and that deposition of energy as fat costs more energy than as protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>], genes in this module might be relevant to differences in RFI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Potential predictive biomarkers for RFI</title><p>DEGs whose expression levels are associated with the phenotype of interest, as well as genes whose expression profiles are similar to the eigengenes of co-expression modules associated with the phenotype are often considered as good candidate biomarkers for the phenotype. Based on our association tests, the best candidate biomarkers included LRP6, ENSSSCG00000024900, ENSSSCG00000008771, PDL1 and ENSSSCG00000024905. LRP6 and ENSSSCG00000024900 were ones of the DEGs between the two RFI groups and ones of the highly connected, eigengene-like genes in modules C1-lightcyan and C2-darkturqoise, respectively (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>: Table S9). Notably, we only found a very few genes whose expression levels were significantly associated with RFI phenotype, which might be because the estimated RFI values were residuals which represented both random errors and true feed efficiency and thus were not accurate, or because there were not many genes whose post-weaning expression levels in blood were well associated with the RFI values measured during the grow-finish phase in blood, or because there may be little or no relationship of blood gene expression in blood and RFI phenotype regardless of age.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusions</title><p>As far as we know, this is the first study to explore transcriptomic differences in blood between pig lines with divergent RFI by RNA-seq. We found that the blood transcriptome was clearly different between the low and high RFI groups, although only a small number of genes showed large fold changes of expression between the two groups. The two RFI groups may be different in mitochondrial and proteasomal activities, small molecule biosynthetic process, and signal transduction. These blood transcriptomic differences may be related to the difference in feed efficiency between these two groups, although the observed relationships of post-weaning blood gene expression with RFI phenotype measured during the grow-finish phase were not strong. The top candidate biomarkers for predicting RFI included LRP6, ENSSSCG00000024900, ENSSSCG00000008771, PDL1 and ENSSSCG00000024905.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Availability of supporting data</title><p>The RNA-seq data sets supporting the results of this article is available in ArrayExpress under accession number: [ E-MTAB-4179; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/</ext-link>].</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec24"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12864_2016_2395_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>Meta data for RNA-seq and RT-qPCR assays.
