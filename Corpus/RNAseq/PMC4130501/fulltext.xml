They are specifically associated with endoparasitic wasps of the family Ichneumonidae and essential for host parasitization by these wasps. We sequenced the <italic>Hyposoter didymator</italic> Ichnovirus (HdIV) encapsidated genome for further analysis of the transcription pattern of the entire set of HdIV genes following the parasitization of four different lepidopteran host species. The HdIV genome was found to consist of at least 50 circular dsDNA molecules, carrying 135 genes, 98 of which formed 18 gene families. The HdIV genome had general features typical of Ichnovirus (IV) genomes and closely resembled that of the IV carried by <italic>Hyposoter fugitivus</italic>. Subsequent transcriptomic analysis with Illumina technology during the course of <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> parasitization led to the identification of a small subset of less than 30 genes with high RPKM values in permissive hosts, consisting with these genes encoding crucial virulence proteins. Comparisons of HdIV expression profiles between host species revealed differences in transcript levels for given HdIV genes between two permissive hosts, <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> and <italic>Pseudoplusia includens</italic>. However, we found no evident intrafamily gene-specific transcription pattern consistent with the presence of multigenic families within IV genomes reflecting an ability of the wasps concerned to exploit different host species. Interestingly, in two non-permissive hosts, <italic>Mamestra brassiccae</italic> and <italic>Anticarsia gemmatalis</italic> (most of the parasitoid eggs were eliminated by the host cellular immune response), HdIV genes were generally less strongly transcribed than in permissive hosts. This suggests that successful parasitism is dependent on the expression of given HdIV genes exceeding a particular threshold value. These results raise questions about the mecanisms involved in regulating IV gene expression according to the nature of the lepidopteran host species encountered.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Grant from French National Research Agency (Paratoxose project, #ANR-09-BLAN-0243-01) URL <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/">www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/</ext-link> and HdIV genome sequencing provided by France Genomique URL <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.france-genomique.org/">https://www.france-genomique.org/</ext-link>.

Their genome is segmented into tens of molecules of various sizes. They are required for the successful development of the endoparasitic wasp and are thus commonly referred to as &#x0201c;viral symbionts&#x0201d;. The PDV genome is transmitted vertically, via a proviral form that persists in all wasp cells. PDV particles are produced from the proviral template exclusively in a specific tissue of the ovaries in the female, the calyx. They are stored within the lumen of the oviducts and are then injected into the insect host during oviposition <xref rid="pone.0104072-Yonggyun1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104072-Volkoff1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Following parasitization, PDV particles rapidly infect most of the host cells, in which the genes encoded by the encapsidated viral genome are expressed. The expression of PDV genes modifies the host immune response and host development, favoring the successful development of the parasitoid within its host <xref rid="pone.0104072-Schafellner1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104072-Vinson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. PDVs do not replicate in the parasitized insect, as the genes required for replication are present in the wasp genome and are not packaged into the virus particles <xref rid="pone.0104072-Lapointe1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0104072-Espagne1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>PDVs are classically separated into Bracoviruses (BVs), carried by endoparasitoid species from the Braconidae Microgastroid complex, and Ichnoviruses (IVs), carried by two subfamilies of ichneumonid wasps, the Campopleginae and the Banchinae <xref rid="pone.0104072-Lapointe1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. BVs and IVs have different origins, and this has resulted in differences in the morphology of their virions, the nature of the genes encoding the particle proteins and the nature of the genes carried by the encapsidated genome. Only 10 PDV genomes have been entirely sequenced to date from among the PDVs carried by about 40,000 wasp species: five BVs, carried by <italic>Cotesia congregata</italic> (CcBV), <italic>Microplitis demolitor</italic> (MdBV), <italic>Glyptapanteles flavicoxis</italic> (GfBV), <italic>Glyptapanteles indiensis</italic> (GiBV) and <italic>Cotesia vestalis</italic> (CsBV) <xref rid="pone.0104072-Espagne1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104072-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>; three IVs carried by the campoplegines <italic>Campoletis sonorensis</italic> (CsIV), <italic>Hyposoter fugitivus</italic> (HfIV) and <italic>Tranosema rostrale</italic> (TrIV); and two IVs carried by the banchines <italic>Glypta fumiferanae</italic> (GfIV) and <italic>Apophua simplicipes</italic> (AsIV) <xref rid="pone.0104072-Lapointe1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0104072-Webb1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0104072-Tanaka1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0104072-Djoumad1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The sequencing of PDV genomes has revealed a number of general conserved features: all PDVs have large genomes (190 to 610 kb), with a low coding capacity (15&#x02013;35%), more similar to eukaryotic genomes than to classical viral genomes, and a large proportion of the genes are organized into multigene families. Indeed, most of the 61 to 197 genes identified in the various PDV species can be grouped into four to 13 gene families (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0104072-Dupuy1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>). Only a small subset of the genes identified in PDV genomes display similarity to eukaryotic genes of known function, such as the BV protein tyrosine phosphatases (<italic>PTP</italic>), and the IV viral innexin genes, or the viral ankyrin genes found in all PDVs sequenced to date. A large proportion of the other genes identified in PDVs display no similarity to known sequences and their exact function remains unknown. Nevertheless, it is now widely accepted that PDV encapsidated genomes mostly contain genes encoding effectors essential for successful parasitism and probably derived from insect genes (i.e. those of the wasp) (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0104072-Dupuy1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>The issues of the presence of numerous multigene families in PDV genomes and their maintenance during evolution remain largely unexplored. It has often been suggested that the genome organizations of these viruses, which probably result from genome duplication events <xref rid="pone.0104072-Lapointe1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104072-Desjardins1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0104072-Tanaka1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0104072-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0104072-Dupuy1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, allows them to maintain a set of genes encoding proteins with additive or complementary roles in parasitism. As PDVs do not replicate in the cells of the parasitized insect, the presence of multigene families may facilitate an indirect increase in effector protein production, increasing viral efficiency. However, gene duplication may also lead to the paralogs acquiring new functions or mechanisms of gene regulation, due to mutations in their coding or non-coding sequences. PDV gene organization into multigene families may, therefore, also increase viral efficiency by allowing the virus to target different host tissues, physiological functions or signaling pathways. Indeed, it has been shown that members of multigene families may display different patterns of transcription in different host tissues <xref rid="pone.0104072-Bitra1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104072-Provost1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Another little explored hypothesis is that gene duplication and the probable neo-functionalization of PDV genes may favor the adaptation of endoparasitoids to new insect hosts. For instance, the genomes of PDVs associated with parasitoids attacking a small number of host species tend to contain fewer genes than those of PDVs associated with species parasitizing a large number of host species <xref rid="pone.0104072-Tanaka1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>One of the first steps towards determining the role of PDV genome organization in the adaptation of the parasitic wasp to its host species is analysis of the transcription of all the genes encoded by the PDV genome during the parasitization of various insect host species. Only a few such studies have been carried out to date, and all have focused on a single host species. Only one complete transcriptome analysis has been performed to date, for MdBV, which contains a small number of genes that have been analyzed by qPCR <xref rid="pone.0104072-Bitra1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The same technique has also been used to follow the transcription of a subset of genes encoded by TrIV during parasitization <xref rid="pone.0104072-Rasoolizadeh1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Indirect data have also been obtained for the <italic>Diadegma semiclausum</italic> IV (DsIV), in a study involving RNAseq analysis of the parasitized host transcriptome <xref rid="pone.0104072-Etebari1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. All these studies have shown differences in PDV transcript levels between host tissues or between the members of a given multigene family.</p><p>We sequenced the circular dsDNA composing the <italic>Hyposoter didymator</italic> encapsidated Ichnovirus (HdIV) genome and studied its transcription. We found that the genome of HdIV, the fourth genome of an IV carried by a campoplegine wasp to be sequenced, had general features typical of IV genomes, with a high degree of similarity to the genome of HfIV, the IV carried by the related species <italic>Hyposoter fugitivus</italic>. <italic>Hyposoter didymator</italic> can parasitize a number of species from the Noctuidae family. We carried out analyses of the whole HdIV transcriptome with Illumina technology, following of the parasitization of two permissive and two non-permissive lepidopteran host species. Oviposition occurred in all four host species but the parasitoid was eliminated by the host cellular immune response in non-permissive hosts. A comparison of the HdIV transcriptomes between the two permissive hosts revealed that (1) a subset of viral genes consistently generated larger numbers of transcripts than the other genes. This subset included a number of genes now known to be specific to HdIV, suggesting that they may encode proteins essential for successful parasitism, and (2) transcript levels were up- or downregulated, depending on the lepidopteran host, although this concerned only a few HdIV genes. Finally, the transcriptome study showed that most of the HdIV genes produced smaller numbers of transcripts in non-permissive than in permissive hosts, suggesting that there may be a minimum level of HdIV gene expression for successful parasitoid development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Insect origin, rearing and parasitism</title><p>Four lepidopteran species were used in bioassays: <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic>, <italic>Mamestra brassicae</italic>, <italic>Pseudoplusia includens</italic> and <italic>Anticarsia gemmatalis</italic>.

However, our knowledge of the role of the corresponding proteins remains limited, essentially because these proteins display no similarity to any known protein of known function. For those belonging to multigene families conserved in IVs, the related proteins have been studied in other biological models and the available data suggest that many play a role in immunosuppression. For instance, the CsIV viral innexins can form functional GAP junction hemi-channels and thus interfere with cell-cell interactions in the lepidopteran host, particularly during the encapsulation process <xref rid="pone.0104072-Marziano1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.

<xref rid="pone.0104072-Dormus1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Similarly, the Cys1_Hd20a protein may be involved in alterations to cellular immunity. Effectively, two secreted CsIV cysteine-motif proteins, VHv1.1 and VHv1.4, decrease host hemocyte cell adhesion capacity by an unknown mechanism <xref rid="pone.0104072-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. The HdIV transcriptome analysis also showed that four <italic>Vank</italic> genes (<italic>Vank1_Hd24</italic>, <italic>Vank1_Hd43</italic>, <italic>Vank1_Hd28</italic> and <italic>Vank1_Hd12ab</italic>) were highly transcribed during parasitism. The <italic>Vank</italic> family is present in all PDVs (BV and IV), suggesting that the corresponding proteins are essential for parasitism success (reviewed by <xref rid="pone.0104072-Huguet1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>). Experiments <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells have shown that BV vankyrins interact with the insect host transcription factor NF-kB and that, like the IkB protein, they maintain NF-kB in its inactive form <xref rid="pone.0104072-Bitra2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0104072-Thoetkiattikul1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Signaling through NF-kB regulates diverse cellular and physiological processes that could consequently be affected by vankyrins. For instance, two CsIV Vanks expressed in a heterologous <italic>in vivo Drosophila</italic> system have been shown to impair the cellular immune response, humoral inflammation and embryonic development of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, with phenotypes similar to those observed in NF-kB-deficient flies (<italic>Dorsal</italic> and <italic>Dif</italic> (encoding NF-kB factors) silenced (RNAi) or mutant <italic>Drosophila</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0104072-Gueguen1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. These previous investigations in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model (which is not naturally parasitized by PDV-associated wasps) have highlighted the potential function of the Vanks, but these findings require validation in natural lepidopteran models. Some IV Vanks are also known to inhibit lepidopteran cell apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0104072-FathGoodin1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0104072-Kroemer3" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. By preventing apoptosis of the IV infected cell, IV Vanks may ensure the maintenance of the non-replicative IV genome and gene transcription throughout parasitism. Additional <italic>in vivo</italic> investigations of the function of HdIV proteins are required to understand the as yet unknown role of these proteins in parasitism, and our results suggest that proteins encoded by genes abundantly transcribed in the <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> host should be given priority, although other genes are probably also required for successful parasitism.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Assessment of the permissiveness of different lepidopteran host species</title><p>Analysis of the HdIV transcriptome during the parasitization of <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> showed that less than one third of the HdIV genes had high RPKM values.

Nevertheless, significant differences in transcript levels were observed for a number of genes. For instance, <italic>Vank3&#x00026;Vank4_Hd11a</italic>, <italic>Cys1_Hd20b</italic>, <italic>Cys1_Hd13, PRRP3_Hd25</italic>, Rep3_Hd17b, Rep3_Hd17a, Rep3_Hd10, Rep2_Hd4, Rep5_Hd5, K-19_Hd27, F3U2_Hd2ab, F3U4_Hd2ab, F4U1_Hd31, F4U1_Hd34, F5U2_Hd31, U1_Hd41, U1_Hd20ab and U1_Hd16 had significantly higher RPKM values in <italic>P. includens</italic> than in <italic>S. frugiperda</italic>. Conversely, a few HdIV genes, such as <italic>Vinx1_Hd38</italic> and <italic>Ngene1_Hd15</italic> in particular, generated fewer transcripts in <italic>P. includens</italic> than in <italic>S. frugiperda</italic>. Overall, the data obtained suggest that some of the global physiological changes observed in the two permissive hosts may be mediated by different viral effectors. However, too little is currently known about the function of HdIV proteins to test this hypothesis. Finally, we observed no major variation or inversion of patterns of RPKM values within any of the HdIV multigene families as a function of host species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104072-g004">Figure 4</xref>, Sf and Pi). Thus, based on this analysis of only two permissive lepidopteran species, there seems to be no clear relationship between the existence of multigene families in HdIV and the possibility of the associated parasitoid being able to exploit a large range of host species.</p><fig id="pone-0104072-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0104072.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>The HdIV transcriptome in different lepidopteran host species (6 h p.p.).</title><p>RPKM levels are indicated for genes belonging to the <italic>Vank</italic> family (<bold>A</bold>), the <italic>Cys-motif</italic> family (<bold>B</bold>), the <italic>Vinx</italic> family (<bold>C</bold>), the <italic>PRRP</italic> family (<bold>D</bold>), the <italic>Rep</italic> family (<bold>E</bold>), the <italic>N-gene</italic> family (<bold>F</bold>), the <italic>GlyPro</italic> family (<bold>G)</bold>, the known single-copy gene (<bold>H</bold>), the F1 to F11 family (<bold>I</bold>) and the newly characterized single-copy gene (<bold>J</bold>).

However, a comparison of permissive and non-permissive hosts showed that HdIV gene transcription rates were much lower in the non-permissive hosts (generally by a factor of log10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104072-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In the non-permissive hosts tested 6 h p.p., a smaller number of HdIV genes were found to be transcribed and overall transcript levels were lower than those in permissive hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104072-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Relevant examples are provided by <italic>Cys1_Hd20a</italic>, <italic>PRRP2_Hd26ab</italic> and <italic>Rep1_Hd16</italic>, which had RPKM values below 2 in <italic>M. brassicae</italic> but over 20 in the permissive hosts. One explanation for the failure of parasitism in <italic>M. brassicae</italic> and <italic>A. gemmatalis</italic> is that low transcript levels result in protein levels that are too low to induce all the changes in host physiology required for the successful development of the parasitoid larva. There may be several reasons for the observed lower levels of transcripts in the non-permissive hosts at early stages of parasitism. Firstly, assuming that <italic>H. didymator</italic> females inject the same volume of calyx fluid during oviposition, regardless of the size of the host, the density of viral particles injected into the host may be lower in non-permissive hosts, as <italic>M. brassicae</italic> and <italic>A. gemmatalis</italic> are slightly larger than the two permissive hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104072-g003">Figure 3G</xref>). Alternatively, HdIV particles may infect the host cells of non-permissive species less efficiently, either because they penetrate a smaller number of cells or because they are eliminated by an antiviral immune response mediated by autophagy or apoptotic mechanisms, as already described in insects <xref rid="pone.0104072-Kingsolver1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104072-Clem1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. A third, non-mutually exclusive, alternative is that putative host regulatory factors (enhancers) are absent from these species.</p><p>Our high-throughput transcriptome results complement existing knowledge acquired through experiments on the wasp <italic>C. sonorensis</italic>, which showed only that non-permissive hosts were not able to sustain CsIV infection during parasitism <xref rid="pone.0104072-Cui2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0104072-Schneider1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Based on this previous work, we could assume that the low level of HdIV gene transcription measured at 6 h p.p. in the two non-permissive hosts (<italic>M. brassicae</italic> and <italic>A. gemmatalis</italic>) in our system may decrease still further during parasitization, accounting for the recovery and normal development of non-permissive hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104072-g003">Figure 3G</xref>, Mb and Ag 6 d p.p.) and efficient immune responses directed against wasp larvae escaping encapsulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104072-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, Mb and Ag).</p><p>One of the key conclusions of this study is that, despite the variations of expression observed for a subset of HdIV genes, the global HdIV gene transcription profile does not differ between parasitized host species. This may be because there is no need for a diversification of the molecular mechanisms driving HdIV gene expression to allow <italic>H. didymator</italic> to exploit a large range of host species. However, our study concerned only a limited number of <italic>H. didymator</italic> hosts, and many other lepidopteran host species need be analyzed before any firm conclusions can be drawn.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study generated the fourth campoplegine IV annotated genome sequence to be published and is, to our knowledge, the first global time-course transcriptome analysis of an IV during parasitization and on different lepidopteran host species. The general features of the HdIV genome are similar to those of the genomes of other IVs. Like other IVs, HdIV has a genome consisting of a large number of small circular DNA molecules (49 molecules of 2.5 to 8.9 kb in size, plus a large, 36 kb segment), and most of its 135 viral genes are organized into multigene families. We identified nine gene families and 28 single-copy genes currently unknown outside of HdIV, which may have been acquired more recently in the <italic>Hyposoter</italic> lineage.</p><p>The principal result of this study, that only a small proportion of HdIV genes are strongly transcribed in parasitized hosts, was unexpected. In an analysis of HdIV gene transcription in the entire parasitized insect host, only a subset (less than 30) of the HdIV genes, most harbored by only 19 of the 50 HdIV segments, was found to be strongly transcribed (RPKM&#x0003e;50) in the two permissive hosts, <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> and <italic>P. includens</italic>. This raises a number of questions:</p><p>Why these particular genes? The most plausible hypothesis is that these genes encode proteins required for successful parasitism. The &#x0201c;top10&#x0201d; genes in this list were all genes specific to HdIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104072-g004">Figure 4 G, H</xref>) that appear to have been acquired recently, during the process of <italic>H. didymator</italic> speciation/adaptation to its host range. Thus, although transcript levels do not always reflect protein levels, these HdIV genes may be considered good candidates for future functional characterization, to improve our understanding of their role in parasitism and to explore epistasis within the HdIV genome. Our results also indicate that total HdIV gene transcript levels are low in non-permissive hosts. This may indicate that HdIV infection is &#x0201c;abnormal&#x0201d; (e.g. inefficient cell entry and/or gene expression) in these lepidopteran species, resulting in failed parasitism.</p><p>How is the expression of these genes regulated? The possible mechanisms involve gene-specific promoter sequences and/or a larger number of gene copies (within the virus particles) thanks to classical segment nesting or the existence of overlapping sequences (e.g. Hd2, Hd17, Hd26). Comparisons between different host species also indicated the probable involvement of host factors in regulating expression, because some genes are differentially expressed between host species, even though this is not generally the case. Our preliminary search for characteristics of the upstream sequences of abundantly transcribed genes was not conclusive, probably because the dataset available is still too limited. Finally, thanks to the apparent great plasticity of PDV genomes, mechanisms for the regulation of particular genes may have been acquired through duplication events and/or recombination between segments (e.g. Hd36 and Hd38, Hd24 and Hd28, Hd31 and Hd34, both encoding an F4 gene more strongly transcribed in <italic>P. includens</italic> than in <italic>S. frugiperda</italic>) or within segments (e.g. Hd6 and, to a lesser extent, Hd20).</p><p>Why are genes that are only weakly expressed or not expressed at all retained in the PDV genome? There are several possible answers to this question: (i) they may be &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; at very low levels and/or in very specific tissues or physiological/cellular processes of the host, or (ii) even if not strictly required, the proteins they encode may increase the chances of parasitism being successful (e.g. synergistically). In any case, it would be interesting to study these genes in detail, to determine the type of selection operating on them (e.g. neutral, positive), once the lack of data for other related biological models (sequences, transcription level) has been overcome. The work performed here dealt with entire host larvae and it is known that some IV genes are differentially transcribed between host tissues <xref rid="pone.0104072-Rasoolizadeh1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0104072-Galibert1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0104072-Rasoolizadeh2" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0104072-Theilmann1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. We, therefore, cannot rule out the possibility that some of the genes producing small numbers of transcripts in the whole host organism are expressed strongly in specific host tissues. Future studies should therefore investigate the tissue specificity of HdIV gene expression, to evaluate the overall role of HdIV genes in parasitism.</p><p>Overall, the data presented here constitute a first, but crucial step towards understanding the global functioning of the HdIV genome during the parasitoid/host interaction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0104072.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>Graphic representation of the overlapping segment in proviral (a) and circularized form (b).</bold> The Hd11a and Hd11b segments are illustrated.
