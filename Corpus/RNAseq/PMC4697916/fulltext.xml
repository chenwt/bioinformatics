Post mortem studies from patients with WNV encephalitis reveal characteristic neuronal loss and glial nodules in the gray matter of the thalamus, medulla, pons, midbrain, basal ganglia, and anterior horn of the spinal cord [<xref rid="OFV182C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, cortical neurons do not display pathologic injury [<xref rid="OFV182C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In mice, regional neuronal susceptibility is due in part to type I interferon-dependent restriction of WNV infection through the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) [<xref rid="OFV182C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="OFV182C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In human cases, the underlying distribution of ISG expression, WNV quantitative loads, viral genetic diversity, and the degree to which they associate with CNS injury are not known. Accordingly, we examined these factors in distinct brain regions of a patient with WNV neuroinvasive disease (WNND). Our data suggest that thalamic regions displaying neuropathologic and neuroimaging evidence of injury also exhibit high ISG expression and viral loads associated with increased WNV amino acid diversity. In comparison, cortical neuronal regions exhibit unexpectedly high viral loads but minimal injury, decreased ISG expression, and lower viral amino acid diversity.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><p>Central nervous system tissue was placed in RNAlater (Life Technologies) or 10% formalin for downstream analysis, and total RNA was isolated using the High Pure Viral RNA kit (Roche). Fixed brain tissue samples were prepared for immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis with an additional step of 3 subsequent 7-minute treatments of 0.1% sodium borohydride in phosphate-buffered saline to remove background autofluorescence. Tissues were labeled with rabbit monoclonal antibody against cleaved-caspase 3 ([CC3] Cell Signaling) and mouse monoclonal antibody to WNV envelope (ATCC, clone E18, VR-1611) at a dilution of 1:100 overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. TRITC-conjugated goat anti-immunoglobulin (Ig)G (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used for secondary staining. Coverslips were mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Life Technologies), and images were obtained using an Olympus VS120 Virtual Slide system and analyzed using Olympus VS-Desktop software. Secondary-only labeling controls were used to calibrate exposures for each tissue type. All research was reviewed and approved by the University of Colorado Institutional Biosafety Committee and Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board.</p><p>West Nile virus RNA copies per milligram of tissue were determined from total RNA isolated from each indicated CNS region using previously described primers [<xref rid="OFV182C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Ribosomal depleted (RiboMinus, Waltham, MA) total RNA from each brain region was prepared for next-generation sequencing (NGS) using the Ovation RNA-Seq System V2 and Ultralow Library kits (nuGEN, San Carlos, CA), as previously described with sequencing on the NextSeq 500 platform (Illumina; sequenced at Colorado State University IDRC Genomics Core) [<xref rid="OFV182C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The 150 nucleotide paired-end reads were demultiplexed using BaseSpace (Illumina). To determine ISG expression, reads were aligned to human <italic>Stat1</italic>(GenBank accession no.

NM_001548) using MOSAIK [<xref rid="OFV182C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>To obtain the consensus WNV sequence from this patient and to define viral genetic diversity, WNV reads from the frontal cortex were assembled using Trinity to create a reference sequence (KT020853) for guided assembly from each region using MOSAIK. Geneious version 7.0.6. was used to compare the assembled WNV sequences to the following WNV strains: NY99(AF196835), 04-214CO(DQ431701), CO5-07(JF957170), BSL6-11(JQ700439), AVA1202600(KC736487), FtC-3699(KR868734), and BSL2-10(JF957185). Intratissue WNV minority nucleotide variants were analyzed using Vphaser2 [<xref rid="OFV182C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="OFV182C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A 51-year-old female presented with 2 days of increasing altered mental status and decreasing responsiveness. Illness was preceded by 4 days of fever, nausea, and diarrhea. The patient's past medical history was remarkable for a history of rheumatoid arthritis treated with methotrexate and prednisone, and the last treatment was 1 year before presentation. The patient was evaluated in the emergency room, intubated for airway protection, and lumbar puncture was performed to obtain cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), which exhibited 163 white blood cells/mL with a differential of 99% lymphocytes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed increased signal in the insula, medial temporal lobe, medial left thalamus, and left cerebral peduncle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="OFV182F1">1</xref>A and B). The CSF was positive for WNV IgG (1.82, normal &#x0003c;1.29 intravenous [IV]) and IgM (8.74, normal &#x0003c;0.89 IV; Focus Diagnostics enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), but CSF and serum WNV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays were negative for WNV RNA (ARUP Laboratories, Roche Molecular Systems Inc.). With these data, the patient was diagnosed with WNV encephalitis. During hospitalization in the intensive care unit, the patient was weaned from sedation, remained comatose, and had an electroencephalogram showing diffuse slowing. The patient did exhibit brain stem function but minimal peripheral responses with a physical exam consistent with loss of lower motor neuron function in all 4 extremities. An MRI of the spine exhibited no spinal cord lesions. Despite aggressive supportive care, the patient passed away after a cardiac arrest at day 11 of hospitalization. Autopsy was initiated 22 hours and 30 minutes after death and found no evidence of myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease. Brain tissue was collected at time of autopsy.<fig id="OFV182F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Regional magnetic resonance imaging injury patterns associated with apoptosis and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression.

The CC3 expression was not correlated with WNV envelope antigen expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="OFV182F1">1</xref>E). Using NGS of whole tissue RNA (RNAseq), we determined the relative expression of ISGs between indicated regions of the CNS during acute WNV encephalitis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="OFV182F1">1</xref>F). We found that, in general, ISG expression was the highest in the subcortical tissues of the thalamus and basal ganglia (caudate nucleus and putamen) that also exhibit injury.</p><p>As detailed above, CSF was positive for WNV IgG and IgM but negative for WNV RNA. However, we used NGS of brain tissue from different brain regions to evaluate WNV population structure in the brain. The frontal cortex, thalamus, and anterior horn of the spinal cord exhibited in excess of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> WNV RNA copies per milligram of tissue, whereas the midbrain, caudate nucleus, putamen, and temporal lobe all exhibited &#x0003c;1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> WNV RNA copies per milligram of tissue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="OFV182F2">2</xref>A). From NGS, each tissue yielded 25&#x02013;33 million sequencing reads, and 0.04% (frontal cortex) to 0.00004% (temporal lobe) of these aligned to WNV genetic sequences. The WNV population size (WNV RNA copies) directly correlated with the WNV sequencing coverage [<xref rid="OFV182C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

diversity because these regions had complete coverage of the WNV coding sequence. The percentage of nucleotides and amino acids with substitutions found within these brain regions was comparable to that previously reported for WNV and dengue virus isolated from other vertebrate tissues, but less than from mosquitoes (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="OFV182F2">2</xref>D and E) [<xref rid="OFV182C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="OFV182C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="OFV182C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The thalamic and cortical tissues contained similar nucleotide diversity, but most of the WNV variants detected in the cortex were silent mutations, which do not result in an amino acid change (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="OFV182F2">2</xref>F). The thalamus contained considerably more WNV amino acid diversity in comparison to the cortex. The intratissue WNV nucleotide variants tended to be concentrated in the nonstructural genome regions, except for 3 envelope variants found in the cortex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="OFV182F2">2</xref>F). Four nucleotides were maintained as minority variants between at least 2 different regions, but the majority of the nucleotide variants were found only in a single brain region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="OFV182F2">2</xref>F). We found additional evidence for region-specific differences in WNV populations by comparing the partial consensus sequences from all of the brain tissues obtained (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="OFV182TB1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>West Nile virus is a vector-borne infection most often transmitted to humans by <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes that can result in neuroinvasive disease (WNND) [<xref rid="OFV182C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Presenting clinical symptoms are representative of typical brain regions displaying MRI injury patterns associated with WNV encephalitis and include areas of increased T<sub>2</sub> and FLAIR signal and low T<sub>1</sub> signal that involve the basal ganglia, thalamus, and brain stem [<xref rid="OFV182C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="OFV182C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>For the first time, we isolated total RNA from different brain regions in a patient with acute WNV encephalitis and described intratissue viral population diversity using NGS technology. We discovered classic injury patterns, defined by neuroimaging and IHC, in the subcortical gray matter of the thalamus, basal ganglia, and midbrain. To our surprise, we found high viral loads in the frontal cortex despite showing little injury, whereas regions exhibiting injury exhibited highly variable viral loads. These data suggest that in human WNND, neuronal injury may be independent of viral replication and injury in the brain may be due to regional factors.</p><p>Post mortem studies have shown that injury patterns correlate with inflammatory infiltrates in the brain, which [<xref rid="OFV182C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] suggests that inflammation and innate neuronal subtype susceptibility to injury are important determinants of disease. The ISGs <italic>Irf1</italic>, <italic>Irg1</italic>, <italic>Ifi27</italic>, and <italic>Rsad2</italic> were shown to inhibit WNV replication in cortical neurons, and they were more highly expressed in the cerebellum compared with the cortex of mice [<xref rid="OFV182C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In this patient, we also show that expression of <italic>Irf1</italic>, <italic>Ifi27</italic>, and <italic>Rsad2</italic>, in addition to <italic>Stat1</italic>, <italic>Oas1</italic>, and <italic>Ifit1</italic>, are regionally heterogeneous, with the high levels generally found in the subcortical regions of the brain. Thus, it may be that regional differences in ISG expression may contribute to the regional patterns of neuronal injury.</p><p>Our data on region-specific patterns of WNV genetic diversity further suggest that WNV encounters different selective pressures as it spreads throughout brain. As with injury, the regional differences in immune responses and susceptibility of neuronal subtypes may contribute to the strength of selection as represented by increased amino acid substitutions in the viral genomes. For example, WNV populations in the thalamus exhibited an increased frequency of amino acid substitutions when compared with the cortex, suggesting an association between increased ISG expression and selection in the CNS. Although consensus amino acid differences between the WNV populations of the cortex and the thalamus were minimal, an expanding body of evidence demonstrates that minority variants may directly and significantly influence WNV phenotype [<xref rid="OFV182C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="OFV182C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="OFV182C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>This study has several limitations. This work is from a single patient; therefore, the findings are hypothesis generating and need to be verified in experimental models. However, the confluence of human clinical data and timely acquisition and analysis of human brain tissue is difficult to complete for this sporadic infection. In this 1 host, we used NGS to show evidence of intraregional variation in viral populations and ISG expression. However, other hosts with different ISG patterns may exhibit different regional genetic variation. Thus, further studies of minority WNV variants and immune activation in the human CNS will be needed to identify mechanisms of viral selection that are associated with injury and disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>We report the first comprehensive study of WNV variation within a human case of viral encephalitis and describe possible associations between viral nucleotide substitutions, neuroradiographic and pathologic injury patterns, and ISG expression in the human brain. These data should guide future investigations into the role of inflammatory responses in selective viral pressures and injury patterns in the brain following viral infections.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Dr. Betty DeMasters and the University of Colorado Hospital Pathology Department for coordination of care and sample acquisition.
