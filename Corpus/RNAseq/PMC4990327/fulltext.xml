Results of a previous study using renal cell carcinoma (RCC) as a model pointed towards cancer-related features, which could be visualized as three groups by microarray based gene expression analysis. In this study, we used a mathematic model to verify the presence of these groups in RCC as well as in other cancer types. We developed an algorithm for gene-expression deviation profiling for analyzing gene expression data of a total of 8397 patients with 13 different cancer types and normal tissues. We revealed three common Cancer Transcriptomic Profiles (CTPs) which recurred in all investigated tumors. Additionally, CTPs remained robust regardless of the functions or numbers of genes analyzed. CTPs may represent common genetic fingerprints, which potentially reflect the closely related biological traits of human cancers.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F&#x000f6;rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SNF 3238BO-10314</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moch</surname><given-names>Holger</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Authors MB, RS, ME, RG, CM, KH are employed by the Qlaym Healthcare AG.

The results may be interpreted as &#x0201c;cluster diameter&#x0201d; estimate. For RCC, the correlation was highest with 0.439; 0.476; 0.413 for CTP-A, CTP-B and CTP-C, respectively. For the other tumor types, these values ranged between 0.14 and 0.18, whereas for control normal tissues these values ranged between 0.08 and 0.14, much lower than for tumors. This difference between normal and tumor tissue was highly significant (p-value = 2*10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>). The direct comparison of the normal and tumor tissue samples of the renal data set GSE53757 (0.08 vs. 0.14, respectively) was also significant (p-value = 5*10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>). We intentionally omitted the SOM clustered data from GSE22541 from this averaging since the independent SOM clustering introduced additional positional scatter.

We then transduced resulting confined RCC-CTPs to the expression data of the same genes in all other tumor types and compared achieved CTP affiliation of each tumor.

We asked if the separation between CTP-A, -B, and -C as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161514.g001">Fig 1</xref> may be entirely or to large part due to noise. In the simulation, we thus assumed that for all patients the deviation from the average expression value of each probe set is just the result of a random fluctuation. The distribution of the deviations is assumed to be normal for every probe set. The subsequent discretization of the values, calculation of the CTP profiles and the ensuing assignment of the virtual patients to a particular CTP was performed according to the protocol, as well as the calculation of the &#x0201c;virtual cancer&#x0201d; specific profile. A random subset of 716 genes was finally picked to mimic the effect of specific gene selection as in the tumor suppressor or oncogene examples.</p><p>For the simulation, we generated 14 virtual cancer patient groups with 50 patients each, similar to the experimental situation.</p><p>Correlating all CTP-A profiles with each other across different virtual cancer types, and similarly for CTP-B and -C, yielded average correlations of less than 0.02. Calculating the same average correlations for the experimental tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes yielded average correlations between 0.7 and 0.76. The probability that these high correlations between CTPs across different cancer types were generated by random is infinitesimally small (p-value &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;100</sup>). Between the two experimental sets, however, the p-values were much higher (0.04&#x02013;0.98), indicating that the null hypothesis (generated from the same underlying distribution and not by noise) held as expected.</p><p>A similar result was obtained when the different CTPs within a cancer type were compared. As expected, experimental correlation values between different CTPs showed values different from 1, i.e. -0.38 (AB), -0.5 &#x02013;-0.6 (AC), and -0.37 &#x02013;-0.51 (BC). Again, these correlations were stable across the tumor suppressor and oncogenes platform (p-values ranging between 0.25 and 0.98), while the simulation yielded average correlations between 0.008 and 0.21. This differed significantly from the experimental values (p-value &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p>In summary, these simulations demonstrate that random effects like mere fluctuations of expression values could not explain the high correlations between CTPs across and within different tumor types.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec014"><title>Discussion</title><p>The hallmarks of cancer imply that all cancers follow specific biological concepts which form the basis of malignant behavior. Therefore, we speculated that such biological concepts among cancers relate closely to each other and may be visualized by gene expression patterns. Our hypothesis originated from the detection of three gene expression outputs in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which appeared to be independent from pathological parameters and correlated with patient outcome [<xref rid="pone.0161514.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In an attempt to further support this hypothesis we designed an algorithmic model, which enabled us to classify Cancer Transcriptomic Profiles (CTP). The initial experiment on RCC was performed on Affymetrix arrays. In order to transduce the algorithmic rule on other cancer types in the first step, we focused on studies performed using Affymetrix microarrays and screened GEO for surgically treated tumor cohorts with associated progression data and identified 55 studies. Being aware of additional useful meta-analysis on different platforms, we noticed that all these platforms lack a proper key to translate their annotations to each other or to Affymetrix or Illumina or even present entirely different technologies such as RNAseq. By focusing on a single platform, we could exclude all additional factors and potential artifacts due to the chip related technical differences. In one instance, however, we compared the Affymetrix outcome with results obtained from Illumina data to demonstrate that the observed results are independent of the gene expression platform chosen. We selected Illumina for this comparison as this platform has about 6000 probes in common with Affymetrix with equal annotations, thus enabling the partial transfer as performed in our text appendix. The generalizations found across tumor boundaries could thus be safely attributed to the underlying tumor biology.</p><p>In this study, we analyzed gene expression data obtained from 8397 samples. Sixteen of 55 datasets accounting for 4177 out of the 8387 tumors were from breast cancer, which currently presents the most frequent tumor type in the GEO repository. We detected three different Cancer Transcriptomic Profiles (CTPs) that are recurring in 13 different cancer types. These CTPs suggest molecular relationships among human cancers.</p><p>Absolute gene expression values with subsequent associated gene enrichment technologies have been used in many gene expression studies. In keeping with this, we first used a similar approach and detected 3 groups in RCC by two-way non-supervised hierarchical clustering [<xref rid="pone.0161514.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Our subsequent goal was to find a mathematic approach, an algorithm, for depicting those 3 groups. According to our opinion, this was best achieved by discretization of gene expression data we describe here. The method we have chosen is <italic>per se</italic> not novel, but to our knowledge, its conceptual application to characterize mathematically the 3 CTPs has not been used and published so far. A closer look at the expression profiles of all genes (Fig A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161514.s006">S1 Text</xref>) clearly shows that the expression levels of the genes in each CTP group are equally distributed. CTP groups are not characterized by expression patterns of a specific set of genes (e.g. high <italic>versus</italic> low) which differ, for example, between two organs, tissue/cell types or healthy/diseased tissue. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161514.g003">Fig 3</xref>, it is the composition of the &#x0201c;expression profiles&#x0201d; yielded from the expression deviations from the mean values from all gene probe sets which defines a specific CTP. According to our opinion one would hardly be able to identify those 3 CTPs by using absolute gene expression levels or a more sophisticated &#x0201c;barcoding&#x0201d; model in which gene expression measurements are banalized to 0 (not expressed) <italic>vs</italic>. 1 (expressed) [<xref rid="pone.0161514.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161514.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, a binary approach would only distinguish between expression levels which are either low or high in two groups. With the binary approach one focuses only on low (underexpressed) and high (overexpressed) expressed genes but exclude those genes which are more or less equally expressed. Our model includes also genes with no or small expression level changes. A closer look on the 3 CTPs clearly demonstrates that these genes provide similar contributions to the CTP profiles as the high differentially expressed genes. As a result, CTPs yielded with a 2-bin system would introduce substantial distortions compared to our CTPs.</p><p>These three CTP groups first detected in RCC and confirmed by the discretization method, were transferable to 12 additional cancer types. We developed the algorithm applied to address various challenges encountered in transcription analysis, so that individual expression fluctuations per gene or probe set were neutralized. Subsequent to the standard GCRMA normalization step for Affymetrix gene expression chips (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161514.s006">S1 Text</xref>), we normalized and scaled the expression values of the entire patient set gene-wise. Subsequently we discretized the scaled expression values into 3 levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161514.s006">S1 Text</xref>). By using our -1,0,1 approach of discretization, which aimed at turning the continuous and multi-parametric data into this finite number of discrete elements, we were able to not only facilitate ensuing computations, but also reduce data noise. Clustering the discretized data of the RCC study GSE19949 for 3 Cancer Transcriptome Profiles (CTP-A, -B, -C) with different methods (e.g., k-means, SOM) and an independent classification based on histological parameters [<xref rid="pone.0161514.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], yielded almost identical results. Elements of our approach relate to methods applied earlier, such as Linear Discriminant Analysis, Significance Analysis of Microarrays [<xref rid="pone.0161514.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] or shrunken centroids [<xref rid="pone.0161514.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. One of the most relevant advantages is that this method is invariant against differences in expression levels resulting from different tissues of origin. It thus may present a novel method enabling the detection of pan-cancer signatures.</p><p>According to our mathematical approach, CTPs are a reappearing pattern throughout the cancer transcriptomes. Notably, different clustering technologies, such as k-means or SOM [<xref rid="pone.0161514.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161514.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], applied after discretization generated similar results. The robust nature of a defined CTP in a tumor was also demonstrated when we investigated the average correlation of all patients assigned for a particular CTP. Despite potential biases which may be caused when calculating with data sets generated from different patient cohorts in different laboratories, the difference of the correlation values obtained from normal and tumor tissue was highly significant. Even the reverse transfer of breast cancer-specific CTPs to RCC resulted in 3 groups which were 65% identical with the original RCC subgrouping further supporting the existence of CTPs in different cancers.</p><p>It is of note that due to the very limited availability of samples from normal (control) tissue published in GEO, it is currently not possible to define the particular threshold between normal and tumor tissue. We noticed that the studies mostly consist of disease sample collections with no corresponding healthy counterparts. Therefore, a healthy/disease threshold could not be yielded, unless by including matched pairs of affected and non-affected tissue samples in a sufficiently large amount. The <italic>de Finetti</italic>-like visualizations demonstrate, however, that normal samples located closer to the triangle center than tumor samples. At the center, the correlation with any of the CTP was lowest, pointing to a lower CTP differentiation in normal tissue samples. Being limited to the present situation, however, we can only state, as shown in the results part, that the defined calculated differences are highly significant (p-value = 2*10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>) and are not occurring due to randomness.</p><p>Finally, CTPs still remained stable with sets of only several hundred genes, whether randomly or non-randomly selected. Therefore, we conclude that i. the expression status of every single gene is important to contribute to a CTP and ii. the expression profile of a minimum set of genes is required to yield a CTP.</p><p>As the CTPs of our RCC indicated correlation with patient outcome, we calculated Kaplan Meier survival plots using all survival data sets from different cancer types that were available in the GEO database. The results were, however, difficult to interpret (data not shown). Some survival plots for sarcoma, breast and lung cancer were similar to those obtained from RCC. Other survival plots showed no associations or, as in the case of ovarian cancer, even contrasting patterns. This data strongly suggest that the analysis of survival data sets from different patient cohorts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161514.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161514.s002">S2</xref> Tables) generated from different research groups, as well as the use of different assay and standardization methods may cause dataset bias and inter-dataset noise. The GEO database presents to our knowledge the major resource for researchers for getting access to clinical survival data. Based on our experience its use for analyzing the prognostic value of molecular markers in one specific tumor type or in different cancers is rather limited. However, this tool is ideally suited to perform comprehensive analysis to detect potential associations between molecular signatures and cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We present a novel model that can be applied to identify cancer-specific gene expression profiles.
