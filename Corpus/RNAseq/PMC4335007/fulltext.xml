Both small RNA species silence gene expression post-transcriptionally in association with the ARGONAUTE (AGO) family of proteins. In mammals, there are four AGO proteins (AGO1-4), of which only AGO2 possesses endonucleolytic activity. siRNAs trigger endonucleolytic cleavage of target mRNAs, mediated by AGO2, whereas miRNAs cause translational repression and mRNA decay through association with any of the four AGO proteins. <italic>Dicer</italic> deletion in mouse oocytes leads to female infertility due to defects during meiosis I. Because mouse oocytes express both miRNAs and endo-siRNAs, this phenotype could be due to the absence of either class of small RNA, or both. However, we and others demonstrated that miRNA function is suppressed in mouse oocytes, which suggested that endo-siRNAs, not miRNAs, are essential for female meiosis. To determine if this was the case we generated mice that express a catalytically inactive knock-in allele of <italic>Ago2 (Ago2ADH)</italic> exclusively in oocytes and thereby disrupted the function of siRNAs. Oogenesis and hormonal response are normal in <italic>Ago2ADH</italic> oocytes, but meiotic maturation is impaired, with severe defects in spindle formation and chromosome alignment that lead to meiotic catastrophe. The transcriptome of these oocytes is widely perturbed and shows a highly significant correlation with the transcriptome of <italic>Dicer</italic> null and <italic>Ago2</italic> null oocytes. Expression of the mouse transcript (MT), the most abundant transposable element in mouse oocytes, is increased. This study reveals that endo-siRNAs are essential during meiosis I in mouse females, demonstrating a role for endo-siRNAs in mammals.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>In animals, the three main classes of small RNAs are microRNAs, short interfering RNAs, and PIWI-interacting RNAs. All three RNA species silence gene expression post-transcriptionally through interaction with the ARGONAUTE family of proteins. In mammals in particular, microRNAs are ubiquitously expressed, are essential for development, and perform numerous functions in a variety of cells and tissues. piRNAs are expressed almost exclusively in the germline, and are essential for male fertility and defense against transposons. Endogenous siRNAs are only expressed in germ cells and embryonic stem cells and have not been ascribed a functional role. By engineering a mouse that expresses a modified ARGONAUTE protein, we disrupt the function of endo-siRNAs exclusively in oocytes and find that females are infertile. Oocytes with an impaired siRNA pathway fail to complete meiosis I, and display severe spindle formation and chromosome alignment defects. Their transcriptome is widely perturbed and expression of the most abundant transposon is increased. These findings indicate that endo-siRNAs are essential for female fertility in mouse, are required for spindle formation, chromosome congression, and defense against transposons. This study unequivocally demonstrates an essential function for siRNAs in mammals, mediated through endonucleolytic cleavage of targets, and provides an explanation for the selective pressure that one AGO protein retains catalytic activity.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the National Institutes of Health Grants HD022681 (to RMS), and R37 GM062534-14 (to GJH), National Human Genome Research Institute 5T32HG000046-13 (to FL) and by a kind gift from Kathryn W.

DICER processes long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) precursors into 21&#x02013;23 bp-long duplexes known as siRNAs [<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. miRNAs are encoded by specific genomic loci and are processed from endogenous hairpin-shaped transcripts that are initially cleaved in the nucleus to a 70-bp miRNA precursor (pre-miRNA) by the Microprocessor complex, which is composed of the RNase III enzyme DROSHA and its partner, DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8 (DGCR8). The pre-miRNA is exported to the cytoplasm, where DICER cleaves the loop region of the molecule to generate the mature miRNA duplex [<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Although both siRNAs and miRNAs are synthesized as duplexes, only one of the two strands, the &#x02018;guide&#x02019; strand, is incorporated into the multi-protein complex RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC); the other strand (&#x02018;passenger&#x02019; strand) is discarded [<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The guide strand recognizes a target mRNA by Watson-Crick base pairing and, based on the degree of sequence complementarity between the small RNA and target mRNA, either endonucleolytic cleavage or translational repression of the target mRNA follows [<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In animals, siRNAs are perfectly complementary to their targets, and hence trigger mRNA cleavage, whereas miRNAs are usually only partially complementary and silence gene expression by translational repression and mRNA decay. Although it was initially postulated that mRNA levels did not change substantially in response to animal miRNAs, it was later shown that mRNA destabilization, prompted by deadenylation and decapping by the mRNA degradation machinery, is the main mode of regulation by mammalian miRNAs [<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. ARGONAUTE (AGO) proteins are at the core of RISC. In mammals, there are four AGO proteins (AGO1&#x02013;4). All four can bind small RNAs and trigger translational repression, but only AGO2 possesses endonucleolytic activity and is the catalytic component of RISC [<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>We previously demonstrated a role for small RNAs during meiosis in mouse oocytes. Mice with an oocyte-specific deletion of <italic>Dicer</italic> are infertile due to defects during meiosis I [<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. <italic>Dicer</italic>-deficient females have morphologically normal ovaries and oocytes, produce normal numbers of oocytes, and ovulate similar numbers of eggs. However, <italic>Dicer</italic> null oocytes display meiotic catastrophe, with multiple disorganized meiotic spindles and severe chromosome congression defects. Expression of a subset of transposable elements is increased and the transcriptome is widely perturbed in <italic>Dicer</italic> null oocytes, with 18.4% of transcripts mis-regulated [<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Deep sequencing of small RNAs demonstrated the presence of DICER-dependent miRNAs and endogenous siRNAs (endo-siRNAs), as well as DICER-independent PIWI interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in mouse oocytes [<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Two populations of endo-siRNAs were found, one that corresponds to transposon-rich loci and another that maps to protein-coding genes. Interestingly, we found that some siRNAs are processed from dsRNAs formed by hybridization of transcripts from protein-coding genes to antisense transcripts from homologous pseudogenes and that these endo-siRNAs regulate the expression of endogenous genes. Therefore, the phenotype of <italic>Dicer</italic> null oocytes could be due to the absence of miRNAs or endo-siRNAs, or both. Using mRNA reporters, we assayed the ability of miRNAs to silence gene expression, looking at both translational repression and transcript levels. We found that miRNA activity decreases during oocyte growth and is suppressed in the full-grown oocyte. Furthermore, the very modest translational repression observed is not accompanied by message degradation [<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Similarly, Suh et al. generated an oocyte-specific deletion of <italic>Dgcr8</italic> and found that <italic>Dgcr8</italic> null oocytes, which lack mature miRNAs, have a normal transcriptome and undergo normal meiotic maturation, fertilization, and embryonic development; consistent with these findings, <italic>Dgcr8</italic> null mice have no discernable phenotype [<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These two studies suggest that most likely endo-siRNAs, and not miRNAs, have an essential role during female meiosis.</p><p>It has recently been reported that mouse oocytes express a truncated DICER isoform, DICER<sup>O</sup>, which lacks the N-terminal DExD helicase domain, and which processes long dsRNAs much more efficiently than the somatic DICER isoform (DICER<sup>S</sup>), which is also expressed, albeit at lower levels [<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The phenotype of <italic>Dicer</italic>
<sup><italic>O</italic></sup> null mice is virtually identical to the phenotype of mice with an oocyte-specific deletion of <italic>Dicer</italic> (which lack both DICER<sup>S</sup> and DICER<sup>O</sup>). Although DICER<sup>O</sup> can produce both miRNAs and endo-siRNAs when ectopically expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells, miRNA levels appear slightly increased in <italic>Dicer</italic>
<sup><italic>O</italic></sup> null oocytes, suggesting that likely siRNAs are responsible for the observed phenotype. Whether this role of endo-siRNAs is mediated by endonucleolytic cleavage of mRNA targets remains unknown.</p><p>To test directly the role of endo-siRNAs through endonucleolytic cleavage in mouse oocytes, we expressed a catalytically inactive knock-in allele of <italic>Ago2</italic> specifically in oocytes to disrupt the function of endo-siRNAs. We find that female mice expressing a catalytically inactive AGO2 (but not active AGO2) in their oocytes are infertile due to meiosis I defects. The phenotype is virtually identical to that in <italic>Dicer</italic> null females&#x02014;female sterility, defects in spindle formation and chromosome congression, increase in abundance of transposable elements, and widespread changes in the transcriptome&#x02014;and using live cell imaging, we characterize in more detail the meiotic defects. This study demonstrates a functional role for endogenous siRNAs through endonucleolytic cleavage in mammals and adds support to the evolutionary pressure to conserve ARGONAUTE endonucleolytic activity in animals.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Generation and characterization of an oocyte-specific catalytically inactive <italic>Ago2</italic> allele</title><p>To eliminate the function of siRNAs we generated mice carrying a catalytically inactive form of AGO2 in their oocytes using a knock-in allele of <italic>Ago2</italic> in which the catalytic DDH motif was mutated to ADH (<italic>Ago2</italic>

Also, AGO2 could cleave other, yet uncharacterized, DICER-independent small RNAs.</p><p>Given that a population of endo-siRNAs in oocytes derives from protein-coding genes, it was postulated that these small RNAs regulate expression of their precursor mRNAs [<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].

<sup>ADH</sup> oocytes, because <italic>Ago2</italic> null oocytes have reduced miRNA levels [<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The concentration of 5 abundant miRNAs was assayed in oocytes of different <italic>Ago2</italic> genotypes. Mature miRNA levels were significantly decreased in both <italic>Ago2</italic>
<sup>ADH</sup> and <italic>Ago2</italic> null oocytes (<xref rid="pgen.1005013.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11A Fig</xref>.). Consistent with this finding, the modest miRNA-mediated translational repression, as assayed using luciferase reporters, was also reduced (<xref rid="pgen.1005013.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11B Fig</xref>.). Although AGO proteins stabilize mature miRNAs (and hence AGO loss leads to miRNA turnover), the catalytic activity of AGO2 is not required for this effect [<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. There are at least two possible explanations for the discrepancy with our results. First, <italic>Ago2</italic>
<sup>ADH</sup> oocytes contain only one allele of <italic>Ago2</italic> and hence the amount of protein is likely half the amount present in wild-type oocytes. Although <italic>Ago3</italic> is the most abundant <italic>Ago</italic> transcript in mouse oocytes (<xref rid="pgen.1005013.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12A Fig</xref>.), <italic>Ago2</italic> levels are substantial and a decrease in available AGO protein concentration may affect miRNA stability. Also, the levels of the other <italic>Ago</italic> transcripts are unchanged in both <italic>Ago2</italic>
<sup>ADH</sup> and <italic>Ago2</italic> null oocytes (<xref rid="pgen.1005013.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12B Fig</xref>.; only <italic>Ago2</italic> and <italic>Ago3</italic> transcript levels are shown because <italic>Ago1</italic> and <italic>Ago4</italic> mRNA levels are extremely low, undetectable in many samples, but are not up-regulated in <italic>Ago2</italic>
<sup>ADH</sup> oocytes). Second, the aforementioned studies were performed in somatic cells, which lack endo-siRNAs. Because the catalytic activity of AGO2 is required for passenger strand cleavage and siRNA unwinding [<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], in <italic>Ago2</italic>
<sup>ADH</sup> oocytes siRNA duplexes would remain associated with AGO2, preventing miRNA binding and thus leading to more rapid miRNA turnover. The <italic>Zp3</italic>-driven Cre recombinase utilized to delete the floxed allele of <italic>Ago2</italic> is active very early during oocyte growth [<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], which takes ~ 3 weeks during which time transcription starts to decrease around mid-growth such that the full grown oocyte is transcriptionally inactive. Therefore, a small difference in miRNA stability can result over time in a highly significant decrease in miRNA levels. However, because mice whose oocytes are depleted of miRNAs show no discernable phenotype [<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the phenotype of <italic>Ago2</italic>
<sup>ADH</sup> mice cannot be attributed to differences in oocyte miRNA levels.</p><p>In mammals, endo-siRNAs have only been described in mouse oocytes, ES cells, and male germ cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A physiological role for endo-siRNAs, however, has not been demonstrated in mammals. Mouse oocytes and ES cells lack the interferon response, an anti-viral defense mechanism against long dsRNA [<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and germ cells in the testis have also been suggested to be insensitive to interferon and hence tolerate dsRNA precursors that could generate endo-siRNAs [<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In the mouse testis, ablation of <italic>Dicer</italic> or <italic>Drosha</italic> in germ cells leads to abnormal spermatogenesis, but male mice with a germ cell-specific ablation of <italic>Ago2</italic> show no phenotype [<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], suggesting that miRNAs are essential for spermatogenesis, but endo-siRNAs are dispensable in the male germline. In contrast, we find that endo-siRNAs are essential in the female germline in mouse. The presence in oocytes of <italic>DICER</italic>
<sup><italic>O</italic></sup> that efficiently generates siRNAs from long dsRNA precursors, coupled with the absence of an interferon response, makes the mouse oocyte a privileged environment for siRNA action and may explain why this highly specialized cell relies on the siRNA pathway to regulate gene expression and protect genomic integrity. Given that <italic>DICER</italic>
<sup><italic>O</italic></sup> is only expressed in mouse and rat oocytes, but not other rodent or non-rodent species [<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], this essential role of siRNAs in oocytes may be restricted to the <italic>Muridae</italic> family.</p><p>Because most animal miRNAs silence their targets by translational repression, often linked to mRNA decay, but not by endonucleolytic cleavage, it has been puzzling that one mammalian AGO protein (AGO2) has retained catalytic activity. The finding that the catalytic activity of AGO2 is required for biosynthesis of one miRNA, miR-451 [<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and that this small RNA is essential for erythropoiesis [<xref rid="pgen.1005013.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] provided an answer to this conundrum.
