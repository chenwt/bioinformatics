<italic>Background:</italic> Interleukin (IL)-27 is a member of the IL-6/IL-12 family of cytokines. It is a potent cytokine, with potential antiviral impact, and has been shown to play a role in modulating functions of diverse cell types, including Th1, Th2, and NK and B cells, demonstrating both pro- and anti-inflammatory roles.&#x000a0; In hepatocytes, it is capable of inducing signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1, STAT3 and interferon-stimulated genes.</p><p id="P5">
<italic>Methods: </italic>To address its role in viral hepatitis, the antiviral activity of IL-27 against hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) was tested
<italic>in vitro</italic> using cell-culture-derived infectious HCV (HCVcc) cell culture system and the HepaRG HBV cell culture model. To further investigate the impact of IL-27 on hepatocytes, Huh7.5 cells were treated with IL-27 to analyse the differentially expressed genes by microarray analysis. Furthermore, by quantitative PCR, we analyzed the up-regulation of chemokine
<italic>(CXCL)-10</italic> in response to IL-27.</p><p id="P6">
<italic>Results:</italic> In both HCV and HBV infection models, we observed only a modest direct antiviral effect. Microarray analysis showed that the up-regulated genes mostly belonged to antigen presentation and DNA replication pathways, and involved strong up-regulation of
<italic>CXCL-10</italic>, a gene associated with liver inflammation. Overall, gene set enrichment analysis showed a striking correlation of these genes with those up-regulated in response to related cytokines in diverse cell populations.</p><p id="P7">
<italic>Conclusion: </italic>Our data indicate that IL-27 can have a significant pro-inflammatory impact
<italic>in vitro</italic>, although the direct antiviral effect is modest.

For example, higher expression of ISGs in hepatocyte is associated with a poor response to IFN-alpha, while a higher expression of ISGs in monocytes is associated with SVR. Hence, a lack of ISG expression in this hepatocyte cell line may be associated with an overall favorable host ISG response. Effects of IL-27 on other cell types may provide clues on the net effect of this cytokine on host innate response to HCV.&#x000a0;</p></list-item></list>
