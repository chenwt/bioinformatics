This study aimed at providing insights into the hypothesized functional link between olfactory sensing of the spawning ground and final sexual maturation. We have therefore assessed the presence and expression levels of olfactory genes by RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of the olfactory rosettes in homing chum salmon <italic>Oncorhynchus keta</italic> Walbaum from the coastal sea to 75 km upstream the rivers at the pre-spawning ground.

RNAseq revealed the expression of 75 known and 27 unknown salmonid olfactory genes of which 13 genes were differentially expressed between fish from the pre-spawning area and from the coastal area, suggesting an important role of these genes in homing.

Sensing the geographic position should be strongly linked to the stage of sexual maturation in both sexes to allow successful spawning of gametes. During the final stage of anadromous salmonid migration, olfactory cues guide the way to the spawning grounds [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Specific odorant factors of the natal river, that have been imprinted in particular areas of the nervous systems of juvenile salmon during downstream migration, are evoked by the adult salmon to recognize the natal river during the homing migration [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Indications exist that olfactory sensing of spawning ground cues simultaneously triggers the final maturation of the gonads [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In this study, we aimed at lifting the veil of the molecular basis of this process and the potential messengers to the reproductive axis, and at confirming the maturation status by assessing the changes that occur in the reproductive axis by tracing back signals from the maturing gonad and steroid messengers in the blood plasma, to the gonadotropins in the pituitary and to their regulation in the brain. This will be necessary to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and to investigate cause-effect relationships between the olfactory transcriptome and the sexual maturation stage in follow-up studies.</p><p>The reproductive axis in fish involves several levels of regulation of sexual maturation, at the levels of the brain, pituitary and gonad (BPG-axis). Development of the gonads in fish is regulated by pituitary gonadotropins (GTHs): Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH). GTHs control gonad development directly and indirectly by regulating the production of gonadal steroids in both male and female fish [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) is a decapeptide neurohormone that stimulates the pituitary to produce and release GTHs and establishes a physical and functional connection between the brain and the pituitary through the innervation by GnRH neurons of many central nervous system (CNS) regions [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Salmon GnRH (sGnRH, or GnRH3 in zebrafish) is localized to the olfactory bulb-terminal nerve as well as to the preoptic area (POA) in the hypothalamus [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The sGnRH has been shown to elicit GTH-releasing activity and is considered to be the hypophysiotropic form [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>During the final stages of the long term homing migration of salmonids, final maturation is likely triggered by one or more specific stimuli. Specifically, sGnRH present in the olfactory system, the terminal nerve and the POA is considered to play important roles in both salmon homing migration [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and sexual maturation. This is also indicated by the effects of GnRH analog administration that include shortening of the homing migration and advancement of sexual maturation [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Hormone profiles have been studied [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and one of the most important findings that supports a functional link between olfactory sensing and sexual maturation through sGnRH was that sGnRH levels in the telencephalon and serum testosterone (T) levels in male and female chum salmon showed a coincident peak at the branch point between the main river and the tributary that leads to the spawning grounds (<xref rid="pone.0137404.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). These results support the idea that sGnRH, besides the hypothesized olfactory role, plays a role in GTH secretion in the pituitary of chum salmon. This strongly suggests a functional link between olfaction and reproductive regulation with sGnRH as direct effector. The need for fine-tuning between both processes points in the direction of sGnRH as a possible transducer of environmental olfactory signals to the GnRH POA neurons that regulate reproductive effects. These inputs may come from the olfactory rosettes where olfactory signals are received by olfactory receptors which are expressed in the sensory neurons. The efficient detection of dissolved odorants like amino acids, nucleotides, steroids, prostaglandins and bile acids (reviewed by Hino et al. [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]) plays a pivotal role in returning to the natal spawning grounds and is suggested to play a role in sexual maturation and reproductive success and, thus, directly contributes to Darwinian fitness. Still, many functional questions on olfactory reception in fish remain unanswered [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] including questions related to its link with reproductive neuroendocrinology.</p><fig id="pone.0137404.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0137404.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Sample sites of returning Chum salmon at the coastal sea of Ishikari Bay and 75 km upstream at the pre-spawning grounds of the Chitose River near Sapporo on Hokkaido, Japan.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0137404.g001"/></fig><p>This study assesses the olfactory transcriptome and the progression of sexual maturation in the brain-pituitary-gonadal axis of homing chum salmon.

For RNAseq, 12 chum salmon olfactory rosette RNA samples were used: three females and three males from each of the sites. In Leiden, RNA was precipitated by centrifugation, washed in 70% ethanol and dissolved again in RNAse free dH2O. RNA concentrations as determined with a Bioanalyzer were between 28 and 115 ng &#x003bc;l<sup>-1</sup> and RIN values between 5.8 and 9.5. Illumina multiplexed RNAseq libraries were prepared from 2 &#x003bc;g total RNA using the Illumina TruSeq<sup>TM</sup> RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (Illumina Inc.). Library concentrations were between 7.7 and 42.5 ng &#x003bc;l<sup>-1</sup> corresponding to molarities between 39.5 and 214.5 nmol l<sup>-1</sup>. All RNAseq libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer as 2 x 50 nucleotides paired-end (PE50) reads according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. Image analysis and base calling were done by the Illumina pipeline. The number of PE50 reads varied from 11.2 to 37.9 million reads per sample, with an average of 20.8 million reads per sample (Table A in <xref rid="pone.0137404.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). The raw RNAseq data of the twelve olfactory rosette samples have been deposited in the NCBI GEO repository with accession number GSE72390.</p><p>Since there was no reference genome of chum salmon (<italic>O</italic>. <italic>keta</italic>) at the time of data analysis, two strategies were used for quantitative analysis of the olfactory placode RNAseq data sets:</p><p>In strategy 1, RNAseq reads from the 12 individual samples were aligned to 48,223 <italic>Salmo salar</italic> cDNA sequences (downloaded from NCBI) using TopHat (version 2.0.5) [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A preliminary test showed that <italic>O</italic>. <italic>keta</italic> and Atlantic salmon (<italic>Salmo salar</italic>) cDNA sequences are approximately 95% identical. Therefore, the reference alignment was done allowing 3 mismatches per 50 nt read (3 mismatches ~ 94% identity). The resulting files were filtered using SAMtools (version 0.1.18) [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] to exclude secondary alignment of reads. Via this strategy about 15% of the chum salmon RNAseq reads could be mapped against the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>salar</italic> reference database (Table A in <xref rid="pone.0137404.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). For statistical comparison of gene expression levels between groups, aligned fragments per predicted gene were counted from SAM alignment files using the Python package HTSeq (version 0.5.3p9) [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In order to make comparisons across samples possible, these fragment counts were corrected for the total amount of sequencing performed for each sample. As a correction scaling factor, we employed library size estimates determined using the R/Bioconductor (release 2.11) package DESeq [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Read counts were normalized by dividing the raw counts obtained from HTSeq by its scale factor.</p><p>In strategy 2, CLC bio&#x02019;s <italic>de novo</italic> assembler was used to generate cDNA contigs from a total of ~250 million PE50 reads derived from all 12 RNAseq libraries. This resulted in 98,542 cDNA contigs corresponding to mRNAs that were expressed in the <italic>O</italic>. <italic>keta</italic> olfactory placodes and ranging in size from 200 to 17,327 nt (Table B in <xref rid="pone.0137404.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). The <italic>de novo</italic> cDNA contigs were annotated to known genes via custom BLAST searches against four reference databases: (a) a UNIPROT protein database (34.7% hits), (b) a Teleost Refseq mRNA database (26.3% hits), (c) a Teleost "all mRNA" database (72.2% hits) and (d) the <italic>Danio rerio</italic> Zv9 genome (7.1% hits). RNAseq reads from the 12 individual samples were then aligned to this <italic>de novo</italic> assembled chum salmon olfactory rosetta cDNA reference database as described above under "strategy 1". About 60% of the RNAseq reads could be mapped against the <italic>de novo</italic> assembled reference database (Table A in <xref rid="pone.0137404.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). Statistical comparison between groups of fish from the prespawning ground vs. fish from the coastal sea site was done using HTseq and DESeq as described above under "strategy 1". Then, for both strategies, olfactory genes were identified by searching for the term 'olfact'. Olfactory genes resulting from strategy 2 were then compared with salmonid and <italic>O</italic>. <italic>keta</italic> NCBI sequences with the megablast option.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Normal distribution was checked by Kolmogorov Smirnoff tests.

The olfactory transcriptomes were compared between male and female fish from the pre-spawning grounds that are hypothesized to have recognized specific odorant factors of the natal rivers (&#x02018;activated&#x02019;) vs. &#x02018;non-activated&#x02019; fish from the coastal sea. This comparison has revealed novel genes and their potential importance in homing-related olfaction. Changes along the brain-pituitary-gonadal axis have been assessed to confirm that fish at the spawning grounds had much advanced in their sexual maturation state in comparison with fish in the ocean and that they had reached final maturation. Assessing these changes was performed applying a diversity of mostly established techniques and available information in order to confirm the advanced maturation of fish near the spawning grounds vs. fish from the coastal sea. The paired insights that have been gained in the processes of olfaction and sexual maturation in homing chum salmon allow us to further consider a link between both processes.</p><sec id="sec018"><title>The plasma steroids: final maturation at the pre-spawning ground</title><p>Lower HSI values and plasma E2 and T levels in female fish from the pre-spawning ground vs. those from the coastal sea indicate the completion of vitellogenesis (<xref rid="pone.0137404.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137404.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). DHP levels in males and females from the pre-spawning ground were much higher than in fish from the coastal sea. Elevated plasma DHP levels are a strong indicator of final maturation, suggesting that both males and females at the pre-spawning ground were more advanced reproductively than coastal sea fish and had initiated the final maturation process (<xref rid="pone.0137404.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). This is also reflected by an increased condition factor.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>The pituitary: regulation of final maturation and feedback by plasma steroids</title><p>The higher <italic>lh&#x003b2;</italic> expression in the pituitaries of fish from the pre-spawning ground vs. those from the coastal sea (<xref rid="pone.0137404.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>) fits well with the progression of gametogenesis towards final maturation. LH is required to initiate the processes of final maturation and ovulation in salmonid fish [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

Primers were designed against an <italic>O</italic>. <italic>keta</italic> genomic sequence that showed high similarity with <italic>O</italic>. <italic>masou</italic> mRNA for sGnRH precursor and several other salmonid GnRH sequences. We can confirm that this <italic>O</italic>. <italic>keta</italic> genomic sequence is chum salmon sGnRH because it is identical to the sGnRH sequence for chum salmon that was published by Kim et al. [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>](Genbank JX183101). sGnRH is localized to the olfactory bulb-terminal nerve as well as to the POA [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and, due to the way the dissection of the brain was performed in this study, <italic>sgnrh</italic> expression can be expected in both the forebrain (including the olfactory bulb and the telencephalon) and the post brain (including the POA) samples. In earlier studies by Yamada et al. [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and by Makino et al. [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], sGnRH levels first showed a peak in the olfactory bulb from the coastal sea to the mouth of Ishikari River and then in the telencephalon at the branch point between the Ishikari River and the Chitose River that leads to the spawning grounds (reviewed by Hayashida et al. [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]). In this study, chum <italic>sgnrh</italic> expression was detected in forebrain and post brain of fish that had already migrated further upstream the Chitose River to the pre-spawning ground (<xref rid="pone.0137404.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). In these fish we found that the expression of <italic>sgnrh</italic> was significantly up-regulated in the post brain (<xref rid="pone.0137404.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>), thus in the POA, which would support sGnRH signalling from forebrain to post brain, from the olfactory bulb to telencephalon and, subsequently, to the POA. As the functional relation would imply, chum <italic>sgnrh</italic> was likely positively correlated with LH production in this study, specifically supported by the positive correlation between <italic>sgnrh</italic> expression in the post brain and <italic>lh&#x003b2;</italic> expression in the pituitary (Table C in <xref rid="pone.0137404.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>The olfactory transcriptome: receiving and transmitting olfactory signals from the spawning grounds</title><p>Our study is aimed at investigating the olfactory transcriptome in relation to homing migration in fish, as recently performed for the Japanese Grenadier Anchovy (<italic>Coilia nasus</italic>; [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]) and European eel (<italic>Anguilla anguilla</italic>; [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]), but ours is the first study aimed at salmonid homing. Deep RNA sequencing revealed the expression of 75 known and 27 unknown salmonid genes that have relation to olfaction. Three super-families of fish olfactory receptors exist: the vomeronasal receptor-like genes V2R-like expressed by <italic>olfc</italic> genes and V1R-like expressed by <italic>ora</italic> genes, and the main olfactory receptors expressed by <italic>mOR</italic> genes [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In the present study, all three superfamilies were represented among the expressed genes. Thirteen olfactory genes were differentially expressed between chum salmon from the pre-spawning ground vs. those from the coastal sea site (<xref rid="pone.0137404.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) suggesting an important role of these genes in homing. The significantly up-regulated olfactory genes were all <italic>mOR</italic> genes (strategy 1: <italic>Salmo salar</italic> NCBI sequences) expressing the main olfactory receptors, an olfactory marker protein and an odorant receptor. The significantly down-regulated genes were a V2R-like expressed by <italic>olfc</italic> and a novel salmonid olfactory receptor. In addition to the receptors, three potential signalling molecules were expressed in the olfactory rosettes: <italic>ependymin</italic>, <italic>olfactomedins</italic> and <italic>sgnrh</italic>. Ependymin is a myelin-associated and hormonally-induced glycoprotein involved in learning and consolidation of long-term memory [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In this study, ependymin expression was up-regulated at fc 3 in the homing salmons suggesting an important role in the olfactory memory. Thereby ependymin is hypothesized to be involved in the retrieval of olfactory imprinting memory, once retained as juvenile migrating downstream from their natal stream to the ocean. Also in fall- and spring-run Chinook salmon, ependymin exhibited much higher expression levels than in an individual from the ocean [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Recently, ependymin (in this case the ependymin II precursor) was shown to play an important role as neural mediator in the olfactory processing of sex pheromones in the telencephalon of goldfish [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Ependymin and sGnRH expression were increased after PGF2&#x003b1; exposure implying a similar functional relationship between olfactory reception and sexual maturation as in homing salmon. Although ependymin may certainly signal from olfactory sensing of the spawning ground to the reproductive axis, Churcher et al. [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] reported on an increase in the levels of mammalian ependymin-related protein (MERP) in the brains of experimentally matured male eels showing that changes could be secondary to hormonal changes during sexual maturation.</p><p>Most <italic>olfactomedins</italic> were highly expressed in the Chum salmon olfactory rosettes. Two <italic>olfactomedins</italic>, <italic>olfm4</italic> and <italic>olf3A</italic> were differentially expressed, suggesting a potentially important role in sensing the spawning grounds during homing. Interestingly, like <italic>ependymin</italic>, most <italic>olfactomedins</italic> are expressed in neural tissues and they may serve as receptors and as modulators of signalling pathways [<xref rid="pone.0137404.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. As such they are certainly candidates to play an important role in conveying olfactory signals to other parts of the brain, e.g. in the pathway that functionally connects olfaction to sexual maturation through sGnRH. <italic>Olfactomedin 4</italic> (<italic>S</italic>. <italic>salar</italic> NCBI gi|224587432) and the novel salmonid gene <italic>olf3A</italic> are therefore worthwhile to investigate more thoroughly in mature homing fish, in particular in relation to the expression of sGnRH at the mRNA and protein levels</p><p>Finally, RNAseq also showed that <italic>sgnrh</italic> was hardly expressed in the olfactory rosettes implying that the olfactory cues may not be immediately linked to maturation through sGnRH but that intermediate messengers like ependymin and olfactomedins may play a role.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Conclusions and perspectives</title><p>From this study it can be concluded that at the pre-spawning ground, the olfactory reception of spawning ground specific cues in the olfactory rosettes appeared to be activated as evidenced by the up-regulated expression of eleven olfactory genes. A clear progression towards final maturation occurred in homing chum salmon from the coastal sea to 75 km upstream the rivers at the pre-spawning ground, mainly characterised by higher plasma DHP levels, higher pituitary <italic>lh&#x003b2;</italic> expression and <italic>sgnrh</italic> expression in the post brain, and lower plasma T and E2 levels. Olfactomedins and ependymin may connect olfactory reception to the expression of <italic>sgnrh</italic> in the post brain to regulate final maturation at the pre-spawning ground.</p><p>Now that these olfactory genes have been identified, their role can be thoroughly examined in larger sample sizes and with a broader geographical coverage. Also, the geographical pattern of olfactory gene expression along the migration route may then be revealed. Gained insights will invite scientists to perform molecular and behavioural studies on the functional role of specific olfactory genes. Male and female olfactory gene expression fingerprints may reveal sex-specific differences in pheromone sensing and sensing of spawning ground specific cues.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0137404.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><p><bold>Table A- Reads.</bold>; <bold>Table B- Results of de novo assembly of 12 x PE50 RNAseq datasets.</bold>; <bold>Table C- Bivariate Pearson correlations.</bold> Given are the measured parameters and the Pearson correlation, the significance and the number (N) of individuals for which values were available to perform the analysis for each of the measured parameters.
