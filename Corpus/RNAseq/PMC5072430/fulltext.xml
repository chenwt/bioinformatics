However, this assumption is currently challenged by several lines of evidence in a growing number of tumours. Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the most lethal cancers worldwide, but it continues to be a poorly understood disease and its metabolic features are far to be elucidated. In this context, we investigated the role of tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1), which is found upregulated in several cancer types and is a key modulator of tumour cell metabolism. Surprisingly, we found that TRAP1 expression inversely correlated with grade, stage and lower survival in a large cohort of OC patients. Accordingly, TRAP1 silencing induced resistance to cisplatin, resistant cells showed increased oxidative metabolism compared with their sensitive counterpart, and the bioenergetics cellular index of higher grade tumours indicated increased mitochondrial respiration. Strikingly, cisplatin resistance was reversible upon pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation by metformin/oligomycin. At molecular level, increased oxidative metabolism in low TRAP1-expressing OC cells and tissues enhanced production of inflammatory mediators such as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8. Mechanistically, we identified members of the multidrug resistance complex (MDR) as key mediators of such metabolism-driven, inflammation-induced process. Indeed, treatment of OC cell lines with TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and IL6 induced a selective increase in the expression of TAP1 and multidrug resistance protein 1, whereas TAP1 silencing sensitized cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Our results unveil a novel role for TRAP1 and oxidative metabolism in cancer progression and suggest the targeting of mitochondrial bioenergetics to increase cisplatin efficacy in human OC.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The current paradigmatic view, based on the classic observations of Otto Warburg, recognizes tumour cells as defective in mitochondrial respiration and mostly relying on glycolytic metabolism. However, very recent observations provide opposite evidence showing that melanoma cells are critically dependent on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) rather than glycolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> and that respiratory function is essential for tumorigenic and metastatic potential of breast cancer and melanoma cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> Notably, it has been shown that the most aggressive ovarian cancer (OC) cell lines show a marked dependence on glutamine rather than on glucose,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> and cancer stem cells from epithelial OC (EOC) patients privilege OXPHOS and resist glucose deprivation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> suggesting that glycolysis is not the main pathway sustaining tumour growth in these systems. EOC is the fifth most common malignancy in women worldwide and, as the introduction of platinum-based chemotherapy, only modest increases in overall survival have been registered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Indeed, EOC is considered a chemo-responsive neoplasm, but, despite this, the majority of patients ultimately develop recurrent disease, with over 60&#x00025; of women eventually dying from their disease within 5 years of diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> In this context, the identification of reliable biomarkers that would allow to tailor treatment according to the patient's disease is urgently needed. Interestingly, high expression of the tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) has been often proposed as a biomarker predictive for poor outcome, among others, in colorectal,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> hepatocellular,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> non-small cell lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> and prostate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> carcinomas. Moreover, TRAP1 has been recognized as a positive regulator of expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> and activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> of the oncogene BRAF, as a factor favouring resistance to taxanes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> and anthracyclins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> in breast cancer and a regulator of cell migration and tumour metastases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> However, whether TRAP1 roles in tumour development and progression are generally oncogenic or not is still a matter of debate. Recently, it has been reported an inverse correlation between TRAP1 expression and tumour stage in cervical, bladder and clear cell renal cell carcinoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> Among them, remarkably, cervical carcinoma relies mostly on OXPHOS for its energetic metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> This is of particular interest, because TRAP1 is an important determinant of tumour metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> and has been proposed as a pivotal driver of cancer cell's shift from OXPHOS toward aerobic glycolysis, the so-called Warburg effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> Interestingly, recent data also directly correlate TRAP1 expression and overall survival of OC patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> Altogether, these observations prompt us to raise the hypothesis that TRAP1-dependent regulation of cellular metabolism and its role in cancer development/progression could be mutually related. Herein, we demonstrate that TRAP1 expression and the consequent metabolic rewiring control platinum resistance and tumour progression through an inflammation-mediated mechanism. By addressing several open questions in human OC, this study could provide relevant knowledge for novel therapeutic approaches based on the targeting of mitochondrial bioenergetics to improve drug efficacy in tumours with increased oxidative metabolism.</p><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>TRAP1 expression associates with OC progression and survival</title><p>Preliminary analyses in a subset of OC tissues indicated that high TRAP1 expression has a positive impact on chemotherapy response and overall survival,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> oppositely to what well demonstrated in colorectal, prostate and many other cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> To shed further light on TRAP1 functions in OC, we took advantage of publicly available serous ovarian cancer cases from Tothill dataset. We used gene expression microarray data (263 samples) to perform correlation analyses between TRAP1 expression and tumour stage, grade and survival. Surprisingly, data showed that lower TRAP1 expression is associated with more advanced disease in OC samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>); more specifically, TRAP1 expression has an inverse tendency with tumour stage (<italic>N</italic>=263, <italic>P</italic>=0.0631) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), a significant inverse correlation with grade (<italic>N</italic>=260, <italic>P</italic>=0.007699) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), and it is associated with better progression-free surviree survival (PFS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) (<italic>N</italic>=255, <italic>P</italic>=0.0116), this also suggesting that higher TRAP1 expression associates with better chemotherapy response. A significant separation of PFS curve before 50 months is clinically relevant, considering that the median PFS for high grade serous OC (HGSOC) patients is 15 months. These findings confirm an intriguing role for TRAP1 in OC progression and outcome.</p><p>To further characterize TRAP1 relevance in OC biology, we used as a model two OC matched cell lines obtained from the same patient with HGSOC before and after development of clinical platinum resistance (PEA1/PEA2).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> We analyzed TRAP1 expression levels in both cell lines and, in agreement with our patients' survival analysis, we found that platinum-resistant OC PEA2 cells show lower TRAP1 expression levels than their sensitive counterpart PEA1, both at protein and mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1d and e</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Low TRAP1 expression correlates with oxidative metabolism</title><p>Data from public gene expression databases display that TRAP1 expression inversely correlates with tumour stage in cervical cancer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> that, interestingly, has been shown to prevalently rely on OXPHOS for its energy metabolism,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> whereas TRAP1 is an important driver of glycolytic metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> Therefore, we hypothesized that TRAP1 could act as a tumour suppressor in a context in which OXPHOS is the preferential pathway for ATP source. To this aim, metabolic features of OC cells were investigated by the BioEnergetic Cellular (BEC) index calculation, obtained through densitometric analysis of the ratio between F1ATPase, HSP60 and GAPDH expression levels: a higher BEC index correlates with an increased dependence on respiratory capacity. The BEC index has been exploited as prognostic value in several cancer types, including OC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> We found that the BEC index is significantly increased upon siRNA-mediated TRAP1 silencing in PEA1 and also tend to increase in PEA2 cells, indicating a bioenergetic shift toward OXPHOS, and analogous results were obtained in sh-mediated stable TRAP1 silencing in PEA1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Moreover, the same analysis indicates for PEA2 cells a BEC index value higher than their sensitive counterpart PEA1, which correlates with TRAP1 expression levels, thus suggesting a predominant oxidative metabolism in chemoresistant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) and supporting TRAP1 role in downregulation of mitochondrial activity.</p><p>To verify the relevance of TRAP1 and metabolism roles in patients, we analyzed 47 HGSOC tissue specimens for TRAP1 expression and for BEC index markers by WB. Remarkably, a positive and statistically significant correlation was found between tumour grade and BEC index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), whereas high TRAP1 protein expression correlated with better overall survival in the same patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). These data support the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of our findings in human pathology, and indicate that in more aggressive tumours TRAP1 expression decreases and BEC index increases, suggesting altogether a shift toward OXPHOS metabolism in advanced OC.</p></sec><sec><title>TRAP1 is responsible for a metabolic shift in OC cells</title><p>To further validate TRAP1 role in OC bioenergetics, we performed metabolic analyses in our paired cell lines. The extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), an indicator of glycolysis, and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) were measured using the Seahorse XFe96 Bioanalyzer (North Billerica, MA, USA). First, PEA1 and PEA2 bioenergetics was analyzed to understand whether low TRAP1 background in chemoresistant cells is correlated to a metabolic shift toward OXPHOS. ECAR analysis shows a higher glycolytic capacity (either basal or maximal) in PEA1 compared with PEA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>); furthermore, OCR value is significantly higher in PEA2 cells compared with PEA1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), thus indicating again that chemoresistant cells, with low TRAP1 levels, shifted more toward mitochondrial function for ATP production. To further support the impact of TRAP1 expression on OC cells' bioenergetics, the same Seahorse analysis was performed on PEA1 cells upon siRNA-mediated TRAP1 silencing. Results show that TRAP1 silencing does not affect glycolytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), whereas both basal and maximum OCR are significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). These results confirm our BEC index data, showing a shift toward OXPHOS in PEA1 cells upon TRAP1 silencing and in PEA2 chemoresistant cells, further supporting the previously described role of TRAP1 as a modulator of mitochondrial metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup></p><p>On the basis of these observations, we aimed at verifying whether the metabolic features related to TRAP1 expression were accompanied by a change in expression or activity of key glycolytic enzymes, namely GAPDH and PFK. We then assessed the expression levels of these proteins by WB, comparing PEA1 and PEA2 cells and TRAP1-silenced PEA1 cells. GAPDH and PFK expression levels are decreased in PEA2-resistant cells compared with PEA1-sensitive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), in keeping with impairment of glycolysis observed by Seahorse analysis in these cells. Conversely, TRAP1 silencing in PEA1 does not modify expression levels of such genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), neither affects the activity of PFK, the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, as demonstrated by colorimetric assays, whereas PFK activity is strongly decreased in PEA2 in comparison with PEA1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). These data further confirm the metabolic profile obtained by Seahorse assays, showing that TRAP1 is directly involved in the regulation of mitochondrial respiration in these cells, but not in glycolysis.</p><p>The limited dependence of PEA2 cells from glucose sources is also confirmed by viability assays. PEA1 and PEA2 cells were grown for 72&#x02009;h in a low-glucose medium, then cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. Results show that PEA2 cells are more resistant to glucose deprivation than their sensitive counterparts, thus demonstrating again their independence from glycolysis for survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>OXPHOS drives cisplatin resistance in low TRAP1 background</title><p>Once demonstrated the role of TRAP1 in OC metabolic shift, we tested the hypothesis that TRAP1 itself could be responsible for cisplatin sensitivity through this metabolic remodelling. Apoptosis was then investigated by caspase 3/7 activity assays in TRAP1-silenced PEA1 cells upon cisplatin treatment: as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, TRAP1 silencing yields cells more resistant to cisplatin-induced caspase cleavage. PEA1 sh-TRAP1 stable transfectants are also more resistant to cisplatin treatment than controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Interestingly, glucose withdrawal induces cisplatin resistance in both control and TRAP1-silenced PEA1 cells, thus suggesting that inhibition of glycolysis and metabolic shift toward OXPHOS may be responsible for the response to the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>).</p><p>We then reasoned that, if TRAP1-silenced cells are more resistant to cisplatin and more addicted to OXPHOS, the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration may sensitize these cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. To test our hypothesis, we combined cisplatin treatment with subtoxic concentrations of metformin, a well-known antidiabetic drug, which is an inhibitor of complex I of the respiratory chain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> Results show that metformin restores sensitivity to cisplatin in TRAP1-interfered PEA1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Accordingly, PEA2-resistant cells were resensitized to cisplatin treatment when coupled with metformin, as demonstrated by both viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>) and caspase activity assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Interestingly, antineoplastic effects of metformin have been recently reported in OC models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> These results were further confirmed by viability assays using, instead of metformin, the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin, which significantly potentiates the effect of Cisplatin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Conversely, we asked whether cisplatin resistance could be directly induced by increased OXPHOS activity. To this aim, PEA1 cells were treated with the uncoupler agent FCCP, which increases respiration rate without affecting ATP cellular production, alone or in combination with cisplatin and, as expected, we demonstrated that FCCP reverts cisplatin apoptotic effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5e and f</xref>), thus supporting our idea of a metabolic involvement in cisplatin resistance of OC systems. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production could reasonably lie between low TRAP1/high OXPHOS and cisplatin resistance. Indeed, ROS assays demonstrate that platinum-resistant PEA2 and TRAP1 knock-down PEA1 cells contain higher ROS levels than their respective counterparts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Furthermore, both viability and apoptosis assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5g and h</xref>) show that antioxidant tretament with <italic>N</italic>-acetyl cysteine (NAC) sensitizes PEA1 and PEA2 cells, as well as TRAP1 knock-down PEA1 cells and control, to cisplatin-induced cell death. Altogether, these data reinforce the hypothesis that TRAP1 is involved in cisplatin sensitivity through metabolic remodelling in OC cells.</p></sec><sec><title>TRAP1-mediated metabolic shift elicits inflammatory response</title><p>As demonstrated by apoptosis and cell viability assays, inhibition of glycolysis by glucose deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) and OXPHOS stimulation by FCCP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5e and f</xref>) are <italic>per se</italic> able to induce cisplatin resistance in PEA1-sensitive cells. These results prompted us to search for the molecules directly responsible for the modulation of cisplatin function in these conditions. To this aim, we cultured PEA1 cells for 6&#x02009;h in the absence of glucose, and then performed a whole-genome gene expression analysis as described in Materials and Methods section, by comparing glucose deprived to control cells. This approach led to the identification of a set of 2158 (1072 upregulated and 1086 downregulated) regulated genes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref> for the full list of differentially regulated genes). The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software allowed us to identify, among the five most relevant regulated biofunctions, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor signalling and the glucocorticoid receptor signalling, two pathways involved in cellular immune response and inflammatory activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Interestingly, previous literature reports that OC is characterized by an autocrine production of interleukins (ILs) and cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> and recent studies associate metabolic reprogramming to IL signalling,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> which has been recently involved in cisplatin resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> Starting from these observations, we selected the 11 most regulated genes in these two pathways according to Ingenuity software (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) for qPCR validation upon glucose deprivation, TRAP1 silencing and treatment with FCCP, an inducer of mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Among the selected genes, qPCR analysis confirmed <italic>CSF2</italic>, <italic>HSPA1A</italic>, <italic>IL6</italic> and <italic>SGK1</italic> as significantly regulated upon a short-term (6&#x02009;h) glucose deprivation; TRAP1 silencing yielded analogous regulation of <italic>CSF2</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic>, and also resulted in significant regulation of <italic>IL8</italic> and <italic>PLAU</italic>; similarly, FCCP treatment modulated the expression of <italic>CSF2</italic>, <italic>IL6</italic> and <italic>PLAU</italic> in the same direction as glucose deprivation and TRAP1 silencing. Interestingly, regulation of <italic>CSF2</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic> was common to all treatments, thus suggesting a significant involvement of such genes in the observed phenomena. To further support these data, we analyzed the correlations between the genes validated in the gene expression analysis and TRAP1 levels by bioinformatic analysis of OC tissue database (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Tables S3 and S4</xref> for the full list of genes/proteins and their correlation coefficient with TRAP1).

Notably, PLAU and TRAP1 have also been reported to oppositely respond to anti-oestrogen-based therapy, with PLAU being downregulated by oestrogen, in contrast to the upregulation of TRAP1,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> which bears an oestrogen-responsive element in its promoter region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> These findings strongly suggest that inhibition of glycolysis and increased oxidative metabolism in PEA1 cells stimulate the production of proinflammatory molecules, which may be responsible for cisplatin resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Metabolism-driven inflammation induces platinum resistance</title><p>We hypothesized that the relevance of TRAP1-related signature in the onset of OC platinum resistance may be due to its peculiar ability to produce, in response to increased OXPHOS, proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL6 and IL8, which are usually secreted by immune cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> To investigate this hypothesis, we performed a pathway analysis on the microarray profile of matched cell lines PEA1/PEA2, PEO1/PEO4/PEO6, PEO14/PEO23.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> Results showed that the inflammatory pathway and the activation of IL signalling are the most significant differentially regulated pathways between resistant/sensitive cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>).</p><p>As <italic>IL6</italic>, among all interleukins, resulted upregulated in all our tested conditions (glucose deprivation, FCCP treatment, TRAP1 silencing), and inversely correlated to TRAP1 in human OC samples, we tested whether treatment with human recombinant IL6 was sufficient to induce resistance to cisplatin in sensitive cells. To this aim, PEA1 cells were treated with 200&#x02009;U/ml IL6 4&#x02009;h before cisplatin addition (20&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M) for further 24&#x02009;h. Results showed that indeed PEA1 cells became more resistant to drug treatment, as demonstrated by reduced apoptosis sensitivity upon IL6 pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). To characterize at a molecular level the mechanisms/factors responsible for this phenomenon, we started from the recent whole-genome characterization of chemoresistant OC,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> showing that acquired resistance associated with overexpression of the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1). Therefore, we focused on two members of this family: <italic>ABCB1</italic>/<italic>MDR1</italic>, an ATP-dependent efflux transporter, whose involvement in tumour drug resistance has been widely reported,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> and <italic>ABCB2</italic>/<italic>TAP1</italic>, which enhances pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma drug resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> and, notably, resulted upregulated in all sets of PEA2/PEO4/PEO23 resistant cells in comparison with their matched sensitive counterparts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> To this aim, we analyzed <italic>MDR1</italic> and <italic>TAP1</italic> levels by qPCR in PEA1 cells upon TRAP1 silencing and upon treatment with two different proinflammatory inducers, namely TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and IL6. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>, both <italic>TAP1</italic> and <italic>MDR1</italic> were upregulated by TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>/IL6 exposure, and a significant induction of <italic>TAP1</italic> is observed upon TRAP1 silencing, thus supporting the role of TRAP1/MDR1-TAP1 pathway in our study model. Accordingly, siRNA-mediated TAP1 silencing yielded an increased sensitivity to cisplatin-induced apoptosis in PEA1 cells and slightly but significantly restored sensitivity to cisplatin in PEA2 cisplatin-resistant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure7d</xref>). Mechanistically, all these findings allowed us to identify ATP transporters as possible key proteins involved/responsible for platinum resistance in these OC cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>HGSOC is the most malignant form of OC and accounts for up to 70&#x00025; of all OC cases. Currently, survival rates of patients with OC remain poor and OC continues to be a poorly understood disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> Indeed, OC experimental models are mostly unable to recapitulate the human disease, raising debate about the need for better systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> Therefore, we started from a set of HGSOC tissue specimens and confirmed our data at molecular level taking advantage of multiple set of matched HGSOC cell lines (PEA1/PEA2, PEO1/PEO4/PEO6, PEO16/PEO23), derived from the same patient before (PEA1, PEO1, PEO16) and after (PEA2, PEO4, PEO6, PEO23) the development of platinum resistance. Moreover, we have repeatedly matched the obtained results with a large database of HGSOC biopsies by analyzing the correlation between expression data in RNA/protein arrays and metabolic and clinical data of patients, also further confirming all the findings in 47 HGSOC tissue specimens. As a result, we found that lower levels of the molecular chaperone TRAP1 are associated with advanced disease and poor survival in HGSOC. This is surprising on the basis of the present literature, presenting TRAP1 as a component of the HSP90 mitochondrial survival pathway with antioxidant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> and antiapoptotic functions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> and a very promising prospective target for novel cancer therapeutics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> Recent advances in TRAP1 biology have shown that it functions as a network hub protein, involved in most cellular processes responsible for the rewiring of tumour metabolism, including the regulation of protein synthesis and degradation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> endoplasmic reticulum stress protection of cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> and the regulation of mitochondrial physiology and cancer cell metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> This apparent contradiction is unravelled by the observation that higher oxidative metabolism correlated with higher tumour grade in OC, and that cisplatin-resistant OC cells showed lower TRAP1 levels and increased OXPHOS and ROS levels. Accordingly, TRAP1 silencing in cisplatin-sensitive cells increased OCR/ROS, induced cisplatin resistance and, strikingly, this phenotype was reversible upon pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial OXPHOS or ROS scavenging. For decades, decreased capacity for OXPHOS because of dysfunctional mitochondria and increased glycolysis have been considered as dominant in neoplastic cells; however, very recent observations challenge this view in a growing number of tumour systems, especially melanoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref></sup> Remarkably, recent data suggested that OC could be included in the list, showing that the most aggressive OC cell lines mostly depend on glutamine rather than on glucose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> and cancer stem cells from EOC patients privilege OXPHOS and resist glucose deprivation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> Intriguingly, the first inverse correlations between TRAP1 and tumour stage was reported in bladder, clear cell renal cell and cervical carcinoma,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> with the latter mostly relying on OXPHOS for its energetic metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> In agreement, previous data correlated TRAP1 expression with favourable chemotherapy response and overall survival in a subset of ER<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-positive OC patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup></p><p>Our results show that the strict correlation between low TRAP1 expression and oxidative metabolism in OC cells is responsible for progression of disease and response to platinum-based therapy, through the activation of an inflammatory programme. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL6, are usually secreted by immune cells, but their expression has been documented in osteosarcomas,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> OC cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> Some interesting observations show that elevated levels of IL6 in the sera and ascites of OC patients predict poor clinical outcome,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> IL8 and IL8 receptor have been proposed as potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup> and have a role in platinum response in HGSOC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> However, to our knowledge, no connection has ever been demonstrated between inflammation, metabolism and drug resistance. In this regard, a very recent work shows that loss of p62 (a NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B regulator) in stromal fibroblasts of prostate cancer promoted tumour progression through a regulation of cellular redox, resulting in increased IL6 production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> A model for the OXPHOS-mediated activation of survival pathways in the establishment of platinum resistance in OC is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Mechanistically, we identified MDR subfamily members (TAP1 and MDR1) as key mediators of such metabolism-driven, inflammation-induced drug resistance. Consistently, according to a recent whole-genome characterization of chemoresistant OC,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> acquired resistance associated with overexpression of the drug efflux pump MDR1. It has been proposed that platinum-resistant HGSOC clones may arise from low-abundance subset of cells within the sensitive tumour through a selection process, rather than through adaptation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup> Metabolic characterization of similar sub-populations of tumorigenic and multidrug resistant cells in other cancer types revealed their dependency on mitochondrial respiration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref></sup> which is consistent with our data. In this regard, the antidiabetic metformin, is already under investigation for possible applications in oncology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref></sup> and has been recently reported as an effective antineoplastic agent in OC models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> In conclusion, we suggest that metabolic features of tumour cells in the peculiar environment of OC can predict cisplatin sensitivity and that TRAP1, bioenergetic index and proinflammatory molecules can serve as predictive/prognostic biomarkers of therapeutic outcome. In this context, we propose the targeting of OXPHOS to improve cisplatin efficacy in tumours with increased oxidative metabolism.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell cultures</title><p>The paired HGSOC cell lines PEA1 and PEA2 have been described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Cell line verification was by Identifiler kit (Applied Biosystems-Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
