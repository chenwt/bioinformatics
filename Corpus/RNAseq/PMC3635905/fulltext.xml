In plants developing seed tissue is the major source of starch, protein, and oils utilized by humans for food, industrial feedstocks or fuel. Therefore accurate analysis of developing seed metabolism is required to understand how these valuable commodities are produced in plants. In the model plant species <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, seeds develop in a non-fleshy fruit tissue known as a silique. The silique tissue has different metabolism and gene expression profiles from the enclosed developing seeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and the silique walls contain more tissue on a fresh weight basis than the developing seeds throughout most of silique/seed development. Therefore, to accurately analyze developing seed gene expression or low concentration metabolic intermediates (such as acyl-CoAs) the developing seeds must be removed from the silique. The very small size of developing Arabidopsis siliques and enclosed seeds (&#x0003e;0.5&#x000a0;mm, &#x0003e;20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g fresh weight per seed) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] makes rapid collection of adequate amounts of tissue for gene expression or metabolite analysis very difficult. Dissecting Arabidopsis seeds from siliques can take 1-3&#x000a0;min per silique, depending on the skill of the experimentalist. Therefore, collection of large amounts of developing seed tissue can be very time consuming. Here we present a method that allows efficient separation of the frozen and metabolically quenched seeds from silique tissue <italic>after</italic> rapidly flash freezing the siliques in liquid nitrogen. Seeds from many siliques may be collected at the same time greatly reducing the time required to collect large amounts of developing seed tissue.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>The time required to collect all the seeds from 50 developing Arabidopsis siliques by individual silique dissection was approximately 1-2&#x000a0;hrs per person in our hands (~6 individuals, 4 separate attempts). However, our new silique popping method (summarized in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) allowed us rapidly collect developing seeds from 50 siliques in less than 10&#x000a0;minutes. The silique popping method takes advantage of the fact that developing Arabidopsis siliques soaked in liquid nitrogen will rapidly pop open (like popcorn) when removed from the liquid nitrogen (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The popping efficiently separates the seeds from the silique walls. We believe the popping is caused by liquid nitrogen that soaks into the silique and then rapidly expands to a gas creating the pressure to pop open the silique when the silique temperature is raised above that of the liquid nitrogen. By quickly transferring the siliques from the liquid nitrogen bath to a closed container on dry ice the siliques can be efficiently popped open while seed and silique tissue stays frozen. Subsequent filtering of the popped open siliques through a sieve and funnel that has been chilled with liquid nitrogen into a tube on dry ice allows the seeds to be rapidly separated from the silique tissue while remaining frozen (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This silique popping method allows the rapid collection of large amounts of developing seed tissue suitable for downstream applications such as RNA extraction. Popping open of ~190 siliques aged 9-10&#x000a0;days after flowering yielded ~0.8&#x000a0;ml of frozen developing seeds. Three ~0.1-0.2&#x000a0;ml aliquots of developing seed produced 27-38&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of total RNA each. Our laboratory has successfully utilized this silique popping method to collect sufficient developing seed tissue for gene expression analysis or analysis of very small metabolite pools, such as acyl-CoA, which accumulate at less than 3 pmol/mg fresh weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Summarized flow chart of silique popping and seed collection.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1746-4811-9-9-1"/></fig><p>To test the suitability of seeds collected by the silique popping method for downstream applications such as gene expression analysis, we compared RNA quantity, quality and gene expression between developing seeds collected by dissection or by the silique popping method. Ten developing siliques aged to 9-10&#x000a0;days after flowering were dissected directly into 1.5&#x000a0;ml tubes on dry ice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Total RNA extracted from six replicate samples (each containing 10 dissected siliques) averaged 14.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g each. However, when 50 siliques were popped open together and split into six replicates a higher yield of 22.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g RNA was obtained. This higher yield may be due to more seeds in each replicate from a more complete removal of seeds from each silique by the popping method. RNA extracted from frozen seeds collected by the silique popping method was of a consistently high quality suitable for large scale gene expression analysis by RNAseq (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Additionally, expression of Arabidopsis genes known to be up-regulated by the handling or touching of plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] had low experimental variability within the samples extracted from seeds collected by the popping method (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of RNA extracted from dissected and popped siliques.</bold> The RNA Integrity Number (RIN) is a measure of RNA degradation to estimate RNA quality for gene expression analysis as measured by an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer.

Put sieve into funnel and dip both into liquid nitrogen together with large forceps (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D) until the liquid nitrogen stops bubbling rigorously (~20-30&#x000a0;seconds).</p><p>c. <italic>Immediately</italic> place the cooled sieve/funnel onto the 1.5 ml tube.</p><p>d. <italic>Immediately</italic> pour the frozen seeds/siliques from the petri plate into the sieve/funnel and tap a few times.
