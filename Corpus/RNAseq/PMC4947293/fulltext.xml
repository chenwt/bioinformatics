Recently targeted therapies have extended progression-free survival, but responses are variable and no significant overall survival benefit has been achieved. Commercial ccRCC cell lines are often used as model systems to develop novel therapeutic approaches, but these do not accurately recapitulate primary ccRCC tumors at the genomic and transcriptional levels. Furthermore, ccRCC exhibits significant intertumor genetic heterogeneity, and the limited cell lines available fail to represent this aspect of ccRCC. Our objective was to generate accurate preclinical in vitro models of ccRCC using tumor tissues from ccRCC patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>ccRCC primary single cell suspensions were cultured in fetal bovine serum (FBS)-containing media or defined serum-free media. Established cultures were characterized by genomic verification of mutations present in the primary tumors, expression of renal epithelial markers, and transcriptional profiling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The apparent efficiency of primary cell culture establishment was high in both culture conditions, but genotyping revealed that the majority of cultures contained normal, not cancer cells. ccRCC characteristically shows biallelic loss of the von Hippel Lindau (<italic>VHL</italic>) gene, leading to accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and expression of HIF target genes. Purification of cells based on expression of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9), a cell surface HIF target, followed by culture in FBS enabled establishment of ccRCC cell cultures with an efficiency of &#x0003e;80&#x000a0;%. Culture in serum-free conditions selected for growth of normal renal proximal tubule epithelial cells. Transcriptional profiling of ccRCC and matched normal cell cultures identified up- and down-regulated networks in ccRCC and comparison to The Cancer Genome Atlas confirmed the clinical validity of our cell cultures.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The ability to establish primary cultures of ccRCC cells and matched normal kidney epithelial cells from almost every patient provides a resource for future development of novel therapies and personalized medicine for ccRCC patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12885-016-2539-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Clear cell renal cell carcinoma</kwd><kwd>In vitro models</kwd><kwd>Primary cell culture</kwd><kwd>Renal cancer</kwd><kwd><italic>VHL</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004203</institution-id><institution>Ontario Institute for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001232</institution-id><institution>Royal Australasian College of Physicians</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is dominated by the clear cell subtype (ccRCC), which makes up 70&#x000a0;% of all RCC and has a poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Biallelic loss or inactivation of the von Hippel Lindau (<italic>VHL</italic>) gene via mutation, deletion or promoter methylation occurs in up to 91&#x000a0;% of sporadic ccRCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and drives a strong pro-survival and angiogenic program due to downstream hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Cancer cell lines are used extensively to characterize novel anti-cancer therapeutics, but such studies have translated poorly from preclinical studies into clinically useful drugs. Genome-wide analysis shows that ccRCC cell lines have many more copy number alterations than primary ccRCC tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and transcriptional profiles of cell lines cluster separately from primary tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition, ccRCC exhibits significant intertumor genetic heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and the limited cell lines available fail to represent this aspect of ccRCC. A lack of patient-matched normal cells further limits research due to the consequent lack of appropriate controls for experiments and drug screening efforts.</p><p>Recently researchers have developed methods for generation of primary tumor-derived cultures such as sphere-forming or adherent cells from brain tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] or 3-D organoids from colorectal cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These primary cultures are amenable to high-throughput assays and other manipulations while simultaneously representing more accurate preclinical models of the tumors from which they are derived. We describe a protocol for efficient generation of primary ccRCC and patient-matched normal kidney epithelial cell cultures from ccRCC tissue specimens, providing significant opportunities for development of personalized medicine approaches for ccRCC patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Tumor collection and processing</title><p>ccRCC samples were obtained from the University Health Network (UHN) and the Cooperative Health Tissue Network from patients providing written consent under UHN Research Ethics Board approval, protocol #09-0828-T (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). ccRCC tumor tissues were procured within 2&#x02013;24 h of excision (CHTN samples were shipped overnight from various sites in the United States).

Others have reported that normal cells out-compete malignant cells in primary cancer cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], possibly explaining the poor efficiency of cell line derivation from most solid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] where lines can often be established, but cannot be maintained. Our protocol establishes accurate <italic>VHL</italic>mut ccRCC cultures that can be passaged at least 20 times. This method will allow researchers to avoid use of extensively passaged lines of uncertain provenance, instead enabling use of early passage, clinically relevant ccRCC cultures for basic studies.</p><p>The purification of ccRCC cells expressing CA9 increased both culture accuracy and efficiency substantially for samples bearing <italic>VHL</italic> mutations. This method can be applied to any specimen yielding at least 1 million viable cells upon processing, thus one limitation is the inability to generate cultures from small specimens, such as biopsies. While not all ccRCC tumors have a detectable <italic>VHL</italic> mutation, <italic>VHL</italic> loss due to biallelic deletion or epigenetic silencing occurs in many of these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. While we have not formally tested CA9 sorting in these patients, our method is likely also applicable in these cases. Indeed, CA9 is expressed in the vast majority (94&#x000a0;%) of ccRCC patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Our results indicated that cultures established in DSFM were normal renal proximal tubule epithelial cells, the presumed cell of origin for ccRCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The outgrowth of normal epithelial cells was surprising given that these cells are not obviously present upon microscopic examination of tumor tissues, leading us to conclude that tumor tissues contain rare residual normal cells with a strong growth advantage over ccRCC cells in DSFM. These culture conditions are remarkably similar to conditions established decades ago for the culture of proximal tubule cells from normal kidneys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Interestingly, our results indicate that DSFM culture conditions that support other cancers like glioblastoma multiforme, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] do not permit ccRCC cell growth; when we transferred <italic>VHL</italic>mut cultures from FBS to DSFM they failed to proliferate, suggesting the intriguing possibility that identification of essential growth factors for ccRCC cells could reveal novel therapeutic targets. Importantly, the differential growth requirements of <italic>VHL</italic>mut ccRCC cells and <italic>VHL</italic>wt normal proximal tubule epithelial cells can be exploited to consistently generate patient-matched normal cultures for virtually every cancer culture, even in the absence of adjacent normal tissue. While these cells senesce at passage 6 to 12, this could potentially be overcome by immortalization with a human telomerase reverse transcriptase (<italic>hTERT</italic>) construct.</p><p>Primary <italic>VHL</italic>mut cultures had doubling times ranging from 44 to &#x0003e;200&#x000a0;h, in striking contrast to the 786&#x02013;0 doubling time of 16&#x000a0;h. This more accurately reflects the heterogeneity and growth kinetics observed in patients and primary xenografts. Cultures were readily established from tumors of varying stages and grades (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1) suggesting no bias for success from more aggressive cancers. Two of four cultures tested to date generate xenografts with characteristic ccRCC clear cell histology. The failure of some cultures to initiate tumors in mice may be due to an insufficient cell dose, or to the eight to ten week incubation period. In our experience patient-derived xenografts initiated directly from primary tissues require four to six months to engraft [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], thus longer incubation times may be required. This would further indicate that our primary cultures are more reflective of patients&#x02019; cancers than commercially available cell lines.</p><p>SNP array analyses indicated that, as shown by Beroukhim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], the cell lines 786&#x02013;0 and A-498 have a large number of CNAs. In our two SNP array experiments we saw a single sample, RCC99 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: Figure S1) that also had substantial CNAs, but this is not typical of ccRCC, as seen in larger-scale genomic studies such as that of Beroukhim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and the TCGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Thus while it is possible that cell lines such as 786&#x02013;0 and A-498 were derived from such samples, the more likely explanation is that many genomic alterations are acquired during long-term passage in culture. At passage 20 our <italic>VHL</italic>mut cultures contained a small number of alterations that were not apparent in their parent tumors, but they did not have the extreme aneuploidy seen in commercially available ccRCC cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This is likely related to their relatively low passage number, and in part to their maintenance in a low oxygen environment, which has been found to increase plating efficiency and lifespan of cells in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], as well as lead to less DNA damage and fewer stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The novel CNAs that were observed in <italic>VHL</italic>mut cultures compared to their matched primary tumors were concordant with common events in ccRCC such as trisomy 7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], suggesting that clones with these alterations may have been present at a subclonal level within the primary tumors, or that cultures were derived from a subclone that was not present in the portion of tumor used for DNA analysis due to regional genetic heterogeneity in ccRCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Future studies utilizing cultures derived from multiple biopsies per patient may provide valuable insights into biological differences between subclones. Alternatively, these alterations could have been acquired during passage, suggesting that despite our best efforts we did not entirely avoid the acquisition of genomic alterations during culture, and supporting the need to utilize in vitro models at early passage.</p><p>Transcriptional profiling identified differentially expressed genes between <italic>VHL</italic>mut and <italic>VHL</italic>wt cultures. Our <italic>VHL</italic>mut gene signature is highly enriched in patient ccRCC samples analyzed by the TCGA and transcriptional networks were identified that would be predicted as a consequence of <italic>VHL</italic> loss: activation of the hypoxic response and increased glycolysis due to HIF stabilization. These results support the use of our <italic>VHL</italic>mut/<italic>VHL</italic>wt paired cultures as representative models of ccRCC biology. The observed increase in genes involved in electron transport/oxidative metabolism, which has been shown to be down regulated in other transcriptional analyses of ccRCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] was initially unexpected, however, some of the genes that are present in this network are in fact involved in negative regulation of electron transport; for example, the most significant gene in that network, NDUFA4L2 (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Table S7) has been shown to be involved in lowering mitochondrial oxygen consumption and Complex I mitochondrial activity, causing a shift from mitochondrial respiration to anaerobic glycolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Other genes in the network are associated with other metabolic processes such as adipogenesis and glycogen synthesis, in line with the fat and glycogen storage phenotype that is the hallmark of &#x0201c;clear cell&#x0201d; RCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In addition, recent findings suggest that as ccRCC cell lines adapt to in vitro culture they derive more of their metabolic demands from oxidative metabolism than directly isolated ex vivo cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. We also noted a network of epigenetics-related nodes, concordant with recent findings that widespread deregulation of chromatin status occurs in ccRCC due to activation of hypoxia-related pathways, as well as mutations in epigenetic regulatory genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Our observation that many networks are down-regulated, including transcription and RNA processing, is also consistent with observations that hypoxia induces a signature of chromatin modifications and global repression of transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Additional pathways repressed in <italic>VHL</italic>mut cells include functions related to normal epithelial biology and tissue homeostasis, such as cytoskeleton organization, cell-cell interactions, extracellular matrix organization and apoptosis, whose loss likely plays a significant role in the malignant behavior of ccRCC.</p><p>Comparison of transcriptional profiles between <italic>VHL</italic>mut cells and their matched primary tumor specimens revealed &#x0003e;4000 differentially expressed genes. At first glance this suggests that the <italic>VHL</italic>mut cultures are not representative of the primary tumors from which they were derived at the transcriptional level. However, a deeper analysis of the differentially expressed genes in the tumor tissues revealed that these were related primarily to a wide range of immune functions, suggesting that the expression of these genes was lost due to the presence of large numbers of infiltrating immune cells in the tumor tissues that were not present in the cultures. Likewise, a higher expression of mitochondrial respiration-associated genes in the tumor tissue likely also reflects the presence of stromal cells within the tumor tissue that do not have <italic>VHL</italic> mutations and thus maintain normal levels of mitochondrial metabolism. Indeed, a recent study in which an algorithm was developed to estimate the fraction of stromal and immune cells in tumor samples from gene expression data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] showed that, upon analysis of gene expression data sets from ten tumor types, ccRCC contained a particularly high level of immune signature expression that correlated with the tumor cellularity as assessed by DNA analysis. The predominant network upregulated in <italic>VHL</italic>mut cultures compared to the matched primary tissues was proliferation, which is also not surprising given that the cultured cells are proliferating in response to culture conditions, whereas the proliferation index in ccRCC tumor tissues as defined by Ki67 staining is in general quite low (median 7.3&#x000a0;% in one study of 176 patients) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Thus overall, while a large number of differentially expressed genes were identified between tumor tissues and <italic>VHL</italic>mut cultures, the majority of these were related to the loss of immune cells in the cultures, and the stimulation of cell proliferation in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have exploited the unique biology of ccRCC to develop a protocol for the reproducible and accurate generation of ccRCC and patient-matched normal proximal tubule epithelial cell cultures (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Transcriptional profiles recapitulate those of primary ccRCC tissues and verify the expression of pathways known to be key components of ccRCC cell biology. The high efficiency of cell culture establishment means that large numbers of cultures can be established from individual patients, allowing studies to be performed that take into consideration the genetic diversity of patients. The ability to generate patient-matched normal cultures from every patient provides a powerful tool for exploring molecular and functional differences between normal and cancer cells and provides ideal reagents for screening for cancer-specific compounds. Our protocol thus overcomes the severe limitations imposed by use of commercial cell lines, and provides a unique resource for the development of personalized therapeutic approaches in a disease that is in great need of novel therapies.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Schematic of workflow to generate matched <italic>VHL</italic>mut and <italic>VHL</italic>wt cultures from surgically resected ccRCC samples. Tumor tissue that has been surgically resected is digested with enzymes to generate a single cell suspension, as described in the Methods. A portion of the tissue is used to extract DNA for <italic>VHL</italic> gene sequencing. The cell suspension can be viably frozen until sequencing results are obtained, if desired. An aliquot of cells is cultured in DSFM to generate a <italic>VHL</italic>wt culture. Remaining cells are stained with antibodies to CD45 and CD31 to allow exclusion of contaminating immune and endothelial cells, and the CA9+ and CA9- fractions are isolated by FACS and plated in media containing FBS. We showed that when both methods for generating a <italic>VHL</italic>wt culture were performed, the success rate increased to 90&#x000a0;% (9 out of 10 attempts; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
