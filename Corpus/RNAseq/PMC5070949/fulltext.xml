Here, we establish that complete transection of corticospinal pathways in the pyramids impairs locomotion and leads to increased spasms and excessive mono- and polysynaptic low threshold spinal reflexes in rats. Treatment of affected forelimb muscles with an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) encoding human Neurotrophin-3 at a clinically-feasible time-point after injury reduced spasticity. Neurotrophin-3 normalized the short latency Hoffmann reflex to a treated hand muscle as well as low threshold polysynaptic spinal reflexes involving afferents from other treated muscles. Neurotrophin-3 also enhanced locomotor recovery. Furthermore, the balance of inhibitory and excitatory boutons in the spinal cord and the level of an ion co-transporter in motor neuron membranes required for normal reflexes were normalized. Our findings pave the way for Neurotrophin-3 as a therapy that treats the underlying causes of spasticity and not only its symptoms.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold>

Physical rehabilitation can restore some muscle control and improve mobility in affected individuals. However, no current treatments provide long-term relief from the unwanted muscle contractions and spasms that affect as many as 78% of people with a spinal cord injury. These spasms can seriously hamper a person&#x02019;s ability to carry out day-to-day tasks and get around independently. A few treatments can help in the short term but have side effects; indeed while Botox injections are used to paralyse the muscle, these also reduce the chances of useful improvements. As such, better therapies for muscle spasms are needed; especially ones that reduce spasms in the arms.</p><p>Rats with injuries to the spinal cord between their middle to lower back typically develop spasms in their legs or tail, and rat models have helped scientists begin to understand why these involuntary movements occur. Now, Kathe et al. report that cutting one specific pathway that connects the brain to the spinal cord in anesthetised rats leads to the development of spasms in the forelimbs as well. Several months after the surgery, the rats had spontaneous muscle contractions in their forelimbs and walked abnormally. Further experiments showed that some other neural pathways in the rats became incorrectly wired and hyperactive and that this resulted in the abnormal movements.</p><p>Next, Kathe et al. asked whether using gene therapy to deliver a protein that is required for neural circuits to form between muscles and the spinal cord (called neurotrophin-3) would stop the involuntary movements in the forelimbs. Delivering the gene therapy directly into the forelimb muscles of the disabled rats a day after their injury increased the levels of neurotrophin-3 in these muscles. Rats that received this treatment had fewer spasms and walked better than those that did not. Further experiments confirmed that this was because the rats&#x02019; previously hyperactive and abnormally wired neural circuits became more normal after the treatment.</p><p>Together these results suggest that neurotrophin-3 might be a useful treatment for muscle spasms in people with spinal injury. There have already been preliminary studies in people showing that treatment with neurotrophin-3 is safe and well tolerated. Future studies are needed to confirm that it could be useful in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold>

Spasticity is defined as a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes with exaggerated tendon jerks, resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex, and intermittent or sustained involuntary activation of muscles (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Pandyan et al., 2005</xref>). Current treatments like tizanidine, botulinum toxin and baclofen are only symptomatic, transiently effective and have varying side effects (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adams and Hicks, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Thibaut et al., 2013</xref>). These symptomatic treatments, which aim at exaggerated reflexes and muscle tone, rarely improve other functional disabilities associated with upper motor neuron lesions such as overground locomotion (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Dietz and Sinkjaer, 2007</xref>). There has been progress in understanding the potential underlying causes of spasticity. However, it remains challenging to model spastic behaviours in rodents. Models are needed to identify new candidate therapies for spasticity. Upper arm spasticity after spinal cord injury and stroke often persists and hampers rehabilitation and effective new therapies are badly needed (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Dietz and Fouad, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adams and Hicks, 2005</xref>).</p><p>To date, spastic behaviours that have been examined in rat models include tail spasms and clonus (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bennett et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) and spontaneous hindlimb and tail spasms during swimming (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Gonzenbach et al., 2010</xref>). One main goal of our study was to model a variety of signs of forelimb spasticity in awake, freely moving rats. These signs include clonus (repeated muscle jerks), prolonged spasms, twitches (fast involuntary contractions) and hyperreflexia, which reflect all symptoms associated with human spasticity after upper motor neuron lesions.</p><p>We sought to understand the mechanisms underlying these functional sensorimotor abnormalities. Sensory inputs from muscles spindles to the spinal cord play a major role in regulating spinal motor circuitry organization and output, especially after CNS injury (<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Takeoka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Akay et al., 2014</xref>). Group I and II proprioceptive afferents innervating muscle spindles project via the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) into the spinal cord to synapse onto motor neurons or interneurons whilst Ib afferents from Golgi tendon organs form synapses on interneurons only (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Eccles et al., 1957</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Dietz, 2002</xref>). The spinal circuitry integrating these sensory signals has a highly specific patterning in order to produce complex muscle activation synergies (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Kiehn, 2016</xref>). Proprioceptive neurons provide positive feedback about muscle contractions, which adjusts movements to environmental factors and controls reflex responses via monosynaptic and polysynaptic spinal pathways (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Dietz, 2002</xref>).</p><p>After traumatic brain or spinal cord injury, the circuits below the lesion site lose some supraspinal input, but they can reorganize and adapt. This reorganization can involve maladaptation causing functional abnormalities such as spasticity. Proposed mechanisms of spasticity include increased activity and connectivity between proprioceptive Ia muscle afferents and motor neurons, reduced presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents by spinal interneurons (<xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Toda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Kakinohana et al., 2012</xref>), reduced autogenic inhibition from Golgi tendon organs (via Ib afferents and inhibitory interneurons), reduced reciprocal inhibition by Ia afferents from antagonist muscles and modified excitation and inhibition from muscle spindle group II afferents reviewed in [<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Dietz, 2002</xref>]) as well as intrinsic changes in motor neurons such as altered ion channels, serotonergic receptors and transporter concentrations in the membranes (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Boulenguez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Murray et al., 2011</xref>) and an increase in persistent inward currents in motor neurons (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Hultborn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Boulenguez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bennett et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">ElBasiouny et al., 2010</xref>) which together cause an increase in motor neuron excitability.</p><p>Peripherally derived Neurotrophin-3, a nerve growth factor, is required for survival of large diameter sensory neurons and motor neurons (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Ernfors et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">Woolley et al., 2005</xref>) and for correct patterning of central proprioceptive afferents during development (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2003</xref>). Neurotrophin-3 can&#x000a0;also reduce motor neuron excitability (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Petruska et al., 2010</xref>). For these reasons, we elected to evaluate Neurotrophin-3 as a novel therapy for forelimb spasticity in adult rats after upper motor neuron lesions.</p><p>After ensuring the survival and patterning of sensory and motor circuitry during development, Neurotrophin-3 levels drop in the muscle (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Murase et al., 1994</xref>). Interestingly, Neurotrophin-3 levels are again increased after exercise (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">G&#x000f3;mez-Pinilla et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Ying et al., 2003</xref>), such as after rehabilitative training post-stroke or spinal cord injury (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Hutchinson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">C&#x000f4;t&#x000e9; et al., 2011</xref>). Rehabilitative training which is based on the principle that coordinated afferent input and motor output improves functional recovery (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Frigon and Rossignol, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Rossignol et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2006</xref>) also normalises proprioceptive reflexes in spinal cord injury models (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">C&#x000f4;t&#x000e9; et al., 2011</xref>). Input from muscle afferents is important for maintaining normal locomotion in adult mice (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Akay et al., 2014</xref>) and for the reorganization of supraspinal pathways after spinal cord injury (because genetic deletion of muscle spindles leads to poorer outcomes [<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Takeoka et al., 2014</xref>]). Neurotrophin-3 is synthesized by muscle spindles in the periphery (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Copray and Brouwer, 1994</xref>). Therefore, Neurotrophin-3 may serve as a muscle-derived signal that enhances functional recovery and neuroplasticity after spinal cord injury and peripheral supplementation of Neurotrophin-3 might enhance recovery.</p><p>Recent studies from our group show that peripherally administered Neurotrophin-3 can remodel spared corticospinal tract connections and promote sensorimotor recovery in adult and elderly rats after stroke (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Duricki et al., 2016</xref>). Peripheral treatment with recombinant Neurotrophin-3 has already been tested in Phase I and II clinical trials and was found to be safe and well-tolerated (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Parkman&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhry et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Coulie et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Sahenk, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Sahenk et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, Neurotrophin-3 also improved sensory and reflex function in patients with Charcot Marie Tooth 1A disease, a large diameter fiber sensorimotor neuropathy (<xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Sahenk et al., 2005</xref>). Taken together, Neurotrophin-3 organizes supraspinal motor tracts and improves sensory function, but whether spinal sensorimotor circuitry and reflex changes can be regulated by Neurotrophin-3 in neuromotor disorders has not been demonstrated yet.</p><p>Here, we established a novel rodent model of spasticity which displays many aspects of functional spasticity observed in humans. The model involves bilateral corticospinal tract lesioning in the pyramids, which was sufficient to elicit changes in the connectivity of proprioceptive afferents to motor neurons resulting in signs of spasticity including hyperreflexia of mono- and polysynaptic reflexes. Intramuscular overexpression of Neurotrophin-3 normalized several spinal reflexes. Analysis of neurophysiological properties of the spinal circuitry and of molecular markers revealed that Neurotrophin-3 acts as a regulator of afferent input connectivity to spinal motor circuitry and as a regulator of motor neuron excitability. Taken together, our study established that proprioceptive afferent input strength and connectivity to the spinal cord changes after supraspinal injury, which affected motor output resulting in signs of spasticity and reduced functional recovery. Overexpression of Neurotrophin-3 in the muscles regulated afferent input specificity and re-balanced excitatory and inhibitory networks in the spinal cord improving functional and neurophysiological outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rats developed spasticity after bilateral pyramidotomy</title><p>To establish a rodent model of spasticity of the forelimb, we performed a bilateral transection of the pyramids in the brainstem (bPYX) of anesthetized rats, which interrupts the corticospinal tracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A&#x02013;C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2&#x02014;figure supplement 1</xref>).

In the first part of this paper, we describe the forelimb spasticity, other behavioural deficits and changes in spinal reflexes that were observed in rats with bilateral pyramidotomies (and treated with AAV-GFP) compared to uninjured na&#x000ef;ve rats. In the second part, we describe how Neurotrophin-3 treatment reduced spasticity, and normalised reflexes, which was accompanied by anatomical changes and behavioural recovery.</p><p>Behaviourally, rats with bilateral pyramidotomy developed spasticity in their forelimbs within two weeks of injury (Compare <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> which shows an uninjured na&#x000ef;ve rat which exhibited no spasticity with <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">3</xref>). The joint movements of the forelimb appeared rigid and the trajectories of the limb were often changed during the swing phase. Rats had narrow stepping with frequently crossed placement of their forepaws. During the loading response of the stance phase we observed vertical oscillatory-like movements, which resulted in bounce-like stepping. Rats displayed spontaneous abnormal prolonged muscle contractions (spasms), and single or repeated muscle jerks (twitch and clonus respectively) with their forelimbs. We observed that spontaneously occurring spasms were more prevalent in forelimb pro-gravity (limb flexor) muscles than anti-gravity (limb extensor) muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Their hindlimbs and tail also displayed signs of spasticity (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). During the swing phase, rats with bilateral pyramidotomies lifted their hindlimbs higher than uninjured rats, which may indicate increased hip pro-gravity (flexor) muscle activity. Based on our observations, we developed a novel open-field scoring system for rats, which measures spasticity and disordered sensorimotor control of the forelimbs during locomotion and spasticity-associated reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 2</xref>; compare <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> with <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Using this scoring system we show that spasticity developed by two weeks and was sustained up until the end of the testing period at 10 weeks after bilateral pyramidotomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).<fig id="media1" position="anchor"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Open-field movements shown by an uninjured na&#x000ef;ve rat (Supplementary to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and Experimental Procedures).</title><p>Rats are placed in a 50 cm diameter Plexiglas cylinder and videotaped for 3 min every fortnight. See Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 2</xref> for scoring system. During swing, forepaw digits are extended. Joint movements in the forelimb are smooth and linear. Forepaws are placed slightly medial to the shoulders and the loading response in stance phase is normal, i.e. stance initiated with a single placing movement with immediate weight bearing. When rearing without wall contact, the rats regulate their balance fully through the hind-paws and tail; distal forelimbs are held parallel to the floor. During swing, hindpaws are not raised above the lowest point of the belly. Tail twitches are not seen.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold>

Movements of the wrist, elbow and shoulder are corrective (swing trajectory is non-linear) and rigid during swing phase. Stance is narrower compared to controls, with forepaws aligning rostrocaudally or with forepaws crossing over. Furthermore, during the loading response of the stance phase, the forepaw makes multiple contacts as weight bearing starts (muscle jerks causing a 'dampened bounce'). Rats display 'associated reactions', such as single muscle jerks, prolonged muscle contractions and repeated muscle jerks.

An early M-wave is evoked by motor axon excitation and a later H-wave is evoked by excitation of Ia afferents synapsing onto motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 3B</xref>). The H-wave was often evoked at lower stimulation intensities than the M-wave, consistent with work by others (<xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2012</xref>). To confirm that the putative H-wave is dependent on sensory afferent stimulation, in three uninjured na&#x000ef;ve rat we cut six ipsilateral cervical dorsal roots, which abolished the H-wave and did not affect the M-wave (data not shown). <italic>n.b.</italic>, F-waves are evoked in the rat only at high stimulation intensities and have very low amplitudes (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Meinck, 1976</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Gozariu et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>The forelimb H-reflex paradigm allowed us to record the H-wave from the same rats prior to injury and then at multiple times after injury. In uninjured na&#x000ef;ve rats, when two stimuli were delivered to the ulnar nerve in close succession (for example using an inter-stimulus interval of 0.5 s) then the second H wave (coloured red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 3B</xref>) was smaller than the first H wave (coloured grey in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 3B</xref>), which is known as frequency-dependent-depression. In uninjured rats, the second H-wave was depressed at inter-stimulus-intervals of 5 s and less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 3B</xref>). One day after bilateral corticospinal tract injury, the H-wave depression was comparable to before injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 3D</xref>). However, at two weeks after bilateral pyramidotomy, the H-wave was less depressed at intervals less than 5 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 3C</xref>). The attenuation of H-wave depression at short inter-stimulus intervals lasted at least up to 10 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 3E</xref>), which suggests there were long lasting changes in synaptic transmission.

Ten weeks after bilateral corticospinal tract injury, rats were terminally anesthetized and the ulnar, median and radial nerves were exposed on the treated side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>) as described previously (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Bosch et al., 2012</xref>). We studied three different reflexes:</p><p>Firstly, we recorded from the ulnar nerve whilst stimulating the median nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>). Both carry afferents from and innervate synergist forelimb flexor muscles which received AAV injections (magenta muscles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). Low intensity and low frequency stimulation activates large diameter neurons that include group Ia, Ib and II muscle afferents and group I range skin afferents but not high threshold ones such as nociceptive C fibers (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Brock et al., 1951</xref>; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Nakatsuka et al., 2000</xref>). Low intensity, low frequency stimulation of the median nerve evoked polysynaptic compound action potentials in the ulnar nerve in uninjured na&#x000ef;ve rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref>). They were increased 10 weeks after bilateral corticospinal tract injury indicating a hyper-excitability of polysynaptic spinal reflexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P,Q</xref>).</p><p>Next, we recorded from the ulnar nerve whilst stimulating its antagonistic radial nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1R</xref>). Low intensity and low frequency radial nerve stimulation evoked only very few to no polysynaptic compound action potentials in the antagonistic ulnar nerve in uninjured na&#x000ef;ve rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1S</xref>). Ten weeks after bilateral pyramidotomy, polysynaptic compound action potentials were increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1T,U</xref>) indicating loss of specificity in afferent connectivity (Figure 6). This gain of aberrant connectivity may cause increased abnormal co-contraction of antagonists. In summary, after bilateral pyramidotomy, stimulation of agonist (median) nerves revealed exaggerated spinal reflexes in the ulnar nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M&#x02013;Q</xref>) whilst stimulation of the homonymous (ulnar) nerve revealed exaggerated spinal reflexes to a hand flexor muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J&#x02013;L</xref>). These findings demonstrate spinal motor circuits of pro-gravity limb flexor muscle groups were hyper-excitable after injury, which is supported by our behavioural observation that flexor muscles were more likely to be affected by spasms compared to extensors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, we recorded from the radial nerve while stimulating the ulnar nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 4A</xref>). Low intensity and low frequency ulnar nerve stimulation rarely evoked polysynaptic compound action potentials in the antagonistic radial nerve in uninjured na&#x000ef;ve rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 4B</xref>) and in rats with bilateral pyramidotomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 4C,D</xref>). Thus, we did not observe any or increased reflex activity in the extensor radial nerve after antagonist (ulnar) stimulation after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 4</xref>). Consistent with this, we seldom observed spasms in forelimb extensor muscles in freely moving rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Taken together, bilateral pyramidotomy led to increased reflexes and muscle spasms primarily involving flexor muscles.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Intramuscular injection of AAV1-Neurotrophin-3 increased levels of Neurotrophin-3 protein in treated flexor muscles, ipsilateral cervical DRG and ipsilateral spinal cord neurons</title><p>Twenty four hours after bilateral pyramidotomy, rats were randomized to treatment with AAV1 encoding either human Neurotrophin-3 or GFP, which was injected into many forelimb flexor muscles (listed in Methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

RNA from homogenates of cervical DRGs were subjected to qRTPCR using primers that distinguish human Neurotrophin-3 mRNA (i.e., transgene specific) from rat Neurotrophin-3 mRNA (i.e., endogenous). Samples from AAV-NT3 and AAV-GFP groups had C<sub>T</sub> values &#x02265;35, comparable to the No Template Control (water). In other words, we did not detect human Neurotrophin-3 mRNA in the ipsilateral or contralateral cervical DRGs of rats injected with AAV1-NT3 or AAV1-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) although we did detect a strong signal for human Neurotrophin-3 in positive control samples of human brain cDNA. Together these results show that the viral vector itself was not retrogradely transported to the DRG, but the neurotrophin-3 protein itself was.</p><p>Intramuscular treatment using AAV1-NT3 in this cohort did not significantly increase levels of Neurotrophin-3 protein in homogenates of ipsilateral or contralateral spinal cervical hemicords (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2&#x02014;figure supplement 2B</xref>) or liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2&#x02014;figure supplement 2C</xref>) 4 weeks after injection. We next used a more sensitive method, namely immunolabeling, to see whether Neurotrophin-3 was detectable in neurons of the dorsal or ventral horns of the cervical spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F&#x02013;J</xref>). Immunolabeling revealed that, in rats treated with AAV1-NT3, Neurotrophin-3 protein was increased in neurons of the ipsilateral cervical dorsal horn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) and ipsilateral cervical motor neurons (including in their nuclei) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>) relative to AAV1-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,I</xref> respectively) but not in contralateral dorsal horn or motor neurons. Together these data are consistent with other studies showing receptor-mediated retrograde transport of Neurotrophin-3 protein from injected muscles in large diameter sensory neurons and motor neurons (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Distefano et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Helgren et al., 1997</xref>). In summary, Neurotrophin-3 protein levels were increased in ipsilateral flexor muscles, ipsilateral cervical DRG and in the ipsilateral spinal cord as well as in blood.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Treatment with Neurotrophin-3 improved functional outcomes after bilateral pyramidotomy</title><p>We assessed the forelimb behaviour of rats treated with either AAV-NT3 or AAV-GFP with our newly developed open-field scoring system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Rats with bilateral pyramidotomy treated with AAV-GFP frequently missed rungs, but intramuscular Neurotrophin-3 treatment gradually improved precision stepping on the horizontal ladder throughout the 10 weeks testing period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Additionally, Neurotrophin-3 treated rats partially recovered grip strength with their treated forelimb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Importantly, Neurotrophin-3 did not cause or affect mechanical hypersensitivity, as expected from human clinical trials (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Parkman&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Sahenk, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhry et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Coulie et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Sahenk et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Intramuscular AAV-NT3 treatment did not improve recovery on the pellet reaching task after bilateral pyramidotomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) which is consistent with the fact that corticospinal injury leads to a persistent deficit in dexterity (<xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Weidner et al., 2001</xref>). Taken together, these behavioural results demonstrate that bilateral pyramidotomy is sufficient to cause spasticity in rodents and that these symptoms can be improved by treating flexor muscles with Neurotrophin-3. Treatment also resulted in improved functional recovery of motor behaviour. We next show that NT3 modifies neurophysiological properties of spinal reflexes whose low threshold proprioceptive and cutaneous mechanoreceptive afferents and motor neurons are known to express TrkC (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">McMahon et al., 1994</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Neurotrophin-3 normalized spinal reflexes evoked by low intensity stimulation of nerves containing afferents from injected muscles</title><p>As described above, rats showed less H-wave depression at inter-stimulus intervals of 5&#x000a0;s and less after bilateral pyramidotomy.

Both nerves carry afferents from and innervate synergist forelimb muscles that were treated with an AAV1 overexpressing Neurotrophin-3.

Finally, Neurotrophin-3 treatment did not modify polysynaptic responses evoked in the radial nerve after stimulation of the ulnar nerve; these responses did not change after injury either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3&#x02014;figure supplement 1C&#x02013;D</xref>).

Transverse sections of the cervical spinal cord were immunolabeled for vGluT1 which is located in excitatory boutons of proprioceptive and cutaneous mechanosensory axons (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Alvarez et al., 2011</xref>).

We determined whether the number of vGluT1 immunoreactive boutons in close proximity to motor neurons changed after bilateral pyramidotomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A&#x02013;C</xref>). After injury, more vGluT1 boutons were found in close proximity to cervical motor neurons of the ulnar and radial nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) which might contribute to the spasticity we report. To explore the specificity of afferent fibers synapsing onto different motor neuron pools, we took advantage of the fact that injection of CTb into the ulnar nerve also transganglionically labels predominantly large diameter afferents (<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Shehab and Hughes, 2011</xref>). CTb-immunoreactive afferents from the ulnar nerve had more vGluT1 boutons in close proximity to radial motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

Together, these results indicate that Neurotrophin-3 treatment normalised the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to motor neurons.</p><p>Changes in the serotonergic system can also cause spasticity after spinal cord injury. Complete transection causes an up-regulation of the constitutively active 5HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Murray et al., 2010</xref>) and incomplete spinal cord injury leaves spared serotonergic fibers in the sensitized spinal cord (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">D'Amico et al., 2013</xref>) which both can cause spasticity by enhancing persistent inward currents. Cervical spinal cord sections were immunolabeled for serotonin and we measured the pixel intensity in the dorsal laminae I/II/III and the ventral horn. Corticospinal tract injury resulted in an increase of serotonergic fiber density in the ventral horn, but not in the dorsal horn; the former was normalized by Neurotrophin-3 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). In the ventral horn, serotonin receptor activity can cause hyper-excitability of motor neurons by regulating the ion symporter KCC2 (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bos et al., 2013</xref>). KCC2, when located to the membrane, expels chloride<sup>-</sup> and potassium<sup>+</sup> ions to regulate the reversal potential of GABA<sub>A</sub> responses; if membrane KCC2 is reduced, motor neurons become hyper-excitable (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Boulenguez et al., 2010</xref>). After injury, we found less KCC2 in the membrane of ulnar and radial motor neurons and more accumulations within the somata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>).

We found that excitatory networks within the spinal cord were upregulated after bilateral pyramidotomy and proprioceptive afferents had increased targeting of antagonistic motor neurons more&#x000a0;than in normal rats. We showed that bilateral pyramidotomy caused hyperreflexia, abnormal sensorimotor processing, spasms and clumsiness during walking. Interestingly, behavioural, neurophysiological and anatomical abnormalities could be dramatically improved with delayed intramuscular Neurotrophin-3 treatment, and we showed that Neurotrophin-3 overexpression in the muscle restored accurate patterning of central connectivity and the amount of KCC2 in the motor neuron membrane which is important for normal excitability.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Bilateral corticospinal tract lesioning is sufficient to cause spasticity</title><p>Our rodent model gives evidence that selective and complete lesioning of the corticospinal tract results in spasticity. From the clinicoanatomic perspective, there is an extensive debate whether selective pyramidal tract damage (a rare event) is sufficient to cause spastic hemiplegia in humans. Stroke and spinal cord injury, which may or may not affect the corticospinal tract, very commonly lead to spasticity (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adams and Hicks, 2005</xref>). Spasticity symptoms have sometimes been ascribed to additional damage to extrapyramidal structures, but a recent extensive review of pathological cases gives evidence that damage to the pyramidal tracts is sufficient and necessary to cause spastic hemiplegia in humans (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">de Oliveira-Souza, 2015</xref>). The classic lesion experiments by Lawrence and Kuypers revealed the role of the corticospinal tract in motor control in non-human primates (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence and Kuypers, 1968a</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">1968b</xref>). A large cohort of macaque monkeys received bilateral corticospinal tract injuries in the pyramids. While skilled hand function is severely affected by the lesions, the monkeys were still able to walk and climb shortly after the injury. We re-examined their original videos (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Lemon et al., 2012</xref>) and observed clonic movements (their Supplementary Videos 2, 3 and 8), narrowed stance during locomotion (their Supplementary Video 6) and increased flexor activities in their forelimbs (their Supplementary Video 7) supporting the notion that corticospinal tract injury is sufficient to produce spastic signs and abnormal locomotion in non-human primates as well as humans.</p><p>Other groups have modelled spasticity in rodents, which has advanced the understanding of underlying causes of spasticity and the development of novel potential therapies (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Gonzenbach et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Boulenguez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Corleto et al., 2015</xref>).

A midthoracic T-lesion, which essentially damages the dorsomedial, dorsolateral and ventromedial parts of the corticospinal tracts, results in hindlimb spasms during swimming (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Gonzenbach et al., 2010</xref>). Whereas these injuries provide models of hindlimb/tail spasticity, which can be measured after stimulation or during specialized behavioural testing for rats, our model of bilateral pyramidotomy allows observation of spasticity in the forelimbs, hindlimbs and tail during awake, free movements in the open field. Our model shows visible signs of spasticity including increased reflexes similar to the human condition. Our model provides further evidence that exclusive corticospinal tract lesioning is sufficient to produce signs of spasticity. Our model also has allowed us to identify a new intervention to treat the underlying neuronal component of disordered sensorimotor control resulting from upper motor neuron lesions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Bilateral pyramidotomy causes changes in the pattern of excitatory and inhibitory boutons in the spinal cord</title><p>One of the more potent anti-spasticity drugs is baclofen, a GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonist (<xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Stempien and Tsai, 2000</xref>). Although it may result in adverse systemic side effects and increasing tolerance during long-term treatment, it is evident that increasing inhibition in the spinal cord is an effective treatment for spasticity. Spasticity is associated with a decrease of inhibitory synapses and inhibitory post-synaptic potentials in motor neurons (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Kapitza et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Kakinohana et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Boulenguez et al., 2010</xref>) plus concurrent increase of excitatory synapses upon and persistent inward currents in motor neurons (<xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Toda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bennett et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Hultborn et al., 2013</xref>). We give evidence that there is an increase of vGluT1 boutons from proprioceptive afferents onto motor neurons and less presynaptic inhibition of proprioceptive afferents in the cervical spinal cord after bilateral pyramidotomy. We also show increased motor neuron excitability through changes in the ion transporter KCC2, but no change in a marker of inhibitory GABAergic synapses/boutons as shown by immunolabeling for vGAT near motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4&#x02014;figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Functionally, knocking out presynaptic GABAergic interneurons results in limb oscillations during directed reaching for sugar pellets (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Fink et al., 2014</xref>). Our bilateral pyramidotomy model results in reduced presynaptic inhibition, oscillatory like movements during the loading response of the stance phase and oscillatory clonic movements of the forelimb which may result from aberrant spinal processing of mechanoceptive and proprioceptive inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">3</xref>). These oscillations are also seen in the non-human primates with bilateral pyramidotomy during reaching for food morsels (Supplementary Videos 2, 3 and 8 in [<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Lemon et al., 2012</xref>]). Intriguingly, our work indicates that there is not only an increase in excitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), but also loss of patterning specificity after bilateral pyramidotomy: We observed abnormal monosynaptic connectivity to radial motor neurons by afferents from an antagonistic flexor nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and abnormal polysynaptic connectivity to ulnar motor neurons by afferents from the radial nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Anatomically, we showed increased numbers of flexor proprioceptive afferent synapses onto motor neurons supplying extensor muscles and neurophysiologically, increased connectivity between flexor and&#x000a0;extensor&#x000a0;afferents to&#x000a0;flexor motor neurons. We propose that this leads functionally to co-contraction or oscillatory muscle activation of flexor and extensor muscles, (including spasms and clonus), which we observed in the open-field testing.</p><p>In conclusion, an effective treatment for spasticity should re-balance the excitatory and inhibitory networks in the spinal cord, but also should ensure correct synaptic connectivity between extensor and flexor muscle groups. We have shown that delayed intramuscular delivery of Neurotrophin-3 to flexor muscles can achieve this in adulthood after bilateral pyramidotomy lesion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Importance of proprioceptive afferent feedback</title><p>Our findings emphasize a need to re-balance excitatory and inhibitory spinal networks and to increase specificity of afferent connectivity in the spinal cord after CNS injury to treat sensorimotor abnormalities and hyperreflexia. Normally, muscle spindles are involved in mediating this balancing act by giving feedback via proprioceptive neurons. Indeed, mice lacking functional muscle spindles (lacking proprioceptive feedback) show impaired re-organization of spinal circuitry and restricted locomotor recovery after CNS injury (<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Takeoka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Akay et al., 2014</xref>). Muscle spindles synthesize neurotrophin-3 (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Copray and Brouwer, 1994</xref>) and this may be one of the feedback signals in proprioceptive neurons underlying spontaneous recovery after spinal cord injury.</p><p>Bilateral corticospinal tract injury causes spinal cord denervation and subsequently spinal circuitry reorganization. Corticospinal axons and proprioceptive afferents compete for synaptic space in the spinal cord in development and also in adulthood (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>). Premotor interneurons receive direct input from the corticospinal tract and cutaneous and proprioceptive afferent fibers (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Brownstone and Bui, 2010</xref>); following loss of corticospinal input, proprioceptive afferents may invade the empty synaptic space on these interneurons. The synaptic space on motor neurons might be reorganized more indirectly: bilateral pyramidotomy causes a significant loss of input to spinal interneurons, which may then withdraw some of their input to motor neurons (<italic>i.e.</italic>, anterograde trans-neuronal synaptic loss akin to activity-based synaptic pruning in development) creating more space for sensory afferent synapses. Our data supports this proposition. We have established that after supraspinal injury proprioceptive afferent input reorganized and showed aberrant connection patterns onto motor neurons in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Intramuscular over-expression of Neurotrophin-3 regulated spinal circuitry re-organization and resulted in reduced sensorimotor abnormalities and normalized hyperreflexia.<fig id="fig6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18146.021</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Spinal hyper-excitability causing hyperreflexia, spasms and disordered sensorimotor control is normalized by intramuscular Neurotrophin-3 treatment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In uninjured healthy conditions, there is a balance between excitatory (afferent and descending) networks, pre-synaptic inhibition and motor neuron excitability. (<bold>B</bold>) After loss of corticospinal innervation, there is a loss of specificity in connections between proprioceptive afferents, spinal interneurons and motor neurons. Indeed, excitatory (afferent) terminations in the spinal cord are increased in number and there is a reduction in molecular markers of pre-synaptic inhibition upon proprioceptive afferents. We propose that this causes increased spinal excitability. Moreover, KCC2 is internalized from the membrane of motor neurons rendering them more excitable. Together, these result in increased spinal reflexes, hallmarks of spasticity. (<bold>C</bold>) Injection of AAV-NT3 into flexor muscles causes trafficking of NT3 to the cervical DRG by retrograde transport (and, possibly, to a lesser extent, by systemic transport). Treatment normalizes the pattern of proprioceptive afferent terminations and restores pre-synaptic inhibition upon proprioceptive afferents. NT3 is also retrogradely transported to motor neurons where KCC2 levels are normalized in the membrane. Multiple spinal reflexes involving treated muscles are normalized. We propose that this is the result of restored specificity of connections between proprioceptive afferents and appropriate motor neurons and normalised motor neuron excitability. Abnormal forelimb movements including spasms are reduced and walking on the ladder is improved. In conclusion, delayed intramuscular treatment with AAV-NT3 results in neurophysiological, molecular and behavioural improvements after CNS injury.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold>

Neurotrophins are retrogradely transported in signaling endosomes (after they bind to and are internalized with their receptors) (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Helgren et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Harrington et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>). We injected an AAV1 expressing neurotrophin-3 into skeletal muscles, which are innervated both by proprioceptive afferents and motor neurons. We found increased levels of neurotrophin-3 protein in the ipsilateral cervical dorsal root ganglia and in motor neurons. We can exclude transport of the AAV1 viral vector as we did not detect the transgene of human Neurotrophin-3 in the ipsilateral cervical DRG with qRTPCR. We also did not detect increased levels of rat neurotrophin-3 mRNA in the ipsilateral cervical dorsal root ganglia after intramuscular injections of an AAV1 expressing the human NT3 transgene as shown by RNA sequencing (Kathe et al, unpublished). We expect that the majority of changes in spinal cord patterning and excitability was mediated via proprioceptive afferents and motor neurons. However, we cannot exclude the possibilities that cutaneous afferents may have modulated spinal reflexes (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Bui et al., 2013</xref>) as it is likely that skin afferents were also exposed to a low concentration of Neurotrophin-3; or that neurotrophin-3 acted to some degree through the vascular circulation systemically although we didn't detect a significant increase protein in muscles other than the injected ones or in the spinal cord. Notwithstanding our current results, systemic delivery routes of delivery for neurotrophin-3 may be effective when higher doses of the protein are administered, for example by intrathecal infusion after spinal cord injury (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Bradbury et al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Ongoing work in our laboratory seeks to identify the optimal biopharmaceutical delivery route and form (protein, gene therapy, agonist antibody or small synthetic molecule) for neurotrophin-3 and for targeting its receptors after spinal cord injury and stroke.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Mechanisms of recovery with neurotrophin-3</title><p>Neurotrophin-3 had several effects on spinal networks that likely contributed to normalization of mono- and polysynaptic reflexes and resulted in functional recovery. Firstly, Neurotrophin-3 caused a re-balancing of excitatory and inhibitory networks in the spinal cord. It restored the specificity and number of excitatory boutons from proprioceptive axons onto motor neurons and a marker of presynaptic inhibition to normal. Secondly, neurotrophin-3 normalised the levels of KCC2 in ulnar and radial motor neuron membranes to normal. KCC2 subcellular location was modified either after direct retrograde transport of neurotrophin-3 in motor axons (which might mean even the non-significant trend of increased neurotrophin-3 protein in the triceps brachii was sufficient to affect its radial motor neurons), or it was secondary to changes in afferent or supraspinal fiber organization. Finally, neurotrophin-3 also affected plasticity of extrapyramidal supraspinal pathways. We showed that neurotrophin-3 normalized the pattern of serotonergic fibers in the cervical spinal cord. Given that other pathways like rubrospinal tract neurons also express trkC receptors (<xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Tetzlaff et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">King et al., 1999</xref>) it is possible that these pathways also undergo sprouting within the cervical spinal cord and may contribute to functional recovery (<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Raineteau et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, we propose that all these anatomical effects of neurotrophin-3 normalize spinal reflexes and reduce spasticity that can interfere with functional recovery. This improves locomotor function. Motor function and restoration of normal reflexes are interdependent and mutually reinforcing as it has been shown that neurorehabilitative training ameliorates reflexes (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">C&#x000f4;t&#x000e9; et al., 2011</xref>) and reflex training ameliorates neurorehabilitation (<xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Thompson and Wolpaw, 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Neurotrophin-3 is a translationally attractive therapy for&#x000a0;treating spasticity as part of a movement disorder</title><p>Spasticity seldom occurs in isolation, but more commonly as part of larger syndromes such as upper motor neuron syndrome or the pyramidal syndrome associated with stroke and spinal cord injury. These syndromes often affect other aspects of movements and sensory processing including locomotion, fine motor function or cutaneous sensation. Existing anti-spastic treatments, which reduce exaggerated reflexes and muscle tone, often do not improve the movement disorder (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Dietz and Sinkjaer, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Corry et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Latash and Penn, 1996</xref>). In contrast, we have shown that neurotrophin-3 has the added benefit of improving other aspects of motor and sensory function after CNS injury. Here, we have shown intramuscular treatment with neurotrophin-3 not only normalized reflexes, but also improved locomotion and grip strength. Moreover, neurotrophin-3 treatment did not cause detectable pain (mechanical allodynia). In previous studies, our group used delayed, intramuscular neurotrophin-3 to treat stroke and observed improved fine motor function and tactile sensation in adult and elderly rats (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Duricki et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, peripheral administration of neurotrophin-3 protein is safe and well-tolerated in Phase 2 human clinical trials even with high doses (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhry et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Coulie et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Sahenk et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Parkman&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Sahenk, 2007</xref>). Our findings suggest that intramuscular neurotrophin-3 reduces signs of spasticity and improves functional recovery by regulating spinal connectivity after supraspinal injury. Moreover, a gene therapy involving intramuscular injection of an AAV1 encoding human neurotrophin-3 under the control of a muscle-specific promoter, which was successfully tested in a mouse model of Charcot Marie Tooth neuropathy (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Sahenk et al., 2014</xref>), now has FDA approval for a clinical trial for patients with Charcot Marie Tooth 1A (Professor Zarife Sahenk, personal communication, August 2016).

Videos were scored by a blinded observer using the Scoring sheet shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>Examples of each sign of spasticity and sensorimotor abnormality that was scored are shown in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>. For purposes of comparison, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> shows a normal rat exhibiting none of these signs. Each forelimb was scored separately, and scores were added up to give a total score per rat (yielding a maximum of 24). Other signs of spasticity (especially those relating to the hindlimb and tail) were not scored (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). The following signs of spasticity or sensorimotor abnormality were scored, using the operational definitions given:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Forepaw digit flexion during swing phase. A score of 1 was given if the forepaw digits were held in a fully flexed position during the swing phase. A score of 0 was given if the forepaw digits appeared flaccid or atonic (i.e., neither flexed nor extended). A score of 0 was given if the forepaw digits were extended. The score was based on the digit position most frequently observed during the three minutes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Joint movements during swing phase. Movements of the wrist, elbow and shoulder were assessed during the swing phase. A score was given to each joint (with a maximum score of 2 per joint). 1 point was given if the joint appeared rigid or showed corrective movement (alternating trajectories in the mid-swing phase) and 2 points were given if the joint appeared rigid and showed corrective movements. A score of 0 was given if the joint movement was smooth or flaccid. The score was based on the type of movement frequently observed for each joint during the three minutes. The maximum score a single forelimb could reach is six (i.e., 3 joints &#x000d7; 2 points).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Stance width: A 'Normal stance' was defined as how the forepaw was placed by normal rats (i.e., slightly medial to shoulders) and was given a score of 0. A 'Wide stance' was defined as when the forepaw was placed more laterally than that seen in normal rats. A wide stance is often seen in rats with neurological injury because this compensatory strategy improves stability. A score of zero was given for a wide stance because it does not indicate increased tone of flexor muscles. A 'Narrow stance' was defined as when the forepaw was placed more medially than that seen in normal rats, with forepaws aligned rostrocaudally or crossed. A narrow stance was given a score of one because it indicates increased muscle tone of flexor muscles. The score was based on the type of stance most frequently observed during the three minutes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Forelimb movements during the loading response of the stance phase. A score of 0 was given for a normal loading response during the stance phase. A score of 1 was given for 'Repeated muscle jerks during onset of stance'. This was defined as when, during the loading response of the stance phase, the forelimb made contact but then withdrew immediately (with one or more cycles of this 'bounce'). A score of 0 was given if the plantar surface of the forepaw was not placed down during the loading response of the stance phase ('No plantar stance'), i.e. dorsal stepping. The score was based on which of these was observed most frequently during the three minutes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Other signs of sensorimotor abnormality: prolonged muscle contractions, single and repeated muscle jerks. A prolonged muscle contraction was defined as a longer than 2 s 'on' muscle activation (e.g., flexor or extensor). A single muscle jerk was defined as a rapid, single 'on-off' muscle activation. A repeated muscle jerk was defined as a rapid and repeated 'on-off' muscle activation (other than in the loading response of the stance phase, to avoid double counting). A score of 1 was given for each of these behaviours if they were observed at least once.</p></list-item></list><p>Many of these signs of sensorimotor abnormalities have been observed in non-human primates (macaque monkeys) after bilateral pyramidotomy, including (1) narrower stance of forelimbs during quadrupedal walking (Supp Video 6 of (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Lemon et al., 2012</xref>), (2) dampened oscillatory movements during forelimb movements (Supp Video 2 and 8 of [<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Lemon et al., 2012</xref>]) and (3) prolonged flexor muscle contractions in sitting positions (Supp Video 7 of [<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Lemon et al., 2012</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Hoffmann-reflex testing</title><p>The H-reflex was assessed at baseline and every two weeks post-surgery. Rats were anaesthetized with 30&#x000a0;mg/kg ketamine and 0.1&#x000a0;mg/kg medetomidine. Two 24-G needle electrodes were inserted across the medial plantar side of the wrist to stimulate the ulnar nerve (via a constant current isolated pulse stimulator, stimulus width 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;s, Neurolog, Digitimer). Two recording electrodes were inserted into the abductor digiti quinti to record electromyograms. The signal was amplified (4000-fold), filtered (with a pass band of 300&#x02009;Hz to 6 kHz), digitized via PowerLab, visualized and analysed with LabChart. The M-wave is evoked by excitation of motor axons. The H-wave is a short latency reflex which includes monosynaptic connections: Ia proprioceptive afferents synaptically activate motor neurons in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). The threshold (1X) was determined as the lowest stimulation intensity that elicited an H-wave response in at least 75% of the recordings. First, we tested the responses to increasing stimulus intensities at 0.1&#x000a0;Hz up to 2x Threshold, which activates low threshold afferent fibers. M-wave and H-wave amplitudes were normalized to the maximum M-wave that we recorded at higher stimulation intensities (up to a maximum threshold of 2x threshold). Next, we tested the frequency dependent depression of the H-wave. This is also commonly referred to as post-activation depression or as rate-dependent depression. We stimulated every 10 s with paired stimuli at inter-stimulus intervals from 10&#x02009;s to 0.1&#x02009;s. The H-wave amplitude of the test stimulus was normalized to the H-wave amplitude of the conditioning stimulus. 25 paired stimuli per frequency were averaged and plotted as a frequency-depression curve. The area under the curve was calculated to give an H-wave measure of hyperreflexia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 3F</xref>). Post-stimulation, rats were given atipamezole (Antisedan, 2&#x000a0;mg/ml) and monitored until fully awake.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Cervical dorsal root axotomy</title><p>Three na&#x000ef;ve animals were used to confirm the H-reflex set-up. Animals were stimulated and recorded from as stated in H-reflex methods. Immediately after the recording, six cervical dorsal roots were cut on the stimulation/recording side. A dorsal midline incision was made above the cervical vertebrae. Muscle tissue was blunt dissected. Laminectomies were performed from C3 to C8. The dura was opened and dorsal roots C3 to C8 were cut with micro-scissors unilaterally. Muscle tissue was sutured in layers and the skin was sutured. Post-surgery animals were kept anaesthetized and the H-reflex recording protocol was repeated. After H-reflex recording, animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Terminal electrophysiology involving median, ulnar and radial nerves</title><p>Rats were anaesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 30&#x000a0;mg/kg ketamine and 0.1&#x000a0;mg/kg medetomidine. A skin cut overlying the pectoralis major from the axilla to the elbow was made and a mineral oil pool was established with the skin flaps. The brachial plexus was exposed and connective tissue was removed from the ulnar, median and radial nerves, which were cut distally. We performed whole nerve recordings from the ulnar nerve, which was mounted on silver-wire hook electrodes (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Bosch et al., 2012</xref>). The median and radial nerves were stimulated to elicit a synergistic and antagonistic response respectively (100 &#x000b5;s, 0.1&#x02009;Hz, 0&#x02013;400 &#x000b5;A). Stimulation intensities were chosen based on the previous observations in our laboratory (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Bosch et al., 2012</xref>). Alternatively, the radial nerve was recorded from whilst stimulating the ulnar nerve. The signal was amplified (4000-fold), filtered (with a pass band of 600&#x02009;Hz to 3 kHz), digitized via PowerLab, visualized and analysed with LabChart. Filtered traces were analysed by measuring the absolute integral (area under the rectified curve) from 1.5&#x000a0;ms to 3.5&#x000a0;ms for monosynaptic responses and 3.5&#x000a0;ms to 12&#x000a0;ms for polysynaptic responses. Values were averaged across 10 recordings per stimulation intensity per animal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Tissue preparation</title><p>Immediately after the nerve prep, rats were perfused transcardially with PBS pH 7.4 and tissues were dissected rapidly. Tissue for sectioning on the cryostat was post-fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS pH 7.4 overnight and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS pH 7.4. Tissue was frozen and embedded in O.C.T., spinal cords and DRGs were sectioned transversely at 30&#x02009;&#x003bc;m or 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;m thickness respectively. Tissues for protein analysis and for RNA extraction were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen after dissection and then stored in a &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C freezer.

In summary, slides were immersed in PBS pH 7.4 for 5 min, then dehydrated in a graded ethanol series for 5 min each. Sections were cleared in Histochoice or Xylene for 15 min before rehydrated in a graded ethanol series. Slides were washed for 5&#x02009;min in distilled water before stained in 0.16% Eriochrome Cyanine R (Sigma-Aldrich, Fluka 32752), 0.5% sulphuric acid (Sigma 84728) and 0.4% iron chloride (Alfa Aesar 12357) in dH<sub>2</sub>0 for 10 min to visualize myelin. Slides were washed in distilled water twice for 5 min and then differentiated in 0.5% aqueous ammonium hydroxide until desired staining intensity is reached, but no more than 2 min. Slides were washed twice for 5 min in distilled water and then dehydrated in a graded ethanol series. Finally, slides were left in Histochoice for 10 min or longer before cover-slipping with DPX.</p><p>Immunohistochemistry was performed with following standard protocol: Tissue was blocked in 10% bovine albumin serum (Sigma, A3059) in PBS for 1&#x02009;hr, then incubated with the relevant primary antibody (Antibody Table) overnight at room temperature. After 4 washes with PBS, the appropriate secondary antibody (Antibody Table) was applied for 90&#x02009;min at room temperature. Images were taken with a Zeiss Imager Z.1 fitted with an AxioCamMRm or with an LSM 710 microscope (Carl Zeiss, 0.3&#x02009;&#x003bc;m thick optical sections). Generally, no GFP expression was observed in unstained sections of DRG or spinal cord.</p><p>All antibodies were verified by their manufacturer (Antibody Table). The serotonin antibody was raised in rabbit and specific staining is inhibited by pre-incubation of the diluted antiserum with serotonin or serotonin-BSA (manufacturer's specification). The vGAT antibody was raised against amino acids 75&#x02013;87 of rat vGAT and its specificity for mammalian vGAT was verified by demonstrating loss of staining using KO mice by the manufacturer. The vGluT1 antibody was raised against amino acids 456&#x02013;560 of rat vGluT1. Its specificity for mammalian vGluT1 was verified by demonstrating loss of staining in KO mice by the manufacturer. The KCC2 antibody recognizes the residues 932&#x02013;1043 of the rat ortholog and is routinely evaluated by western blot in rat brain membrane preparations by the manufacturer. The Neurotrophin-3 antibody is a synthetic peptide corresponding to the human prepro-Neurotrophin-3 amino acids 174- 189 (the epitope is part of the mature peptide sequence). Staining can be inhibited with Neurotrophin-3 peptide (manufacturer's specification).</p><p><table-wrap id="tblu1" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Antibody</th><th valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Supplier and cat number</th><th valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Concentration</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rabbit anti-serotonin</td><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sigma, S5545</td><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1:6000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mouse anti-vGAT</td><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Synaptic Systems 131 011</td><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1:200 (+0.1%TX-100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rabbit anti-vGluT1</td><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Synaptic Systems 135 302</td><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1:1000 (+0.1%TX-100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Goat- anti-CTb</td><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">List Laboratories 703</td><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1:2000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rabbit anti-KCC2</td><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Millipore 07-432</td><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1:500</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rabbit anti-NT3</td><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Abcam 65804</td><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1:500</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Alexa 488 donkey anti-mouse</td><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Life Technologies A21202</td><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Alexa 488 donkey anti-rabbit</td><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Life Technologies A21206</td><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Alexa 594 goat anti-rabbit</td><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Life Technologies A11012</td><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Alexa 488 donkey anti-goat</td><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Life Technologies A11055</td><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">DyLight 650 donkey anti-goat</td><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Abcam ab96938</td><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1:1000</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn2"><p>Antibody table: Table showing primary and secondary antibodies.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Image analysis was performed with Image J or Zen Imaging software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Analysis of serotonin immunohistochemistry</title><p>Images were acquired with a Zeiss Imager Z.1 fitted with an AxioCamMRm.

C7/8 spinal sections were analysed. Once motor neurons were identified, 3 cross-sectional lines were drawn across the motor neurons and pixel intensities were measured along the lines. The area under the curve, where the lines cross the membrane, was measured. Thus, 6 values for each motor neuron were measured, which were averaged before further analysis. 25 motor neurons were analysed per rat and per motor neuron type.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Analysis of synaptic boutons by confocal fluorescence microscopy</title><p>To determine the number of boutons in close proximity to motor neurons or other boutons, consecutive confocal images (0.3&#x02009;&#x003bc;m thick optical sections) were acquired as z-stacks (total average thickness: 15&#x02009;&#x003bc;m) using a 63x objective. Z-stacks were analysed by scrolling through the different optical sections. To identify inhibitory boutons in close proximity to terminals, immunohistochemistry was performed with antibodies for a pre-synaptic marker for GABAergic synapses (vGAT+) and a pre-synaptic marker labeling proprioceptive or cutaneous sensory afferents terminals (vGluT1+). 250 vGluT1 boutons were scored in the ventral horn for each animal by a single and blinded experimenter: either the bouton was in very close proximity to at least one vGAT bouton (score&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1) (e.g., identified by yellow pixels in 15 &#x000b5;m z-stacks when projected into a single plane; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H,J</xref>) or not in close proximity to any vGAT boutons (score&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor.</p><p>There was a general enthusiasm for your study, which introduces a new rodent model that captures aspects of spasticity after injury of the corticospinal tract and the potential positive effect of NT3 on the aberrant reflexes and motor disabilities. However, several major concerns about the presentation of the model, the electrophysiological and molecular data, and the mechanisms for the NT3 effect, as well as a number of other issues were raised. To alleviate these problems a major revision of the text and better presentation of data as well as elimination of data from the present manuscript are needed, as outlined below. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary of the work:</p><p>In this manuscript, Kathe et al. describe a new injury rat model with bilateral pyramidotomy which leads to permanent motor impairment of fore and hindlimbs and changes in spinal reflexes resembling those following stroke or partial spinal cord injury. The behavioral changes were observed during spontaneous movements while reflex changes were tested in anaesthetized animals. The authors also show changes in synaptic connectivity onto motor neurons and that molecular factors are up- or down-regulated after in the dorsal root ganglia. Interestingly, many of the reflex changes and the changes in synaptic connectivity appear to be normalized by intramuscular over-expression of NT3 using viral vectors in single muscles, while other aberrant motor behaviors are partially improved. The study presents a new model of CNS injury leading to reflex changes and spasms included in the motor symptoms often described as spasticity in humans after spinal cord injury. The study clearly shows an effect of NT3 treatment on these symptoms suggesting that it may be possible to rectify injury released motor symptoms with this therapy.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors introduce a new model of 'spasticity'. The model and the motor changes and reflex changes that follow the injury need to be presented much better. Essentially Figure 1 should show the anatomical lesion, the observed behavioral motor disorders (spasms, changing in stepping overcrossing, staircase, open field score, etc.), and the essential reflex changes which include the changes in H-reflex, polysynaptic reflexes, and postsynaptic depression in control and in weeks after the injury. In this way the reader will be able to compare this model with previously published models (partial or full SC injury or stroke models). For the reflexes it needs to be made clear what kind of polysynaptic reflexes are tested. The current description is superficial and not convincing. All the stimulated nerves contain skin afferents (in the group I range) that could contribute to polysynaptic reflexes. But there is no mention of this in the text. In addition, the reflexes are difficult to understand even for a spinal motor physiologist because the small diagrams are misleading, and the text and figure legends are insufficient (for example Figure 2C of postsynaptic depression is incomprehensible, and it is not clear that the diagrams in Figure 2G, J are correct as well as the one in Figure 2&#x02014;figure supplement 1F and K). Please restrict the reflex description to the well-known H-reflex and postsynaptic depression.</p><p>2) Having introduced the model and its changes, the NT3 effects should be described in a separate text and figure with the essential reflexes and motor behavior summarized. In this way the authors can avoid jumping back and forth in the description of the model, the electrophysiological findings, and the behavioral characterizations and how these parameters are relevant for spasticity and the treatment with NT3 injections.</p><p>3) The definition of spasticity should be clear. However, the discussion of what spasticity really is does not seem very appropriate. There is no right or wrong answer to that (and no "controversy", even if there may be strong opinions). Clearly definitions have to be somewhat different in the clinic and in animal experiments, even if one tries to find animal models that are as close to the clinical situation as possible. It should be clearly stated that selective pyramidal lesion is a rare clinical event and stroke or spinal cord injury related spasticity is much more common.</p><p>4) There are generally a number of overstatements that NT3 treatment completely alleviates spasticity, which is not the case. This should be rectified. Also it should be noted that other treatments have been introduced in addition to baclofen.</p><p>5) Synaptic analysis is non-trivial and the authors state that they counted a synapse if vGAT and vGlut1 were in 'very close apposition'. What exactly do they mean by this &#x02013; how close does this need to be to be classed as a synapse and without deconvolution do they think they are resolving individual synapses?</p><p>6) How were the 5-HT changes assessed (it is not obvious from the figure that the changes are representative). Needs discussion and comments on how the quantification was done.</p><p>7) The NT3 treatment is not easy to understand. What does it do, and how can it act non-retrogradely &#x02013; is it because the main effect is systemic? Otherwise it is hard to understand that so many symptoms can be affected by a single or few muscle injections. The authors should explain the large tendency in NT3 increase in triceps after virus injection in flexor muscles, and the recovery in radial MNs Figure 4D and in TrkC neurons in Figure 7B and generally discuss the systemic effects.</p><p>8) The explanation of the NT3 increase in DRG by its retrograde transport is not supported by the data. Retrograde transport of the active signaling from the nerve endings to the soma is the basis of the long-range actions of the neurotrophins.</p><p>9) The PCA analysis does not provide much information, nor does it strengthen the data because it relies on author observations/analysis that have been arbitrarily chosen. Should be deleted.</p><p>10) The RNA-seq data should be presented in a comprehensive way with the genes in the main figure. However, since RNAseq has been performed on entire DRGs, it is hard to draw any conclusions from the data. Other neuron types express TrkC in the DRG and are likely to respond to NT3 overexpression. It is therefore not easy to understand the focus on sema 4. It is interesting but there is not proof or even slight indication that this molecule is involved in any of the changes. To show this would require a KO. We think it unreasonable to ask for this for this study, but we think the data are too preliminary at this point to include as an explanation and propose that the entire RNA-seq story be deleted from the paper and saved for a separate publication where the functional role of individual molecules can be addressed.</p><p>11) Discussion: The comments on Lawrence and Kuypers' experiments/films are important since the present model is a bilateral lesion of the pyramidal tract! When it comes to the mechanisms (subsection &#x0201c;Underlying mechanisms and treatment choice&#x0201d;) it is not correct that most GABAB receptors are responsible for presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents. It is also striking that the KCC2 is the only mechanism proposed for cellular mechanisms for the hyperexcitability of motoneurons. What about the persistent inward currents &#x02013; that were first described by Schwindt and Crill, then by Hounsgaard, Hultborn, Kiehn et al., and Dave Bennett et al. (the 2 latter groups also proving that they are increased following chronic spinal cord lesion, and certainly contribute to spasticity)? This is complemented by experiments by several other groups in Seattle, Chicago and Halifax. This paper is not addressing this question, but a couple of sentences in the Discussion should be a minimum. Finally, how can removal of the CST lead to change in competition onto motor neurons. CSTs do not reach MNs in rats?</p><p>12) Figure 8 should be deleted since it there is not support for only retrograde NT3 transport as the mechanism.</p><p>13) Title: The title needs to be changed to reflect the revision.

Please restrict the reflex description to the well-known H-reflex and postsynaptic depression.</italic>
</p><p>We have entirely revised Figure 1 in line with your suggestions. We have included lesion assessment, observed behavioural deficits and the essential reflex changes in Figure 1. Reflexes, which were assessed with neurophysiology, include the H-reflex and polysynaptic reflexes in Figure 1J-L and 1M-U , respectively. &#x0201c;Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 3&#x0201d; shows additional H-wave depression data in uninjured naives and at various time-points after the injury including new data for earlier time points (1 Day after injury) to show the time course of change for this reflex.</p><p>We have modified the Results section and Figures 1 and 3 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"/>to explain thoroughly what polysynaptic reflexes were tested. Specifically, in the figures and manuscript, we are referring to responses that had latencies between 3.5 and 12 ms which were evoked by low threshold and low frequency stimulation of a nerve whilst recording from a heteronymous nerve. We elaborated on which afferents are likely activated at the stimulation strengths we used, namely these include group Ia, Ib and II muscle afferents, cutaneous (mechanoreceptive) afferents in the group I range.</p><p>We have striven to make the descriptions of the reflex pathways more accurate and comprehensible in the Results sections and figures including their descriptions. We have provided new diagrams which we hope illustrate the reflex pathways better. We provided a new diagram for the H-reflex (Figure 1J and &#x0201c;Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 3&#x0201d;). We have included graphs which depict the post-activation depression / frequency-dependent depression of the H-wave for baseline, Day 1, Week 2 and Week 10 time-points. In the Results section and in &#x0201c;Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 3F&#x0201d;, we describe how we analysed the depression of the H-wave: "We measured the area under the stimulus-response curve from inter-stimulus intervals of 10 seconds to 0.1 seconds (Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 3F) for each rat at each time point separately and then plotted the group mean values (Figure 1L)".</p><p>Furthermore, we included new diagrams (replacing old ones) for the experimental set-up of polysynaptic reflex assessments (Figure 1M, N, R and &#x0201c;Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 4&#x0201d;), which clearly depict the nerves that were stimulated and recorded from without including any hypothesis about the complex spinal circuitry that is involved in these polysynaptic reflexes.</p><p><italic>2) Having introduced the model and its changes, the NT3 effects should be described in a separate text and figure with the essential reflexes and motor behavior summarized. In this way the authors can avoid jumping back and forth in the description of the model, the electrophysiological findings, and the behavioral characterizations and how these parameters are relevant for spasticity and the treatment with NT3 injections.</italic>
</p><p>We agree. We have described the effects of NT3 in separate text (the second part of the Results section) and separate figures (i.e., Figures 2-5 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"/>including their figure supplements) with the essential reflexes and behaviours summarized there.</p><p><italic>3) The definition of spasticity should be clear. However, the discussion of what spasticity really is does not seem very appropriate. There is no right or wrong answer to that (and no "controversy", even if there may be strong opinions). Clearly definitions have to be somewhat different in the clinic and in animal experiments, even if one tries to find animal models that are as close to the clinical situation as possible. It should be clearly stated that selective pyramidal lesion is a rare clinical event and stroke or spinal cord injury related spasticity is much more common.</italic>
</p><p>We have revised our definition of spasticity (found in the first paragraph in the Introduction) and now provide a single clear definition of spasticity, which is also consistent with the animal behaviour we observe. We have revised the Discussion and Methods sections with regards to definitions of spasticity. We agree that definitions of spasticity may have to be different in the clinic and in animal experiments. In the Discussion section, we removed the section using the word &#x0201c;controversy&#x0201d; and acknowledge the range of spinal cord injury animal models that display spasticity that is similar to the human condition. In our Methods, we provide &#x0201c;behavioural operational definitions&#x0201d; for each of the signs of spasticity which we observed in the open field.</p><p>Furthermore, we now state clearly that selective pyramidal lesion is a rare clinical event (subsection &#x0201c;Bilateral corticospinal tract lesioning is sufficient to cause spasticity&#x0201d;, first paragraph) and that stroke or spinal cord injury-related spasticity is very common: we now present estimates for the prevalence of spasticity amongst the spinal cord injury community in our Introduction (first paragraph).</p><p><italic>4) There are generally a number of overstatements that NT3 treatment completely alleviates spasticity, which is not the case. This should be rectified. Also it should be noted that other treatments have been introduced in addition to baclofen.</italic>
</p><p>This was unintentional. We have modified the manuscript at the relevant sections to avoid overstating our claims about NT3 treatment.</p><p>We now acknowledge other treatments in addition to baclofen including tizanidine and botulinum toxin in the Introduction.</p><p><italic>5) Synaptic analysis is non-trivial and the authors state that they counted a synapse if vGAT and vGlut1 were in 'very close apposition'. What exactly do they mean by this &#x02013; how close does this need to be to be classed as a synapse and without deconvolution do they think they are resolving individual synapses?</italic>
</p><p>We agree that an important distinction exists between identification of individual synapses (e.g., by electron microscopy or high resolution microscopy with deconvolution) and identification of bouton-like structures (e.g., by confocal fluorescence microscopy).</p><p>We have modified our manuscript to ensure we describe our Methods and Results more appropriately and more fully. Throughout the manuscript, we now refer to &#x0201c;boutons&#x0201d; instead of &#x0201c;synapses&#x0201d;. Instead of &#x0201c;very close apposition&#x0201d; we now use the term &#x0201c;in close proximity&#x0201d; and we define this term in Methods (Image Analysis: Analysis of synaptic boutons by confocal microscopy).</p><p><italic>6) How were the 5-HT changes assessed (it is not obvious from the figure that the changes are representative). Needs discussion and comments on how the quantification was done.</italic>
</p><p>In the Methods section, we now describe more clearly how the 5-HT changes were assessed (Image Analysis: Analysis of serotonin immunohistochemistry) which is an adaptation of a validated method for quantification of serotonergic fibres that has been previously published (Grider, Chen, and Shine 2006).</p><p>We have created new a figure which shows a representative image from each group rather than showing compressed heat-maps of the grey matter for each group. These images now better illustrate the mean changes depicted in the graphs.</p><p><italic>7) The NT3 treatment is not easy to understand. What does it do, and how can it act non-retrogradely &#x02013; is it because the main effect is systemic? Otherwise it is hard to understand that so many symptoms can be affected by a single or few muscle injections. The authors should explain the large tendency in NT3 increase in triceps after virus injection in flexor muscles, and the recovery in radial MNs Figure 4D and in TrkC neurons in Figure 7B and generally discuss the systemic effects.</italic>
</p><p>We have rewritten the manuscript to make the NT3 treatment easier to understand. The Results section includes a new subsection that is dedicated to the data related to synthesis and transport of NT3 and Figure 2 presents our experimental data relating to this.</p><p>In the Methods section, we list the forelimb muscles that received treatment, i.e. how many injections and which volumes were made into which muscle groups. We administered an AAV1 which carries the human Neurotrophin-3. Our data show that Neurotrophin-3 protein is transported from forelimb flexor muscles to ipsilateral cervical DRG and to the dorsal horn of the cervical spinal cord as well as to ventral horn motor neurons. In new subsections in the Discussion ("Did Neurotrophin-3 reduce spasticity via retrograde signaling?" and "Mechanisms of recovery with neurotrophin-3") we now explain what NT3 treatment does and how it can act: we propose that the dominant mechanism involves retrograde transport although we note that we cannot exclude systemic effects.</p><p>As requested, we now discuss in the Results and Discussion sections that there was a trend (albeit not statistically significant) towards increased Neurotrophin-3 levels in the ipsilateral (and not contralateral) <italic>triceps brachii</italic> and we comment that this may have resulted from AAV spread from during injection of nearby muscles (e.g., <italic>biceps brachii</italic>) or transport of protein in the bloodstream. We now present the data for both ipsilateral <underline>and</underline> contralateral triceps and biceps in Figure 2 and its supplements.</p><p>As requested, we also now discuss the recovery of KCC2 in the radial MNs (former Figure 4D) in the Discussion section entitled "Mechanisms of recovery". We discuss the evidence that KCC2 levels might have been modified either by direct retrograde transport of neurotrophin-3 in motor axons (which might mean even the non-significant trend of increased neurotrophin-3 protein in the <italic>triceps brachii</italic> was sufficient to affect its radial motor neurons), or, secondarily to changes in afferent or supraspinal fiber organization.</p><p>With regard to the potential for systematic effects of Neurotrophin-3, we wish to disclose to the reviewers that my team has shown that one month of subcutaneous infusion of recombinant Neurotrophin-3 can normalise an H reflex and promote sensorimotor recovery in elderly rats when treatment is initiated 24 hours after large cortical stroke (Duricki et al., unpublished work). However, a very high dose of Neurotrophin-3 was infused subcutaneously (47 &#x003bc;g/kg/day) to achieve this result and we have evidence that lower doses are not effective when given systemically. Accordingly, we think it is likely that the majority of results reported in the present manuscript are due to retrograde transport of Neurotrophin-3 rather than systemic effects of Neurotrophin-3 in the blood stream. We are happy to provide this additional manuscript to reviewers if requested.</p><p><italic>8) The explanation of the NT3 increase in DRG by its retrograde transport is not supported by the data. Retrograde transport of the active signaling from the nerve endings to the soma is the basis of the long-range actions of the neurotrophins.</italic>
</p><p>We agree that retrograde transport of an active signalling complex from the nerve endings to the soma is the basis of the long-range actions of endogenous neurotrophins, as shown by Silvia Arber&#x02019;s group for gene expression by postnatal mouse proprioceptors, for example (Lee et al. 2012). In the manuscript we also now cite several papers that also found retrograde transport of Neurotrophin-3 from muscle to DRG neurons (DiStefano et al. 1992, Helgren et al. 1997).</p><p>As described above (Essential Revisions: point 7), we have rewritten the Results section to explain better our evidence that Neurotrophin-3 is transported retrogradely from forelimb flexor muscles to ipsilateral cervical DRG and to the dorsal horn as well as motor neurons in the ventral horn of the cervical spinal cord. Specifically, our ELISA measurements of homogenates of DRG show that Neurotrophin-3 protein is elevated in ipsilateral DRGs of AAV1-NT3 rats relative to contralateral DRGs and to AAV1-GFP rats.</p><p><italic>9) The PCA analysis does not provide much information, nor does it strengthen the data because it relies on author observations/analysis that have been arbitrarily chosen. Should be deleted.</italic>
</p><p>As requested, we have removed the PCA analysis from the manuscript.</p><p><italic>10) The RNA-seq data should be presented in a comprehensive way with the genes in the main figure. However, since RNAseq has been performed on entire DRGs, it is hard to draw any conclusions from the data. Other neuron types express TrkC in the DRG and are likely to respond to NT3 overexpression. It is therefore not easy to understand the focus on sema 4. It is interesting but there is not proof or even slight indication that this molecule is involved in any of the changes. To show this would require a KO. We think it unreasonable to ask for this for this study, but we think the data are too preliminary at this point to include as an explanation and propose that the entire RNA-seq story be deleted from the paper and saved for a separate publication where the functional role of individual molecules can be addressed.</italic>
</p><p>As requested, we have removed from the manuscript the RNAseq data and the accompanying hypothesis and data about Sema4C. Thank you for the very reasonable position that you took regarding the need for KO work. I plan to apply for funding to use conditional KOs to evaluate the mechanisms by which Neurotrophin-3 promotes these changes and I will seek to publish this data in a separate publication in the future.</p><p><italic>11) Discussion: The comments on Lawrence and Kuypers' experiments/films are important since the present model is a bilateral lesion of the pyramidal tract! When it comes to the mechanisms (subsection &#x0201c;Underlying mechanisms and treatment choice&#x0201d;) it is not correct that most GABAB receptors are responsible for presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents. It is also striking that the KCC2 is the only mechanism proposed for cellular mechanisms for the hyperexcitability of motoneurons. What about the persistent inward currents that were first described by Schwindt and Crill, then by Hounsgaard, Hultborn, Kiehn et al., and Dave Bennett et al. (the 2 latter groups also proving that they are increased following chronic spinal cord lesion, and certainly contribute to spasticity)? This is complemented by experiments by several other groups in Seattle, Chicago and Halifax. This paper is not addressing this question, but a couple of sentences in the Discussion should be a minimum. Finally, how can removal of the CST lead to change in competition onto motor neurons. CSTs do not reach MNs in rats?</italic>
</p><p>Thank you for these corrections and suggestions for additions; we have modified our Introduction and Discussion sections accordingly.</p><p>We now describe the role of persistent inward currents in the hyperexcitability of motor neurons controlling the hindlimbs and tail of various species including rats and work by the authors that you mention above. We also mention that changes in descending monoaminergic pathways can enhance persistent inward currents (Result section). Our model involved axotomy of non-monoaminergic pathways; this also induced changes in the pattern of monoaminergic (serotonergic) arbors in the cervical spinal cord. In the future it would be interesting to determine whether bilateral pyramidotomy induces persistent inward currents that might contribute to the moderate spasticity that we observed.</p><p>We agree that corticospinal tract neurons do not or rarely reach MNs directly in rats. At present we do not know why removal of the CST leads to an increase in vGluT1 positive boutons on motor neurons. Prof. Jack Martin&#x02019;s group has also observed a similar phenomenon in the cervical spinal cord (ten days after unilateral pyramidotomy) and we now cite their work (Tan et al. 2012). We also now discuss the possibility that bilateral CST axotomy leads to anterograde transneuronal loss of synapses from motor neurons in the Discussion section "Importance of proprioceptive feedback". Complete bilateral ablation of the CST will cause considerable loss of input to spinal interneurons and it is possible that this loss of descending activity leads to loss of synapses from these interneurons onto motor neurons. In turn a signal from spinal cord motor neurons might lead to synthesis and secretion of factors known to promote sprouting and synapse formation. Indeed, evidence from other groups shows that pyramidotomy leads to changes in the expression profile in the cervical spinal cord of genes known to play roles in axon sprouting and synapse formation (Bareyre and Schwab 2003). This might cause sprouting and synapse formation of vGluT1 expressing afferents onto motor neurons, which we observed in our study.</p><p><italic>12) Figure 8 should be deleted since it there is not support for only retrograde NT3 transport as the mechanism.</italic>
</p><p>As we argue above, the majority of our data are consistent with a predominant effect of NT3 via retrograde transport. Notwithstanding this, we accept that we cannot exclude some systematic effects of NT3.</p><p>Accordingly, we have modified our summary figure and its figure legend to show that NT3 may be acting retrogradely as well as systemically.</p><p><italic>13) Title: The title needs to be changed to reflect the revision. In particular it needs to be stated what the CNS injury is and what reflexes that are normalized.</italic>
</p><p>We have changed the title to reflect the revisions. We now state the type of CNS injury (bilateral corticospinal tract injury) and that low threshold spinal reflexes were normalized. In the Abstract we now state clearly that these also included the H reflex to a hand muscle and low threshold polysynaptic spinal reflexes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
