These intercellular connections do not provide a diffusional restrain between the two compartments. However, during development this interface, initially consisting of neuroepithelial cells and later radial glial cells, is characterized by &#x0201c;strap&#x0201d; junctions, which limit the exchange of different sized molecules between cerebrospinal fluid and the brain parenchyma. Here we provide a systematic study of permeability properties of this inner cerebrospinal fluid-brain barrier during mouse development from embryonic day, E17 until adult. Results show that at fetal stages exchange across this barrier is restricted to the smallest molecules (286Da) and the diffusional restraint is progressively removed as the brain develops. By postnatal day P20, molecules the size of plasma proteins (70 kDa) diffuse freely. Transcriptomic analysis of junctional proteins present in the cerebrospinal fluid-brain interface showed expression of adherens junctional proteins, actins, cadherins and catenins changing in a development manner consistent with the observed changes in the permeability studies. Gap junction proteins were only identified in the adult as was claudin-11. Immunohistochemistry was used to localize at the cellular level some of the adherens junctional proteins of genes identified from transcriptomic analysis. N-cadherin, &#x003b2; - and &#x003b1;-catenin immunoreactivity was detected outlining the inner CSF-brain interface from E16; most of these markers were not present in the adult ependyma. Claudin-5 was present in the apical-most part of radial glial cells and in endothelial cells in embryos, but only in endothelial cells including plexus endothelial cells in adults. Claudin-11 was only immunopositive in the adult, consistent with results obtained from transcriptomic analysis. These results provide information about physiological, molecular and morphological-related permeability changes occurring at the inner cerebrospinal fluid-brain barrier during brain development.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cerebrospinal fluid</kwd><kwd>brain development</kwd><kwd>barriers</kwd><kwd>permeability</kwd><kwd>ventricular zone</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="5"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="73"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="12507"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The exchange of molecules between the brain and the periphery is restricted by specific cellular and biochemical mechanisms present at several interfaces between these two compartments: the blood&#x02013;brain barrier proper, the blood&#x02013;cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier, the blood-arachnoid barrier and the (inner) CSF&#x02013;brain barrier only present during brain development (M&#x000f8;llg&#x000e5;rd et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>; Saunders et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The morphological basis of blood&#x02013;brain and blood&#x02013;CSF barriers is the presence of tight junctions between cerebral vascular endothelial cells and choroid plexus epithelial cells respectively. These junctions restrict free diffusion between the blood, the brain parenchyma and the CSF (for reviews see Saunders et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Dziegielewska and Saunders, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Ek et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Engelhardt and Liebner, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Much less is known about the development of CSF&#x02013;brain interface. Junctions between cells lining the ventricular system of the developing brain were first described on the basis of conventional electron microscopy as modified tight or intermediate junctions, or as desmosomes (Tennyson and Pappas, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">1962</xref>; Duckett, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">1968</xref>; Levitt et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>). Subsequent studies characterized these junctions in fetal sheep using thin-section and freeze-fracture electron microscopy and established that they had a very different structural arrangement compared with tight junctions. Unlike tight junctions, which appear to join cells in a &#x0201c;belt-like fashion&#x0201d; at their luminal lateral cell membranes, these novel junctions, named &#x0201c;strap junctions,&#x0201d; appeared to encircle cells from their ventricular surface (M&#x000f8;llg&#x000e5;rd et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>) and were shown to hinder the free diffusion of solutes from the CSF into the fetal brain (Fossan et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>). In contrast to tight junctions of blood&#x02013;brain and blood&#x02013;CSF barriers, which are present from the earliest stages of brain development and remain throughout adulthood (M&#x000f8;llg&#x000e5;rd and Saunders, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Mishra and Teale, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Saunders et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), strap junctions are only present during development, with minimal gap junctions between some neuroepithelial cells; in the mature brain only gap junctions are present (Brightman and Reese, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1969</xref>; M&#x000f8;llg&#x000e5;rd and Saunders, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; M&#x000f8;llg&#x000e5;rd et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>; Iliff et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Additional evidence for the presence of a developmentally regulated CSF&#x02013;brain barrier came from a study examining the cellular distribution of native and foreign albumins injected into fetal and neonatal lateral ventricles of rats (Cavanagh and Warren, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>). This study showed that both types of albumin were distributed in some (but not all) cells lining the ventricles suggesting specialized uptake rather than paracellular unrestricted diffusion (Cavanagh and Warren, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>).</p><p>The fetal-specific interface that separates CSF from the brain's internal milieu is thought to control the transfer and diffusion of solutes into the brain and play an important role in restricting access of protein, present in high concentration in fetal CSF (Dziegielewska et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Adinolfi, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>; Dziegielewska and Saunders, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>), across the ventricular zone, which initially consists of neuroepithelial cells that subsequently differentiate to radial glial cells prior to neurogenesis. This, combined with an increase in colloidal osmotic pressure due to the high protein concentration responsible for the expansion of the ventricles and outward growth of the brain (Desmond and Jacobson, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>), are fundamental mechanisms controlling normal brain development (Saunders, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Johansson et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Saunders et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The presence of this diffusion restraint during brain development has been suggested to be important for normal cortical development (Stolp et al., <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2011b</xref>) and its disturbance is thought to contribute to several neurodevelopmental pathologies such as autism (Stolp, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Stolp et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>The present study is the first comprehensive investigation into the permeability properties of the inner CSF-brain interface during development, using lipid insoluble molecular markers with a range of sizes from 286 to 70,000 Da. We report that permeability of this barrier in mouse brain gradually changes from highly restrictive at fetal ages to an unrestricted diffusion in the adult. Molecular characterization, using RNA sequencing performed at a fetal and adult age, identified several known junctional proteins that are expressed at the CSF-brain barrier in a developmentally regulated manner. In addition to the transcriptomic analysis we also demonstrated that the change in the permeability characteristics coincided with changes in the cellular distribution of several junctional proteins such as cadherins, catenins and claudin-5. We propose that these junctional proteins are involved in the formation of strap junctions and in regulation of the changing diffusional properties of this barrier.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animal experimentation</title><sec><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee, University of Melbourne (Application ID 1112115.2).</p></sec><sec><title>Animal experiments</title><p>Time-mated pregnant Swiss Pro mice were obtained from the Animal Resource Centre Pty.

Two doses of 0.2 ml were given 20 min apart. Animals were monitored during this process and pain reflexes were observed. When the pain reflexes were no longer evident, mice were placed supine on a heated pad (33&#x000b0;C) and the uterine horns were exposed. Each fetus was removed consecutively from the uterine horn.

BED reaction product was also faintly visible in the extracellular space of the ventricular zone between the cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). By E19 and P0, cellular uptake of BED was visible at all aspects of the ventricular lining and the extracellular staining in the brain parenchyma was clearly positive (illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The results from fetal animals indicated that at these ages there is limited diffusion of molecules as small as 286 Da BED, between radial glial cells lining the CSF-brain interface.

It is possible that the specialized cellular uptake of small molecules may be the primary mechanism allowing their access to the early developing brain.</p><p>The earliest age at which diffuse labeling in the extracellular space of the brain was detected was in newborn pups (P0). At that age more BDA3 kDa appeared to diffuse into the medial aspect of the ventricle (as shown by a greater intensity of fluorescent marker, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and indicates that the permeability of the inner CSF&#x02013;brain barrier allows unhindered diffusion of a 3 kDa molecule from about the time of birth in mice (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>10 kDa rhodamine BDA (BDA10 kDa)</title><p>Diffusion of BDA10 kDa into the brain around the whole ventricular zone interface was prevented in E17 and E19 mice, as no fluorescent labeling was visible at either age in the brain (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). At P0 results for BDA10 kDa were variable&#x02014;a small amount of the marker (not measurable) was detected diffusing into the extracellular space of the ventricular zone in one pup from one litter, while in 2 other pups no diffusion was observed. This may indicate that at this stage of development there is a change in the permeability properties of the CSF&#x02013;brain interface and a small difference (hours) in the age of the pups could explain the observed results. At older ages (P10 to adult) BDA10 kDa was found in brains from all animals including some intercellular presence in the ependymal layer. Thus, the permeability of the CSF&#x02013;brain barrier changes between P0 and P10 to allow the diffusion of molecules up to 10 kDa (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>70 kDa rhodamine BDA (BDA70 kDa)</title><p>The earliest age at which BDA70 kDa was observed to diffuse into the brain was in P10 animals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>); however, this was only detected in the medial and lateral aspects of the ventricle.

In pups from a second litter (<italic>n</italic> = 2), diffusion was not observed in the brain of either animal. In the adult brain (<italic>n</italic> = 2) diffusion of the probe was observed from the ventricle into the brain in both animals.

Only the dorsolateral part of the lateral ventricular wall was sampled (see Materials and Methods). In this paper we focus only on genes that are thought to play a role in intercellular junctional structures. However, a more comprehensive analysis of the full RNA-Seq dataset dealing with the general development of the ventricular zone will be published elsewhere.</p><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> lists the junction-related genes that were identified in embryonic ventricular zone (A) and adult ependyma (B). The Table also lists numerous genes known to be associated with tight junctions that were below the detection threshold of the method. In the embryonic ventricular zone only 19 junction-related genes were present with FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped) values above the cut off of 1.0. In the adult ependyma there were 23 detectable junction-related genes. In the embryonic ventricular zone 9 genes belonging to the actins were represented, 6 belonged to catenin gene family, 3 were cadherins and one was a claudin (<italic>Cldn5</italic>). No detectable levels of genes coding for gap junction proteins were observed. In the adult ependyma three genes for gap junction proteins were detected, eight genes were from the actin family, four were catenins and there was only one cadherin. Claudin-11 (<italic>Cldn11</italic>) was the gene expressed at the highest level in the adult ependyma (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Genes from this first pass analysis were subsequently grouped by their molecular categories and represented as differentially regulated between the two ages (i.e., the fold differences between E17 and adult). These are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>. In addition, genes that did not show age-related expression differences are also listed. Some genes were only present in the embryo in detectable copy numbers whereas others were present only in the adult. The largest single category was actin and actin-related genes&#x02014;two (<italic>Actg1</italic>, <italic>Actl6b</italic>) were present only in the embryo; one (<italic>Actr3b</italic>) was present only in the adult. Another five were expressed at a higher level in the embryo than in the adult (<italic>Actb, Actr3, Actr1a, Actr2, Actr10</italic>) in the range 2.3&#x02013;7.0-fold enrichment.

The molecular exchange between the brain interstitial fluid, peripheral circulation and the CSF occurs across the interfaces between the brain, the blood and the CSF (Saunders et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Properties of two of these barriers, the blood&#x02013;brain barrier proper (between the brain and the blood) and the blood&#x02013;CSF barrier (between the blood and the CSF) have been extensively studied, including during development (for review see Saunders et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) but the inner CSF&#x02013;brain barrier, the last frontier together with the outer CSF-brain barrier as it were (see Br&#x000f8;chner et al., in preparation), is not well understood.</p><sec><title>Permeability of the inner CSF-brain barrier</title><p>Here we have presented a study to investigate systematically the permeability properties of this inner barrier during development. Only one study has previously attempted to do so and also found that there was a size restriction at earlier ages compared to free diffusion at later stages of brain maturation (Fossan et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>). However, in the study of Fossan et al. (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>) only one sized marker (HRP, 40 kDa) was used and only two developmental stages in fetal sheep were compared. The only other studies of ventricular zone in embryos appear to be those of Chang and Sive (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2012a</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>) in zebrafish. As in the present report, these authors used a series of different molecular sized dextrans (10&#x02013;400 kDa FITC-conjugated) injected into the cerebral ventricles of zebrafish embryos as early as 22 h post fertilization. In 24 h post fertilization embryos the smallest 10 kDa dextran &#x0201c;leaked almost immediately into the neuroepithelium, whereas the 70 kDa dextrans moved only slowly into that tissue and 2000 kDa not at all.&#x0201d; This contrasts with our results in mouse embryos (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) in which even the smallest marker barely penetrated between the cells of the ventricular zone at E17-E19. This difference in permeability of the ventricular zone in the two studies could be due to the difference in species or to the stages of development examined.</p><p>Results presented here demonstrate that at early stages of fetal mouse brain development the CSF&#x02013;brain interchange of inert lipid insoluble molecules is restricted for ones as small as 286 Da BED (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The 3 kDa probe was not detected in the brain extracellular spaces until P0 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The size restriction for free diffusion appeared to progressively relax and after P20, the CSF&#x02013;brain barrier no longer hindered diffusion of protein&#x02013;sized molecules such as BDA70 kDa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). However, both BED and BDA3 kDa were detected intracellular in the brain ventricular zone in some cells lining the lateral ventricles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This indicates that the primary mechanism involved in the potential penetration of lipid insoluble molecules, including larger compounds such as proteins (Cavanagh and Warren, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>), into the early developing brain is restricted to specific cellular uptake and does not occur by non-specific intercellular diffusion.</p><p>In the present study the distance to which each sized probe diffused at each stage of brain development was estimated. However, in such an approach, penetration of a probe <italic>in vivo</italic> does not occur in an entirely free, unrestricted diffusion pattern. Values calculated in the present study were mostly less than the calculated theoretical rate using Fick's second law (a mathematical representation of free diffusion) even after allowing longer times for larger molecules to diffuse into the brain. The difference is most likely to be due to (i) CSF flow, (ii) the ventricular surface barrier, (iii) the cellular architecture of the brain into which the probes diffuse, and (iv) bulk flow of the interstitial fluid of the brain. Nevertheless, the results obtained from such calculations indicated that by adulthood the passive diffusion of molecules as large as 70 kDa was unrestricted while earlier in development the size restriction was progressively relaxed as the brain matured (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><p>There is little information available about the rate of CSF flow in immature brains (Saunders, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>) but the flow of brain interstitial fluid was studied previously by Cserr and her colleagues (e.g., Cserr et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>; Szentistv&#x000e1;nyi et al., <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>; Cserr, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>). Their findings have been followed up recently using 2-photon microscopy (Iliff and Nedergaard, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Thrane et al., <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The brain does not appear to possess a true lymphatic system like the rest of the body, although drainage from brain interstitial fluid into the cervical lymphatics has been demonstrated by studies over more than the past 100 years (see Abbott, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Iliff and Nedergaard (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) have coined the term, the glymphatic system to describe this drainage of the bulk flow of solutes. Fluid first flows via the para&#x02013;arterial space&#x02014;or Virchow&#x02013;Robin space&#x02014;and diffuses into the interstitial fluid. The interstitial fluid and solutes then diffuse into the brain parenchyma facilitated by astrocytes that possess aquaporin&#x02013;4 (AQP&#x02013;4) which assist in water transport. AQP&#x02013;4 is expressed on the endfeet of astrocytes that line the para&#x02013;arterial and para&#x02013;venous spaces. Interstitial fluid and solutes are then drained via the para&#x02013;venous spaces, which surround major drainage veins (Iliff and Nedergaard, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Thrane et al., <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Xie et al., <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>In this study BDA probes of all three sizes were visible in the brain within many blood vessels but on closer inspection under the microscope it became apparent that these molecules were confined to the para&#x02013;vascular (Virchow&#x02013;Robin) spaces. This is illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> where an example of large vessels in the adult brain after an intraventricular injection of BDA70 kDa or BDA10 kDa is shown.</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>Paravascular distribution of biotin dextrans, following intraventricular injection</bold>.

These permeability changes and those describer earlier in fetal sheep (Fossan et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>) correlate with the presence of strap junctions in the ventricular zone of the developing brain and their subsequent disappearance at later stages of development (M&#x000f8;llg&#x000e5;rd et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>CSF and plasma protein concentration</title><p>Part of the hypothesis of this study was that changes in the permeability of the CSF&#x02013;brain barrier could be related to changes in protein concentration in the CSF (see Introduction). Results showed that the CSF protein concentration in the mouse embryo was highest at E15 followed by E17 and E19. There was a decline in protein concentration from P0 to P20. This drop in CSF protein concentration between P0 and P10 seems to coincide with the appearance of unhindered diffusion of BDA3 kDa and BDA10 kDa into the brain. The unrestricted diffusion of BDA70 kDa coincides with the drop in protein concentration between P10 and P20. By adulthood all three probes were visible in the brain extracellular space lining the ventricular system and the CSF protein concentration was at a minimum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the premature infiltration of protein into the brain during development is closely linked with altered neurogenesis (Stolp et al., <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2011b</xref>). Neurogenesis begins in the mouse ventricular zone at approximately E13.5 and astrogliogenesis begins to occur in the brain between the approximate ages of E16 and E18 (G&#x000f6;tz and Huttner, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Stolp et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2011a</xref>,<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). This is around the age when the CSF protein concentration began to drop, the permeability properties of the barrier were transforming, and when progressive remodeling of the barrier with respect to junctional proteins was beginning to occur (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular make-up of strap junctions</title><p>Strap junctions between cells lining the ventricular zone have only been described in embryonic brains (M&#x000f8;llg&#x000e5;rd et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). Their molecular structure is not known but freeze fracture images show cell-cell junctional interactions that are thought to exclude intercellular passage of molecules between CSF and the brain (Fossan et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>; M&#x000f8;llg&#x000e5;rd et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). Permeability studies described in the present study identified changes in the size of molecules able to diffuse across this interface. This is the first study in which an attempt was made to describe possible molecular make up of strap junctional complexes.</p><p>Because the molecular structure of strap junctions is not known it seems reasonable to suggest that genes that are expressed exclusively in the embryonic ventricular zone, or at least at a higher level than in the adult, will be involved in their formation. By the same token it would seem unlikely that genes expressed only or at a higher level in the adult would be involved in strap junction structure. However, the genes that are expressed at both ages, but not differentially so, could not be ruled out as contributing to strap junction structure. In fact only three such genes were identified (<italic>Actn4</italic>, <italic>Ctnna1</italic>, and <italic>Ctnnd2</italic>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>).</p><p>A striking finding was that very few of the genes known to be involved in intercellular tight junction formation (see Bauer et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Van Itallie and Anderson, <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) appear to be expressed in the ventricular zone of the lateral wall of the lateral ventricle in mouse embryos. Claudin-5 has been associated with cerebral endothelial tight junctions (Nitta et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). In this study its gene was only detected in the embryo, albeit at a rather low level (FPKM&#x02014;1.00, the lowest level of detection using this method). Our immunohistochemical results showed prominent staining for claudin-5 in endothelial cells of blood vessels in the subventricular zone at this age; but there was also some distinctive immunostaining of the apical-most part of the ventricular zone cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Claudin-5 has also been demonstrated in the ventricular zone of zebrafish embryos (Zhang et al., <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). These authors and others (e.g., Chang and Sive, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2012a</xref>) have interpreted this as indicating that the ventricular zone/neuroepithelial cells are joined by tight junctions. The transmission electron micrographs in Zhang et al. (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) are too low resolution for identification of the nature of the intercellular junctions, but loss of claudin-5 resulted in disruption of these intercellular junctions and allowed passage of lanthanum. As shown by M&#x000f8;llg&#x000e5;rd et al. (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>) it requires freeze fracture to identify these junctions as strap junctions. Otherwise in our data set transcripts for traditionally important tight junction protein genes such as occludin, MAGUK-like proteins, including ZOs, tricellulin (MarvelD2), JAMs, ESAM, were not detectable. This is in spite of their presence, as detected by immunohistochemistry, as early as E12 mouse (M&#x000f8;llg&#x000e5;rd et al., unpublished observations) and immunostaining for ZO-1 in zebrafish embryonic neuroepithelium (Zhang et al., <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The expression of <italic>Cldn5</italic> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>) and its presence demonstrated by immunohistochemistry (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>) together with lack of expression of many other tight junction genes suggests strongly that claudin-5 may be a component of strap junctions in the embryonic ventricular zone. In addition, representatives of all three of the key gene families involved in cell adhesion in epithelia (Adams et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>) were present and expressed either exclusively or at a higher level in the embryo (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). These were seven actin or actin-related genes, two cadherins, one protocadherin and four catenins. It has been thought for a long time (Adams et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>) that the actin cytoskeleton stabilizes epithelial intercellular junctions by attachment to cadherins (Hirano et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>; Matsuzaki et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>) via cytoplasmic interactions with catenins (Nagafuchi and Takeichi, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Ozawa and Kemler, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>). However, more recently this concept has been challenged and it appears that the linkage between the cadherin-catenin complex and actin filaments may be more dynamic than previously thought (Drees et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Yamada et al., <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Weis and Nelson, <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Zhang et al. (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) illustrate quite widespread immunostaining for actin in 30 h post fertilization zebrafish embryos but do not mention which antibodies were used.</p><p>In epithelia of metazoans specialized cell-cell adhesion proteins comprise the classical cadherin/&#x003b2;-catenin/&#x003b1;-catenin complex and it is the cadherins that provide the link between adjacent cells and catenins that link the cadherins to the underlying actin cytoskeleton (Miller et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Our current RNA-Seq data shows that all of the key components of intercellular adhesion junctions are present in the ventricular zone of mouse embryo lateral ventricles although some of the specific genes are different from those usually identified in adherens junctions of mammalian epithelia. The expression of these adherens junctional genes in the ventricular zone of the embryonic mouse brain is consistent with previous ultrastructural studies of the ventricular zone in the developing sheep and human brain showing the presence of well-formed adherens junctions between the cells in this region (Saunders and M&#x000f8;llg&#x000e5;rd, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>; M&#x000f8;llg&#x000e5;rd and Saunders, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>).</p><p>The ultrastructural information available shows that the ventricular zone junctions have a particular configuration of a single strand in freeze fracture, which has an orientation perpendicular to the CSF surface of the cells rather than a circumferential &#x0201c;belt-like&#x0201d; configuration typical of tight and adherens junctions; although in thin-section electron microscopy these junctions have been described as having tight junction and adhesion-like elements (M&#x000f8;llg&#x000e5;rd et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). The typical intercellular junctions in the adult ependyma are prominent gap junctions, whereas only few and small gap junctions associated with the strap junctional elements are present in the embryonic ventricular zone (see Figure 9A in M&#x000f8;llg&#x000e5;rd et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). In marked contrast to this, strap junctions are only present in the ventricular zone of the early developing brain (M&#x000f8;llg&#x000e5;rd et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). It is noteworthy that in the current study it was only in the adult that gap junction genes were identified (<italic>Gja1</italic>, <italic>Gjb1</italic>, <italic>Gjc3</italic>, see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). Also in adult ependyma only one actin-related gene was expressed at a higher level (<italic>Actr1b</italic>); in addition, one claudin (<italic>Cldn11</italic>), two Jams (<italic>Jam2</italic> and <italic>Jam3</italic>) and one plakophilin (<italic>Pkp4</italic>) were expressed at a higher level. Two catenin genes were present in adult ependyma but expressed at a much lower level than in the embryo, whereas another was expressed at the same level at the two ages. Thus, it is quite clear that the gene profile of junction-related genes is quite different in embryonic ventricular zone and in adult ependyma.</p><p>Actins, particularly &#x003b2;-actin are also important for a variety of other cellular functions some of which may be related to their presence in the ventricular zone of embryonic brain. &#x003b2;-actin has been suggested to comprise between a half to two thirds of mammalian brain actin (Choo and Bray, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1978</xref>; Otey et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>) although in a &#x003b2;-actin knock out actin levels were maintained by upregulation of &#x003b3;- and &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin; however there was about 70% perinatal lethality (Cheever et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). &#x003b2;-actin is involved in a range of cellular functions during development including migration (Ayala et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and growth cone guidance (Dent and Gertler, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). These functions may be important for the differentiation and migration of ventricular zone cells, which contribute to the formation of the layered neocortex (Moln&#x000e1;r and Clowry, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). It does seem therefore that the main families of proteins involved in strap junction formation are likely to be actins, cadherins, catenins and claudin-5. Some of these proteins were also investigated by immunohistochemistry to establish their cellular distribution (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations of the study</title><sec><title>Permeability</title><p>A number of factors may have affected the outcomes of the permeability experiments. During development the volume of the lateral ventricles changes and the distance between the ventricles and from the cerebral surface to the interior of the ventricles increases (Liddelow et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) as does the flow of CSF (Saunders, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>). Thus, the likelihood of a successfully injected probe reaching the contralateral ventricle can be variable. In order to overcome these limitations, the volume of dextran that was injected was increased with age and the time allowed for the dextran to diffuse into the contralateral ventricle was also increased. These limitations appear to be more significant in the older ages and this was reflected in the reduced number of successful injections in P20 and adult animals.</p><p>Great care was taken to inject the same volume into each ventricle at each age, but it was difficult to determine how much of this diffused into the contralateral ventricle. This limited the ability to properly measure the diffusion distances and then accurately compare them between animals. Intraperitoneal injections of these probes would at first appear to be the solution to this problem; however, with age, the amount of probe that needed to be introduced would have to be increased dramatically to offset the loss through renal excretion. Obstruction of the renal system has been used to restrict such losses thus retaining higher concentrations of marker in blood, but may represent an un-physiological state and was deemed unnecessarily stressful for the animals (Habgood et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). The most consistent approach to such experiments is an <italic>in vivo</italic> ventricular perfusion (as was done in fetal sheep, Fossan et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>). This is impracticable in mice due to their very small size, especially at fetal stages.</p></sec><sec><title>Animal ages, numbers and injection route</title><p>The small size and vulnerability of exposed fetuses meant that numbers of fetal animals with successful injections ranged between one and three experimental animals per age, mostly two separate litters. For each probe all postnatal experiments were conducted on pups from a minimum of two different litters.</p></sec><sec><title>Morphology</title><p>For the permeability studies brains were embedded in agar and cut into 100 &#x003bc;m sections using the vibratome (Leica). This method allowed for clearer observation of the diffusion of molecules into the brain. Some brains were embedded in paraffin and cut into 5 &#x003bc;m thick coronal sections. This method better indicated the cellular uptake of the probes.</p></sec><sec><title>Cellular distribution of junctional proteins</title><p>There is no information available about the molecular composition of strap junctions limiting the ability to use immunohistochemistry to detect cellular changes at this interface. Immunohistochemistry of candidate proteins was based on the RNA-Seq results. It is possible that some other junctional proteins, that were either below the detection levels or were simply not identified in the transcriptomic analysis, could also be involved. We are preparing a more comprehensive immunohistochemical study of strap junctions using all available antibodies to junctional proteins (M&#x000f8;llg&#x000e5;rd et al., unpublished observations).</p></sec><sec><title>Sampling of the lateral wall of the lateral ventricles and RNA-seq analysis</title><p>The lateral wall of both lateral ventricles was carefully dissected out under a dissecting microscope. However, it is inevitable that some tissue from the sub-ventricular layer was also obtained. This probably explains the finding of a high level of <italic>cldn11</italic> in adult mice. Tight junctions of myelin sheaths in developing subependymal oligodendrocytes were strongly positive for claudin-11/OSP (oligodendrocyte-specific protein, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>) after P10 and the developing claudin-11 positive arachnoid barrier layer present in E16 (see, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>) was not within the dissected sample. The dissected samples from E17/18 lateral telencephalic wall would have included claudin-5 positive blood vessels in the subventricular zone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>), but also in the adult subependymal layer. Claudin-5, occludin and ZO-1 are known to be present in the blood vessel tight junctions from their earliest development. In this study <italic>Occl</italic> and <italic>Tjp1</italic> (ZO-1) expression were not detected presumably because they were below the detection level. Small gap junctions also connect adjacent neuroepithelial cells in the ventricular zone but no gap junctional proteins were detected, i.e., were also below the detection level.</p><p>We avoided contamination by the choroid plexus and checked RNA-Seq datasets for choroid plexus specific genes such as transthyretin (Dickson et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>; Thomas et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>). Samples used in this study were transthyretin negative. Because of the unknown degree of possible contamination of the sample by underlying sub-ventricular zone cells, the datasets were only mined for known junctional proteins. This, in principle, limited our analysis to intercellular complexes mostly occurring in the ventricular zone/ependymal layer. It is possible that there are as yet unrecognized junctional genes in our data set that contribute to the structure of strap junctions.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have studied the permeability properties and junctional-protein characteristics of the inner CSF-brain interface during mouse brain development. Permeability of this barrier gradually changed from highly restrictive (to molecules even as small as 286 Da size) in fetal ages to unrestricted diffusion (to molecules at least as large as 70 KDa) in the adult. Molecular characterization, using RNA Sequencing of the ventricular zone (fetus) and ependyma (adult), identified several genes of known junctional proteins that are expressed at this inner CSF-brain barrier in a developmentally regulated manner. It was also found that the age-dependent changes in permeability characteristics correlate with changes in the cellular distribution of junctional proteins: cadherins, catenins and claudin-5. We suggest that these junctional proteins are involved in the formation of strap junctions and in regulation of the changing diffusional properties of this barrier. Further work will be required to establish the scope of the control mechanisms in the CSF-brain interface during development and their significance for normal brain development.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abbott</surname><given-names>N.
