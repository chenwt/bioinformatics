Six thousand sequence baits were designed to target <italic>Dic2</italic> vs. <italic>Silur</italic> polymorphisms discovered in a previous RNAseq study. These baits were exposed to genomic DNA of the RIL population. Eighty percent of the targeted SNPs were recovered, 65% of which were of high quality and coverage.

Durum wheat [<italic>Triticum turgidum</italic> (L.) subsp. <italic>turgidum</italic> (L.) convar. <italic>durum</italic> (Desf.)] accounts for about 10% of the total global wheat production (World Grain Statistic, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.igc.int">www.igc.int</ext-link>). It is a minor crop compared to bread wheat, which is the focus of considerable efforts with regard to breeding new high performance cultivars, genomic investigations and resource developments. In this respect, new omics resources developed under the umbrella of the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Initiative (IWGSC) represents a major input for all Triticeae genomic approaches [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Durum wheat (<italic>Triticum turgidum</italic> subsp. <italic>durum</italic>) is a modern representative of a group of allotetraploid subspecies (<italic>Triticum turgidum</italic> subsp.) that were domesticated from the wild <italic>T</italic>. <italic>turgidum dicoccoides</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is closely related to bread wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.), which arose via spontaneous interspecific hybridization between a domesticated <italic>T</italic>. <italic>turgidum</italic> spp. form (AB genomes, 2n = 4x = 28) and the wild diploid <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>tauschii</italic> (D genome, 2n = 14) [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>As durum wheat and bread wheat share two closely related genomes, molecular tools and basic research are mostly focused on bread wheat and are secondarily used for durum wheat breeding [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Molecular tools are now crucial for rapid and efficient breeding [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], so genotyping tools are constantly studied and being improved. Numerous durum wheat genetic maps have already been developed as described below. The number and type of markers used to build these genetic maps have both evolved rapidly over the last decades. The first genetic maps have been built with a few hundred loci based on restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers or amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], In the early 2000s, the development of PCR markers such as SSRs, EST-SSRs, or DArTs [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] led to an increase in molecular resources while streamlining protocols. These new resources, which are often developed for the most important economic species (e.g. bread wheat), have therefore facilitated genotyping of secondary crops such as tetraploid wheat. Map resolution has thus been improved [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], while facilitating the delimitation of chromosome regions involved in the control of agronomical traits [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and relevant comparisons of local recombination rates have been published [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, bridging information from different single cross maps has allowed high density consensus maps to be built based on several thousand markers. These have improved genome coverage, proposed a validation of marker ordering, and reduced large gaps due partly to the absence of polymorphism between parents [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Single nuclear polymorphisms (SNPs) in coding and noncoding sequences have recently become favorable markers for building high-density genetic maps thanks for their high abundance in the genome [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Rapid advances in sequencing capabilities and dramatic cost reductions have facilitated genome-wide discovery of SNPs, even for polyploid species such as wheat [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The reduction of genomic complexity via techniques such as RNAseq sequencing can help generate large SNP databases for bread wheat [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and durum wheat [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These techniques can also be used for designing large-scale DNA microarrays for wheat [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] or for genotyping by sequencing [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. But few specific durum wheat tools are currently available. For example, although durum wheat polymorphisms have been used on the recent wheat 90K iSelect array <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wheatgenomics.plantpath.ksu.edu">http://wheatgenomics.plantpath.ksu.edu</ext-link>), most polymorphisms were of bread wheat origin [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Nevertheless, such arrays can only reveal polymorphisms documented on large panels encompassing broad temporal (old and elite cultivars) and geographical diversity. When used on durum wheat, they generated good results for building maps, but few studies have dealt with elite x elite crosses [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Moreover, as such arrays are primarily focused on genotyping elite material, they may lack some polymorphisms specific to wild and ancient germplasm, such as the wild <italic>T</italic>. <italic>turgidum</italic> subsp. Lastly, this technology is remarkably cost efficient per data point for projects requiring a high number of polymorphisms, such as GWAS studies, but it remains expensive for genetic mapping, diversity surveys or genomic prediction programs when interesting SNPs have been identified. Medium throughput technology built on parental specific polymorphism may represent a valuable alternative to high throughput microarrays for several applications.</p><p>Array uses fluorescent technology, which also limits data interpretation, especially in a polyploid context with closely related sequences, like homeologous genes, where intralocus heterozygous states can be easily confused with interlocus divergence. Genotyping by sequencing thus appears to be a promising alternative and could be used even for <italic>de novo</italic> genotyping of large populations at low cost [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A first set of technologies is based on an efficient method involving genome complexity reduction combined with multiplex sequencing. Restriction associated DNA tagging (RAD) [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] or double digestion RAD (ddRAD) [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] target the genomic sequence flanking restriction enzyme sites to produce a reduced representation of the genome. However, GBS does not enable targeting of specific sequences in the genome and always encounters difficulties when dealing with complex polyploid genomes such as durum wheat presenting homeologous loci and many repetitive sequences [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Sequencing transcribed portions of the genome using RNA extracted from standardized tissues (RNAseq) is also a good alternative since the transcribed gene-coding regions represent only one to two percent of the whole genome [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Genotyping by sequencing large populations using RNAseq is feasible but, unfortunately, transcriptomic libraries are more costly than genomic libraries and this method leads to a high rate of missing data due to the presence of low expressed genes and the dependence of some gene expression on specific tissue or environmental conditions [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Whole exome capture [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] was shown to be an effective strategy to reduce genome complexity. It paves the way to genotyping by sequencing of complex genomes [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and to discovering a tremendous number of gene polymorphisms. This approach requires a good reference genome to map the reads properly, enabling a proper calling of allelic intralocus variations, exploiting the divergence between homeologous gene copies [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This approach is now possible since large resources are available for wheat genome [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], in addition to the durum wheat transcriptome [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Whole exome capture (WEC) is a very powerful approach but is still costly when coverage of the whole genome is not needed.</p><p>In this case, reducing the number of captures to a small set of targeted polymorphisms is an efficient <italic>ad hoc</italic> genome reduction technique, notably in cases where polymorphisms have already been identified in a set of parental lines. Baits are synthesized from a documented set of SNPs and hybridized to genomic DNA for capturing relevant homologous fragments that are subsequently sequenced. Baits would also capture fragments highly homeologous and/or paralogous to the targeted sequence. The resulting reads could be nevertheless assigned properly and could permit the disclosure of untargeted SNPs.</p><p>Specific capture ensures that the population will be polymorphic at most targeted positions, once a given sequencing error level is accepted. Deep sequencing of relatively few targets (~5000) should also ensure a good coverage of those targeted loci, thus reducing the risk of missing data. This technique appears to be especially well adapted for the construction of dense genetic maps since the bait design can maximize the number of targeted contigs, as sequencing will reveal all SNPs in the contig area for which the bait has been designed. Targeting specific loci permits spreading of future markers along chromosomes, thus maximizing the detection of recombination events, which is a desirable feature for genetic map building. The density of the bait design can be very easily adapted in regions of interest (e.g. higher density nearby known QTL). Finally, sequence knowledge around an SNP eases the design of competitive allele-specific PCR markers (KASPar) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.kbioscience.co.uk">http://www.kbioscience.co.uk</ext-link>), which are attractive, cost effective and easy to use markers for breeders in routine breeding programs [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Here we report results of sequencing fragments captured with specific allelic baits applied on a durum wheat bi-parental segregating RIL population. The bait design is precisely described. We analyzed the capture efficiency and identified some caveats inducing the capture of off-target repetitive microsatellite sequences likely due to a daisy chain effect [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Genotyping by sequencing data has been successfully used to build a high density genetic map comparable to recently published maps using the 90K iSelect array.

The cleaning step resulted in 2.5 million usable reads per sample on average (min: 0.3 M, max: 5.5 M), with an average of 0.3 million orphan reads.</p><p>Read mapping revealed a high degree of on-target enrichment efficiency for all accessions. Indeed, on average, 86% of the reads were mapped on DWr, which denoted a low degree of hybridization between baits and off-target DNA.</p><p>However, a high number of reads were accumulated on some microsatellite-like regions within contigs that were not carrying baits and 20 DWr contigs accounted for more than 42% of the total number of mapped reads. This phenomenon was due to the presence of microsatellite-like regions nearby the SNP targeted in these contigs, thus capturing thousands of small reads containing repetitive elements.</p><p>This means that some of our baits may have captured genomic fragments carrying microsatellites, even though none of our baits could have been considered as a &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; microsatellite. Close inspection of our baits revealed that very few of them (96) were carrying a 7-mer of dinucleotide repeated element or a 5-mer of trinucleotide repeated element.</p><p>Direct capture of long stretches of repetitive DNA such as microsatellite patterns by the baits seemed unlikely. The fact that we did not detect any other strongly repeated sequence in our reads suggests that the corresponding fragments were indeed captured primarily by our baits but successively amplified by a daisy-chain effect on non-targeted microsatellite capture. The daisy-chaining principle was first introduced in a cross hybridization context that used a standard adapter at the ends of each fragment of the genomic library. Blocking oligonucleotides must be used during the hybridization phase of the adapters to avoid these unexpected technical captures and reduce the adapter size [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We believe that in our case, we initiated a genomic daisy-chaining process among the multitude of wheat DNA fragments carrying microsatellite sequences. Although we could not be certain that we identified the &#x0201c;guilty&#x0201d; baits, we removed them from the bait database provided in the supporting information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0154609.s006">S5 File</xref>). Using a blocking agent made of identified microsatellites might also reduce this daisy-chain effect and improve the target capture efficiency.</p><p>This huge presence of repetitive elements did not prevent capture of the targeted SNPs. Indeed, only 6% of the targeted positions were not covered at all. The median number of reads received per targeted contig per individual was 11.4.</p><p>Among the 6,240 targeted loci, 5,301 were thus recovered, but 768 of them designed on EPO were found to be monomorphic between <italic>Dic2</italic> and <italic>Silur</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0154609.t002">Table 2</xref>).

From this set, 2,822 SNPs were genotyped for more than 100 individuals. These SNPs made up the ER-clean-SNP dataset. Finally, 45% of the total targeted SNPs were recovered.

The biggest gap per chromosome is 15 cM long on average.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Map validation</title><p>On average, more than 80% of the markers within any LG shared a common putative assignment on BWr (min of 57% on LG 10 and maximum of 100% for LG 11, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0154609.s007">S1 Table</xref>). Moreover, 86% of the inconsistencies observed between mapping assignments and putative assignment were due to homoeologous competitive-genome assignment (e.g. marker attributed to chromosome 1A instead of 1B). SNPs located in a gene having a very close homeolog could not receive a reliable chromosome assignment, leading to putative chromosome assignment errors. Moreover, if one of the two homoeologous copies of genes was not present in BWr for any reason, the corresponding reads automatically mapped on the corresponding homeo-genome, hence creating confusion. We thus considered, when hesitating between homeologous chromosomes, that the assignment revealed by genetic mapping was more reliable (and thus used) than the putative assignment obtained by blast on BWr.</p><p>Some putative chromosome assignment inconsistencies were also observed between non-homeologous chromosomes for 2% of the markers, as summarized in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0154609.s008">S2 Table</xref>. For example, 11 markers were mapped on chromosome 7A, but they had a putative assignment on chromosome 4A of BWr. The same situation was observed between 4B and 5A (8 markers). The converse situations were also observed (4A-7A and 5A-4B, 7 markers and 4 markers, respectively). These situations always concerned markers grouped together on the genetic map and that had close putative physical positions on BWr (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0154609.s001">S1 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0154609.s008">S2 Table</xref>). DWr contigs containing these markers were blasted on the barley genome assembly proposed by the International Barley Genome Sequencing Consortium [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Only blasts with similarity higher than 95% were kept, and the best blast hit of each DWr contig was determined using the blastn e-value. Homologous genes were found for 21 of the 30 DWr contigs presenting inconsistencies and were always grouped on the same chromosome. For two of these blocks (LG 23 and 17), durum wheat shared a similar ancestral chromosome assignment with barley, while bread wheat carried a translocation. The reverse situation was observed for the two other blocks (LG 12 and 13) where bread wheat had the same chromosome structure as barley and durum wheat carried translocations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0154609.s008">S2 Table</xref>).</p><p>In the vast majority of cases, the marker order was very consistent with physical putative positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154609.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation coefficients ranged from 0.65 (2A) to 1 (5A), with an average of 0.93. These coefficients were also very high with the genetic positions of the IWGSC zipper, with an average coefficient of 0.93 (min: 0.74; max: 0.97). For each comparison, only one chromosome presented a coefficient of below 0.9, i.e. chromosome 2A when comparing with the putative physical position, and chromosome 5B when comparing with the putative genetic positions. As the Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation coefficients between the physical and genetic putative positions themselves were only 0.65 and 0.78 for chromosome 2A and 5A, it may indicate a discrepancy between the genetic (IWGSC zipper) and physical putative positions (POPSEQ data [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]) within the bread wheat reference itself. Our data suggests that the most likely order on the centromeric region of the 2A chromosome is the one proposed by the genetic position of the zipper. This can explain the negative slope of our polynomial regression observed on the centromeric region of the chromosome 2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154609.g003">Fig 3</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0154609.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0154609.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Correlations between putative physical and genetic positions.</title><p>The 14 durum wheat chromosomes are shown separately, with the putative physical position on the X-axis (bp) and the genetic position on the Y-axis (cM).

The adjusted R square ranged from 0.86 to 0.99, with an average of 0.94, and enabled us to identify a few markers outside of the 95% confidence interval (1.7% of the markers on average). Thirty-seven markers were found to be outside of the confidence interval and were thus considered as intra-chromosomal inconsistencies. Chromosome 3B had the highest number of outlier markers (8 markers). Several chromosomes present only one outlier (3A, 5B, 7A, 7B). As many of the outlier markers had multiple blast hits on the bread wheat reference, the inconsistencies could likely be explained by their membership to duplicate/multiple gene families. Consequently, better is to consider their mapping position correct instead of their blast assignment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="sec016"><title>Specific allelic capture is tailored for population genotyping</title><p>Genotyping by capture targeted polymorphisms was found to be a powerful tool for characterizing a whole population on the basis of thousands of SNPs. Eighty-five percent of the targeted polymorphic SNPs were recovered, and 65% were of high quality, thus ensuring the relevance of the genetic map. This technique also led to the discovery of untargeted SNPs on homeologous or paralogous genes, which added information on loci that were not formerly detected as polymorphic. The presence of bonus SNPs is an important feature of the genotyping by capture technique since bonus SNPs accounted for 26% of the final number of SNPs (3790).</p><sec id="sec017"><title>Capture provides fewer but more informative SNPs than arrays</title><p>Arrays are currently considered as the most powerful and practical way to genotype a population, but GBS on whole exomes may also become a medium throughput genotyping tool, even for complex species like wheat [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Once designed, arrays have major advantages: high-density, simplicity, low missing data rate and no need for labor-intensive bioinformatics treatment. Their main caveats are a lack of flexibility for some applications when used on specific germplasm that differs from the panel upon which the polymorphism was established, for medium density coverage of several thousands of SNPs (e.g. for mapping) and when the cost per individual is an issue.</p><p>Working on durum wheat and developing maps on specific parents, genotyping by sequencing targeted captures appeared to be suitable in our case and the obtained results confirmed the efficiency of the technique. The possibility of targeting specific loci had several advantages. First we were able to develop markers on loci known to be polymorphic in our two contrasted parents. This was especially interesting in our case since many SNPs on the 90K iSelect array were monomorphic on durum wheat even though 16 durum varieties were used to screen for polymorphisms [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This array was recently used to build a high density consensus framework map [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] based on 10 populations. The number of recovered SNPs per mapping population increased from 2,567 (2.9%) in elite x elite crosses to 10,911 (12.1%) in highly polymorphic crosses involving the emmer wheat <italic>T</italic>. <italic>dicoccum</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0154609.s009">S3 Table</xref>). Elite x elite populations are much harder to map due to their lack of polymorphism, which could explain the low density of the maps obtained with the 90K iSelect array.</p><p>In our case, we targeted 6,240 existing SNPs in the parents and recovered 3790 SNPs (61%), including the bonus-SNP dataset. Roughly comparing the number of SNPs was not sufficient here. As the baits were deliberately designed to sample existing polymorphisms in a maximum of different contigs, it enhanced the mapping accuracy by maximizing the chance of detecting recombination at distant loci. This was clearly noted when comparing the number of unique mapping positions between our map and the 10 durum maps from the 90K iSelect array. The latter maps had between 580 (for elite x elite) and 2,056 unique positions (for emmer x elite), i.e. between 9 and 35% of the total number of markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0154609.s009">S3 Table</xref>), while our map was built at 1,624 unique positions for 3,790 markers (43%). As the number of RILs were comparable, even though the number of markers was lower for capture than for the iselect array, it had a higher capacity for spotting distinct loci among chromosomes.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Bait captures more than just an SNP</title><p>Genotyping by capture provides information on the surrounding genomic context of the targeted SNP markers. Indeed, baits are derived from known contigs, so the surrounding sequence is known for lengths of at least 120 or 200 bp. These surrounding sequences can be highly useful for designing ready to use genome-specific KASPAR markers for breeding.</p><p>Confusion between homeo-genomes is a recurrent problem for polyploid species when the divergence between genomes A and B is low. On a targeted position, it may be impossible to unravel the two genomes once captured [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], leading to loci with a high degree of heterozygosity that are ultimately discarded. Capturing both genomes with genomic surrounding sequences has the double advantage of maximizing the chance of unravelling them and finding new SNPs.</p><p>Clearly, a bait can capture untargeted homologous genomic sequences (e.g. homeologs, paralogs). Ideally, this complexity should be addressed by using a complete reference for mapping the reads. Indeed, if the reference contains all existing homologous sequences, then the reads will likely be properly mapped, SNPs adequately identified and genotypes accurately called. In our case, as durum wheat is not sequenced, and as the bread wheat sequence is not fully complete, slightly divergent from durum and contains copy number variations among individuals [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], we preferred to use our DWr reference based on RNAseq [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Problems related to undocumented homologous sequences in the reference can lead to excess heterozygosity. In our case, the number of SNPs with excess heterozygous genotypes was very low (3%), which confirms the quality of our DW reference and that 120 bp are sufficient for overcoming most homolog-related ambiguity.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>SNP capture is cheap and easy to handle</title><p>Exon capture is efficient for deciphering gene complexity in wheat [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] but still cannot be used routinely to genotype large populations at a reasonable cost. To this regard, using capture on restricted genomic fragments could bring efficient complementary tools for genotyping relatively large populations at reasonable cost. Bioinformatics treatments are facilitated by the marked reduction in genome complexity due to the low percentage of genomes actually sequenced. The cost of SNP capture could thus become very attractive in situations where either DNA arrays are not available or not adapted (medium size and medium throughput situations), and since whole exome capture remains unaffordable for specific purposes such as mapping or genomic selection.</p><p>Our entire protocol is based on the possibility of buying bait batches (we used the minimum purchase of 20,000 baits, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mycroarray.com/">http://www.mycroarray.com/</ext-link>) for a particular program, allowing the capture of 576 (12&#x000d7;48) genomic libraries in our current conditions. The cost of these individual libraries, already optimized [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], is still around &#x020ac;10. Sequencing a multiplex of 192 captured libraries on a single lane of Hiseq3000 Illumina sequencer puts the final cost of data production at about &#x020ac;28&#x02013;30 per genotype in our conditions. By data point, the cost could appear more expensive than genotyping by sequencing (GBS) or microarrays, but GBC on targeted polymorphisms is more accurate than GBS in complex species like durum wheat, and does not require the initial investments for a micro-array development. Furthermore, GBC allows for a very quick adjustment between individuals number and SNP number, i.e., increasing multiplexing and reducing the number of targeted genes, and it does not depend on a specific platform to call the genotypes.</p><p>This study showed that only two 120 bp baits were enough to capture a locus. This makes future genotyping experiments targeting 10,000 SNPs possible, therefore considerably decreasing the price per data point. Moreover, genotyping by capture was found to be an appropriate tool for maximizing pooling for sequencing. The main caveat in our experiment concerned the large number of reads mapping in microsatellite-rich regions. We expect that substantial progress could be achieved in this respect, hence significantly increasing the number of effective reads, by using of an ad&#x02019;hoc blocking DNA and avoiding to design baits in microsatellite rich contigs.</p><p>Working on other durum wheat populations (including elite x elite) will help assemble a database of tested useful baits targeting 10,000 SNPs located in as many contigs. This set could be used to score very large populations for few SNPs by selecting only the most relevant baits for the task, hence allowing drastic increases in multiplexing. It could also be used for targeting 10,000 or more SNPs on few individuals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>High quality genetic map</title><p>Genotyping by capture of targeted loci enabled us to obtain a dense high quality genetic map of 3,729 markers containing 1,624 unique positions.</p><sec id="sec021"><title>Highly dense SNP capture genetic map</title><p>Our map has almost as many markers as individual maps obtained by the 90K iSelect array [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], but provides about twofold more unique positions per SNP.

Such chromosome assignment swaps occurred between loci of chromosomes 7A-4A and 4B-5A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0154609.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The long arms of chromosomes 4A and 5A, and the short arm of chromosome 7B of Chinese Spring have already been reported to be involved in interchange.

Secondly, the two maps gave a very close and low recombination rate in the 200&#x02013;600 Mb pericentromeric segment, i.e. 0.06 cM/Mb in DS and 0.07 cM/Mb in the tetraploid consensus map ([<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154609.g003">Fig 3</xref>). These two observations suggest an increase in recombination intensity at the distal end of 3BL, as already described [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec024"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study demonstrates the feasibility of a genotyping by capture approach for complex polyploid species such as durum wheat, and confirmed that it is a reliable strategy for genotyping whole populations for thousands of SNPs. The set of baits required to genotype this population is provided with a real effort made to localize the proposed markers. These resources will likely be useful for other mapping populations including a <italic>T</italic>. <italic>dicoccum</italic> parent. The capture efficiency could also be improved by targeting more loci and taking care concerning the bait area in order to avoid the presence of microsatellite repetitive elements.</p><p>Genotyping by capture could be used to easily target durum elite specific polymorphisms. Nevertheless it is still hard to predict if seeking polymorphism in coding sequence (using RNAseq as has been done here or in the 90K iSelect array) will be sufficient to get polymorphism in area deeply depressed by the successive bottlenecks experienced by elite durum [<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154609.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In this case, baits could also be based on polymorphism identified in non-coding genomic sequences and already tested on microarrays such as the Breedwheat Axiom 420 K (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.breedwheat.fr/">www.breedwheat.fr/</ext-link>). As whole exome capture is developing, preliminary sequencing of a set of interesting parents followed by the development of specific baits would help to rapidly identify recombinants in large population sets or to map efficiently interconnected mapping populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec025"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0154609.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Correlations between putative physical and genetic positions.</title><p>The 14 durum wheat chromosomes are shown on the same plot, with the putative physical position of SNPs on the X-axis (bp) and the genetic position on the Y-axis (cM).
