Praziquantel (PZQ) is the drug used currently to cure schistosomiasis. It is safe, affordable and effective against the three major species of schistosomes infecting humans (<italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>haematobium and S</italic>. <italic>japonicum</italic>) but its massive administration in endemic areas has increased the likelihood of emergence of PZQ-tolerant parasites [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, there is a necessity to find new drugs and targets against schistosomes, and inhibiting parasite reproduction could be an excellent strategy to control both transmission and pathology of schistosomiasis. Indeed, the pathology mainly results from the impressive fertility of female worms which lay hundreds of eggs every day. Trapping of parasite eggs in host tissues finally causes severe disorders, particularly hepatosplenomegaly, hepatic fibrosis, and bladder cancer [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Protein kinases, and particularly tyrosine kinases (TKs), play important roles in development and metabolism. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling networks are essential for many cellular activities such as growth, proliferation, differentiation or migration, and they represent major targets in anti-cancer therapy [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Different studies have demonstrated the importance of TKs in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> gametogenesis and egg production indicating that parasite kinases are interesting targets for the development of new therapeutics against schistosomes [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Particularly, we have recently demonstrated the importance of Venus Kinase Receptors (VKRs) in the control of reproduction in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. VKRs are atypical RTKs formed by an extracellular Venus Fly Trap (VFT) domain associated via a single transmembrane domain with an intracellular TK domain similar to that of insulin receptors (IR) [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Since their discovery in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> in 2003 [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], VKRs have been identified in diverse invertebrate phyla including platyhelminths, arthropods, annelids, mollusks, echinoderms, and cnidarians [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Their function in reproduction has been confirmed in the mosquito <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> recently [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Most of the organisms studied express a single VKR but in several species, multiple vkr genes are present and encode different VKR homologs [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Two VKR molecules, SmVKR1 and SmVKR2, are expressed in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic>, and they were shown to participate in the development of the ovary in female worms. SmVKR1 and SmVKR2 are two different receptors that are activated by distinct ligands [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. First evidence was obtained that these schistosome VKRs can differentially induce kinase signaling pathways. When they were expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, each receptor activated both ERK2 and Akt pathways but only SmVKR1 was able to induce JNK phosphorylation [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Src Homology-2 (SH2) domain-containing protein B (Shb) proteins are pleiotropic adaptor proteins that convey signals from membrane RTKs to intracellular signaling intermediates. They possess a C-terminal SH2 domain and a central PhosphoTyrosine Binding (PTB) domain both involved in interaction with phosphorylated tyrosines, as well as an N-terminal Proline-rich sequence that binds SH3 domains [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Shb proteins enable protein-protein interactions and serve as platforms linking activated RTKs to various downstream signaling partners [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>In this paper, we show that a <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> Shb protein (SmShb) interacts with the membrane receptor SmVKR1. This interaction is dependent on the phosphorylation of the juxtamembrane Y<sub>979</sub> residue of SmVKR1, occurs through the SH2 domain of SmShb, and allows the activation of a specific JNK signaling pathway in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization shows that SmShb transcripts localize as Smvkr1 transcripts [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] in the reproductive organs of the parasite and SmShb silencing experiments exhibit morphological effects within the testes suggesting a role of SmShb in sperm migration. All together, these data describe for the first time a molecular function of Shb proteins in JNK signaling and suggest the potential importance of SmShb in development and/or reproduction of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All experiments involving hamsters within this study have been performed in accordance with the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and other Scientific Purposes (ETS No 123; revised Appendix A) and have been approved by the committee for ethics in animal experimentation of the region Nord Pas de Calais France (authorization No. AF/2009) in the local animal house of the Pasteur Institute of Lille (Agreement No. A59-35009).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Parasite material</title><p>A Puerto-Rican strain of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> is maintained by passage through albino <italic>Biomphalaria glabrata</italic> snails and <italic>Mesocricetus auratus</italic> golden hamsters.

Indeed, co-expression of SmShb with SmVKR2 F<sub>949</sub>Y induced the activation of a JNK pathway in oocytes which did not exist with SmVKR2 wild type and blocked ERK2 and PI3K/Akt/S6K pathways as well as GVBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163283.g006">Fig 6</xref>). The specific role of SmShb in the induction of JNK activation by both SmVKR1 and SmVKR2 F<sub>949</sub>Y was supported by the demonstration that the activation of JNK in the presence of SmShb was blocked by an excess of SH2<sub>SmShb</sub> protein that acts as a negative dominant of SmShb but not by an excess of SH2-deleted SmShb protein (SmShb<sup>&#x00394;SH2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163283.g007">Fig 7</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0163283.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0163283.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>SmVKR-SmShb interaction induces JNK pathway.</title><p><italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes were co-injected with cRNAs encoding V5-SmVKR1 WT or Y<sub>979</sub>F or V5-SmVKR2 WT or F<sub>949</sub>Y and SmShb and incubated with 1&#x003bc;M L-Arginine or 1mM Ca<sup>++</sup> respectively.

Linking is mediated by diverse specific binding domains, like SH2 and PTB or SH3, which recognize phosphorylated tyrosines or poly-proline sequences, respectively. Shb is an adaptor protein containing an N-terminal Pro-rich domain, a central PTB domain and a C-terminal SH2 domain. The SH2 domain interacts with diverse phosphorylated RTKs preferentially at a pY-T/V/I-X-L binding site [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In contrast, the Pro-rich domain can recruit SH3-containing proteins like Src, p85 PI3K, PLC-&#x003b3;, c-Abl, Janus Kinase (JAK), Grb2 or Eps8. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Shb in turn generates binding sites for other SH2-containing partners making Shb an essential platform to transduce various cellular signals [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Shb proteins are ubiquitously expressed and generate variable complexes depending on the cell type and on the conditions of cell activation. Therefore, they have unique effects either in differentiation, proliferation, survival or motility [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The Shb SH2 domain binds to PDGF-R[<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], FGFR-1 [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], VEGFR-2 [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], NGF-R [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] to regulate apoptosis, proliferation, cell migration, and differentiation respectively in fibroblasts, endothelial, and neuronal cells through the modulation of Ras/MEK/MAPK and PI3K kinase pathways. Shb can modulate c-Abl pro-apoptotic signaling in response to stress stimuli by interacting with SH2 and SH3 domains of the Abl kinase and regulating its activity [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In mouse embryonic stem cells, the absence of Shb impairs various aspects of differentiation, suggesting a role of Shb in development [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].

This paper presents i) the first characterization of an invertebrate Shb protein expressed by a platyhelminth parasite, ii) its interaction with an unusual RTK, VKR, which specifically occurs in invertebrates, iii) the demonstration for the first time of the potential participation of Shb to JNK activation, and iv) the hypothesis that this pathway could be involved in gamete mobility and thus in reproduction.</p><p>The protein SmShb has a structure similar to other proteins of the Shb family with the exception of the PTB domain, a sequence demonstrated to interact with the FAK focal adhesion kinase [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which was not identified in SmShb. Phylogenetic analyses however, confirm that SmShb belongs to the Shb family and is distinct from Shc, Grb2, Grb7 or Nck proteins which represent other SH2-containing adaptors largely recognized for their capacity to bind to activated RTKs and for their involvement in signaling.</p><p>Since their first discovery in 2003 [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], VKRs have been identified in various organisms and shown to be expressed in larval stages and gonads of several animal species [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Recent advances demonstrated their importance for reproduction in the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> parasite and in the insect <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] but their functions in signaling remain elusive. In this work, we identified the protein SmShb as an interacting partner of SmVKR1.</p><p>Indeed, analyses of the capacity of SmShb to interact with various known RTKs of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic>, ie SmVKR1, SmVKR2, SmIR1 and SmIR2, expressed either in their normal or in their active kinase states, have shown that the intracellular domain of the constitutively active SmVKR1 kinase was the only one to offer binding sites for SmShb. Identical results were obtained from interaction studies in yeast and in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. We also provided evidence that the specific binding of SmShb to the phosphorylated form of SmVKR1 was mediated by its SH2 domain and through the unique motif pY<sub>979</sub>ENL located in the intracellular part of SmVKR1, just next to the transmembrane domain. Mapping of the phosphorylable tyrosines present within the SmVKR1 intracellular sequence effectively indicated that only the residue Y<sub>979</sub> was susceptible to be part of the consensus motif pYxxL for Shb SH2 domain binding [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Mutagenesis experiments then allowed us to confirm that Y<sub>979</sub> was a crucial residue for the interaction between phosphorylated SmVKR1 and SmShb. Moreover, in the case of SmVKR2 which does not bind SmShb (and possesses a juxtamembrane F<sub>949</sub>EEL in place of the Y<sub>979</sub>ENL of SmVKR1), the replacement of F<sub>949</sub> by a tyrosine residue was sufficient to allow its interaction with SmShb. These data indicated that a juxtamembrane motif pYExL in SmVKR was necessary and sufficient to allow interaction with SmShb. SmIR1 and SmIR2 insulin receptors, which do not possess similar motifs in their juxtamembrane regions, did not bind SmShb. However, it is important to mention that, in the experimental conditions used for SmVKR receptors, the activated <italic>Schistosoma</italic> EGF receptor (SER), which contains a juxtamembrane YxxL (YTNL) motif similarly to that of SmVKR1, did not bind SmShb (results not shown). This suggests that the Y+1 residue E could be required for SH2<sub>SmShb</sub> binding. Additionally, it is possible that the interaction between SmShb and SmVKRs requires the participation of specific residues surrounding the phosphorylated tyrosine, such as proline at Y-1 and cysteine at Y+4 positions. Indeed, these residues are common to SmVKR1 (PpYENLC) and mutated F<sub>949</sub>Y SmVKR2 (PpYEELC) but they are not present in SER (ApYTNLL). Further experiments are still necessary to fully define the binding site of SmShb on SmVKRs, and to check for possible interaction of this adaptor protein with several other RTKs already characterized in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic>, particularly with the parasite FGF-R receptors [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. As mammal Shb proteins have been shown to interact with a large variety of RTKs [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], we cannot exclude that SmShb interacts as well with other schistosome RTKs. Furthermore, this result indicates that changing the pYExL motif to FEEL allows discrimination of SmVKRs by their potential downstream interaction partners substantiating the view that different and non-redundant roles of the schistosome VKRs have evolved after the duplication event of the first schistosome VKR gene. More largely, a possible species-restriction of the binding between Shb and VKR proteins could exist since we have observed that AgVKR from the mosquito <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> was not able to interact with SmShb while inversely the SH2 domain of AgShb (XP_309808.4), which shares about 40% homology with SH2<sub>SmShb</sub>, interacted with AgVKR but not with SmVKR1 (results not shown).</p><p>In a previous study we have demonstrated that the activation of SmVKR1 and SmVKR2 induced ERK2 and PI3K/Akt/S6K pathways in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes and that only SmVKR1 activated the phosphorylation of JNK [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In this work, we showed that in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes ligand-activation of SmVKR1 in the presence of SmShb resulted in JNK phosphorylation, but at the same time in a blockade of ERK and PI3K pathways and as a consequence in the inhibition of meiosis resumption in the oocyte. These results already suggested that SmShb could be involved in the initiation of a JNK cascade activation and further experiments performed with the SmVKR2 receptor mutated to be able to bind SmShb then confirmed the potential role of SmShb in the induction of JNK activation. Ligand activation of SmVKR2 F<sub>949</sub>Y in oocytes in the presence of SmShb generated a phenotype similar to that of ligand-activated SmVKR1, with a stimulation of the JNK pathway concomitant to the inhibition of ERK and PI3K pathways and GVBD. To our knowledge, the participation of Shb proteins in the activation of JNK has not been shown in mammalian cells, but their function in the regulation of ERK and Akt signaling has been described in Shb-deficient mice [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The loss of Shb provoked an increase of ERK or Akt signaling in different cells, suggesting that Shb could facilitate cell differentiation by negatively modulating ERK and Akt activation. Consistently, our results confirm here the function of SmShb in the inhibition of ERK and Akt signalling which are two predominant VKR pathways.</p><p>SmVKR1 and SmShb were expressed in all parasite stages with a more important quantity of transcripts detected in larval stages as compared to adult parasites. However, in sexually mature <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic>, both types of transcripts were co-localized in reproductive organs (mature oocytes and testes), suggesting that SmVKR1 and Shb proteins could interact within gametes. However, SmShb silencing in adult worm pairs did not provide solid morphological arguments for a decisive role of SmVKR1-SmShb interaction in the ovary. Knocking-down of SmVKR1 had shown an accumulation of big oocytes [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which has not been as obvious in the ovaries of SmShb-silenced females. However, SmShb knock-down in male schistosomes led to an accumulation of differentiated gametes in testes, a phenotype which was not observed before in SmVKR1-silenced males [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. As many other RTKs, VKRs probably exert pleiotropic functions and induce the activation of various signaling pathways controlling metabolism, growth and differentiation. Moreover, Shb proteins, whose expression has been shown to be tightly controlled in cells [<xref rid="pone.0163283.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], are multifaceted signaling partners for diverse RTKs and their platform-based activities are strictly dependent on the cellular context including receptor activation and tissue- and stage-dependent expression of potential binding partners. This is supported by our recent studies describing many proteins as potential partners of SmShb and whose identities revealed their functions in various biological processes. This in turn explains that the congruence of Smvkr1 and SmShb RNAi phenotypes was small. Nonetheless, localization and RNAi results provided a first view on SmShb function, which is associated with gametogenesis.</p><p>In conclusion, SmShb appears to be a component of a signal transduction platform specifically formed by activated SmVKR1. In this molecular context activated SmShb has the potential to mediate the activation of a JNK pathway and negatively modulate ERK- and Akt-dependent metabolism and proliferation pathways, supporting cell differentiation and development pathways. SmShb and SmVKR1 are expressed in all the stages of the parasite and they are particularly abundant in larval forms. It would be interesting to unravel the importance of their partnership in the development of other <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> stages such as schistosomula and sporocysts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0163283.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Gene organization of SmShb.</title><p>(A) Exon-intron structure of SmShb locus.
