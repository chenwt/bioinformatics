Its basal phylogenetic position within the dinoflagellates make <italic>O. marina </italic>useful for understanding the origin of numerous unusual features of the dinoflagellate lineage; its broad distribution has lent <italic>O. marina </italic>to the study of protist biogeography; and nutritive flexibility and eurytopy have made it a common lab rat for the investigation of physiological responses of marine heterotrophic flagellates. Nevertheless, genome-scale resources for <italic>O. marina </italic>are scarce. Here we present a 454-based transcriptome survey for this organism. In addition, we assess sequence read abundance, as a proxy for gene expression, in response to salinity, an environmental factor potentially important in determining <italic>O. marina </italic>spatial distributions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Sequencing generated ~57 Mbp of data which assembled into 7, 398 contigs. Approximately 24% of contigs were nominally identified by BLAST. A further clustering of contigs (at &#x02265; 90% identity) revealed 164 transcript variant clusters, the largest of which (Phosphoribosylaminoimidazole-succinocarboxamide synthase) was composed of 28 variants displaying predominately synonymous variation. In a genomic context, a sample of 5 different genes were demonstrated to occur as tandem repeats, separated by short (~200-340 bp) inter-genic regions. For HSP90 several intergenic variants were detected suggesting a potentially complex genomic arrangement. In response to salinity, analysis of 454 read abundance highlighted 9 and 20 genes over or under expressed at 50 PSU, respectively. However, 454 read abundance and subsequent qPCR validation did not correlate well - suggesting that measures of gene expression via <italic>ad hoc </italic>analysis of sequence read abundance require careful interpretation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here we indicate that tandem gene arrangements and the occurrence of multiple transcribed gene variants are common and indicate potentially complex genomic arrangements in <italic>O. marina</italic>. Comparison of the reported data set with existing <italic>O. marina </italic>and other dinoflagellates ESTs indicates little sequence overlap likely as a result of the relatively limited extent of genome scale sequence data currently available for the dinoflagellates. This is one of the first 454-based transcriptome surveys of an ancestral dinoflagellate taxon and will undoubtedly prove useful for future comparative studies aimed at reconstructing the origin of novel features of the dinoflagellates.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p><italic>Oxyrrhis marina </italic>is a basal dinoflagellate taxon that has been extensively studied in both experimental and ecological contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and increasingly represents a target for studies of dinoflagellate evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. <italic>Oxyrrhis marina </italic>appears to have diverged early in the evolutionary branch leading to the dinoflagellate lineage, close to when the dinoflagellates diverged from the apicomplexans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and thus occupies a novel position within the alveolates (<italic>i.e</italic>. the ciliates, dinoflagellates, and apicomplexans). The alveolate lineages have each evolved a variety of unusual molecular and genomic features, the development of which has remained unclear in many cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The phylogenetic position of <italic>O. marina</italic>, as an intermediate lineage between the dinoflagellates and the apicomplexans, and the recognition that it possesses further unusual cytological and genetic features, make it a significant target for the study of evolutionary patterns and genome organisation within the alveolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Despite increasing scientific interest in <italic>O. marina</italic>, genetic and genomic data for this taxon remain relatively scarce (though see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]). In part, this is because comparative genomic approaches are limited by the relatively large phylogenetic distances separating <italic>O. marina </italic>from other genetic/genomic-model protists (<italic>e.g</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]). More generally, dinoflagellate genomes remain poorly-characterised due to several genomic characteristics. For example, dinoflagellates typically possess large genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] that contain numerous genes arranged in repetitive tandem-arrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]; further, they have potentially complex transcriptomes composed of multiple transcript variants for many genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The occurrence of such traits in <italic>O. marina </italic>remains only partially characterised: the genome appears to be large [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and a number of genes occur as multiple transcribed variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], but whether these genes are present as tandem-arrays has not been demonstrated.</p><p>While full genome sequences remain out of reach, next generation sequencing platforms nonetheless provide an efficient strategy to characterise transcriptomes, which can then be used to (1) quantify genomic features such as novel gene transcripts, alternative splicing, and levels of gene expression; and (2) uncover the molecular basis of adaptive traits in ecological model-organisms that lack reference genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Thus, high throughput transcriptome sequencing represents a common starting point for large scale sequencing projects for a broad taxonomic range of organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Indeed, several EST and transcriptome sequence datasets now exist for dinoflagellate species (<italic>e.g</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], including an EST dataset for one strain of <italic>O. marina </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. For <italic>O. marina</italic>, many components of its biology are well-characterised, and it is commonly employed as a model to parameterise ecological processes and trophic interactions (<italic>e.g</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]). Additionally, as a result of its broad distribution and abundance in intertidal environments, <italic>O. marina </italic>is a useful model of the evolutionary and biogeographic processes that determine the distributions of free-living protists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The wide distribution of <italic>O. marina </italic>is undoubtedly associated with an ability to tolerate a range of environments, notably variation in salinity, temperature, and pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Beneath this general pattern, however, is evidence for intra-specific variation in physiological tolerances; for example <italic>O. marina </italic>isolates display differing tolerances to environmental salinity, which potentially correlate with their occurrence in open water compared with intertidal habitats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Crucially, the molecular basis of differences in physiological tolerances, and hence the mechanisms by which physiological adaptation potentially drives biogeographic patterns, are unknown. Identifying genes that respond to key parameters such as salinity stress represents the first step towards indentifying the basis of physiological differences between strains.</p><p>In this paper, we present the first 454-based transcriptome sequence data for <italic>O. marina</italic>, with the aim of (1) highlighting the occurrence of genomic features such as extensive gene transcript variants, tandemly-arrayed genes, and a gene complement that make it an important target for understanding genome evolution within the dinoflagellates. Moreover, (2) we assess the use of 454 read abundance to determine variation in gene expression in response to salinity stress, and thus we examine the potential molecular basis of salinity tolerance in this eurytopic flagellate. In doing so we provide a substantial dataset that increases the publically available DNA sequence resources for this highly unusual dinoflagellate species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culturing</title><p>To provide RNA for cDNA synthesis and subsequent 454 sequencing, monoclonal cultures of the <italic>O. marina </italic>isolate 44_PLY01 (source: Plymouth harbour, UK, 50.3632 N, -4.139 W; see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]) were established in triplicate with media adjusted to 30 and 50 PSU (practical salinity units). Cultures were grown in modified Droop's S69 axenic growth medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] for details) and were treated with gentamycin (50 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>-1</sup>) and penicillin/streptomycin solution (100 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>-1</sup>) to limit bacterial growth; absence of bacteria and fungi was confirmed by culturing small volumes of <italic>O. marina </italic>cultures in L1p, L1m, and L1pm test media (media recipes provided by The Provasoli-Guillard National Center for Culture of Marine Phytoplankton, Bigelow Laboratory, Maine, USA) and by visual inspection of DAPI stained culture aliquots using a UV-equipped inverted microscope. Cultures were maintained in the dark at 18&#x000b0;C and serially transferred to ensure exponential growth. Specific growth rate (&#x003bc;, d<sup>-1</sup>) was calculated from daily estimates of cell density over 5 days (cell densities were estimated by counting 1 ml subsamples using a Sedgewick-Rafter chamber).

First strand cDNA was synthesised using Superscript II reverse transcriptase from ~0.75 &#x003bc;g total RNA. Sufficient template for sequencing (~5 &#x003bc;g) was generated by long-range PCR; briefly, cDNA was amplified in 90 &#x003bc;l PCR containing 1.5 &#x003bc;l first strand cDNA as template, 20 mM dNTPs, 12 &#x003bc;M SMART oligo, ~50 U Advantage 2 <italic>Taq </italic>polymerase (Clontech), and the manufacturer's standard PCR buffer; thermal cycling conditions were: 95&#x000b0;C for 1 min, followed by 18 cycles of [95&#x000b0;C 15s, 65&#x000b0;C 30s, 68&#x000b0;C 6 min].

Libraries created from 30 and 50 PSU salinity treatments were multiplex identified (MID-tagged) and then pooled for sequencing using 0.5 &#x000d7; GS454flx sequencing run. Sequencing reads were quality trimmed and adaptor sequences removed prior to assembly. Contig assembly was performed using Newbler (release 1.1.03.24, Roche), with overlap settings of 35 bp and 99% identity and default values for the remaining parameters. The overall assembly was performed using the combined sequence data for both salinity treatments, and differentially-expressed genes were identified subsequent to annotation.</p></sec><sec><title>BLAST identity searches and sequence annotation</title><p>Sequence contigs were annotated using a priority BLAST search strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Briefly, <italic>O. marina </italic>contigs were compared sequentially against the following databases: Uniprot (release 15.0), NCBI Nr (release 172.0), Pfam (release 24.0), and Smart (version 4.1); identity searches were conducted using BLASTX (for Uniprot, Pfam, Smart) and megaBLAST (BLASTN - for NCBI Nr) implementations of the standalone BLAST program. Initial BLAST parameters were word size 30 (BLASTN), 3 (BLASTX) and an e-value cut-off of 1e<sup>-10</sup>. After each search the contigs that were not identified at the selected e-value cut-off were queried against the subsequent database (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

For each of the largest clusters indentified in this way, contributing contigs were aligned using Seqman (DNAstar Inc, USA) and obvious errors (e.g. homopolymer length variations) or mis-alignments edited manually.

Prior to assembly the CCMP1788 EST data were screened for redundancy (&#x02265; 99.5% identity, 50 bp minimum overlap), which reduced the data from 18, 024 sequences to 11, 024. Subsequently, the 454 RNAseq and EST datasets were assembled at &#x02265; 90%.

In all cases 454 contigs were truncated and no spliced leader sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] were detected in the dataset. Relative contig length varied between 70 and 15% of the full mRNA transcript (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The most complete identifiable contigs occurred for elongation factor 2 and ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase large subunit (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>).

In the cases where multiple fragments occurred (<italic>e.g</italic>. HSP90 and Actin) one contig/fragment was typically highly abundant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). Manual checking of fragment alignments suggested that overlapping regions contained genuine polymorphisms, though the occurrence of multiple non-overlapping fragments is presumably an artefact of library preparation or sequencing (see discussion). The second arrangement, multiple highly overlapping contigs, appears to be a genuine biological signal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>). To assess the prevalence, of these expressed gene variants, 454 contigs were further grouped/assembled using CAP3. This higher level assembly of contigs generated 164 gene clusters consisting of 2-28 contigs. In the majority of cases clusters consisted of truncated cDNAs bearing 3' UTR variants with &#x0003c; 100bp of coding sequence. However, for identified gene clusters, with &#x0003e; 200bp of coding sequence, variation was predominately synonymous, with d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>S </sub>ratios between 0.33-0.023 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). For the most extensive gene variant clusters, contigs were predominantly highly overlapping and biased toward the 3' end of mRNAs (e.g. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>). A similar occurrence of gene variants was evident in the <italic>O. marina </italic>CCMP1788 EST dataset. An additional CAP3 assembly of the combined <italic>O. marina </italic>data highlighted a limited degree of overlap (74 CAP3 contigs contained sequences derived from both datasets) and ~750 gene variant clusters in the CCMP1788 ESTs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The most abundant gene cluster in CCMP1788 consisted of 33 variants, but was not identifiable by BLAST similarity searches against nr or nt databases.

Target gene expression was normalised to 2 control genes (actin and alpha-tubulin, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Six and 4 targets were identified as over or under expressed at 50 PSU, respectively, and greatest fold differences between treatments occurred for beta-tubulin, 40S ribosomal protein, and phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PhNMT) genes. Comparison of relative expression patterns estimated from qPCR and 454 read abundance indicated extensive discrepancies between the 2 approaches. In 6 out of 14 comparisons, the direction of expression differences was the same based on the 2 approaches. In the remaining 8 cases there were substantial differences in relative expression level estimates; for example, estimates of expression for HSP90 were 4.0 fold over expressed at 50 PSU versus 1.8 fold under expressed for 454 and qPCR based estimates, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Oxyrrhis - an emerging genomic model</title><p>Recent interest in the genetic and genomic architecture of <italic>O. marina </italic>has informed the evolutionary history of a range of conspicuous dinoflagellate traits. For example, it is now clear that the RNA trans-splicing mechanism, seemingly ubiquitous within the dinoflagellates, also occurs within <italic>O. marina </italic>and the more distantly related <italic>Perkinsus marinus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], suggesting that trans-splicing was established early in the ancestral lineage leading to the dinoflagellates. In contrast, studies of the mitochondrial genome indicate that the large but highly fragmented structure, again a feature of this taxon, is a more recent trait as it is common to the dinoflagellates and <italic>O. marina </italic>but probably not to <italic>Perkinsus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Perhaps the most conspicuous dinoflagellate feature, the seeming massive genome sizes harboured by some species (up to 215 Gb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]), also predates <italic>O. marina </italic>(a recent estimate places the genome size at ~50 Gbp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]) but occurred after the divergence of <italic>Oxyrrhis</italic>/dinoflagellates from <italic>Perkinsus</italic>, in which the genome is of more typical proportion (~86Mb). Thus it is clear that <italic>O. marina </italic>is of increasing significance in the study of alveolate evolution.</p><p>Here we further indicate that tandem gene arrangements and abundant expressed gene variants are common in <italic>O. marina</italic>. EST surveys of several dinoflagellates have highlighted the occurrence of multiple transcripts coding for the same gene product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and detailed studies of specific genes have revealed complex gene arrangements and expressed gene variants in several species (e.g.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]). In <italic>O. marina</italic>, previous study has shown abundant gene transcript variants for actin, HSP70, and rhodopsin (<italic>e.g</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]). We indicate the same phenomenon here, with nominally 30 identified expressed genes (and ~130 anonymous truncated transcripts) present as up to 28 variants, for which the majority of nucleotide variation was synonymous. A comparison with existing ESTs indicates even more extensive gene variant clusters in <italic>O. marina </italic>CCMP1788. In both cases, a large number of variant clusters were not identifiable by BLAST searches against Genbank databases and no obvious functional class of genes appeared to dominant the most abundant variant clusters. For 44_PLY01 the largest gene cluster occurred for phosphoribosylaminoimidazole-succinocarboxamide synthase, a gene associated with purine metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and the largest variant cluster in CCMP1788 coded for a type II rhodopsin gene. Notably, Slamovits et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] have described ~50 variants encoding rhodopsin in strain CCMP1788; here we detected far fewer variants (2-4 rhodopsin contigs). This discrepancy may simply be a result of different methodologies. <italic>Oxyrrhis marina </italic>cultures in this study were grown in the dark, and given the likely role of rhodopsin in phototaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], it would seem a potential that this treatment may reduce rhodopsin expression. Alternatively, differences in gene variant abundance may occur between strains. Whether structural or transcriptional differences exist at this level has yet to be examined, though global comparisons of the 44_PLY01 and CCMP1788 datasets using BLAST and CAP3 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) both highlighted limited similarity (~15% of ESTs/contigs were common to both strains). We have previously documented extensive genetic diversity within <italic>O. marina </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and strains CCMP1788 and 44_PLY01 occur within different <italic>O. marina </italic>clades (44_PLY01 and CCMP1788 occur within clades 1 and 2, respectively) based on sequence variation at 2 gene loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Whilst it is beyond the scope of the current study, it is likely that comparative assessments of gene/genome complement, arrangement, and structure at a range of phylogenetic between basal dinoflagellates will be highly informative. In particular, such comparative strategies will be useful to assess the rate of change of, for example, gene copy number at a key evolutionary juncture within the alveolates.</p><p>In addition to the occurrence of extensive expressed gene variants we have also shown that genes encoding transcribed variants occur as tandem repeated arrays in <italic>O. marina</italic>, an arrangement that has been demonstrated for a number of other dinoflagellate taxa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The 5 genes examined here (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>) were each arrayed in tandem, separated by short intergenic regions. HSP90 occurs in several contexts, with 2 major variants of the intergenic region; notably however, based on 3' UTR sequence the variants detected in a genomic context did not tally with those present in the RNAseq dataset. Given that mRNA sequences for HSP90 were fragmented and incomplete at the 3' end it is most likely that the corresponding portion of transcripts were simply missing in the RNAseq data, though it is also possible that we have under sampled the existing variation for this gene. In contrast, only a single intergenic sequence was recovered for alpha tubulin, which did match the mRNA sequence. In both cases cDNAs were trans-spliced, a universal feature of dinoflagellate transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and the trans-splicing acceptor site corresponded to an 'AG' signal as noted in other dinoflagellates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Of course, as a result of potential amplification biases associated with PCR detection, the actual diversity of intergenic regions is difficult to assess; nevertheless the occurrence of tandem gene repeats separated by different intergenic spacers suggests a number of potential genomic arrangements. Different intergenic spacers potentially indicate the occurrence of multiple tandem arrays at different genomic loci. Alternatively, individual arrays may be a complex arrangement of gene copies and heterogeneous intergenic spacers. Notably an <italic>in situ </italic>hybridisation based study of several genes in <italic>O. marina </italic>indicated 3, 4, and 5 genomic locations for actin, alpha tubulin, and HSP90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The precise structure and the extent of these tandem gene arrays remains to be investigated in <italic>O. marina</italic>; regardless, it is now increasingly clear that gene duplication is extensive in dinoflagellates more generally, and results in complex gene arrangements (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Understanding the mechanisms promoting such expansions is an important focus for dinoflagellate genome biologists. A systematic survey of the arrangement of such duplicated genes will be informative and given the basal position of <italic>Oxyrrhis </italic>it will almost certainly prove valuable for establishing the likely origin of extensive duplication in the dinoflagellate lineage.</p></sec><sec><title>The gene complement of <italic>O. marina</italic></title><p>Analysis of the existing CCMP1788 EST dataset identified a range of <italic>O. marina </italic>genes indicative of significant evolutionary processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. <italic>Oxyrrhis marina </italic>possesses genes such as proteorhodopsins that appear to have been laterally transferred from a bacterial origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and a number of plastid genes, including ketol-acid reductoisomerase, carbonic anhydrase, and cysteine synthase, which suggests an evolutionary ancestry that included a chloroplast bearing cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In this study, we highlight the occurrence of a broad range of genes associated with amino acid synthetic and metabolic pathways, including genes which indicate the ability to synthesise 'essential' amino acids, a capacity not typical in heterotrophic protists. Molecular evidence for extensive biosynthetic capacities certainly supports previous study on the nutritional biochemistry of <italic>O. marina</italic>. A series of comprehensive studies of nutritional physiology by MR Droop and co-workers (<italic>e.g</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]) highlighted that, in addition to phagotrophy, <italic>O. marina </italic>displayed a "plant-like" biochemistry including the ability to synthesise the full complement of amino-acids from ammonium or other simple nitrogen sources. While amino acid biosynthesis capability in heterotophic protists is exceptionally diverse, an absolute requirement for several amino acids is typical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. A broad range of transcripts indentified in this study were associated with amino acid metabolism and biosynthesis; based on the KEGG databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], 18 of the 22 amino acid biosynthesis pathways were represented by 100 454 contigs. The ability to undertake population growth on a fully synthetic medium with relatively simple absolute requirements (acetic acid or ethanol; valine, alanine; biotin; thiamine; vitamin B1s; ubiquinone; and a sterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]) and an exceptionally broad phagotrophic capacity (35-40 different prey items are documented as supporting <italic>O. marina </italic>population growth <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]) make <italic>O. marina </italic>exceptional. One mechanism by which <italic>O. marina </italic>may have gained its biosynthetic capacity is via an ancestral plastid or ancestral cyanobacterial endosymbiont [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The occurrence of plastid targeting signalling peptides and genes that are almost certainly plastid or cyanobacterial in origin (<italic>e.g</italic>. those coding for 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5- phosphate reductoisomerase, haem, carbonic anhydrase, ketol-acid reductoisomerase, and dihydrodipicolinate reductase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and this study) are certainly strong support for such a mechanism.</p><p>More generally, based on GO and BLAST annotations a broad range of gene families and metabolic processes are nominally represented in the <italic>O. marina </italic>RNAseq library presented here. However, estimation of transcriptomic diversity, the comprehensiveness of the sequencing, and thus the likely gene complement of <italic>O. marina </italic>is difficult in the absence of a reference or close reference genome. Estimates of gene content based on genome size are possible; recent work by Hou and Lin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] shows a strong non-linear correlation between genome size and protein-coding gene number across a broad range of eukaryotes. Hou and Lin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] estimate total gene content of the largest dinoflagellate genomes to be on the order of 80-90, 000 genes comprising ~1% of the total genome. An estimated DNA content for <italic>O. marina </italic>of ~55.8 pg cell<sup>-1 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] places its genome within the dinoflagellate range (~50 Gbp) and suggests some ~70, 000 genes (assuming an average eukaryotic gene size of 1.3 Kbp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]). Gene-content predictions of this magnitude are exceptionally high in comparison to other eukaryotes; however, as noted above, many genes in dinoflagellates occur in high copy numbers (up to 5, 000 gene copies in some cases, <italic>e.g</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]); thus, it is possible that much of the 'gene space' in dinoflagellates is occupied by multi-copy genes and the total proteomic diversity is closer to that displayed by eukaryotes more generally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>The representation of conserved gene classes also provides an approximate indication of transcriptome coverage. In this study we detected 61 ribosomal protein coding transcripts of the 75-80 that are typical of most eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]; while contigs did not represent full transcripts and such a comparison can only give a crude estimate these figures suggest a representation in the region of 75% of the transcriptome. It should be noted however, that comparison of the RNAseq and EST datasets for <italic>O. marina </italic>potentially conflict with this estimate. Assuming strains are relatively similar (sequence divergence based on mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I is ~2% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]), the degree of overlap in transcriptome sequence datasets between strains was relatively small (~15%), potentially indicating a high degree of under-sequencing in both cases. Of course, strains might differ more than suspected, or biases in sequencing (<italic>e.g</italic>. truncation or fragmentation of transcripts) might reduce overlap between the datasets. In either case, it seems clear that comprehensive sampling of the <italic>O. marina </italic>transcriptome is likely to require a further substantial sequencing effort.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptomic novelty and the problem of identification by identity</title><p>We have identified a number of interesting features of the <italic>O. marina </italic>transcriptome adding to previous descriptions of an unusual gene content in this organism. However, the majority of the sequences generated in this study were not identified by identity searches. This limited identification success, whilst partially accounted for by a 3' bias in this dataset (and thus a high representation of UTR sequence), is nevertheless diagnostic of a broader difficultly for genomic studies of dinoflagellates. While, the dinoflagellates are increasingly regarded as important targets for the study of genome evolution, large scale sequence resources are only relatively recently accumulating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. This poor sequence representation has an impact on the current use of such databases for sequence identification. For example, within the NCBI databases, EST datasets (totalling 155, 474 sequences) exist for only 21 dinoflagellate species, and the majority of ESTs (122, 235) are derived from just 5 species. Similarly, in a genomic context, only a handful of plastid genomes and genome sequence surveys exist for dinoflagellates and the majority of nucleotide sequences are environmental rDNAs. Consequently, identification of new sequences via database searches presents a significant challenge for dinoflagellate taxa.</p><p>In context, the relatively low annotation rate achieved in this study is, therefore, not surprising. EST projects on metazoa, with relatively close ancestry to many genomic model organisms, can yield high proportions of ESTs (<italic>e.g</italic>. &#x0003e; 95%) that are identified by reference to existing sequence databases (<italic>e.g</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]). By contrast, only 1, 890 (16%) contigs were identified for <italic>O. marina</italic>, and less than 2% of transcripts matched to a single relatively closely related species, such as <italic>Perkinsus marinus</italic>. Comparably low rates of annotation have been reported for other dinoflagellate EST projects, with only 9% of the (~1, 400) ESTs isolated from <italic>Alexandrium ostenfeldii </italic>homologous to known proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] and ~20% (of 6, 723) of ESTs from <italic>Alexandrium tamerense </italic>identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. While ESTs from a number of other eukaryotic protist taxa, for example diatoms, do not appear to be so different from the protein and transcript data available in public databases, a typical annotation rate of ~50% of transcripts again highlights gaps in genomic information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Most notably a recent EST project on <italic>Perkinsus marinus </italic>generated ~31, 000 EST sequences, clustered into ~8, 000 unique sequences of which 55% were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]; possibly the higher annotation rate in this case is a result of the closer (relatively) phylogenetic affinity between <italic>Perkinsus </italic>and the Apicomplexa (a group that is well characterised by virtue of containing numerous parasites of humans and livestock). It is notable that only 145 <italic>O. marina </italic>transcripts produced significant identity to <italic>P. marinus </italic>sequences, and only 161 matches occurred between <italic>O. marina </italic>contigs and those from other dinoflagellate taxa. Whether, this is a genuine result of a high degree of novelty of the <italic>O. marina </italic>genome or a simple result of limited genomic data can only be confirmed by further genome scale sequencing, although inferences from phylogenetic analysis do suggest that <italic>Oxyrrhis </italic>represents a highly divergent and novel lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of salinity tolerance mechanisms by differential gene expression</title><p>The application of next-generation sequencing technology to directly characterise transcript abundance is an increasingly used strategy for gene expression profiling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. The most precise strategies quantify either 5'or 3' (or both) cDNA fragments and thus overcome potential biases associated with sequence read length and incomplete reverse transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]; but for species that lack genome references (for fragment mapping) this approach negates the generation of full or near full length coding sequences, which are typically a valuable output of transcriptome sequencing projects in the case of poorly characterised organisms. Our aim here was to determine whether a <italic>de novo </italic>transcript assembly can be used concurrently with an experiment to obtain an informative gene expression profile.</p><p>Comparisons of transcript abundance profiles for cells grown under 2 salinity treatments nominally identified differing gene expression patterns and in combination with growth rate estimates seemed to provide evidence for specific physiological responses and a tangible molecular mechanism. A higher maximum grow rate at 30 PSU, was concurrent with a relatively strong induction of ~20 transcripts at this salinity. Likewise, a reduced growth rate and modest induction of a different set of 8 genes occurred at 50 PSU. However, agreement between transcript abundance and qPCR gene expression estimates were relatively poor, both in terms of direction and magnitude, and in only 6 out of 14 assays were expression estimates similar. In a broader context, gene expression patterns derived via different methodologies (<italic>e.g</italic>. qPCR <italic>vs</italic>. microarray platforms) often do not strongly correlate, although there appears to be more concordance between qPCR and next-generation sequencing platforms than with microarrays (cf. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]), which may relate to overall transcript abundance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. It is clear from a range of studies that some features of next generation sequencing protocols not specifically designed/targeted to quantify transcript abundance potentially generate significant biases in representation (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]). From the study presented here for example, the representation of a number of gene transcripts in the <italic>O. marina </italic>RNAseq dataset by numerous non-overlapping fragments (with differing read abundances) is clearly problematic and is likely a result of either incomplete cDNA synthesis and/or a proportion of read assembly errors. Likewise, the occurrence of extensive expressed gene variants, seemingly common in most dinoflagellates has the potential to result in extensive discrepancy between sequence and qPCR bases approaches; particularly if qPCR assays co-amplify extensive gene variant families.</p><p>Accepting the above issues, those genes whose expression profiles were confirmed by qPCR did tentatively suggest a potential underlying salinity response. In 3 cases qPCR and 454 expression estimates identified genes as up regulated at 50 PSU; most notable was the up regulation of phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase - this enzyme is a component of a common pathway in plants that generates the osmoprotectant glycine betaine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Thus, increased salinity appears to elicit a decrease in specific growth rate and tentatively a concurrent osmoregulatory response. Clearly such an inference is speculative and confirmation of the occurrence of this metabolic pathway in <italic>O. marina </italic>is required.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have generated some 7,398 cDNA sequence contigs for the basal dinoflagellate <italic>O. marina</italic>.

Nonetheless, we have identified a large number of transcripts associated with amino acid biosynthesis, and demonstrated the occurrence of extensive expressed gene variants and tandem gene arrangements; thus further highlighting the utility of next-generation sequencing platforms for generating <italic>de novo </italic>large scale sequence data to characterise non-genetic-model taxa. Additionally in this study, comparisons of relative read abundance of cells grown under differing osmotic stress nominally identified ~30 genes differentially regulated in response to salinity. While agreement between sequencing and qPCR based gene expression estimates was relatively poor; qPCR expression data tentatively identified candidate genes for further study of salinity tolerance in this taxon. In an evolutionary context, this is one of the first 454-based transcriptome surveys of an ancestral dinoflagellate taxon and will undoubtedly prove useful for future comparative studies aimed at reconstructing the origin of novel features of the dinokaryon. In an ecological context, these data highlight candidate genes for further research into potential adaptive mechanisms behind broad geographic distributions in eukaryotic microbes.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PCW, DJSM, and CDL conceived and designed the study; CDL and LEM conducted culturing and molecular biology laboratory work; NS, LVM, CDL, and PCW undertook data analyses; all authors contributed to the manuscript.
