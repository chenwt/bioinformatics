Human MBNL1 is a key factor in the etiology of myotonic dystrophy (DM), a muscle wasting disease caused by the occurrence of toxic RNA molecules containing CUG/CCUG repeats. MBNL1 binds to these RNAs and is sequestered in nuclear foci preventing it from exerting its normal function, which ultimately leads to mis-spliced mRNAs, a major cause of the disease. Muscleblind-proteins bind to RNAs via N-terminal zinc fingers of the Cys<sub>3</sub>-His type. These zinc fingers are arranged in one (invertebrates) or two (vertebrates) tandem zinc finger (TZF) motifs with both fingers targeting GC steps in the RNA molecule. Here I show that <italic>mbl</italic> genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and in other insects also encode proteins with two TZF motifs, highly similar to vertebrate MBNL proteins. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> the different protein isoforms have overlapping but possibly divergent functions <italic>in vivo</italic>, evident by their unequal capacities to rescue the splicing defects observed in <italic>mbl</italic> mutant embryos. In addition, using whole transcriptome analysis, I identified several new splicing targets for Mbl in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos.

In the complete list of 81 candidates there is a clear enrichment for the GO annotation terms &#x02018;actin binding&#x02019;, &#x02018;cytoskeletal protein binding&#x02019;, &#x02018;protein binding&#x02019; and &#x02018;tropomyosin binding&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034248.s001">Table S1</xref>), indicating the prominent function of <italic>mbl</italic> in muscle development and differentiation. However, many genes with a large number of intron-exon reads represent loci with multiple, often interspersed transcripts, which makes analysis very difficult, e.g. <italic>Pde1c</italic>, <italic>Ect4</italic> or <italic>l(3)82Fd</italic>. Some genes with many intron-exon reads also harbor transposons, which does account for some of the reads, e.g. <italic>Cda5</italic>.</p><p>Taking these limitations into consideration, the analysis revealed several new potential candidates as targets for Mbl in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. I tested ten of these candidates by RT-PCR and found splicing defects in five of them. The observed defects are either a shift in the ratio of different isoforms (<italic>CG33205</italic>, <italic>cora</italic>), the incorrect selection of mutually exclusive exons (<italic>wupA</italic>, <italic>kkv</italic>) or general defects in splicing accuracy (<italic>Mf</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Possible functional differences between isoforms</title><p>An important question is whether the different proteins, with one or two TZF motifs and with different C-termini, have different functions <italic>in vivo</italic>. One possibility could be that all the different Mbl isoforms in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which are generated from one gene by extensive alternative splicing, have similar and redundant functions regulating the alternative splicing of the same pre-mRNAs. Another possibility could be that the different proteins have different pre-mRNA targets. As a third alternative some isoforms could be involved in functions altogether different from the regulation of splicing, such as RNA localization. In vertebrates, MBNL proteins are encoded by three separate genes, and for MBNL2 a function in localizing the integrin &#x003b1;<sub>3</sub> transcript has been demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034248-Adereth1">[16]</xref>. Whether any other Mbl protein besides MBNL2 is involved in RNA localization remains to be seen.</p><p>To address this question I tested the ability of Drosophila Mbl proteins with one or two TZF motifs to rescue the splicing defects occurring in homozygous mutant embryos. It has previously published that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Mbl regulates alternative splicing of two transcripts in embryos, &#x003b1;<italic>-actinin</italic> and <italic>ZASP52</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034248-MachucaTzili1">[4]</xref>. In homozygous mutant embryos the tissue specific and developmental timing dependent splicing of &#x003b1;<italic>-actinin</italic> is mis-regulated, e.g. with the premature occurrence of adult isoforms already during embryogenesis. Also in mutant embryos aberrant <italic>ZASP52</italic> transcripts can be detected, where a cryptic splice site in exon 15 is used. In both cases there was a clear rescue of the splicing defects by transgene 1, which encodes a protein with only one TZF motif. Transgene 2, which codes for a protein with both TZF motifs, only rescues the &#x003b1;<italic>-actinin</italic> splicing but not the splicing of <italic>ZASP52</italic>.</p><p>A third published target for Mbl in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is <italic>troponinT</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034248-VicenteCrespo1">[5]</xref>. It has been shown that in mutant pupae alternative splicing of transcripts from this gene is mis-regulated. I find that also in embryos there is a shift in the ratio of two different isoforms of <italic>troponinT</italic> transcripts in <italic>mbl</italic> mutants. This defect is not rescued by either of the two transgenes tested.</p><p>Having identified additional transcripts mis-spliced in <italic>mbl</italic> mutant embryos, I tested again the two different transgenes for their ability to rescue these defects. There is generally good rescue with transgene 1 whereas transgene 2 only rescues the splicing of <italic>cora</italic> and <italic>kkv</italic> to some extent.</p><p>The observed differences between the two transgenes indicate that there might be functional differences between Mbl proteins with one and two TZF motifs. Both are clearly regulators of alternative splicing, as they efficiently rescue the splicing of &#x003b1;-Actinin, which also demonstrates that expression occurs from both transgenes and that the proteins function in the nucleus. The different rescue capacities for the other <italic>mbl</italic> targets could indicate different specificities of the protein isoforms, where the protein with two TZF motifs might have other, not yet identified, targets. An alternative explanation, which cannot be ruled out at this stage, is that the proteins are present in the cells in very different amounts or that they localize mostly to different sub-cellular compartments. Because both transgenes are inserted at the same genomic location on the X-chromosome and the same GAL4 driver-line was used it seems unlikely that significantly different RNA levels should be transcribed. Therefore one would have to assume that the translation efficiencies of the RNAs are different, or that the extra 121 amino acid residues affect the stability or localization of the protein encoded by transgene 2. This hypothesis will only be testable after generation of an antibody, which allows the detection of Mbl proteins at endogenous levels on western blots.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Potential Mbl binding sites in intronic sequences</title><p>Apart from CUG repeats, the five nucleotide sequence, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-AGUCU-3&#x02032;</named-content>, has been identified as a consensus binding motif for <italic>Drosophila</italic> Mbl by <italic>in vitro</italic>-studies using a protein with the first TZF motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034248-Goers2">[20]</xref>. This sequence motif occurs, however, only rarely in intronic sequences flanking those exons that are mis-spliced in <italic>mbl</italic> mutants. It has also been suggested that Mbl recognizes complex RNA secondary structures, which would not be easy to predict.</p><p>On the other hand, it was found that expression of the human gene, MBNL1, can rescue embryonic lethality in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, suggesting that both proteins recognize the same target RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034248-Monferrer1">[24]</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> selection has lead to the definition of a binding motif for the human protein, which is a GC motif embedded in pyrimidines, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-YGCY-3&#x02032;</named-content>, with a preference for at least one pyrimidine-base (Y) being U <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034248-Goers1">[19]</xref>. In efficient high-affinity binding sites this motif often occurs in several copies in the RNA. In a simple model for the regulation of alternative splicing, exon exclusion is promoted when MBNL binds upstream of the exon, whereas binding downstream of the exon enhances its inclusion.</p><p>Given the high degree of similarity between the zinc finger motifs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Mbl and human MBNL1 it seems likely that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein recognizes the same binding sites in pre-mRNAs. Analysis of the complete <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome showed that the binding motif occurs on average 1.72 times in intronic sequences close to exons (&#x0003c;200 bp) (Vipin T. Sreedharan and Gunnar R&#x000e4;tsch, personal communication). In the intronic sequences close to the exons 5 and 6 in <italic>Actn</italic> there are indeed clusters of YGCY motifs. In this case there is also good correlation with the model that Mbl binding downstream enhances inclusion (exon 5a) whereas binding upstream of the exon predominantly leads to exclusion (exon6). For the other exons where Mbl regulates splicing, mostly identified in this study, the correlation is less clear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034248-g010">Fig. 10</xref>). For example, in the case of <italic>wupA</italic> there is no clustering of YGCY motifs detectable, although the presence of Mbl protein clearly leads to the inclusion of exon 6a and the exclusion of exons 6b&#x02013;6d. In several other cases it is not simple the inclusion or exclusion of an exon that is regulated by Mbl, but the selection between alternative splice sites for one exon.</p><fig id="pone-0034248-g010" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0034248.g010</object-id><label>Figure 10</label><caption><title>Distribution of YGCY motifs in intron sequences.</title><p>Schematic representation of 200 bp intron sequences near exons that are mis-spliced in <italic>mbl</italic> mutants; for introns smaller than 400 bp only half of the intron sequence is depicted.
