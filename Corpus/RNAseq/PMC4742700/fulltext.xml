One such transition, between cell types named &#x0201c;white&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;opaque,&#x0201d; is regulated in an epigenetic manner, in the sense that changes in gene expression are heritably maintained without any modification of the primary genomic DNA sequence. Prior studies revealed a highly interconnected network of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that control this switch. We report the identification of Ssn6, which defines an additional layer of transcriptional regulation that is critical for this heritable switch. Ssn6 is necessary to maintain the white cell type and to properly express the opaque cell transcriptional program. Ssn6 does not bind DNA directly but rather associates with specific combinations of DNA-bound transcriptional regulators to control the switch. This work is significant because it reveals a new level of regulation of an important epigenetic switch in the predominant fungal pathogen of humans.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award1"><funding-source>HHS | NIH | National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)<named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</named-content></funding-source><award-id>R01AI049187</award-id><principal-award-recipient>ALEXANDER D JOHNSON</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award2"><funding-source>HHS | NIH | National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)

The white-opaque switch in the fungal species <italic>Candida albicans</italic> is an example that occurs in a unicellular eukaryote. As such, the white-opaque switch represents a cell fate decision amenable to extensive genetic, biochemical, and systems level dissection.</p><p><italic>C.&#x000a0;albicans</italic> is a part of the normal human microbiota and is also an opportunistic pathogen that can reside in many diverse niches within the human host. <italic>C.&#x000a0;albicans</italic> can undergo a number of morphological changes, including the well-studied switch from the &#x0201c;white&#x0201d; to the &#x0201c;opaque&#x0201d; cell type (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). These two cell types are heritable for many generations (~10<sup>4</sup>), and the switch between them occurs epigenetically, that is, without any change in the primary DNA sequence of the genome. White cells are spherical and produce shiny, domed colonies under standard laboratory conditions, while opaque cells are elongated and produce flatter, darker colonies (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). In addition to these physical distinctions, the two cell types display different mating abilities (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), metabolic preferences (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and interactions with host immune cells (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Several environmental inputs influence the frequency of switching between the two cell types; these include temperature (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), carbon dioxide levels (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), and carbon source (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;</label><caption><p>Working model for the white-opaque regulatory circuit.

Currently, six sequence-specific DNA binding proteins (Wor1, Wor2, Wor3, Czf1, Efg1, and Ahr1) are known to regulate the switch (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). Wor1, the &#x0201c;master regulator,&#x0201d; is highly upregulated in opaque cells, drives mass switching to the opaque cell type when overexpressed, and, when deleted, &#x0201c;locks&#x0201d; cells in the white cell type. Under standard laboratory conditions and in standard laboratory strains, Wor1 is repressed by the a1-&#x003b1;2 heterodimer, and for this reason, only strains homozygous at their mating type locus are switching competent (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Wor2, Wor3, and Czf1 are also upregulated in opaque cells and are required to maintain the opaque cell type and permit switching at the appropriate frequency (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Analogous to Wor1, but acting in the opposite direction, Efg1 is a white-cell-enriched regulator that, when overexpressed, drives switching from opaque-to-white (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The recently identified regulator Ahr1, which represses the switch from white-to-opaque in an Efg1-dependent manner (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), is the first identified regulator of white-opaque switching that is not differentially transcriptionally regulated between the two cell types.</p><p>In this paper, we identify Ssn6 as a core regulator of white-opaque switching. Unlike the six previously described regulators of white-opaque switching, Ssn6 does not bind DNA directly and specifically; rather, based on the behavior of its ortholog in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, it is recruited to DNA by sequence-specific DNA binding proteins. Our results establish that Ssn6 represents a second layer of white-opaque switching regulation, where it represses genes through association with the previously described sequence-specific regulators.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="h1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s1.1"><title>Deletion of <italic>SSN6</italic> results in cells that are locked in the opaque phenotype (opaque-locked cells).</title><p>To identify additional members of the white-opaque regulatory network, we extensively analyzed the available genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcriptional profiling data for the white-opaque regulatory circuit (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). We found that three of the six known regulators (Wor1, Wor2, and Efg1) bind upstream of the <italic>SSN6</italic> gene (orf19.6798). On the basis of this evidence, we hypothesized that Ssn6 plays a role in regulating white-opaque switching.</p><p>To test the hypothesis that Ssn6 controls white-opaque switching, we converted an a/&#x003b1; <italic>ssn6</italic> deletion strain (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) to the switching-competent a/&#x00394; and &#x003b1;/&#x00394; states, where either the <bold>a</bold> locus or the &#x003b1; locus had been deleted.

Again, the a/a <italic>ssn6</italic> deletion strain gave rise exclusively to opaque-looking cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>), and several independent switching assays supported the conclusion that these strains were &#x0201c;locked&#x0201d; in the opaque cell type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;</label><caption><p>Single-cell morphology of strains deleted for <italic>SSN6</italic>.

We observed that both a/&#x00394; <italic>ssn6</italic> and &#x003b1;/&#x00394; <italic>ssn6</italic> deletion strains (which are opaque locked) mate with efficiencies that are within 10-fold of those of wild-type opaque cells and are at least 1,000-fold higher than the efficiencies seen in mating between wild-type <bold>a</bold> and &#x003b1; white cells (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS2">Table&#x000a0;S2</xref> in the supplemental material).</p><p>We note that a/a heterozygous <italic>SSN6</italic>/<italic>ssn6</italic> strains exhibited a normal white-to-opaque switch frequency (~5%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>), suggesting no haploinsufficiency of Ssn6 in relation to its role in regulating white-opaque switching. Ectopic expression of <italic>SSN6</italic> in white cells did not prevent switching to the opaque cell type, and ectopic expression in opaque cells did not result in mass switching to the white cell type (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table&#x000a0;S1B</xref> in the supplemental material), results consistent with the fact that <italic>SSN6</italic> is not differentially regulated between the two cell types. These results are also consistent with the idea that Ssn6 is recruited to DNA by sequence-specific DNA binding proteins. In the absence of the relevant DNA-bound proteins, overexpression of <italic>SSN6</italic> would be expected to produce little effect.</p><p>In <italic>S.&#x000a0;cerevisiae</italic>, Ssn6 (Cyc8) is tightly bound to Tup1, and the two function together as a complex. This is most clearly evidenced by the fact that <italic>tup1</italic> and <italic>cyc8</italic> deletions produce virtually the same phenotypes in <italic>S.&#x000a0;cerevisiae</italic> and result in the same genes being derepressed. This is not the case in <italic>C.&#x000a0;albicans</italic>. Garc&#x000ed;a-S&#x000e1;nchez et al. showed, using microarrays and deletion strains, that Ssn6 and Tup1 control different sets of genes in a/&#x003b1; cells (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Park and Morschh&#x000e4;user showed that a <italic>tup1</italic> deletion has only a modest effect, if any, on white-opaque switching (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). This is in contrast to the large effects observed here for the <italic>ssn6</italic> deletion. Taken together, these results indicate that, in <italic>C.&#x000a0;albicans</italic>, Ssn6 functions independently of Tup1. To confirm this, we converted an a/&#x003b1; <italic>tup1</italic> deletion strain (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) to the switching-capable a/&#x00394; background and compared it to an a/&#x00394; <italic>ssn6</italic> strain. Again, the two deletions produced very different phenotypes: the <italic>tup1</italic> deletion is hyperfilamentous, whereas the <italic>ssn6</italic> deletion is not (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</xref> in the supplemental material).</p></sec><sec id="s1.2"><title>Wor1 is necessary for establishment of the opaque cell type in the <italic>ssn6</italic> deletion mutant.</title><p>To date, expression of <italic>WOR1</italic> has always proven necessary for both the establishment and maintenance of the opaque cell type.

Strikingly, more than 99% (165 of 166) of Ssn6-bound intergenic regions are bound by at least one of the other six regulators of white-opaque switching (Wor1, Wor2, Wor3, Czf1, Efg1, and Ahr1), more than 90% of the Ssn6-bound intergenic regions are bound by either Wor1 or Wor2, and approximately 80% of these are also bound by Efg1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">D</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig.&#x000a0;S3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">C</xref>). In addition to the propensity to bind in association with Wor1 and Wor2, Ssn6 tends to be found at sites bound by multiple regulators; more than 85% of Ssn6 binding events are at locations where three or more other regulators are also bound. These trends are much greater than would be expected by chance (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataS3">Data Set&#x000a0;S3D</xref>). The change in the distribution of Ssn6 across the genome between white and opaque cells represents a complete reconfiguration of Ssn6; it appears largely driven by the presence of Wor1, Wor2, and Efg1 in opaque cells. As might be expected from such a result, a search for DNA sequences overrepresented in the Ssn6 binding sites produced the canonical Wor1 motif (WTTWARSTTT) (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig.&#x000a0;S3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">D</xref>). However, the rules of Ssn6 recruitment cannot be as simple as the requirement of the presence of Wor1, Wor2, and/or Efg1, as there are many sites in the genome bound by one or both of these regulators that are not enriched for Ssn6 binding. As has been established in <italic>S.&#x000a0;cerevisiae</italic>, numerous combinations of regulatory proteins can recruit Ssn6 to sites on DNA; for <italic>C.&#x000a0;albicans</italic>, the precise &#x0201c;rules&#x0201d; of recruitment remain to be worked out, although we know that Wor1, Wor2, and Efg1 are key players.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="h2"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The regulatory network controlling white-opaque switching in <italic>C. albicans</italic> is large, complex, and highly interconnected. Three properties of the network suggest rationales for this complexity. (i) The circuit exhibits an extreme example of bimodality, with each state being stable for ~10<sup>4</sup>&#x000a0;cell generations. (ii) The circuit controls the expression of about 20% of the protein coding genes in the <italic>C.&#x000a0;albicans</italic> genome. (iii) The extent to which genes are white- or opaque-phase-enriched varies enormously from one gene to the next: some are tightly shut off in one of the two cell types, but most exhibit more graded expression differences. In this paper, we demonstrate that the Ssn6 transcriptional corepressor is a key regulator of the white-opaque circuit. Ssn6 is critical for the stability of the white cell type and also plays a widespread role in the regulation of both the white and the opaque cell transcriptional programs.</p><p>The characterization of Ssn6&#x02019;s role in the white-opaque regulatory network requires a refinement to our current conception of how switching between the two cell types is regulated. In a wild-type strain, under normal laboratory conditions, switching to the opaque cell type occurs in a stochastic manner. When either <italic>EFG1</italic> or <italic>AHR1</italic> is deleted from <bold>a</bold> or &#x003b1; cells, the switch to the opaque cell type still occurs randomly, although at a significantly higher frequency than in wild-type <bold>a</bold> or &#x003b1; cells. Deletion of <italic>SSN6</italic>, however, results in immediate and complete switching to the opaque cell type as long as an intact <italic>WOR1</italic> gene is present. This deterministic, as opposed to stochastic, nature of switching in the <italic>ssn6</italic> deletion mutant indicates that white cells actively repress the machinery needed to trigger the switch to the opaque cell type, with Ssn6 at the center of this repression. In other words, Ssn6 is necessary for the stochastic nature of the switch.</p><p>In addition to maintaining the stochastic properties of white-to-opaque switching, Ssn6 also plays a role in the proper expression of the transcriptional program specific to both white and opaque cells. Ssn6 is required to prevent activation of the opaque cell specification program in white cells; however, the majority of that regulatory control is exerted indirectly through the maintenance of low-level <italic>WOR1</italic> expression. In other words, Ssn6 does not directly repress the entire opaque cell transcriptional program in white cells but, rather, prevents excitation of the transcriptional circuit that leads to elevated <italic>WOR1</italic> expression and transition to the opaque state. As discussed above, there are a few opaque-phase-specific genes whose expression is directly repressed by Ssn6, independently of Wor1.</p><p>The role of Ssn6 expands in opaque cells, as it occupies many more regions of the genome and appears to be recruited largely by the opaque-phenotype-specific &#x0201c;master&#x0201d; transcriptional regulators, most prevalently Wor1 and Wor2. Thus, in opaque cells, Ssn6 is important for the specification of the opaque cell phenotype and is required for the repression of the majority of the white cell transcriptional program. In addition to these cell type-specific roles, Ssn6 also is important for the repression of a number of other genes whose expression is not enriched in either cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;</label><caption><p>Model of a subset of Ssn6 repression in the white and opaque cell types. (a) In white a/a cells, some opaque-phase-enriched genes are directly or indirectly repressed by Ssn6 independently of Wor1 (top) in coordination with an undetermined &#x0201c;X&#x0201d; cofactor. (b) In opaque a/a cells, a majority of white-phase-enriched genes are directly or indirectly repressed by Ssn6, possibly in combination with Wor1, Wor2, and/or Efg1 (top). In both cell types, Ssn6 represses a number of genes that are neither white enriched nor opaque enriched (bottom). Arrows and bars represent activation and repression, respectively, and reflect both direct and indirect regulation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mbo0011626500005"/></fig><p>The work in this paper adds another layer of complexity to the regulation of white-opaque switching in <italic>C.&#x000a0;albicans</italic>. Previous analysis concentrated on a group of sequence-specific DNA binding proteins that underlie the switch, and the current work shows that Ssn6, recruited by certain combinations of these proteins, is equally important to the switch. In particular, when <italic>SSN6</italic> is deleted, cells are tightly locked in the opaque cell type and the stochastic nature of the switch is lost. Although it appears to act as a general repressor, regulating many genes of diverse functions (including those that have little, if any, relation to the white-opaque switch), there is a dramatic shift in the distribution of Ssn6 across the genome when cells switch from the white cell type to the opaque cell type. Our work indicates that this shift is crucial both for the specification of the two distinctive cell types and for controlling the frequency of switching between them.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="h3"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s3.1"><title>Growth conditions.</title><p>All strains were grown on synthetic complete media supplemented with 2% glucose and 100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml uridine (SD + aa + uri) at room temperature unless otherwise noted.

The samples from each mating mixture were then recovered with a sterile applicator stick, resuspended in 1&#x000a0;ml SD without amino acids (SD&#x02212;aa), and homogenized 5 times for 1&#x000a0;min each time in a Bransonic M3800 bath sonicator. After normalizing each mating mixture to ~2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> cells per ml, 1 ml of each mating mixture was pelleted by centrifugation (2 min at 10,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic>) and then washed, resuspended, and diluted serially in SD &#x02212; aa media. Dilutions were plated on SD without arginine (arg) and with nourseothricin (300&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml) to select for mating products and plated on SD-arginine to select for the mating products plus the limiting parent. Plates were cultured for 3&#x000a0;days at 30&#x000b0;C and scored for colony growth. Mating frequency was calculated as follows: mating frequency = [number of mating products (SD &#x02212; arg + NAT)]/[(number of mating products + number of limiting parents (SD &#x02212; arg)].</p></sec><sec id="s3.6"><title>Microarrays.</title><p>Three independent microarray experiments were performed for each strain. One replicate (replicate C) used cells grown to mid-log phase in SD + aa + uri at 25&#x000b0;C. The other two replicates (replicates A and B) used cells grown under identical conditions but with arginine supplemented into the growth media at a concentration of 2.5&#x000a0;mg/ml to accommodate a growth defect likely associated with the arg<sup>&#x02212;</sup> genotype of our a/&#x003b1; strains. RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis were performed as previously described (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). A pooled reference was made using equal proportions of aa-cDNA from each strain to be hybridized on the array. The pooled reference was labeled with Cy3, and the experimental strains were all labeled with Cy5. Equal amounts of Cy3-labeled and Cy5-labeled samples were hybridized to 8x15K microarrays (AMADID no. 020166), and arrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000B microarray scanner. Array images were gridded using GenePix Pro version 7, and global LOWESS normalization was performed for each array using a Goulphar script written for R (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Normalized data for independent probes corresponding to the same ORF was then collapsed using a Python script. Processed, transformed data for key comparisons can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataS1">Data Set&#x000a0;S1</xref> in the supplemental material.</p><p>The three repeats for each strain were divided into three groups (groups A, B, and C), keeping replicates processed on a given day together. There was an extra replicate of the a/a <italic>ssn6</italic> deletion in each group, giving six total repeats for this genotype. Transformations (i.e., a/a opaque versus a/a white) were performed within each group (i.e., a/a opaque A versus a/a white A, a/a opaque B versus a/a white B, and so on), with the three extra a/a <italic>ssn6</italic> deletion replicates also transformed against the same strains that the first copy was transformed against (i.e., a/a <italic>ssn6</italic> deletion A and a/a <italic>ssn6</italic> deletion repeat A versus a/a white A).</p><p>Lists of genes meeting specific criteria (i.e., enriched by at least 3-fold in a deletion strain relative to the wild type) were developed as follows. Whether three or six replicates were available, we required that the median value exceed the given threshold. The number of genes changing in a given deletion strain excludes the gene or genes that were deleted in that case (i.e., <italic>SSN6</italic> in an <italic>ssn6</italic> deletion strain). Lists of white-phase-enriched and opaque-phase-enriched genes are based on the data from this transcriptional analysis as well as on previously reported RNAseq data (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In addition, we created a high-confidence set of genes that were white or opaque phase enriched 2- or 3-fold in each of four different experiments (24, 26, 30; this study). Figure&#x000a0;3 and Fig. S2 in the supplemental material show the median value for each set of transformations.</p></sec><sec id="s3.7"><title>ChIP-chip analysis.</title><p>Cultures for chromatin immunoprecipitation were harvested during mid-log phase by centrifugation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, strand displacement amplification, dye coupling, and hybridization to a custom 1x244K Agilent tiling microarray (AMADID no. 016350) were performed as described previously (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). We used two custom antibodies against Ssn6 as well as an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen AHO0062) for N-terminally Myc-tagged Ssn6. Ssn6 custom antibodies were raised against the sequences CPPAKPHGAPQQRTG (residues 664 to 677; referred to here as anti-664) and CETKKDTTKTSPAKQ (residues 1005 to 1018; referred to here as anti-1005) (GenScript). Full-genome ChIP-chip experiments on Ssn6 in white cells used anti-664 antibodies and were performed twice. Full-genome ChIP-chip experiments on Ssn6 in opaque cells were performed once with each custom antibody and once with anti-Myc for the 7&#x000d7; Myc-Ssn6 strain. Arrays were scanned using a Genepix 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments/Molecular Devices) and processed as described previously (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) with the following exception: minimum enrichment cutoffs for MochiView (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) peak detection were set to the default 0.58 value for the tagged/wild-type arrays and to 0.27 for the untagged/deletion arrays. Peak sizes were set to 500&#x000a0;bp. These settings are identical to those previously used for the analysis of Wor1, Wor2, Wor3, Czf1, Efg1, and Ahr1 binding (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Peaks were then filtered by the subtraction of a previously reported set of likely artifactual peaks which show variable but substantial enrichment in many control ChIP-chip experiments performed using antibodies against a deleted target (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>For the white cell Ssn6 ChIP-chip experiments, two independent experiments were performed with anti-664 against a wild-type a/a white strain and two independent control experiments were performed against an a/a strain deleted for <italic>ssn6</italic>. The two experimental and control experiments were merged and the peaks then identified by MochiView using the settings described above. One peak was manually added (upstream of orf19.1906 and orf19.1907) based on a manual examination of the data.</p><p>For the opaque cell Ssn6 ChIP-chip experiments, the processed peak calls from the three independent experiments (262 in anti-Myc, 91 in anti-664, and 178 in anti-1005) were then further processed as follows. Any binding sites in the Myc data set that overlapped a peak from either of the custom antibodies (176 peaks) were taken, and the location was defined based on that of the Myc data set. Peaks in the Myc data set that did not directly overlap a custom antibody peak but that were part of the flanking enriched area of a broader custom antibody peak (47 sites) were also taken. A further 5 Myc data set sites that did not follow these criteria were also taken on the basis of visual inspection of all datasets at that location. A further 9 locations that were not called in the Myc data set but that were called in both custom antibody datasets were also taken; the anti-1005 data set locations and enrichment were used for these peaks. This resulted in a total of 237 peaks of size 500&#x000a0;bp which we used for all subsequent analysis. The analyzed ChIP-chip data are included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataS1">Data Set&#x000a0;S1</xref> in the supplemental material.
