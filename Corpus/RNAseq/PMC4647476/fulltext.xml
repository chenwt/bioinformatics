Omic analyses (transcripts, proteins and metabolites) are powerful tools for assessing biochemical differences in biological systems.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Berry skins of red- (Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir) and white-skinned (Chardonnay, Semillon) wine grapes were harvested near optimum maturity (&#x000b0;Brix-to-titratable acidity ratio) from the same experimental vineyard. The cultivars were exposed to a mild, seasonal water-deficit treatment from fruit set until harvest in 2011. Identical sample aliquots were analyzed for transcripts by grapevine whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray and RNAseq technologies, proteins by nano-liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy, and metabolites by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Principal components analysis of each of five Omic technologies showed similar results across cultivars in all Omic datasets. Comparison of the processed data of genes mapped in RNAseq and microarray data revealed a strong Pearson&#x02019;s correlation (0.80). The exclusion of probesets associated with genes with potential for cross-hybridization on the microarray improved the correlation to 0.93. The overall concordance of protein with transcript data was low with a Pearson&#x02019;s correlation of 0.27 and 0.24 for the RNAseq and microarray data, respectively. Integration of metabolite with protein and transcript data produced an expected model of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, which distinguished red from white grapes, yet provided detail of individual cultivar differences. The mild water deficit treatment did not significantly alter the abundance of proteins or metabolites measured in the five cultivars, but did have a small effect on gene expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The five Omic technologies were consistent in distinguishing cultivar variation. There was high concordance between transcriptomic technologies, but generally protein abundance did not correlate well with transcript abundance. The integration of multiple high-throughput Omic datasets revealed complex biochemical variation amongst five cultivars of an ancient and economically important crop species.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12864-015-2115-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Grape berry</kwd><kwd>High-throughput sequencing</kwd><kwd>Metabolomics</kwd><kwd>Proteomics</kwd><kwd>Transcriptomics</kwd><kwd><italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> L.</kwd><kwd>Water-deficit stress</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006031</institution-id><institution>United States - Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund (IL)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IS-4325-10</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cramer</surname><given-names>Grant R.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation (US)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBI 0741876</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cramer</surname><given-names>Grant R.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Grapes (<italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> L.) are an economically important agricultural commodity, having an economic impact greater than $162 billion to the American wine and grape industry alone (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ngwi.org">http://www.ngwi.org</ext-link>). Cultivated grapes are grown and consumed as fresh fruit, used as the root stocks for fruit producing scions, and in the production of a range of wines with distinct and complex flavor profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Grapevines are a long-lived perennial fruit species intertwined within the culture of many countries dating back more than 7000&#x000a0;years.</p><p>There are more than 5000 distinct cultivars of grapes in the world. Grape production is found on every arable continent around the globe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Grapevines have maintained a rich genetic diversity since domestication as a result of vegetative propagation practices that both immortalize existing traits and unknowingly encourage unique phenotypes to arise from clonal cuttings that carry somatic mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Regional environments often referred to as &#x0201c;terroir&#x0201d;, in conjunction with human selective pressures have shaped the cultivar characteristics associated with many of the popular wines enjoyed today [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The color of a grape berry&#x02019;s skin contributes a recognizable cultivar characteristic that differentiates red- and white-skinned grapes. Anthocyanins are the purple, blue and red pigments that provide the color associated with the skins and wines from red cultivars, and are extracted from the berry skins during winemaking; they are crucial constituents for quality in high-end wines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. White cultivars do not synthesize anthocyanins as a result of two adjacent mutations within the genes of the MYB transcription factors, in <italic>VviMYBA1</italic> and <italic>VviMYBA2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Human selective pressures from domestication are believed to have maintained this phenotype in many of today&#x02019;s popular cultivars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Other phenylpropanoids, besides anthocyanins, contribute to distinct cultivar differences in both grapes and wine. For example, genetic and environmental factors account for cultivar-dependent differences in abundance of the flavon-3-ols, catechin and epicatechin, in red wines produced from diverse regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Wine and table grapes also differ in their concentrations of both hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids levels, with wine grape content significantly higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The qualities of bitterness and astringency in wine are attributed to monomeric flavan-3-ols and polymeric proanthocyanidins or condensed tannins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and have been studied for their effects upon human health, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Cultivar differences also extend to subtle variations in amino acid composition at harvest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Ammonia and certain amino acids are the main nitrogen-containing compounds assimilated by yeasts within fresh grape juice or musts before fermentation commences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Nitrogenous substances become available to yeasts from pressed berry juice or via extraction from the skins, in the case of fermenting red wines. The assimilable nitrogen levels in grapes must also play a role in determining the duration of fermentation, and musts are often amended with ammonium salts (DAP) to ensure efficient fermentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Yeast assimilates free amino acids under anaerobic fermentation conditions, with the exception of proline that stoichiometrically requires oxygen for degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Aroma composition of wines shares a close relationship with must amino acid composition, where volatile compounds such as isoamyl acetate, isobutanol, isobutyric acid and methionol are significantly different among cultivars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Grape composition at harvest can therefore impact the quality of the finished wine.</p><p>The environmental influence of water deficit has been positively correlated with the enhancement of quality attributes such as color, aroma and flavor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. For example, Deluc et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] investigated seasonal water deficit in Cabernet Sauvignon observing 2-fold increases in the accumulation of the five major anthocyanins, as well as significant increases to the MYB transcription factors that regulate the final steps in anthocyanin biosynthesis. Drought tolerance amongst cultivars also varies between grapevine cultivars and species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Wine produced from low water status vines had significant reductions in vegetal aroma, but were rated highly for fruity aromas associated with red and black fruit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Water-deficit-treated berries also showed significantly induced transcripts involved in fatty acid cleavage or hydroxylation of monoterpenes leading to plant volatile production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Severe water deficit can also increase berry nitrogen status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] by differentially affecting the transcription of amino acid metabolism, including proline, glutamate and phenylalanine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, an integrated analysis (transcriptional, translational, and intermediary and end-products of metabolism) is presented to test the uniqueness of three red-skinned and two white-skinned cultivars: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Semillon, respectively. Here, the same berry samples from the same vineyard and climate, free of disease and insect pressures, were sampled and utilized for each Omic analysis. The cultivars were exposed to a mild, seasonal water-deficit treatment from fruit set until harvest in 2011 to provide a more diverse molecular expression that underlies the unique responses of each cultivar. The major goal of this research was to elucidate the major biochemical and signal transduction pathways that were active at berry maturity. This was accomplished using an Omics approach to identify and quantify the relative abundance of transcripts, proteins and metabolites in the berry skins. Another goal was to evaluate the platform performance of gene expression profiled by NimbleGen Grape Whole-Genome Microarray and Illumina RNAseq technologies. In addition to comparing abundance changes of individual proteins and transcripts, ancillary components of the berry biological system were determined through primary and secondary metabolite analyses using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS). Interestingly, the cultivars&#x02019; proteomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic responses to the drought treatment were divergent, reflecting, at the level of the berry skin, unique grape profiles. In this comprehensive assessment of five grape berry cultivars at harvest, we found that there was concordance amongst the Omics platforms in differentiating each cultivar&#x02019;s uniqueness.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Five Omic data sets comprising transcripts, proteins, and metabolites, generated from the same harvested skins, were used to investigate cultivar differences in biochemistry and signal transduction at berry maturity.

Approximately 50,000 spectra per sample were assigned to peptides matching a total of 2867 non-redundant <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> proteins in the UniProtKB database (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>).

Ground skin sample aliquots from the same three experimental replicates used for the protein analysis were sequenced with an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing system to determine transcript abundance.

The relative metabolic abundance from berry skins of primary and secondary metabolites (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>) were analyzed by GC-MS and LC-MS based methods.</p><p>Venn diagrams illustrate the distributions of identified (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) and quantified (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) proteins in the different cultivars.

Only proteins detected in all samples (1211) were assessed, but all transcripts measured were considered for this analysis in both platforms. The top ten most abundant proteins (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) surveyed in each cultivar consisted of only 17 proteins, many of which can be classified as pathogenesis-related (PR). Additionally, three of the proteins were in the top ten most abundant of each cultivar: &#x003b2;-1, 3, glucanase [UniProtKB:F6HLL9], major latex protein 22 [UniProtKB:A5BAX1], and a peroxiredoxin-5 [UniProtKB:D7TBK8]. Both transcript platforms were assessed for the degree of concordance in reporting highly expressed transcripts. The top most abundant transcripts by microarray (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>) consisted of a common set of 16 uniquely annotated transcripts from the cultivars. Again, several of the top transcripts were PR protein-related including a class IV chitinase, a non-specific lipid-transfer protein and two thaumatins. Five of the transcripts were also ranked in the top ten of each cultivar: invertases/pectin methylesterase inhibitor [UniProtKB:Q9M4H8; EnsemblePlants:VIT_16s0022g00960], chitinase class IV [UniProtKB:Q7XAU6; EnsemblePlants:VIT_05s0094g00340], putative ripening-induced protein 1 [UniProtKB:Q6VEQ6; EnsemblePlants:VIT_05s0049g00760], photosystem II protein D1 [UniProtKB:F6GXB0; EnsemblePlants:VIT_11s0052g01680], and one transcript without a known annotation [UniProtKB:F6H8M1; EnsemblePlants:VIT_05s0049g00520). A BLAST search of the unannotated transcript references a putative proline-rich protein in several species including grape. For RNAseq transcripts (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>), a common set of 18 uniquely annotated transcripts made up the top ten from the cultivars. As with the proteins and microarray transcripts, many of the top transcripts were the same PR proteins in the microarrays. Five of the transcripts were also ranked in the top ten of each cultivar: putative ripening-induced protein 1 [UniProtKB:Q6VEQ6; VIT_05s0049g00760], chitinase class IV [UniProtKB:Q7XAU6; EnsemblePlants:VIT_05s0094g00340], abscisic stress ripening protein 2 [UniProtKB:F6GY46; EnsemblePlants:VIT_18s0072g00380], allergenic protein Pt2L4 [UniProtKB:Q9M4H7; EnsemblePlants:VIT_12s0059g00590], and the same unannotated transcript in the microarrays [UniProtKB:Q9M4I2; EnsemblePlants:VIT_05s0049g00520]. Microarray transcripts that did not fully correspond with the RNAseq are annotated as containing probesets that potentially cross hybridize with other closely related genes. For example, all four probes that map to the <italic>cupin</italic> and <italic>Photosystem II protein D1</italic> genes listed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> have the potential for cross hybridization (see Cramer et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] for a full list of genes with potential hybridization, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Top ten most abundant proteins quantified within each cultivar</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th/><th/><th colspan="5">Cultivar<sup>b</sup>

RNAseq data were normalized and modeled with the standard edgeR pipeline. Generalized linear models were fit to a multifactorial design formula (5 x 2; cultivar x treatment) for significance testing, and indicated 15,149 transcripts changed significantly with cultivar; the transcript abundance of one transcript changed significantly with treatment; and 241 transcripts changed with the cultivar x treatment interaction term.</p><p>There was a common set of 1211 proteins that was quantifiable across each of the cultivars and treatments. This consistent set of proteins was considered for further reliable comparative quantitative analyses. The protein abundance of 832 proteins changed significantly with cultivar (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>), but there were no significant changes in protein abundance for either treatment or cultivar x treatment interaction terms. In addition, the relative metabolic abundance of primary and secondary metabolites (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>) changed significantly with cultivar, but no metabolite abundances were changed significantly for either treatment or cultivar x treatment interaction terms (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>).</p><p>A comparison of Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref> reveals that the percentage of the transcripts varied substantially with cultivar between the two transcriptomic platforms, 92&#x000a0;% for the microarray platform and 56&#x000a0;% for the RNAseq platform. The percentage of proteins varying with cultivar was approximately 69&#x000a0;% and the percentage of metabolites varying with cultivar was approximately 95&#x000a0;% for both platforms. Thus, all Omic platforms revealed a large variability in molecular abundance amongst all the cultivars.</p><p>In summary, data variability was mostly attributed to the cultivar effect. The mild water deficit treatment effect was much less. ANOVA results indicate that mild water deficit did induce a significant change in the abundance of a small percentage (&#x0003c;6&#x000a0;%) of transcripts. Protein and metabolite abundances in this study were significantly affected only by a specific cultivar.</p><p>Experimental samples from each platform were analyzed by principal components analysis (PCA) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), which reduced the dimensionality of the data and allowed a clearer observation of the underlying structure. Each PCA biplot showed the directions where there was the most variance in the data. Cultivars separated from one another similarly on the first principal component in each platform providing substantial concordance amongst the different Omic approaches. Generally, red cultivars separated from white, but Pinot Noir samples separated somewhere in between. Biological variability in samples was evident particularly in protein and metabolite biplots. The secondary metabolites were separated along the first component, separating the red cultivars that synthesize anthocyanins, and anthocyanin moieties separated Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot from Pinot Noir.

We primarily observed higher protein abundance in the red cultivars for enzymes involved in phenylalanine through anthocyanin biosynthesis, such as flavanone 3-hydroxylase and leucoanthocyandin dioxygenase. Missing spectra within the experimental replicates of the white cultivars was evidence of their lesser abundance. Relative to the red cultivars, Chardonnay and Semillon proteins involved in phenylpropanoid and flavonoid were less abundant, although, a chorismate mutase (CM) in Chardonnay was an exception to that observation. Chorismate is an important precursor that interfaces the biosynthesis of phenylalanine and tyrosine, tryptophan, folate, and phylloquinone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Four phenylalanine ammonia-lyases (PAL; [UniProtKB:A5BPT8, F6HNF5, F6HR33, F6HS12]) were identified only within the red-skinned cultivars.

The importance of color to the sensory experience of red wines is derived from the red, purple and blue anthocyanin pigments produced in the berry skin. Observable differences of anthocyanidin content and their glycosylated, acetylated and coumaroylated moieties amongst the red cultivars were strongly cultivar dependent. All metabolites were significantly different at the cultivar level except malvidin 3-O-(6-p-coumaroyl)glucoside and petunidin 3-O-(6-acetyl)glucoside. Malvidin 3-glucoside had the largest relative abundance of any anthocyanin, and the acetylated and coumaroylated forms of malvidin were also in high abundance in Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot relative to the other four anthocyanins. Mild water deficit did not have any significant effects on anthocyanin abundance in any cultivar. Thus, all of the variation in metabolite composition could be attributed to the cultivar and not to water deficit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Differences in amino acid metabolism</title><p>The mature grape berry, via pressed must, provides a source of nitrogenous substances in the form of free amino acids and cleaved peptides, proteins and nucleic acid derivatives, and in mineral ammonium salts that collectively make up the fermentable nitrogen metabolized by yeast during alcoholic fermentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].

Of the mapped proteins quantified in each cultivar, all but ornithine aminotransferase (2.6.1.13) and ornithine carbamoyltransferase (2.1.3.3) were significantly different. Transcript abundance differences between cultivars were muted, with the exception of an argininosuccinate lyase (4.3.2.1). Only the arginase (3.5.3.1) transcript [UniProtKB:D7U7W7; EnsemblePlants:VIT_15s0048g00420] in the microarray was significant for the cultivar x treatment term, but all transcripts were significant for cultivar.

Proline was also the most abundant amino acid quantified by GC-MS. The relative abundance of proline more closely corresponded with the protein abundance of pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase, but did not correspond with the transcript abundance. The relative abundance of arginine was not significantly different in any measured cultivar, but the abundances of glutamine, glutamate, ornithine and proline were significantly different between cultivars. The higher relative abundance of ornithine, glutamate and glutamine in Chardonnay corresponded to a higher relative transcript abundance of arginosuccinate synthase and glutamine dehydrogenase.

For example, <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of the Corvina transcriptome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] revealed 180 new or unique genes (the authors referred to them as private genes) not annotated in the PN40024 reference genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. RNAseq has also been used to describe the expression of specific transcription factors over-expressed at single developmental stages, such as those belonging to the ERF, WRKY and UPBEAT transcription factor families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Knowledge of the timing of transcription factor activity can be used for generating new hypotheses for investigating the regulation of berry development. Collectively, these studies have assisted in furthering our understanding of grapevines and improving the functional annotation of the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. These transcription studies are very powerful, often for the information not mentioned explicitly in the text but contained in their corresponding data sets.</p><p>The availability of the grape genome coupled with microarray and next generation sequencing technology allows global gene expression profiling. Platform concordance was informative of how well each of the technologies performed at measuring transcript abundance. Similar workflows were used beginning with identical tissue and methodology for total RNA extraction and quality assurance checks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Samples also went through similar cDNA syntheses prior to hybridization or library preparation. Closed platforms like microarrays are not readily adapted to improvements made to genomes as are gff3 annotation files and suffer from potential cross-hybridization events. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> illustrated the decrease of concordance between the platforms for annotated genes with the potential for one or more probe cross-hybridizations. Many of the lowly expressed transcripts in the RNAseq were not accurately modeled in the arrays with a wide range of expression values. The dynamic range of detection was not as high in the microarrays, evident by the right-tail in the pairwise plots. But, the expression profiles of the arrays did follow the relative abundance levels of transcripts seen with RNAseq.</p><p>Read numbers per gene are a function of the expression level of the gene, the number of reads generated by the technology and the length of the transcript for those reads to align with. Inefficiencies in measuring gene expression can be related to the degree of read mapping due to poor or incomplete annotations, and RNA that is lost during extraction, or during cDNA conversion and ligation to adaptors. Ultimately, measuring mRNA levels is only a proxy for protein abundance, which is even more complicated when considering the importance of post-translational modifications that affect protein or enzyme activity. While the two&#x000a0;transcriptomic platforms were highly correlated with each other, neither platform was an accurate predictor of protein abundance in general. The finding that the abundance of most transcripts is not correlated with the abundance of proteins from the same gene is consistent with a classic study in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>] and many other findings in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Like the yeast study of approximately 100 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>], our study of approximately 1200 proteins indicated that there was an increased correlation coefficient if one enriched the data set with more abundant proteins. Nevertheless, even in the top 10&#x000a0;% of the most abundant proteins, the abundance of the majority of the proteins did not correlate with its transcript abundance, with less than 50&#x000a0;% of the proteins being significantly correlated with their transcript partner.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Model assessment and correlation</title><p>Why is the relationship of protein abundance to transcript abundance low? Regulation of gene expression can be controlled at many different stages, which may explain partly the poorly observed correlation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. For example, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation related to the processing of RNA (e.g. alternative or differential splicing) and the stability of the RNA itself can determine the level of expression, where tissue specificity or stress response determines a specific isoform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. The general translation of mRNA into protein can also be affected by translational regulation from different regulatory elements (e.g. depletion of ternary complex or hormone signaling) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Protein stability (often measured as a half-life) might also be influenced by the specific isoform or by the conditions that lead to its formation. These examples do not even include the potential for post-translational modifications of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>], which only increases the complexity and reduces the probability for a high correlation of transcript abundance with protein abundance. Yet, subsets of different transcript-protein pairs were strongly correlated, particularly some pathogenesis-related proteins in the skin. At least in the mature berry, the regulation of these genes appears to be tightly controlled at levels upstream of translation.</p><p>Transcript-protein pair relationships that lack any correlation can also reveal insights into the biology shared across cultivars. For example, three of the top most abundant proteins quantified [UniProtKB:D7SKR5, EnsemblePlants:VIT_06s0004g03550; UniProtKB:F6HUD1, EnsemblePlants:VIT_02s0025g03600; UniProtKB:D7TBK8, EnsemblePlants:VIT_11s0016g03630] assist in scavenging H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and are involved in ascorbate-glutathione metabolism; they can offer protective qualities to a maturing berry, irrespective of cultivar, and benefit vine fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. Both the protein and transcript abundances of ascorbate peroxidase and a glutathione peroxidase were high in each of the cultivars. These data support the hypothesis that high protein abundance levels at this berry developmental stage are important for sustained H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> scavenging and antioxidant activities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Effects on berry skin phenolics at harvest</title><p>Phenylpropanoids, derived from phenylalanine, are a diverse class of secondary metabolites and are important factors that influence antioxidant activities in grapes and wines. The biosynthesis of small molecular weight phenolics, such as caffeic acid and caftaric acid, peak around the onset of ripening (veraison) and then decrease in the weeks thereafter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. As in Castellarin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>], we wanted to link observable changes in our transcriptional and translational data sets with changes in metabolism following a seasonal water deficit. In the present study, numerous protein-transcript pairs and metabolites involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis were mapped (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>), showing the phenotypic diversity of various organoleptic properties (e.g. color and astringency) and berry biochemistry. Enzymes related to anthocyanin biosynthesis were highly abundant relative to other enzymes mapped. Similarly, Deytieux et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] observed high relative abundance of chalcone synthase, flavanone 3-hydroxylase and UDP glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase enzymes that initiate the gradual accumulation of these phenolic compounds.</p><p>Many of the phenylpropanoids were among the most abundant metabolites measured, with the genotype determining the abundance distributions. Metabolic profiling of anthocyanins in the three red cultivars revealed variation in the relative metabolic content of each selected metabolite (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>). Our results for high levels of malvidin were consistent with those reported previously for Cabernet Sauvignon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], Malbec [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>] and Yan73 (Muscat Hamburg x Alicante Bouschet) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. The strong effect of cultivar was evident in protein and metabolite differences observed between the cultivars.</p><p>Stilbene abundance also varied between cultivars when compared at harvest. In Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz fruit, levels of <italic>trans</italic>-resveratrol accumulated at similar levels from veraison to maturity, whereas its glucoside, <italic>trans</italic>-piceid only increased in Shiraz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Similarly, our cultivars displayed divergent stilbene levels at harvest, with the highest levels observed in Pinot Noir. This is consistent with two comprehensive studies of cultivar comparisons of stilbene concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>], in which Pinot Noir was the cultivar that had the highest stilbene concentrations. Under more severe water deficit, <italic>trans</italic>-piceid metabolite abundance increases 5-fold along with increasing steady state transcript abundance in Cabernet Sauvignon, but not in Chardonnay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. These observations are further supported by a 3-year survey of 78 Italian red, white and pink grape cultivars, where large variability in stilbene abundance was consistent with gene expression analysis in the healthy, developing grape berries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. The abundance of different stilbenes, like other phenylpropanoids, can distinguish one cultivar from another.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Importance of assimilable nitrogen in berry skins</title><p>Assimilable nitrogen within grape must (fermenting juice) can be a limiting factor to yeast growth during fermentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The total nitrogen content is distributed primarily in skins and seeds of ripe berries, with the amino acid content ranging from 30 to 40&#x000a0;% depending upon cultivar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Proline, arginine, glutamine, alanine, and glutamate are the major amino acids in fresh grape juice, but the specific composition and concentration of amino acids varies by cultivar, vineyard location and winemaking practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. By sampling and processing berry tissues from the same experimental vineyards, we hoped to reduce some of the variability introduced in our previous studies where the metabolisms of Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay were compared from grapes grown in different geographic locations, root stock and trellis systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Transcripts related to glutamine and glutamate metabolism were significantly different between cultivars. The metabolite abundance for these two amino acids in this study was low, and reflected different cultivar distributions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). Levels of glutamine and glutamate abundance decrease overtime from veraison to maturity in studies located in Israel and Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. Proline is one of the major amino acid constituents in both juice and wine, and is formed from 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. In two studies, Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz berry skins showed large increases in proline relatively late in the ripening process (post-veraison) peaking at maturity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. High proline abundance was observed in each of the cultivars in our study. Ornithine, derived from the urea cycle, can function as a substrate for further amino acid biosynthesis when converted to glutamate 5-semialdehyde (2.6.1.13) by ornithine aminotransferase, which links proline and arginine metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Non-protein amino acids like ornithine and &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA) also contribute to total available nitrogen content within grape must [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Bach et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>] observed varying GABA concentrations amongst 21 cultivars that changed with region, cultivar and year of harvest, observing the highest GABA levels in Chardonnay. We did not directly measure GABA in this study, but we can hypothesize that GABA levels like other nitrogen contributing compounds measured in this study varied with the cultivar.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Minor effects of water deficit</title><p>Water deficit treatment did not significantly alter the abundance of proteins or metabolites in the five cultivars in this study. Berry physiology was also unaffected by water stress, which indicated that the stress was mild. Matthews et al. have shown that mild water deficit does not significantly affect levels of soluble sugars, titratable acidity or berry diameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>]. These grapes, however, did produce wines with significantly different flavor and aroma profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In contrast, more severe water deficit causes significant reductions in berry diameter in Cabernet Sauvignon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and Chardonnay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and significantly alters metabolite composition and abundance. The lack of significant differences observed in the present study was possibly related to the mild water deficit, thus inducing only small differences in metabolite abundance. With a higher number of replications and lower CV for the samples, statistically significant changes in metabolite abundance in response to water deficit may have been detected.</p><p>Another explanation for only a few molecules with significant differences may be attributable partly to the single sampling time point at maturity. Dai et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>] surveyed a number of central metabolic signatures from whole berry samples displaying developmental specificity, with large abundance changes primarily occurring shortly before, through, and shortly after veraison. This argument is further supported by a fruit development experiment comparing Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz berry skins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], which showed similar developmental trends in both central and secondary metabolites where large metabolic changes occurred early in development rather than at near-maturity. Additionally, the mild water deficit very likely caused subtle Omics changes that made it difficult to detect common responses with this level of replication.</p><p>Post-veraison, the berry undergoes rapid cellar expansion and increases in soluble sugars for a time, but as development continues, progressively towards senescence, the berry undergoes withering or dehydration. Perhaps the poor detection of treatment related effects was simply due to both treatments having experienced a degree of water deficit-related stress, although no visible withering or shrivel was observed. The high observed abundance of peroxiredoxin proteins across cultivars is consistent with the fact that they are known to be elevated in vines exposed to water deficit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], although other environmental stress factors such as high light or UV intensity could also influence protein abundance. In an extreme example, Corvina berries undergo a withering process in the process of making the famous Ripasso and Amarone wines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. As a result of the mild water deficit used in this study, cultivar effects were the dominant differentiating factor in metabolic content.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, this study provides a rare and powerful glimpse into the molecular underpinnings of grape. It compares the skin of the berries of five cultivars of grapevines at maturity, a tissue that is a source of texture, color, flavor and aroma for grapes and wines. An enormous amount of effort and money went into collecting these data, but there was a much greater effort expended for the complex data analyses in this study. Few plant studies have collected such a large amount of data from five molecular platforms from identical tissue samples coming from a very similar environment (vineyard). The comparisons showed that the platforms were concordant with each other, that each variety can be distinguished from each other in a similar way with each of the platforms. Yet each platform was reproducible, providing a unique view, showing unique differences at each molecular level, and revealing some of the complexity of these biochemical pathways.</p><p>The phenotypic variation in the cultivars resulted in unique and large differences in abundance in many of the most common classes of proteins and metabolites measured in berry skins. Analysis of functional categories showed that metabolism was very active and there were substantial responses to abiotic and chemical stimuli in the berry skin. In this study, only transcript analyses were sensitive enough to detect significantly induced changes from the moderate water deficit treatment. Overall, transcript abundance was poorly correlated with protein abundance. Omic analyses elucidated cultivar differences in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and amino acid metabolism that influence winemaking, including color, astringency and yeast assimilable nitrogen levels. In addition, this study showed that there were significant differences in the classes of pathogenesis proteins in the berry skins of each cultivar in the absence of pathogenic pressures.</p><p>The models presented here are simple and crude. One of the goals of the systems biology approach (Omics) is to construct models and make predictions. This study represents only the first steps in the path of achieving such goals. The integration of the data here and the models constructed are just the beginning. These simple models showed again that biochemical pathways are complex and cultivars can vary significantly in simple primary metabolic pathways, such as amino acid metabolism, as well as more complex secondary metabolic pathways, such as phenylpropanoid metabolism. To be predictive, more data will need to be collected over time to better estimate molecular activities and transport. Nonetheless, this study is valuable, depositing a large amount of information into public data repositories that can be used to build and create future molecular annotation and models. The data presented here can be utilized and explored for years to come.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec18"><title>Plant material and experimental conditions</title><p>Berries from five grapevine (<italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> L.) cultivars, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Semillon, were harvested during the fall of 2011 from the University of Nevada, Reno experimental vineyards (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The North Vineyard was divided in half and separated into 15 rows (5-well watered; 10-drought stressed), with Chardonnay on the northern half and Cabernet Sauvignon on the southern half. Each row in the North Vineyard maintained 23 vines of each cultivar. The South Vineyard was divided into six blocks (A-F). Each block contained four rows divided into thirds, with 15 vines of a given cultivar in each third. Merlot, Pinot Noir &#x00026; Semillon vines were grown in each block. Blocks A, C &#x00026; D were well watered, and blocks B, E &#x00026; F were treated with water deficit. Rows in each of the experimental vineyards were planted in a north to south orientation, to achieve nearly maximal daily sunlight exposure. Following fruit set in early July 2011, leaves were removed near the clusters on the east-facing side of vines in both vineyards to increase fruit exposure to light and air circulation. Vines were drip irrigated with 8&#x000a0;l&#x000a0;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> emitters and grown under well-watered or water deficit conditions post-fruit set (Additional files <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> &#x00026; <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Mid-day stem water potentials were measured weekly with a pressure chamber (3005 Plant Water Status Console, Soil Moisture Corp., Goleta, CA, USA), as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], on fully mature leaves to assess plant water status throughout the growing season [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>]; stem water potential measurements were averaged across cultivars, because no significant differences in stem water potentials amongst the cultivars could be detected. Following weekly measurements, water was either applied or withheld in an effort to maintain a mild water deficit treatment at&#x02009;~&#x02009;&#x02212;0.8&#x000a0;MPa and &#x02212;0.6&#x000a0;MPa for control vines. Titratable acidity (TA) and &#x000b0;Brix (total soluble solids) were assayed from juice crushed from a minimum of two whole berry clusters collected from different vines. The TA (g&#x000a0;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) measurements were performed with an automatic titrator (HI 84102, Hanna Instruments, Woonsocket, RI, USA). The automatic titrator was standardized daily with tartaric acid (6.4&#x000a0;g&#x000a0;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), with 0.5&#x000a0;N NaOH utilized as a titrant to an endpoint of a pH of 8.2 for both standard and juice measurements. &#x000b0;Brix was measured with a digital refractometer (HI 96811, Hanna Instruments, Woonsocket, RI, USA) that was calibrated with deionized water before each measurement. Daily precipitation, Penman evapotranspiration and temperature measurements (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) from the experimental vineyards were collected from the Desert Research Institute&#x02019;s (DRI) Western Regional Climate Center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>]. DRI calculates evapotranspiration using the 1982 Kimberly-Penman equation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>]. Berry diameter measurements were taken weekly with a digital caliper (General Ultratech No. 147, New York, NY, USA), beginning after fruit set until the week of cultivar harvest. Berry diameter measurements consisted of measuring 15 randomly selected berries per cluster from the same four labeled clusters (technical replicates) on a single vine (experimental replicate). Three experimental replicates per cultivar and treatment were used to compute diameter means. Six experimental replicates, comprised of&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;2 whole berry clusters were harvested in early to late October 2011 (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for details). Sampling dates for berry skin material varied between cultivars in order to achieve similar &#x000b0;Brix and TA concentrations in berries, but WW and WD treatments were gathered on the same day (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). To avoid edge effects, berry clusters were harvested from vines away from the ends of the trellised rows. All six sampled experimental replicates come from six different individual vines at different locations within the vineyard and were utilized for metabolomic extractions and analysis. From the six experimental replicates sampled, five experimental replicates were randomly selected for microarrays. Of the five experimental replicates used for microarrays, three experimental replicates were randomly selected for proteomic and RNAseq analysis. Thus, proteomic and RNAseq analyses utilized the same sampled experimental replicates. Berry skin tissue for all analyses was separated from the seeds and pulp prior to being flash frozen with liquid nitrogen and finely ground using a RETCH-mill (Retsch MM301, Newtown, PA, USA) with pre-chilled steel holders and grinding beads.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Protein extraction and LC-MS/MS analysis</title><p>Proteins were extracted from the frozen, finely-ground skin samples using a modified phenol-based extraction protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

A count matrix of aligned reads was generated with Samtools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>] and HTSeq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] from BAM alignment files, which outputs counts for each gene feature. Using the &#x0201c;union&#x0201d; mode, HTSeq discarded read counts if they were ambiguous, not assigned to any gene feature, or if the alignment was not unique.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The ANOVA and most data analyses were conducted in R (3.1.2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>]. RNAseq read count normalization and differential expression analysis were performed with edgeR (3.8.6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], counts from each aligned sample library (experimental replicate). An experimental design model was created accounting for cultivar (5 levels), treatment (2 levels) and the interaction between these two effects before fitting generalized linear models to estimate log-fold changes. Contrast coefficients for each factor were selected for significance testing. Moderated log-counts-per-million (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>) were computed with the cpm() function in edgeR for data visualization of RNAseq data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Gene set enrichment analysis</title><p>Functional analysis and enrichment of biological processes was determined with the BinGO (version 3.0.2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] application in Cytoscape (version 3.1.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].
