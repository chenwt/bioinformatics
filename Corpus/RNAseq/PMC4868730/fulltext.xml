situations and facilitate drug discovery for cancers such as endometrial carcinoma. We performed a genome-wide somatic mutation-expression association study in a total of 219 endometrial cancer patients from TCGA database, by evaluating the correlation between &#x0223c;5,800 somatic mutations to &#x0223c;13,500 gene expression levels (in total, &#x0223c;78, 500, 000 pairs). A bioinformatics pipeline was devised to identify expression-associated single nucleotide variations (eSNVs) which are crucial for endometrial cancer progression and patient prognoses. We further prioritized 394 biologically risky mutational candidates which mapped to 275 gene loci and demonstrated that these genes collaborated with expression features were significantly enriched in targets of drugs approved for solid tumors, suggesting the plausibility of drug repurposing. Taken together, we integrated a fundamental endometrial cancer genomic profile into clinical circumstances, further shedding light for clinical implementation of genomic-based therapies and guidance for drug discovery.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>endometrial cancers</kwd><kwd>expression-associated somatic mutations</kwd><kwd>cancer genomics</kwd><kwd>cancer drivers</kwd><kwd>cancer drug repurposing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In the United States, uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) or endometrial cancer is the third most common malignancy and the most prevalent genital-system tumor among females, with an estimated 54,870 new cases and 10,170 deaths in 2015 [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Endometrial cancer transformation arises from the normal uterine corpus through a progressive accumulation of somatic and epigenetic aberrations.</p><p>On the basis of disease stage, early-stage endometrial cancer can generally be cured, while recurrent and advanced endometrial cancer is clinically aggressive, and progress in developing treatment approaches has been limited [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The dearth of new clinical drugs has led to a new approach called drug repurposing, the alleged new uses for old drugs, to increase usable therapeutic agent access for endometrial cancers. The rationality of drug repurposing of approved anticancer drugs is based on the concept that different cancers may possess similar pathological molecular or pathway origins. The most noticeable feature of drug repurposing is the clear understanding of pharmacological mechanisms, pharmacokinetic profiles, metabolism pathways and toxic reactions of approved drugs [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In estimation, approximately 90% of old drugs can be developed for secondary purposes [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], further provide evidence for the feasibility of drug repurposing as a drug discovery tool.</p><p>The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database is a large-scale genomic database that primarily envisions somatic changes of cancers including endometrial cancer [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The final goal of these tremendous efforts is to tailor patient treatment in a personalized manner, and drive customization of disease care by implementing tumor genetic information. Importantly, the identified drivers can act as drug targets for disease amelioration, treatment biomarkers for patient categorization, and prognostic markers for patient survival. Although the landscape of somatic aberrations in endometrial cancer has been depicted, the potential utilization of relevant biomarkers into clinical situations has been limited. Moreover, studying large amount of cancer genomic data remains analytically challenging. The genetic architecture of transcription profiles is thoroughly affected by several kinds of genetic and epigenetic polymorphisms [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Consequently, the presence of other genetic determinants may increase the difficulty in clarifying the effects of somatic mutations on gene expressions.</p><p>Taken together, the above-described situations motivated this integrative study to determine expression-associated somatic alterations and quantify their aberrations on the cancer transcriptome. These expression-associated (e)SNVs were further prioritized by a scoring system based on 7 criteria to identify biologically risky mutational candidates and provide crucial information for drug discovery.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Identification of eSNVs in endometrial cancer</title><p>We applied a 2-step linear regression to correlate the somatic mutation status with the residual expression value while adjusting for 2 genetic determinants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).

The summary measure of the concordance index calculated by Uno's method was 0.7867 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>).

To identify biological candidate risk mutational variations in endometrial cancer patients, we first evaluated prognostic-related eSNV signatures using a Cox-regression. We identified 13 eSNVs which were significantly associated with prognostic-free survival in endometrial cancer patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).

We classified patients into 2 groups based on the prognostic-related signature profiles. Patients who bore at least 1 mutation in their prognostic-related signatures were compared to patients with no mutation on the 13 eSNVs.

In particular, <italic>CTNNB1</italic> (5 eSNVs), <italic>PIK3CA</italic> (2 eSNVs), and <italic>TP53</italic> (3 eSNVs) contained more than 1 eSNV which were cluster-related. Surprisingly, patients who bore the <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutation were significantly enriched in cluster 1 compared to clusters 2 and 3 (Chi-square <italic>p</italic> = 2.75 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>). Similarly, the <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation was significantly enriched in patients in cluster 3 (Chi-square <italic>p</italic> = 3.62 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>). In contrast, the number of patients with the <italic>TP53</italic> mutation was higher in cluster 2 compared to clusters 1 and 3 (not significant, Chi-square <italic>p</italic> = 0.1926). Notably, our results matched previous observations that mutations of <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>PPP2R1A</italic> were more common in the serous-like, which was enriched in cluster 2. Comparatively, mutations of <italic>PTEN</italic> and <italic>ARID1A</italic> were more common in endometrioid endometrial cancer, which was enriched in clusters 1 and 3. Cluster-related and prognostic-related signatures were combined and are illustrated with mutational clusters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>). We ascertained a mutually exclusive pattern of some somatic mutations among the 3 clusters, suggesting the importance of eSNV-based investigations of somatic mutations, as different mutations in the same gene may result in different prognostic outcomes. For instance, 4 of 6 eSNVs in <italic>CTNNB1</italic> were enriched in cluster 1 patients and showed mutually exclusive patterns. Notably, Liu <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] reported that <italic>CTNNB1</italic> is a somatic driver that characterizes an aggressive subgroup in endometrioid-type endometrial cancer, which is enriched in cluster 1. However, a <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutation on rs12191339 was observed only in cluster 2 patients, which correlated with a poorer survival rate. In addition, although most patients possessing <italic>TP53</italic> mutations were enriched in cluster 2, this confirms previous results that the <italic>TP53</italic> mutation is linked to poorer outcomes; however, the <italic>TP53</italic> rs121913343 variation was only observed in cluster 1 patients. Taken together, these results support the significance of assessing eSNV-based mutational profiles (compared to gene-based mutational profiles) in order to gain biological insights into disease profiles.</p><p>To identify cooperative dysregulation of eSNVs and gene transcription which may contribute to tumorigenesis and cancer progression, we derived a cluster-centric pairwise mutation-mutation correlation analysis based on &#x003b2;-coefficients of transcript levels of associated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3C</xref>). As a result, eSNVs were categorized into 4 consensus clusters and we identified 3,706 significant pairwise co-occurrences (453 eSNVs), with overlapping correlated gene numbers ranging 10&#x0223c;78 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>To clarify the SL interaction profile in endometrial cancer, we first indicated bimodal genes in the transcription profile, and then nominated candidate SL pairs according to the bimodal expression exclusively with an eSNV-based mutation.

Second, we showed that patients&#x02019; mutation profiles can be used to stratify UCECs, further linking disease aggressiveness and patient prognoses, thus providing a rationale to facilitate the fast-tracking of potential therapeutic targets in endometrial cancer. Third, we emphasized the importance of depicting somatic mutation profiles in an SNV-based manner, as different mutations in the same genes may link to distinct aggressiveness and prognostic outcomes in cancer patients. Finally, we adopted a scoring system to prioritize eSNVs, which may contribute to therapeutic switching.</p><p>In 3 identified endometrial cancer-related <italic>cis</italic>-eSNVs, we mentioned that alterations in <italic>TP53</italic> (<italic>tumor protein p53</italic>) are well-studied in endometrial cancer, and our results revealed that 14 eSNVs were significantly correlated with transcript levels of 267 genes, demonstrating a wide regulatory role of <italic>TP53</italic> somatic alterations in endometrial cancer. <italic>ATF7IP</italic> (<italic>activating transcription factor 7 interacting protein</italic>), a multifunctional nuclear protein associated with heterochromatin, was reported to be associated with testicular germ cell cancer [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Two eSNVs (chr12:14576892 and chr12:14649176) on <italic>ATF7IP</italic> were identified to cause dysregulation of 100 genes. Therefore, our study suggested <italic>ATF7IP</italic> as a new susceptibility locus in endometrial cancer. It is noteworthy that <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>ATF7IP</italic> were annotated as transcription function-related genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>), which further explained thefunctional impacts of their alterations on downstream expression levels of many genes. In addition, 1 somatic alteration (chr8:21827087) on <italic>XPO7</italic> (Ran GTPase binding protein) was identified to be expression-associated in endometrial cancer, which was correlated with expression levels of 32 genes. Indeed, <italic>XPO7</italic> has been shown to be associated with serous epithelial ovarian cancer patient prognoses [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Here, we figured that the <italic>TP53-, ATF7IP-</italic>, and <italic>XPO7</italic>-associated expression profiles contribute to the discrepancy mutation statuses of these genes, demonstrating a wide range of perturbations of gene expression levels caused by somatic alterations.</p><p>In 13 identified cluster-related signatures, <italic>TP53, CTNNB1, PIK3CA, ARID1A, FBXW7</italic>, and <italic>PPP2R1A</italic> (which accounted for 65.0% (13/20) of eSNVs) are well-established recurrently mutated genes in endometrial cancers [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In this study. we demonstrated that these mutations embody the disease aggressiveness of endometrial cancers. Since late-stage (stages III + IV) and serous-like endometrial cancer patients were enriched in cluster 2 compared to clusters 1 and 3, the recurrent gain of these mutations may therefore be reflected by the disease progression, and further linked to disease aggressiveness in patients. To clarify the eSNVs that had the strongest prognostic values, we discovered 13 prognostic-related signatures (mapped to 10 genes) that could predict survival outcomes of endometrial cancer patients (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary note</xref>: <italic>13 prognostic-related signatures</italic>). Notably, when comparing the prognostic potentials between identified clusters and 13 prognostic-related signatures, we ascertained a higher clinical value of 13 prognostic-related eSNVs compared to mutational clusters, with summary measures of the AUC equal to 0.736 and 0.618, respectively. A time-dependent AUC also revealed that these 13 eSNVs possessed higher abilities to predict survival compared to mutation clusters, with first-year AUC values equal to 0.76 and 0.58, respectively. Taken together, we have enumerated 31 cluster-related and/or prognostic-related eSNV-based mutational signatures, and linking their mutational changes to various genes transcription level changes can highlight the underlying mechanism of how these somatic alterations incarnate disease aggressiveness and prognostic potential in endometrial cancer patients.</p><p>Most cancer-related mutational studies were conducted in a gene-based manner. Here, we adopted an SNV-based association test to gain more-detailed insights into endometrial cancer biology. After determining 31 cluster-related and prognosis-related signatures, we observed that most of the eSNVs showed clear mutual exclusivity between clusters, which correlated with different clinical outcomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). As an illustration, somatic alterations, including chr4:153249510 (<italic>FBXW7</italic>), chr5:67591246 (<italic>PIK3R1</italic>), rs28934576 and rs11540652 (<italic>TP53</italic>), rs121913399 (<italic>CTNNB1</italic>), and chr19:52716323 (<italic>PPP2R1A</italic>), were specifically enriched in cluster 2, which was linked to higher tumor aggression and poor prognoses. However, rs121913343 in <italic>TP53</italic> and rs121913403, rs28931588, and 121913413 in <italic>CTNNB1</italic> were specifically enriched in cluster 1, which was identified to be less aggressive (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary note</xref>: <italic>SNV-based somatic mutation profiles</italic>).</p><p>We employed 7 biological criteria to prioritize eSNVs and construct biological risk candidates for drug discovery (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A&#x02013;5C</xref>). Among 1,580 genes (275 driver genes and 1,305 correlated genes), 14 were determined to be solid-tumor drug target genes. In total, 9 drugs, including gemcitabine, dexrazoxane, thyrotropin-alfa, tamoxifen, bevacizumab, extramustine, marimastat, denileukin diftitox, and dasatinib, were identified to bind endometrial cancer-relevant altered genes that were associated with somatic mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). We interpreted the findings from 2 following aspects. First, our result suggested a possibility for indication switching for endometrial cancer. For the solid-tumor drugs identified, most were approved therapeutic agents for other cancer types (e.g., breast cancer [tamoxifen], colorectal cancer [bevacizumab], and prostate cancer [estramustine]). For endorsement of re-profiling of our findings to endometrial cancer, a <italic>VEGFA</italic> inhibitor, bevacizumab, was shown to be well tolerated and active in recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer based on progression-free survival at 6 months [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A phase II randomized clinical trial is currently ongoing to assess the antitumor efficacy of combining bevacizumab with conventional chemotherapies in advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: NCT01770171). In addition, gemcitabine was shown to be well tolerated and showed modest activity in advanced endometrial cancer [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition, a retrospective phase II trial also revealed a high potency of combining gemcitabine with cisplatin in endometrial cancer patients [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Estramustine, an anti-microtubule chemotherapeutic agent was identified in our study, and was shown to exert growth-inhibitory effects in endoplasmic reticular-positive endometrial cancer cells <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Interestingly, tamoxifen was identified in our study, and it is widely used to treat breast cancer, and was shown to increase the endometrial cancer incidence. The results should be carefully interpreted as the mechanism of endometrium hyperplasia induction is due to the weak estrogenic effect of tamoxifen but not the target of tamoxifen, i.e., <italic>PRKCG</italic>, which was identified as a potential therapeutic biomarker in our study. In addition, low-grade endometrial cancer was also demonstrated to respond to tamoxifen treatment [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Here, we noted the pitfall of drug repurposing based solely on aberrant molecular signatures without considering multiple and complex biological effects of therapeutic agents. Nonetheless, we have described a powerful prioritization method for identifying promising therapeutic candidates which may benefit endometrial cancer treatment.</p><p>Second, we mentioned a latent pharmacogenomic issue for the identified therapeutic agents when implementing clinical cancer treatment. Investigation of somatic alterations revealed a highly heterogeneous cancer profile across patients, providing a rationale to incorporate somatic mutation information into clinical use for more-efficient cancer treatments. For example, we discovered that <italic>LCK</italic> is a candidate therapeutic gene in endometrial cancer, and the expression level of <italic>LCK</italic> was significantly correlated with a somatic alteration of chr10:82187096. <italic>LCK</italic> is inhibited by dasatinib, a Src family protein (including p56<sup>Lck</sup>) and an EphA2 receptor blocker that inhibits a large array of targets. In support of dasatinib's therapeutic switching, a clinical trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: NCT01440998) of dasatinib in late-stage and recurrent endometrial cancer is ongoing [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Due to the promising molecular scheme, the clinical applicability of dasatinib in cancer treatment may therefore depend on harbored mutations of patients.</p><p>There have some limitations of this study. Based on its retrospective design, we showed the associations among identified drivers and clinical variables, further functional studies (in basic field or clinical study) and validations are required to assess the possibility of clinical application and implementation of our findings.</p><p>In summary, our study provides new insights into pharmacogenomic-guided pharmacotherapies based on driver eSNV profiles of endometrial cancer patients and closes the gap between oncogenomic research and traditional personalized trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In summary, our results reveal an integrative framework of correlation between SNV-based somatic mutations and transcripts&#x02019; levels in endometrial cancer. Since a number of driver eSNVs showed different aberration potential to transcripts, we illustrated the correlation between driver eSNV and clinicopathological features, e.g. disease stage, tumor histology and patients&#x02019; survival. In addition, we prioritized driver eSNVs and together their correlated probes, showing that these genes were enriched in known targets of approved solid tumor drugs. This approach can narrow down the candidate drugs before conducting clinical trial, thereby providing new avenues for the drug development of endometrial cancer, boosting drug discovery process and providing potential gene targets and drug candidates for the drug-repurposing and treatment of endometrial cancer. Besides, this approach can also be applied to other cancer types to prioritize drug candidates and facilitate their clinical applications and implementations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s5"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s5_1"><title>Datasets</title><p>Our study included 219 UCEC patients with primary tumor RNA expression data and mutation data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>).

The expression or methylation value of primary tissue was then normalized by the expression or methylation value of adjacent normal tissue to construct a standardized absolute differential expression or methylation profile [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, sole SNVs, SNVs annotated as insertion/deletion or germline/others, and all SNVs located outside of chromosomes 1&#x0223c;23 were excluded from the mutation profile.

In addition, Benjamini &#x00026; Hochberg adjusted <italic>p</italic> values were used to control the false-positive rate. In <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq-002">Equation 2</xref>, we tested for 78, 571, 548 pairs of SNV-gene associations by adopting a linear regression model (5, 824 SNV and 13, 491 genes), followed by the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing corrections. A genomic inflation factor lambda value was calculated (carried out with the <italic>snpStats</italic> package) to explore the possibility of cryptic sample relatedness that may bias the results of the association study. We then categorized significant associations based on their eSNV-gene relationships. We defined SNVs located within the gene that showed an association with the transcript level as &#x0201c;<italic>cis</italic>-acting eSNVs&#x0201d; and SNVs located outside of the gene showing correlations with the expression value as &#x0201c;<italic>trans</italic>-acting eSNVs&#x0201d;. We also intersected significant genes correlated with 3 genetic determinants (CpG methylation, somatic copy number alterations, and mutational eSNVs). For data presentation, pie charts were constructed with the <italic>plotrix</italic> package and a Venn diagram was illustrated with Venny (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/">http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s5_3"><title>Gene-based prioritization</title><p>After performing an SNV-based association analysis to identify expression-associated somatic alterations, we used the package <italic>DawnRank</italic> [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] to identify candidate personalized driver mutational genes in 219 TCGA UCEC samples (with both expression and mutation profiles available). RNA-sequencing expression data of primary tumors were normalized by available adjacent normal solid-tissue data using the &#x0201c;DawnNormalize&#x0201d; function, which returns a standardized differential expression matrix. The full gene network required by the <italic>DawnRank</italic> algorithm was downloaded from the <italic>DawnRank</italic> homepage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioen-compbio.bioen.illinois.edu/DawnRank/">http://bioen-compbio.bioen.illinois.edu/DawnRank/</ext-link>) which contained curated information from Reactome Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reactome.org/">http://www.reactome.org/</ext-link>), the Pathway Interaction Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pid.nci.nih.gov/">http://pid.nci.nih.gov/</ext-link>), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg/">http://www.genome.jp/kegg/</ext-link>). In short, the <italic>DawnRank</italic> algorithm evaluated the connectivity and number of differentially expressed genes to measure the impact of a mutation, utilized a dynamic damping factor to rank mutated genes based on their ability to perturb downstream genes, and returned personalized ranked mutated gene lists of every single UCEC sample. After the <italic>DawnRank</italic> analysis, we adopted the <italic>maxstats</italic> package to calculate maximally selected rank statistics of each patient in order to distinguish passenger from driver mutations with a cutoff of 0.95. In addition, predefined genes identified by TCGA, including <italic>TP53, CTNNB1, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PTEN, POLE, ARID1A, KRAS, CTCF, FBXW7, PPP2R1A</italic>, and <italic>ARID5B</italic> (<italic>RPL22</italic> was excluded as no SNV was detected to be correlated with its transcript level), were collaboratively included to prioritize eSNVs based on their corresponding gene loci. The number of candidate personalized driver genes identified by <italic>DawnRank</italic> was further correlated with UCEC patients&#x02019; clinical profiles (disease stage, tumor histology, and tumor grade) by a Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, and pairwise significance was determined by a Wilcoxon test (with the Bonferroni correction method for multiple testing corrections).</p><p>We then conducted an over-representation analysis (ORA) based on gene ontology (GO) biological process (BP) terms using the <italic>ClusterProfiler</italic> package [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We selected 0.01 as the significant Benjamini &#x00026; Hochberg adjusted <italic>p</italic> value cutoff to identify significantly enriched GO terms. We also downloaded a gene list of 1, 470 transcription factors (TFs), 297 transcription co-factors, and 118 chromatin-remodeling factors from The Animal Transcription Factor Database (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, AnimalTFDB) on 4 May 2015 [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] a comprehensive transcription factor database. We categorized 542 eSNVs into 2 categories: 99 TF-related eSNVs which mapped genes were annotated to be essential in gene transcription processes or gene transcription regulation (i.e. genes belonging to one of either &#x0201c;TF&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;transcription co-factor&#x0201d;, or &#x0201c;chromatin remodeling factor&#x0201d;) and remaining 443 non TF-related eSNVs. The proportions of mutation types (missense, silent, nonsense, 3&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR), intron, RNA, splice site and 5&#x02032; UTR mutations) in all, TF-related, and non-TF-related categories were separately calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s5_4"><title>Mutation cluster analysis</title><p>We conducted a clustering analysis based on 542 prioritized driver eSNVs to categorize UCEC patients into 3 groups based on their mutation profiles. In considering the sparse nature of the mutation matrix, we applied an unsupervised spherical k-means algorithm as implemented in the <italic>skmeans</italic> package to the mutation data with parameters <italic>k</italic> = 3 and method = &#x02018;pclust&#x02019;. The clustering result was visualized with the <italic>NMF</italic> package, with UCEC samples seriated within each cluster with the <italic>seriation</italic> package. A heatmap was constructed based on identified patient clusters and 542 eSNVs. In the heatmap visualization, black indicates mutations that occurred, while white indicates that no mutation was recorded. Unsupervised agglomerative hierarchical clustering of eSNVs was conducted with the parameters scale = &#x02018;row&#x02019;, distfun = &#x02018;correlation&#x02019;, and hclustfun = &#x02018;ward.D&#x02019;. We then correlated the 3-cluster configuration with patients&#x02019; clinical profiles including the disease stage, tumor histology, tumor grade (by Fisher's exact test), and survival data (by a Cox-regression test). Cox-proportional hazard models in the <italic>rms</italic> and <italic>survival</italic> packages were applied to evaluate the prognostic potential of the identified cluster against progression-free survival data with or without adjusting for the disease stage and tumor histology. The Kaplan-Meier estimator was illustrated with the <italic>ggplot2</italic> package. To further elucidate the prognostic potential of the identified cluster, we carried out a 10-year time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, with time-dependent accuracy summarized through correct classification rates defined as sensitivity and specificity was calculated, and calculated the cumulative case/dynamic control area under the ROC curve (AUC) as implemented in the <italic>survivalROC</italic> package [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. ROC curves constructed using the true positive rate (y-axis) and false positive rate (x-axis) can be utilized to evaluate the performance of a predictor against censored survival data. C-statistics which had scores of 0.5&#x0223c;1.0 were calculated to assess the accuracy of the identified clusters against the survival phenotype. The ROC curve lay on the 45&#x000b0; line indicated that the analyzed classifier was unable to predict survival outcomes. In addition, the summary measure of the censoring-adjusted C-statistic was calculated by Uno's method as implemented in the <italic>survAUC</italic> package.</p></sec><sec id="s5_5"><title>Prioritization of biological candidate eSNVs</title><p>To identify cluster-related eSNV signatures, we applied Fisher's exact test to correlate 542 eSNVs with identified patient clusters and selected a significance threshold of 0.05. Additionally, prognostic-related signatures were identified by applying a Cox-proportional hazards model. The null hypothesis, that there was no correlation between the mutation status and survival, was tested. We selected eSNVs that showed significance (with a Cox-regression <italic>p</italic> value of &#x0003c; 0.05) against progression-free survival with or without adjusting for clinical profiles. According to the 13 identified prognostic-related eSNV signatures, we classified patients into 2 groups: &#x0201c;with mutation(s)&#x0201d; (which mutation(s) could be found in at least one of the prognostic-related signatures) and the remaining as &#x0201c;without a mutation&#x0201d;. To construct the Kaplan-Meier distribution, UCEC patients were assigned to 2 groups, and the significance level of the progression-free survival difference between the 2 groups was calculated based on the Cox-regression model. Furthermore, to assess how well the 2-group configuration predicted the survival time for UCEC patients, a 10-year cumulative/dynamic ROC analysis of prognostic-related eSNV signatures was carried out, and summary measures of AUC were also calculated as described above.</p><p>To access the cooperative dysregulation of somatic mutations and relative expressions, we carried out a pairwise eSNV-eSNV correlation analysis based on the overlapping number of their associated genes. Fisher's exact test on a 2-by-2 contingency table was used to identify significant mutational eSNV pairs that co-occurred (Bonferroni corrected <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Then, we applied 2 additional analytical steps to minimize latent false positive coincident eSNV pairs. In considering the direction and magnitude of the coefficient, an unsupervised consensus clustering analysis of eSNVs using associated genes (beta coefficients) was conducted. We used the <italic>ConsensusClusterPlus</italic> package with 80% subsampling over 1, 000 iterations of k-means upon Euclidean distance matrix for subclasses identification with parameter maxK = 7. We successfully identified 4 robust clusters that accounted for positive or negative relationships between the eSNVs and associated genes. We thus excluded eSNV pairs that belonged to different consensus clusters. We further excluded eSNV pairs with overlapping associated gene numbers of &#x0003c; 10 to declare significant co-occurrence.</p><p>We applied the <italic>BISEP-BEEM</italic> (bimodality subsetting expression-bimodal expression exclusive with mutation) algorithm as implemented in the <italic>BiSEp</italic> package to identify candidate synthetic lethality (SL). Two genes were defined as having SL if mutations in both genes caused cell death but a mutation in either gene alone did not lead to cell death. To harmonize the RNA-sequencing data to the downstream analysis, we used the <italic>sRAP</italic> package to normalize RPKM values of primary tumors in UCEC patients. We rounded the expression value to &#x0003c; 0.1 to avoid bias caused by low-coverage genes, followed by log<sub>2</sub> transformation. The log<sub>2</sub>-normalized expression profiles of samples were inputted into <italic>BiSEp</italic> to detect bimodality (2 mixture components) and non-normality in all genes by model-based hierarchical clustering. Then, the BEEM algorithm was applied to detect eSNVs enriched in either of the bimodal gene expression modes. A threshold of Fisher's exact <italic>p</italic> value of &#x0003c; 0.05 was used to select candidate SL eSNV-gene pairs.</p><p>Each driver eSNV identified from UCEC patients was scored by the following 7 criteria (the adopted scoring system was modified from Yukinori Okada <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]): (i) eSNVs were annotated as missense variants; (ii) eSNVs were annotated as nonsense variants; (iii) eSNVs showed significant associations with gene expressions that were located within associated genes (<italic>cis</italic>-acting); (iv) eSNVs were prioritized by identifying mutational clusters (cluster-related) with <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; (v) eSNVs were prioritized by a Cox-regression with or without adjusting for clinical profiles (prognostic-related) with <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; (vi) eSNVs were prioritized by a pairwise mutational co-occurrence analysis with adjusted <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 and which showed consensus associated gene profiles; and (vii) eSNVs were prioritized by a candidate SL eSNV-gene pair nomination analysis with <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05. Correlations among these 7 criteria were calculated and visualized with the <italic>corrplot</italic> package, with a hierarchical clustering order for the correlation matrix. We carried out a pairwise significance test using a Phi correlation coefficient for the association among the 7 criteria (significant <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). We calculated the number of criteria that were satisfied and assigned a score to each driver eSNV, which ranged 0&#x0223c;7. We defined those eSNVs with a score of &#x02265; 2 as &#x0201c;biological UCEC risk mutational eSNVs&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="s5_6"><title>Candidate tumor drug mining</title><p>Drug target gene information was obtained from the DrugBank database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.drugbank.ca/">http://www.drugbank.ca/</ext-link>) and Therapeutic Target Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bidd.nus.edu.sg/group/cjttd/">http://bidd.nus.edu.sg/group/cjttd/</ext-link>) on 28 April 2015 [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Drug target genes were filtered by several criteria including human species and targeted by approved drugs. We manually extracted genes which were annotated as the target of an antineoplastic drug based on the indication. Then, the drug target profile was separated into a &#x0201c;solid-tumor drug target profile&#x0201d; (<italic>n</italic> = 79) and a &#x0201c;hematologic-tumor drug target profile&#x0201d; (<italic>n</italic> = 45) based on annotated indications. The hematologic-tumor drug target profile was constructed based on the keywords &#x02018;leukemia&#x02019;, &#x02018;lymphatic leukemia&#x02019;, &#x02018;multiple myeloma&#x02019;, &#x02018;lymphoma&#x02019;, &#x02018;leukemias and lymphomas&#x02019;, and &#x02018;hematologic malignancies&#x02019;, while the remaining were extracted to build a solid-tumor drug target profile. We evaluated whether genes from the biologically risky gene profiles were pharmacologically therapeutic targets of approved solid-cancer drugs. In total, 275 genes (mapped by 394 prioritized biological eSNVs) and 1, 305 correlated genes were used to separately query corresponding drugs in the solid-tumor and hematologic-tumor drug target profiles. Overlapping genes between the query gene list and solid-tumor or hematologic-tumor drug target profiles were extracted and counted. In addition, drugs that targeted genes in the query gene list were also illustrated. Enrichment of overlapping genes extracted from the solid-tumor and hematologic-tumor profiles were calculated by a hypergeometric test.</p></sec><sec id="s5_7"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>We performed all analytic workflows in this study under the R environment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cran.r-project.org/">http://cran.r-project.org/</ext-link>) and Bioconductor (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioconductor.org/">http://www.bioconductor.org/</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURES AND TABLES</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="oncotarget-07-5909-s001.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e1595" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx" xlink:href="oncotarget-07-5909-s002.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e1597" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx" xlink:href="oncotarget-07-5909-s003.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e1599" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx" xlink:href="oncotarget-07-5909-s004.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e1601" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx" xlink:href="oncotarget-07-5909-s005.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e1603" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx" xlink:href="oncotarget-07-5909-s006.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e1605" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx" xlink:href="oncotarget-07-5909-s007.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e1607" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND FUNDING</title><p>This work was supported by grants from Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW103-TDU-B-212-113001), from the National Science Council, Taiwan, ROC (MOST 104-2320-B-038-016) and from Taipei Medical University (12310-0223).</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions</bold></p><p>H.S.C.W. designed approaches, performed integrative analysis, interpreted data and wrote the manuscript.
