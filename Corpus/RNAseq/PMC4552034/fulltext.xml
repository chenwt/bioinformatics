By disrupting water balance, drought stress reduces plant development, reproduction, seed, and fruit yields [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Plants respond to drought stress with complex cascades of gene expression and signal transduction [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The identification and application of genes associated with stress tolerance are of interest in the development of drought tolerance in crop plants [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Approximately 2000 drought-responsive genes have been identified in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For some xerophytes, like <italic>Populus euphratica</italic>, gene discovery and transcriptome analyses have led to the identification of numerous potential stress-related genes [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These studies are contributing new gene resources, revealing drought responsive mechanisms in xerophytes and enabling production of more stress tolerant plants.</p><p><italic>Ammopiptanthus mongolicus</italic> (Maxim. Ex Kom.) Cheng f., is a relatively primitive species found in the semi-arid region of north-western China [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The genus <italic>Ammopiptanthus</italic> (in the <italic>Leguminosae</italic>) contains only two species (<italic>A</italic>. <italic>mongolicus</italic> and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nanus</italic>) which are considered endangered. This is of great concern ecologically given that the two species are the only evergreen broadleaf shrubs in this largely desert area [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Strong osmotic stress resistance makes it possible for <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mongolicus</italic> to survive in very inhospitable areas, where the annual precipitation can be as low as 150 mm and the lowest temperature is below -30&#x000b0;C. Our previous studies have elucidated cold resistance mechanisms in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mongolicus</italic>. It is of even greater importance to discover the genes and metabolic pathways associated with drought stress tolerance in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mongolicus</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Individual drought-related genes have been cloned and identified, such as <italic>AmCBL1</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], <italic>AmNHX2</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], <italic>AmVP1</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], <italic>AmEBP1</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and <italic>AmLEA</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, the few gene resources for <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mongolicus</italic> in GenBank (5,801 ESTs and 164 nucleotide sequences as of Dec 1<sup>st</sup>, 2014) are inadequate to fully characterize stress response pathways.</p><p>Originally, Sanger sequencing of cDNA libraries, which is relatively low throughput, costly and nonquantitative, was used for gene discovery and transcriptome analysis [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In recent years, rapid developments in next-generation sequencing (NGS), such as massively parallel 454 pyrosequencing and Illumina-based RNASeq, have spurred rapid developments in genomics and transcriptomics research [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Because of its advantages of longer read lengths, speed and accuracy, 454 pyrosequencing has been widely applied in <italic>de novo</italic> sequencing, especially in gene discovery and functional identification with non-model organisms, such as <italic>Aegilops variabilis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], <italic>Metasequoia glyptostroboides</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], <italic>Cicer arietinum</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], <italic>Eucalyptus grandis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], <italic>Phalaenopsis orchids</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], <italic>Populus euphratica</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and <italic>Liriodendron tulipifera</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136495.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>A few studies have reported gene expression profiles from <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mongolicus</italic> under drought stress.

Of the 1,594 putatively unique transcripts assembled from the 5,282 ESTs, 528 were specific to stress-response. Recently, Wu <italic>et al</italic>.

Two cDNA libraries constructed from RNA of leaves from drought-treated seedlings and untreated seedlings were sequenced on a 454 pyrosequencing platform. Insights into the functions of expressed genes were obtained from COG annotations, GO classifications and KEGG metabolic pathway analysis. The putative functions of transcripts from leaves observed in this study represent a different set of genes from the previous reports from transcriptomes of root tissues and seedlings under drought and non-drought conditions.

The fraction of unigene sequence coverage was simply calculated as the length of the combined consensus sequence of all reads mapped to a specific unigene, divided by the length of the respective unigene. Four distinct clusters of sequences emerged when the coverage by root vs. leaf sequence reads were compared for all cases in which at least 10% of the unigenes length was covered (<xref rid="pone.0136495.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). The unigenes clearly fell into all four possible clusters of root vs. leaf read coverage: unigenes for which the length of coverage was high by both root and leaf reads, unigenes for which the length of coverage was high by root reads but low by leaf reads, unigenes for which the length of coverage was low by root reads but high by leaf reads, and cases in which unigene length of coverage was low for both root and leaf reads. The numbers of unigenes in each of the clusters differed greatly however. The factor most affecting the difference in total counts of unigenes in each of the four classes was the disproportionate number of unigenes for which the length of coverage was high in leaf tissue mRNA reads, in contrast to the more uniform distribution of coverage of unigenes with reads from root tissue. The total numbers of unigenes covered at a minimum of 10% of their length by root vs. leaf reads is shown in <xref rid="pone.0136495.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>.

In contrast, we used a drought stress treatment as similar as possible to conditions experienced in nature, i.e. a long-term treatment (4 weeks) of plants in soil stressed to specific water potential values. Short vs. long term desiccation durations can produce different results in physiological and adaptive responses. Generally, plants respond to rapid dehydration by minimizing water loss or altering expression of certain genes to prevent dehydration damage. Under slowly developing water deficits, plants can survive against dehydration by optimizing their long term acclimation responses, including changes to shoot physiology and resource allocation [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. As soils become dry, signals from the roots are transported via the xylem to leaves, resulting in reduced water loss and decreased leaf growth, followed by changes in abscisic acid (ABA), pH, cytokinins, ethylene precursors and other factors related to stress signaling processes[<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Thus, while it is appropriate to study responses in root tissues under short-term water-stress conditions, above ground tissues are valuable in research on longer-term responses to drought stress. The treatment length was chosen from results of preliminary experiments in which physiological status and expression of candidate drought-response genes were assessed by qRT-PCR at 2, 3 and 4 weeks intervals.

Also individual reads can be more difficult to assign to specific members of gene families than contigs, complicating transcriptome analysis.</p><p>More PUTs may have been expected from the transcriptome assembly, however, given the large number of high quality sequence reads obtained (over 190M) and the fact that many genes are normally expressed in leaves.

This could result in a smaller, less complex transcriptome, if <italic>de novo</italic> transcription of stress-response genes are then predominant, at least transiently. Perhaps differences in complexity of transcriptomes among abiotic stress studies may relate in part to stress levels, for example if shorter, less intense stress treatments have less effect on suppression of gene expression. Furthermore, at the time that the stress treatment commenced, the leaves that we sampled were already fully developed, at which time only house keeping genes may have been active.

It is also known that transcription factors such as MYB and MYC may be activated, and interact with certain cis-elements, thus inducing the expression of drought responsive genes [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. We observed two DEGs related to MYB transcription factors that were induced by drought stress. However, no MYC-related DEGs were identified in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mongolicus</italic> in this study. In the alternate, ABA-independent signaling pathway, gene expression under drought stress is not related to ABA levels [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The dehydration-responsive element (DRE) is a 9-bp conserved sequence, TACCGACAT, that has been observed in the promoter region of drought-responsive genes [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Commonly, the transcription factors of DRE-binding proteins contain the AP2/EREBP domain, such as DREB1/CBF and DREB2 (DRE binding protein) [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136495.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In this study, a number of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mongolicus</italic> PUTs were observed that match the AP2/DREBP domain, 11 of which showed significant differential expression under drought. The soybean <italic>GmDREB2</italic> protein has been reported to promote the expression of downstream genes to enhance drought and high salinity tolerance in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The WRKY gene (Contig3894_DT) identified in our study, which was highly expressed under drought stress, had not been previously reported in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mongolicus</italic>. Thus further functional characterization of this gene is warranted, similar to studies of overexpression of soybean GmWRKY genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> in which plants were reported to be more tolerant to cold (<italic>GmWRKY21</italic>), salt (<italic>GmWRKY54</italic> and <italic>GmWRKY21</italic>) or drought (<italic>GmWRKY54</italic>) stress than wild-type plants [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136495.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. WRKY TFs were suggested to play a key role in ABA and drought-responsive signalling networks [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Even though <italic>WRKY23</italic> was originally identified as a plant-parasitic nematode-inducible gene, current studies also indicated that <italic>PtWRKY23</italic> is involved in redox homeostasis and cell wall-related metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0136495.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The function of the <italic>WRKY23</italic> gene in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mongolicus</italic> under drought treatment remains to be determined through further research, including transgenic studies in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> or a leguminous model such as <italic>M</italic>. <italic>truncatula</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec020"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this report, we provided a comprehensive transcriptome analysis of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mongolicus</italic> under drought stress, incorporating data and findings from previous reports as well as new experimental findings. All of the putatively unique transcripts were annotated, and drought-responsive DEGs were classified as to functional categories and metabolic pathways. Many candidate genes potentially involved in drought stress in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mongolicus</italic> were identified.</p><p>The one month water deprivation regime applied in this study generated a relatively small decrease in the leaf water potential in the drought-tolerant <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mongolicus</italic> plants indicating that the plants did not experience the degree of physiological stress that might be expected in drought-sensitive plants under the same conditions. To create greater physiological stress levels, a longer and more severe water-deprivation regime would have been required, which may have elicited a stronger gene expression response in the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mongolicus</italic> plants as well. However, in this study we were interested in learning how <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mongolicus</italic> plants tolerate water deprivation conditions that would damage most other species, and if there is a gene expression component associated with that, rather than determining what levels of water stress would produce the same physiological and gene expression responses in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mongolicus</italic> as in drought-sensitive species exhibit under lower stress levels. All species, even desert plants, will be damaged or perish at some point after prolonged drought conditions. However response to extreme, damaging stress conditions may not reflect inherent tolerance mechanisms in desert plants. The fact that <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mongolicus</italic> plants in this study did demonstrate many of the typical changes in gene expression in response to water stress conditions, relative to controls, documented that the treated <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mongolicus</italic> plants did perceive the stress conditions, even though the plants were not yet showing many signs of physiological stress. Perhaps, in part, <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mongolicus</italic> adaptation to xeric conditions involves a more rapid gene expression response, or the ability to respond to lower levels of physiological stress, than in more drought-sensitive species. It would be interesting in future research to investigate if the upstream transcription factor DEGs which we uncovered in this study play a role in the priming of expression of defence-response gene expression pathway genes in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mongolicus</italic>. Drought-tolerance mechanisms in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mongolicus</italic> may also include structural and constitutive adaptations of equal or greater importance than temporal gene expression changes, which would also be worthy of additional study.</p><p>All data in this study have been publically archived for future research. We hope that this report will lead to more research on the functional identification of drought-responsive genes and mechanisms in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mongolicus</italic>, to enrich our knowledge of the basis of stress tolerance in desert-adapted plants and facilitate the improvement of drought resistance in other plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec021"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec022"><title>Plant material</title><p>This study was approved by the National Engineering Laboratory for Tree Breeding.

The transplanted seedlings were separated into two groups: control group (CK) and drought-treated group (DT). Controls were watered to field capacity every day. For the DT group, the water stress treatment was implemented by stopping watering on the first day and withholding water for the next two to four weeks, which simulated a natural drought process (<xref rid="pone.0136495.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>).
