The perennial nature of leafy spurge is mainly attributed to vegetative shoot growth from an abundance of underground adventitious buds that transition through well-defined phases of seasonally-induced dormancy [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Generally, adventitious buds are produced on the crown and lateral roots of leafy spurge in late May to early June and enter a state of paradormancy once formed. These buds will initiate new shoot growth when aerial tissues are destroyed or removed [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In the fall, environmental cues perceived by the plant (reduced temperature and photoperiod) induce adventitious buds to transition from paradormancy to endodormancy, which induces a state of extended growth incompetence [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; meaning these adventitious buds are inhibited from resuming normal growth when exposed to growth-conducive conditions. Growth competency can be restored to these endodormant buds by extended cold temperature [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In leafy spurge, endodormancy is relatively shallow with some buds showing little to no dormancy, but most buds have greatly delayed growth or sluggish growth upon return to growth-conducive conditions following endodormancy induction [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, if the conditions remain cold, the buds will stay, non-growing, in an ecodormant state. Interestingly, endodormancy formation in the fall is required for leafy spurge to vernalize, and flowering competence gained by vernalization coincides with the transition from endodormancy to ecodormancy [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These results support the hypothesis that there is an overlap in signaling mechanisms regulating dormancy and flowering [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), a universal promoter of flowering, plays a crucial role in mediating the onset of flowering [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In arabidopsis (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Heyn) and other annual models, CONSTANS (CO), together with FT, GIGANTEA (GI), CRYPTOCHROME 2/CRYPTOCHROME-INTERACTING BASIC-HELIX-LOOP-HELIX (CRY2), PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4), and the mediator complexes are important positive regulatory factors in <italic>FT</italic> transcriptional regulation, whereas FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP), TEMPRANILLO 1 (TEM1) and SCHLAFMUTZE (SMZ) are negative regulatory factors to balance <italic>FT</italic> transcription [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. <italic>FT</italic> is primarily expressed in phloem companion cells in the leaves and the resulting protein is transported to the meristem where it initiates a transition of the vegetative meristem to a floral meristem [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The CO/FT regulatory module plays a vital role in controlling the photoperiod regulation of flowering in arabidopsis and, surprisingly, this module also controls short-photoperiod-induced growth cessation and bud set in poplar [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, it is assumed that perennial plants may share a similar signaling pathway to regulate other complex developmental or biological processes.</p><p>Since first associated with endodormancy, following the cloning of the <italic>EVERGROWING</italic> locus in peach [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], <italic>DORMANCY ASSOCIATED MADS-BOX</italic> (<italic>DAM</italic>) genes have been identified from numerous woody plants. Meta-analysis of microarray data comparing different stages of bud dormancy in leafy spurge, raspberry (<italic>Rubus idaeus</italic>), poplar (<italic>Populous</italic> ssp.), potato, and grape (<italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] identified several MADS-box transcription factors related to the <italic>DAM</italic> genes from peach. Interestingly, <italic>DAM</italic> genes encoded one of the few differentially-regulated transcription factors identified in leafy spurge and 3 or more of the other species. In addition, the previous study also indicated that expression of two <italic>DAM</italic> transcripts was significantly increased in crown buds during the transition from paradormancy to endodormancy. One of the <italic>DAM</italic> transcripts (<italic>DAM1</italic>) was primarily expressed during endodormancy, and the other (<italic>DAM2</italic>) was primarily expressed in late endodormancy and during ecodormancy [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Subsequent studies indicated that both transcripts are splice variants from the same gene [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p><italic>DAM</italic> genes have similarity to the transcription factors <italic>SVP</italic> and <italic>AGAMOUS-LIKE 24</italic> (<italic>AGL24</italic>) in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and have expression patterns consistent with a role in dormancy regulation in many perennial plants [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In arabidopsis, SVP negatively regulates <italic>FT</italic> by binding a CArG motif to maintain plants in vegetative growth [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Transcription of <italic>FT</italic> was coordinately down-regulated upon induction of <italic>DAM</italic>, which was paralleled by transitions from paradormancy to endo- and eco-dormancy in leafy spurge crown buds [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Further, over-expression of leafy spurge <italic>DAM</italic> genes in arabidopsis had a negative effect on flowering and growth [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Likewise, over expressing a Japanese apricot <italic>DAM</italic> gene in poplar enhances dormancy induction in poplar, and the highest <italic>DAM</italic> expressing lines had lower levels of <italic>FT</italic> transcripts than lines showing low <italic>DAM</italic> expression or which over-expression had little impact on the phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, because of the structural similarity between DAM and SVP, and the role of <italic>FT</italic> in controlling bud dormancy in poplar as well as the impact of expression of <italic>DAM</italic> genes on <italic>FT</italic> transcript accumulation in heterologous systems, the leafy spurge DAM proteins have been proposed to play a direct role in dormancy induction and maintenance through negative regulation of <italic>FT</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Subsequently, two genomic BAC clones containing <italic>FT</italic>-like genes from leafy spurge and several BAC clones containing very similar <italic>DAM</italic> gene have been cloned and characterized [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Here we test the hypothesis that DAM regulates <italic>FT</italic> expression, and document the expression of <italic>DAM</italic> and <italic>FT</italic> genes, including diurnal expression, tissue-specific expression, and the expression pattern under dormancy induction. Results indicate that <italic>DAM</italic> and <italic>FT</italic> genes are expressed in a manner consistent with DAM negatively regulating <italic>FT</italic> expression, but the minimal tissue-specific expression of <italic>FT</italic> in the buds along with minimal differential expression of DAM in the leaves suggests that modification of the hypothesis may be in order. Additionally, we examine the possible interaction of DAM with FT promoter elements using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using an antibody proven to interact with the leafy spurge DAM protein(s).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plant materials and treatments</title><p>Three-month-old leafy spurge plants, grown in sunshine mix in 1- &#x000d7; 8-inch conetainers under 16 h of natural and supplemental lighting (from 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM CST) and an average greenhouse temperature of approximately 25&#x000b0;C, were used in this study.

All samples were immediately frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub> and stored at -80 C. For dormancy induction analysis, plants were moved into a growth chamber under long-photoperiod (16 hrs) with cold night, morning, and evening (11 C for 16 hrs) but warm mid-day (24 C for 8 hrs) conditions. These conditions have been shown to induce endodormancy within 6 weeks [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Samples were collected at 0&#x02013;8 days, and 1.5 through 7 weeks. Shoot apices and leaves were collected for expression analysis during the first four weeks of dormancy inducing conditions when crown buds were small. After that, leaves and crown buds were collected because aboveground parts stopped growing but crown buds were enlarged. Two biological replications were collected. Samples were frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub> immediately after collection and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C for further study. After 7 weeks of treatment to induce endodormancy, plants were exposed to 5&#x000b0;C and short-photoperiod (8 hours) to vernalize and induce ecodormancy. After four weeks, we removed all aerial tissues and moved these plants into a greenhouse to check dormancy status (the plants with 20 weeks vernalization were also examined to confirm they had broken endodormancy). The length of the longest shoots from crown buds of at least 7 plants were measured after two weeks.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>RNA extraction and expression analysis</title><p>Frozen samples were ground in liquid N<sub>2</sub> and RNAs were extracted following the pine tree extraction protocol [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

It is unclear if <italic>DAM</italic> is also regulated by circadian clock associated proteins in perennial plants in a manner similar to <italic>SVP</italic> of arabidopsis. However, the presence of conserved evening elements in the promoters of leafy spurge <italic>DAM</italic> genes [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] is consistent with this possibility. Additional experiments with a shift from diurnal photoperiods to constant light or darkness will be required to determine if the response was the result of circadian regulation or not.</p><p>In arabidopsis, <italic>FT</italic> expression levels are influenced by the regulation of CONSTANS (CO) abundance [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Under long-photoperiod conditions, the transcript abundance of <italic>CO</italic> is regulated by the circadian clock [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and its posttranscriptional regulation is triggered by light [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Therefore, in arabidopsis, the activation of <italic>FT</italic> transcription mainly depends on the light-mediated posttranscriptional regulation of <italic>CO</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In leafy spurge under long-photoperiods, <italic>FT</italic> expression levels also appear to follow the light status with peak expression at the end of the photoperiod with no apparent anticipation of a light or dark cycle. Thus, our observations would be consistent with a CO/FT regulatory module under long-photoperiod conditions controlling <italic>FT</italic> expression in leafy spurge, assuming that the products of these homologs perform similar function in leafy spurge as they do in arabidopsis. Overall, the diurnal expression patterns of <italic>DAM</italic> and <italic>FT</italic> in leafy spurge appear to be similar to the diurnal expression patterns or <italic>SVP</italic> and <italic>FT</italic> in arabidopsis.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Expression of DAM and FT in leafy spurge are similar to that in other species</title><p>Tissue-specific gene expression studies indicated that the <italic>DAM1</italic> transcript is preferentially expressed in shoot apices and crown buds, and <italic>DAM2</italic> transcript is preferentially expressed in stems and shoot apices, with some expression in leaves (<xref rid="pone.0126030.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).

These results suggest that <italic>DAM</italic> genes have no strict tissue specificity.

In leafy spurge, the increased abundance of <italic>FT</italic> in leaves and flowers are consistent with a role for <italic>FT</italic> in flowering regulation, assuming that these homologs functions similarly in leafy spurge as it does in other species. In Lombardy poplar, <italic>PnFT1</italic> and <italic>PnFT2</italic> also had strong expression in early-summer leaves and capsules of reproductive trees, while <italic>PnFT3/4</italic> had strong expression in stems and winter lateral buds.

It is unclear if the lack of <italic>DAM</italic> induction was due to the observed increasing senescence of the leaves after several weeks of endodormancy inducing conditions (data not shown), or if some other factors were responsible for the limited increase in <italic>DAM</italic> accumulation. However, a slight accumulation of <italic>DAM1</italic> transcript in the leaves appears to occur after 7d in leaf tissue following endodormancy induction and this precedes the significant drop in <italic>FT</italic> expression after 8d.

Likewise, in the shoot tips, <italic>FT</italic> transcript accumulation did not drop below its initial levels for nearly a week after the observed strong increase in <italic>DAM</italic> expression. Because we did not observe changes in FT expression prior to observing changes in DAM expression, these observations are consistent with the potential role for DAM negatively regulating <italic>FT</italic>.</p><p>As noted above, <italic>DAM</italic> is primarily induced and expressed in the buds and meristem (<xref rid="pone.0126030.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).

Thus, it is also possible that DAM might also regulate endodormancy induction in leafy spurge through mechanisms similar to how SVP regulates flowering in arabidopsis. In support of this hypothesis, <italic>SOC1</italic> was down regulated by endodormancy-inducing conditions in leafy spurge in two separate microarray experiments [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and recently in an independent RNAseq experiment (unpublished), albeit not at our fairly strict significance cutoff of p&#x0003c;0.005.</p><p>Our results are, however, consistent with DAM having a potential negative regulatory role in <italic>FT</italic> gene expression in the leaves since the significant decrease in <italic>FT</italic> expression did not precede the significant increase in <italic>DAM1</italic> transcript accumulation.

However, the earliest test for endodormancy induction was four weeks, and thus we cannot rule out the immediate establishment of endodormancy with induction of <italic>DAM</italic> and repression of <italic>FT</italic>.

In this study, regions 1, 2 and 5 of the leafy spurge <italic>FT2</italic> promoter have similar locations with variants of CArG III/IV and CArG V motifs in the <italic>FT</italic> promoter region of arabidopsis. A search of the <italic>FT2</italic> promoter region highlighted putative transcription factor binding sites and conserved motifs (<xref rid="pone.0126030.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, an unknown motif (tttcatgatgggtt) was found in region 1, which could represent an atypical CArG motif. Moreover, this motif is also conserved in similar regions of the leafy spurge <italic>FT4</italic> and poplar <italic>FT2</italic> promoters. Because CArG box sequences can be variable for SVP protein binding [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], we suggest that this conserved motif may serve as a novel CArG box that is recognized by the leafy spurge DAM protein. However, the region 2 was also enriched in the ChIP assays, and this region contains two CArG boxes, one of which (with the sequence cctattgg) is very similar to a CArG box in the same promoter region of the poplar <italic>FT2</italic> gene promoter (with the sequence cctcttgg) and which is identical in the first 6 bases to the CArgIII binding site in the arabidopsis <italic>FT</italic> gene.</p><p>It should be noted though, that only <italic>DAM1/2</italic> and three other <italic>DAM</italic>-like transcript shows high accumulation during ecodormancy (data not shown). Additionally, it has been proposed that DAM and other related proteins likely have additional targets besides <italic>FT</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We also agree that other targets (such as <italic>SOC1</italic>) might be viable targets for DAM and that such interactions have a potential role in dormancy responses. Consequently more work is needed to determine not only the additional targets of DAM proteins, but also the complex interactions of other potential regulators of dormancy on expression of <italic>FT</italic>. Towards this end, we have developed an antibody that recognizes the DAM protein and have data from chromatin immunoprecipitation assays that indicates it can specifically interact with chromatin that includes the conserved CArG box in the <italic>FT</italic> promoter. However, further studies are needed to confirm the specificity of this antibody and the specificity of the CArG box binding supported by these initial observations.</p><p>In conclusion, evidence here and in the literature strongly suggest the DAM/FT regulatory module may be a common mechanism controlling dormancy development in perennial plants. <italic>FT</italic> genes, as crucial developmental regulators, have multifaceted roles in plant development- including bud dormancy [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. <italic>FT</italic> is regulated by both epigenetic mechanisms and by many regulatory factors or complexes binding to different elements in the promoter or introns of the <italic>FT</italic> gene [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. DAM has similarity to other proteins known to negatively regulate <italic>FT</italic> in other systems. Leafy spurge <italic>DAM</italic> and <italic>FT</italic> genes have opposite seasonal expression patterns during para- to endo-dormancy transition in the fall [<xref rid="pone.0126030.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Here we show that <italic>DAM</italic> and <italic>FT</italic> have expression patterns that generally consistent with the hypothesis that DAM negatively regulates <italic>FT</italic>. Additionally a conserved CArG box exists in the <italic>FT</italic> promoters of leafy spurge and poplar, and may serve as the binding sites for DAM or other very similar proteins. Further, conservation of the potential DAM binding site in poplar and leafy spurge suggests that the DAM/FT regulatory module may be a common mechanism controlling endodormancy induction in perennial plants. Collectively, these results provide further evidence for DAM having a direct role in negatively regulating <italic>FT</italic> in leafy spurge.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0126030.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>List of primers.</title><p>Primers used for qRT-PCR to determine gene expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation result analysis.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0126030.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0126030.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>List of contigs with similarity to predicted DAM1 antibody binding site.</title><p>List of transcripts assembled from three different expression analyses of leafy spurge including two containing dormant and growing bud samples that were identified as having sequence similarity (E values &#x0003c; 10E-5) with <italic>DAM1</italic> in a BlastX search of the transcriptome database.

The nature of the antigenic 30 kD band that eluted with the GST-tagged DAM2 protein is unknown, but is likely to be a breakdown product of the DAM2 protein. The level of specificity of the antibody in vivo under non-denaturing conditions is unclear, but given the fact that likely DNA targets of DAM1 can be specifically precipitated with this antibody, it seems likely that it is reactive in vivo.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0126030.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0126030.s005"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>FT2 promoter sequence and likely transcription factor binding sites.</title><p>Above shows <italic>FT2</italic> promoter region and the putative conserved transcription factor binding sites are marked.
