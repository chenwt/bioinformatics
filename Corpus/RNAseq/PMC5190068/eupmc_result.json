    "Approximately 50-75% of patients with serous ovarian carcinoma (SOC) experience recurrence within 18 months after first-line treatment. Current clinical indicators are inadequate for predicting the risk of recurrence. In this study, we used 7 publicly available microarray datasets to identify gene signatures related to recurrence in optimally debulked SOC patients, and validated their expressions in an independent clinic cohort of 127 patients using immunohistochemistry (IHC). We identified a two-gene signature including KCNN4 and S100A14 which was related to recurrence in optimally debulked SOC patients. Their mRNA expression levels were positively correlated and regulated by DNA copy number alterations (CNA) (KCNN4: p=1.918e-05) and DNA promotermethylation (KCNN4: p=0.0179; S100A14: p=2.787e-13). Recurrence prediction models built in the TCGA dataset based on KCNN4 and S100A14 individually and in combination showed good prediction performance in the other 6 datasets (AUC:0.5442-0.9524). The independent cohort supported the expression difference between SOC recurrences. Also, a KCNN4 and S100A14-centered protein interaction subnetwork was built from the STRING database, and the shortest regulation path between them, called the KCNN4-UBA52-KLF4-S100A14 axis, was identified. This discovery might facilitate individualized treatment of SOC."
