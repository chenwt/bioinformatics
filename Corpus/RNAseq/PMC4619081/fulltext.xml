The prevalence of alternative splicing increases from invertebrates to vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and is particularly high in the immune and nervous systems, where high diversity of molecular repertoires is necessary for cell identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Whether an alternative exon is included or excluded in a mature RNA is considered a matter of combinatorial control, involving splice sites, additional binding sites, and the factors that recognize them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Recent evidence suggests that chromatin organization and transcriptional dynamics may also contribute to this control. First, splicing can occur co-transcriptionally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and this has been demonstrated to be widespread in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], fruit fly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Second, some splicing factors are known to interact with modified histone tails, and intragenic histone modifications have been shown to be involved in alternative splicing decisions on individual genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Third, RNA Polymerase II elongation dynamics is known to influence exon inclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], which was shown to be modulated by CTCF binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Lastly, a number of independent studies demonstrated that nucleosome density correlates with exon-intron architecture genome-wide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and specifically with exon inclusion levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>While links between chromatin and splicing have thus been established, attempts to incorporate chromatin information on quantitative models predictive of cell type-specific exon inclusion levels have met so far with moderate success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and the extent to which cell type-specific chromatin organization contributes to cell type-specific splicing patterns remain largely unknown.</p><p>Here to investigate the relationship between chromatin and splicing, we analyzed transcriptome and epigenome data generated in a number of human cell lines within the ENCODE project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. First, we used RNASeq data to identify exons that are differentially included between cell lines. We found that a relatively small fraction of human exons (about 3&#x000a0;% of all internal exons in about 10&#x000a0;% of all investigated genes) exhibit regulated inclusion across human cell lines. These regulated exons are maintained at intermediate inclusion levels compared to all exons. Second, we used ChIPSeq data to investigate the association between the inclusion of regulated exons and histone modifications. Our results strongly suggest that there is little or no direct association between histone modifications and the inclusion levels of the majority of these exons. We identified, however, a small set of regulated exons (about 4&#x000a0;% of all differentially included exons) in which cell type-specific inclusion levels do appear to be directly associated to levels of canonically activating histone modifications. In contrast to most exons, the inclusion of these exons is maintained at remarkable low levels across a large variety of cell types and tissues. In addition to being enriched in histone modifications, these exons have other characteristics typical of promoter regions, but they do not correspond to sites of transcription initiation. However, they tend to lie closer to transcription initiation sites, and through chromatin looping they tend to interact with promoter regions.</p><p>Our observations are consistent with a role for promoter regions and for promoter-characteristic epigenetic signatures in the regulation of the alternative splicing of a well-defined set of exons, possibly involving the opening of chromatin and folding of chromatin loops that bring together regulated exons and promoters into close spatial distance. Histone modifications and other features that activate transcription could then be co-opted in these cases to participate also in the regulation of exon inclusion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>R1.

Nuclear polyA+ RNA was selected, since, in contrast to other RNA fractions, in this fraction splicing has been essentially completed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], but it is unlikely to have undergone nonsense mediated decay (NMD), and thus, it reflects more precisely the direct outcome of splicing.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Assessment and properties of exons differentially spliced between cell lines K562 and Gm12878. <bold>a</bold> Classification of &#x02018;more included&#x02019; and &#x02018;less included&#x02019; exons. <bold>b</bold> Estimated inclusion ratio in the K562 cell line (x-axis) and in the Gm12878 cell line (y-axis) of exons whose inclusion is: (1) significantly higher in Gm12878 (dark blue); (2) significantly higher in the K562 cell line (dark red); (3) whose inclusion does not change significantly between the two cell lines (light blue). <bold>c</bold> Distribution of the sum of the strengths of 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019; splice sites flanking exons that do not display significant differences in inclusion between the cell lines (notAS, left boxplot) and differentially included (that is, regulated) exons (AS, right boxplot).

These belong to 15,679 different genes. We used the one-sided Fisher test on the number of exclusion and inclusion reads to identify differentially included exons between each cell pair (see <xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). Exons with significant inclusion level changes were called more/less included exons depending in the direction of the change (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b&#x02013;g</xref> shows the results of the comparison of Gm12878 and K562. We identified 1,688 exons regulated between these two cell lines (1,066 more included in Gm12878 and 622 more included in K562, <italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c;0.05, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). These differentially included exons possess known properties of alternative exons, as previously described in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]: (1) they have weaker splice sites compared to exons not differentially included (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>); (2) they tend to be shorter (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>); and (3) when coding, their length is more often divisible by three (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Moreover, (4) we did not find significant differences in the expression levels of the genes hosting differentially included exons between the two cell lines compared (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). In order to independently validate our alternative exon calling method, we selected a total of 15 of these exons (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>). Using exon-junction oligonucleotides (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1), we quantified by qPCR the ratio of inclusion/skipping isoform in Gm12878 compared to K562. This method of quantification provides an assessment of the differences in the relative inclusion of the exons regardless of possible differences in gene expression between the cell lines compared. We validated 12 out of the 15 selected cases (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>), corresponding to a validation rate of 80&#x000a0;%.</p><p>We assessed whether conditions 1&#x02013;4 above (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c&#x02013;f</xref>) were satisfied in each of the 10 pairwise comparisons between the five cell lines considered here, and we kept only the seven comparisons satisfying all of them (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2). Furthermore, we retained only exons with minimum absolute change of 0.1 or two-fold in the inclusion levels between the two cell lines. In total, we obtained 1,849 more included and 2,483 less included exon comparisons in the seven cell-pairs employed. The terms &#x02018;more included exons&#x02019; and &#x02018;less included exons&#x02019; are arbitrary, since they depend on the direction of the comparison. We preferred to keep them separate to allow for better visualization and validation of the results presented (see below).</p><p>Because the same exon can appear in different pairwise comparisons, when pooled together, the two sets correspond to 2,081 unique exons that showed regulated inclusion levels across the human ENCODE cell lines. These correspond to about 3&#x000a0;% of all exons initially considered, and belong to 1,637 genes (10.44&#x000a0;% of all genes initially considered). Exons with regulated inclusion exhibit in general weak inclusion changes across human cell lines (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The median exon inclusion range (that is, the differences between the maximum and minimum inclusion observed) is 0.20. For more than 90&#x000a0;% of the exons, the change is less than 0.5. Moreover, they show generally intermediate exon inclusion levels when compared with the inclusion levels of non-regulated exons (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Differentially spliced exons in cell lines. <bold>a</bold> Inclusion range of regulated exons.

In addition, in our analysis, we used only one exon per gene, the one with the lowest <italic>P</italic> value. In total, we obtained 1,684 more included and 2,198 less included exon comparisons in the seven cell pairs employed corresponding to 1,921 unique exons (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3, Additional files <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The splicing landscape of this filtered set of regulated exons is very similar to the previous one (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>R2. Co-occurrence of differences in histone modifications with alternative exon inclusion</title><p>For each differentially included exon in each pairwise cell comparison, we computed differential signal for nine histone marks, the insulator protein CTCF and input DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. We defined the &#x02018;differential signal&#x02019; for each chromatin feature as the difference of the averaged normalized signal over the exon in the second cell type (for example, Gm12878 for the comparison K562 vs. Gm12878) and the averaged normalized signal over the exon in the first one (for example, K562 for the same comparison, see <xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). We pooled the differential exonic signal across all exons and all cell-line comparisons together to produce a single composite comparison for each monitored variable separately for &#x02018;more included&#x02019; and &#x02018;less included&#x02019; exons. By using differential signals on the same genomic interval, we eliminated possible biases due to intrinsic genomic features such as GC content.</p><p>Our analysis revealed enrichment of CTCF, H3K9ac, H3K27ac, and H3K4me3 levels in more included exons (<italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c;0.01; Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni correction) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). We also observed a negative association with the control signal, which consists of cross-linked and sonicated DNA. This may represent a measure of chromatin compaction, and may reflect an association between open chromatin and higher levels of exon inclusion. Importantly, the association observed between exon inclusion and input DNA is in the opposite direction than that observed for rest of the chromatin features, indicating that we are likely underestimating the strength of the associations. To validate these results, we performed ChIP-qPCR using H3K9ac antibodies and primers specific (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4) for the target exons (and a constitutive exon of the same gene as a control) in K562 and Gm12878 cells. In all four alternative exons investigated, a clear difference in H3K9ac signal between the two cell lines was detected, positively correlating with differential exon usage. In contrast, constitutive exons on the same genes showed, in general, smaller (sometimes even opposite) differences and higher variability among replicates (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Enrichment of chromatin epigenetic marks on regulated exons. <bold>a</bold> Differential signals (log2, Y-axis) for &#x02018;more included&#x02019; (blue) or &#x02018;less included&#x02019; (red) exons from the seven cell pairs used, are represented for 11 ChIPSeq datasets corresponding to different epigenetic marks, CTCF, and input DNA (control).

Promoter-like histone marks and exon inclusion</title><p>While the results above do indicate a significant association between a number of histone modifications and exon inclusion, the effect is certainly weak. This could reflect a general, but weak, effect of histone modification on most differentially included exons, or alternatively, a strong effect only on a subset of them. To investigate the two alternatives, we performed k-means clustering on the sets of more and less included exons, based on the levels of the five chromatin features that we found significantly associated with differential exon inclusion. After k-means optimization, the data were partitioned in four clusters of different signal profiles and each exon was assigned to the cluster with the nearest mean (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). As expected &#x02018;more included&#x02019; and &#x02018;less included&#x02019; exons generated similar but mirrored clusters.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>K-means clustering based on epigenetic signatures of regulated exons. <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> boxplots represent differential ChIPSeq signal for more included (<bold>a</bold>) and less included (<bold>b</bold>) exons. Each square represents one group of exons identified by K-means clustering. The number of exons present in each cluster is indicated to the left of each cluster. Three clusters of exons show strong differential signal for H3K9ac, H3K27ac, and H3K4me3 in the direction of the inclusion level change. These exons were called &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exons due to the nature of these histone modifications</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13059_2015_797_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p>The k-means clustering shows clearly that while the majority of differentially included exons do not show differences in the levels of the monitored histone modifications between cell pairs, a subset of 4&#x000a0;% of all differentially regulated exons (100 exon comparisons) exhibits co-occurrence of large differential levels of H3K9ac, H3K27ac, and H3K4me3 associated with differential exon inclusion. Surprisingly, for the clusters that exhibit a change in the differential level of histone modifications, this change is always concordant with the direction of the inclusion level change (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). This was not the case when performing clustering with the histone modifications levels in the downstream constitutive exons (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3).</p><p>Since these marks are known signatures of active promoters, we will refer to this subset of exons as &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exons. These 100 exon comparisons are distributed across all cell-line pairs considered here (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5) and they correspond to a total of 70 unique exons, as some of these exons appear in multiple comparisons. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reinforced the hypothesis that these exons have peculiar features regarding histone modifications. Indeed PCA based on the differential histone modification levels clearly separates the core set of non-&#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exons, the histone modifications levels of which is immune to splicing changes, from the &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exons, which spread in all directions towards the periphery of the PCA projection (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4).</p><p>To further validate these findings, we compared K562 and NHEK, an ENCODE Tier 2 cell line that had not been previously used in our analysis. Out of the 70 exons above, 22 are differentially included between these two cell lines. In two cases, no change in histone modification levels could be detected. In 17 of the remaining 20 (85&#x000a0;%), the direction of the differential inclusion is consistent with the direction of the total differential levels of H3K9ac, H3K27ac, and H3K4me3 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5), while only in three cases (15&#x000a0;%) exon inclusion and histone modification levels change in opposite directions. With the same rationale, we compared NHEK with the other cell lines used in our analysis (Gm12878, HelaS3, Huvec, HepG2) and expanded our validation to 40 out of 47 different exons tested (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S6).

Characterization of &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exons</title><p>We thus proceeded to further characterize the subset of &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exons. We merged the 100 &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exon comparisons from the more-included and less-included groups, retaining the association with the pair of cell lines where they were identified as differentially included. For each exon comparisons we then have one exon associated with two cell lines: C-higher (the cell line in which the exon is more included) and C-lower (the cell line in which it is less included). For a list of all the &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exons and the corresponding C-higher and C-lower cell lines, see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S7.</p><p>Compared to the rest of regulated exons, &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exons are included at particularly low levels, with a median inclusion level of 0.32 and 0.07 in &#x02018;C-higher&#x02019; and &#x02018;C-lower&#x02019; cell lines, respectively (see exon inclusion distribution in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S6), in comparison with 0.54 and 0.23 for the non-&#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; regulated exons (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). To assess whether low inclusion levels are a characteristic of &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exons, or a consequence of our measurements restricted to human cell lines, we used 1,500 RNASeq samples from the GTEx project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] to estimate exon inclusion levels of the set of regulated exons in human tissues. We found that also in human tissues, &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exons exhibit significantly lower levels of inclusion that regulated non-&#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exons (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S7).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Characterization of &#x0201c;promoter-like&#x0201d; exons. <bold>a</bold> Exon inclusion levels in C-higher (yellow) and C-lower (blue) cell lines in &#x0201c;promoter-like&#x0201d; and non &#x0201c;promoter-like&#x0201d; exons. <bold>b</bold> Transcription factors binding enrichment significance in C-higher over C-lower cell lines.

First, they are enriched in binding sites, both when considering sequence motifs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables S8 and S9), and accumulation of Transcription Factor (TF) ChIPSeq reads. Indeed, we found that 15 out of the 32 TF analyzed have significantly more accumulation of reads in C-higher than in C-lower cell lines, while none displays the opposite trend (Fig.&#x000a0;5b and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S9). Among the enriched transcription factors is Brg1, which together with Brm is one of the two ATPases of the chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF, and it has been shown to interact with the splicing machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S9). Second, they are enriched in DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS) in C-higher cell lines (Fig.&#x000a0;5c). DHS generally mark <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements and are indicative of open, more accessible chromatin. The difference in DHS signal is limited to the regulated exons and does not expand to the flanking constitutive ones (Fig.&#x000a0;5c). All differentially regulated exons show a similar but weaker enrichment (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S9). Third, &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exons in C-higher also show a clear enrichment of RNA Polymerase II signal (Fig.&#x000a0;5d).</p><p>All these promoter associated features in &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exons could suggest that these exons actually overlap un-annotated TSS - in which case, elevated levels of H3K9ac, H3K27ac, and H3K4me3 could simply reflect the action of transcription, and be unrelated to exon inclusion. To rule out this possibility, we analyzed the number of CAGE tags (sequence tags that target specifically the 5&#x02019; end of transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]) mapping to &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exons, and find it marginal when compared to the level in annotated TSS (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). We also found no significant difference in the distribution of upstream and downstream junction inclusion reads (RNASeq reads that connect two neighboring exons), further confirming that &#x02018;promoter-like exons&#x02019; are indeed &#x02018;bona fide&#x02019; exons, and do not represent, as a bulk, un-annotated TSSs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>&#x02018;Promoter-like&#x02019; exons are not used as TSS. <bold>a</bold> Gene expression levels of exons in C-higher and C-lower conditions measured using CAGE tags.

Moreover, analyzing clusters of CAGE tags, which are assumed to indicate annotated or un-annotated TSS, we observed alternative TSS usage for &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exons between cell lines (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>).

Transcription activating histone modifications would thus be &#x02018;co-opted&#x02019; to participate also in the regulation of inclusion of &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exons. To further test this hypothesis, we analyzed genome-wide Chromatin Interaction Analysis with Paired-End-Tag sequencing data (ChIA-PET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]) that has been used to map long-range chromatin interactions. It was recently shown that some internal exons loop and physically interact with promoter and enhancers, and for this reason display &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; or &#x02018;enhancer-like&#x02019; chromatin marks, and are enriched for co-transcriptional splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. These datasets are available only for Hela and K562 and therefore we could only analyze a fraction of the exon comparisons. In &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exons we found enriched ChIA-PET signal in C-higher than C-lower cell lines (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>) in a fashion independent of the distance between the TSS and the exon itself (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7f</xref>). Since these ChIA-PET datasets target RNA polymerase II with un-phosphorylated ser2, found in the transcription pre-initiation complex and marking gene promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], this increase of signal should indicate increase looping and interaction between &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exons and TSSs. As a control, we did not find ChIA-PET signal enrichment in the set of all regulated exons (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S10). Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7g</xref> shows a &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exon more included in Hela than in K562, exhibiting local peaks of DNase I, RNA Pol II, H3K9ac, H3K27ac, and H3K4me3 in Hela, but not in K562. The exon also shows ChIA-PET tags only in Hela cells.</p><p>When analyzing individual ChIA-PET links, we found that 94&#x000a0;% of the &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exons have at least one interaction with the un-phosphorylated pol II, in the C-higher cell line. This percentage is 68&#x000a0;% in the C-lower cell line, considering only the cell lines where we have data available. Genomic connections detected through ChIA-PET are not necessarily distal. To assess whether linear proximity in the genome could also explain the promoter like features of this set of exons, we used chromatin segmentation tracks produced by the ENCODE project (chromHMM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]). These genome segmentations represent broad epigenomic domains, reflecting specific combinations of histone modifications and other chromatin features. Although the resolution of the chromHMM segmentations is limited, we found that for about 40&#x000a0;% of the &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exon comparisons the exon is located in a chromatin state that extends all the way to the closest used TSS, both in the C-higher and C-lower cell lines, which would indicate linear proximity in the genome.</p><p>Linear and/or spatial proximity to active promoters explains the enrichment in histone modifications in included &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exons, but it does not necessarily show that there is a mechanistic connection between exon inclusion and levels of histone modifications. In fact, we found a positive correlation for these three histone marks between the levels at the TSS and at the exon, consistently higher and only significant (<italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c;0.01) in C-higher cell lines (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S10). However, while accumulation of the marks is generally higher in C-higher than C-lower cell lines, both at the TSS and at the exon, the difference in the levels of the histone modifications between C-higher and C-lower cell lines is much larger at the exons than at the TSS (<italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c;2.2e-7 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7h</xref>). This strongly suggests that the enrichment of chromatin marks concomitant with inclusion in &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exons it is not a mere consequence of proximity to the promoter, but that it is mechanistically connected to the splicing of these exons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Regulated alternative splicing is assumed to contribute to cell type identity and methods have been developed which are able to predict tissue specific exon inclusion with high accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In our analysis, we found a relatively small number of human exons (about 3&#x000a0;% of all exons) exhibiting regulated inclusion in a panel of human cell lines. This cannot be attributed to insufficient sampling by RNASeq, since ENCODE cell lines are sequenced in replicates at very high depth of coverage (around 240&#x000a0;M reads per sample). On the other hand, the diversity of biological samples used is certainly reduced, and cell lines are known to exhibit peculiar biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. While regulated splicing, therefore, is likely to be more widespread than detected here, our results could also suggest that the contribution of splicing regulation to defining cell type identity is exerted chiefly through a relatively small, but well defined, set of exons.</p><p>Recent results have unveiled that pre-mRNA splicing occurs predominantly co-transcriptionally, thus providing a framework in which chromatin and transcription-related factors interact with the pre-mRNA processing machinery. However, among most exons with regulated inclusion we found in general, little direct association between differential inclusions and histone modifications. While these results are not fully unexpected, since splicing factors are likely to be the main players in splicing regulation, they somehow in contrast with reports of histone modifications influencing splicing outcomes through recruitment of splicing factors and through the modulation of RNA Pol II dynamics. Indeed, previous work linked high H3K9ac levels in the <italic>NCAM</italic> gene with fast elongating RNA Pol II and skipping of a specific exon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. High levels of H3K36me3 or H3K27me3 along the <italic>FGFR2</italic> were correlated with the regulation of a mutually exclusive alternative splicing event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In these cases, however, changes in histone modifications appear to spread over large regions covering the whole gene, while here we explicitly explored chromatin modifications local to the exons. More importantly, in our work we investigated only direct effects acting independently, and we ignored the role of high order interactions between different histone modifications and other elements of chromatin structure. These could actually configure a quite complex histone-based splicing regulatory code. Furthermore, we focused specifically in complete exon skipping events, and ignored other types of splicing events such as alternative splice site usage. In this regard, Tilgner <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] found that nucleosome occupancy may contribute more strongly to the definition to the 3&#x02019; splice site. If so, histone modifications would also be expected to play a major role in the regulation of alternative 3&#x02019; splice sites.</p><p>While we did not found evidence for a general direct effect of chromatin structure in exon inclusion, we did identify a subgroup of regulated exons (about 4&#x000a0;% of all regulated exons) for which co-occurrence of H3K9ac, H3K27ac, and H3K4me3, histone modifications typically associated to promoters, strongly correlate with exon usage levels. This association is not biased by our discovery approach, since we replicated it in cell line comparisons that were not part of the training set. These &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; alternative exons appear predominantly in low abundance isoforms, but in which, a significant increase in the density of histone modification correlates with an increase in the levels of exon inclusion. These observations suggest that chromatin architecture may play a more prominent role in the regulation of exon inclusion, under conditions of weak splice site recognition.</p><p>We further related the accumulation of these histone modifications in highly included exons with higher occupancy of RNA Polymerase II. Accumulation of RNA Polymerase II has been linked to exon inclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], associated with slower Pol II kinetics and consequently additional opportunities for splice site recognition before competing sites come into play [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. However we also found higher inclusion of &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exons in states of open chromatin, as measured by DNase I. This observation is somehow in contrast with previously proposed models linking closed chromatin and slower transcription elongation with increased exon inclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In particular for H3K9ac, previous studies reported a correlation between accumulation of this mark along the whole gene body (NCAM) and skipping of a specific alternative exon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p>We also found that &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exons, while no promoters themselves, they are, on average, closer to TSS and enriched by ChIA-PET tags associated with RNA Polymerase II. Thus, we hypothesize that, in these exons, splicing regulation is mediated by the promoter, either by formation of a DNA loop with the exon and helping chromatin marking and transcription factor binding extending from the TSS to the alternative exon, or by differential splice site pairing when an alternative TSS generates an alternative first exon (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Recent work exploring the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the genome reported physical links between internal exons and their associated promoter or enhancers. These results argue for an interplay between 3D genome organization and alternative splicing regulation and warrant the systematic analysis of these associations in future studies using conformation capture technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. An alternative interpretation relies on the fact that H3K9ac, H3K27ac, H3K4me3, and DNase hypersensitive on &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exons simply reflect open chromatin on these exons. It is conceivable that binding of factors facilitated by the opening of chromatin influence splice site recognition either directly through their effects on splicing factor recruitment or through effects on RNA Pol II elongation - a mechanism resembling promotion of exon inclusion by CTCF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Models linking promoter activity with inclusion of &#x02018;promoter-like&#x02019; exons.

We specifically propose that in exons that are proximal to active promoter regions (either in linear or 3D space), open chromatin promotes exon inclusion, maybe by facilitating the recruitment of splicing factors. However, we want to stress that through our analysis we are unable to uncover the direction of the causation, and while histone modifications have been proposed to promote splicing, results have also been obtained suggesting that splicing can promote modification of histones by enhancing the recruitment of chromatin remodeling factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Further research will be needed to work out their detailed molecular mechanisms behind these observations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Alternatively skipped exon calling</title><p>Using the gencode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] v15 annotation we determined all exons that are<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>internal in all transcripts they appeared in</p></list-item><list-item><p>not overlapped by any non-identical exon</p></list-item><list-item><p>between 50 and 450&#x000a0;bps long</p></list-item><list-item><p>at least 600 nts away from the respective annotated TSS or TTS</p></list-item><list-item><p>surrounded by AG-GT splice sites</p></list-item><list-item><p>located on chromosomes 1&#x02013;22 and X</p></list-item></list></p><p>For the remaining exons, a 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 table was constructed containing junction inclusion reads and junction exclusion reads in the two cell types (cell1 and cell2) retaining only the exons with a minimum of 1 junction inclusion read in cell1 and 1 exclusion read in cell2 or vice versa.
