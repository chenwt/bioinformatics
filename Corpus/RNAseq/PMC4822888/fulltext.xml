However, defining the Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 contribution to nociceptive signalling has been hampered by a lack of selective inhibitors. Here we report two potent and selective arylsulfonamide Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 inhibitors; PF-05198007 and PF-05089771, which we have used to directly interrogate Na<sub>v</sub>1.7&#x02019;s role in nociceptor physiology. We report that Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 is the predominant functional TTX-sensitive Na<sub>v</sub> in mouse and human nociceptors and contributes to the initiation and the upstroke phase of the nociceptor action potential. Moreover, we confirm a role for Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 in influencing synaptic transmission in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord as well as peripheral neuropeptide release in the skin. These findings demonstrate multiple contributions of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 to nociceptor signalling and shed new light on the relative functional contribution of this channel to peripheral and central noxious signal transmission.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The funder provided support in the form of salaries for authors [AA, AB, MC, JT, MM, AW, EP, AG, PJC, RD, DP, ZL, BM, CW, NS, RS, PS, NC, DK, RB, ES], but did not have any additional role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

In particular, loss-of-function mutations in SCN9A (the gene encoding Na<sub>v</sub>1.7) have been identified in patients with congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP; [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]), whereas gain-of-function mutations in SCN9A lead to chronic pain syndromes such as paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD, [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]) and inherited erythromelalgia (IEM) [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, expression of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 in DRG neurons extends from the peripheral terminals in the skin to the central terminals in the dorsal horn [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These studies present a clear link between Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 function and pain sensation and raise the possibility that selective Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 inhibitors might hold therapeutic potential as novel analgesics.</p><p>Despite the strong evidence implicating Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 in human pain genetic studies, a detailed investigation of the role of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 in nociception remains an important area of investigation. Na<sub>v</sub> channels are essential for action potential initiation and upstroke in excitable cells. Out of a repertoire of nine Na<sub>v</sub>s (Na<sub>v</sub>1.1&#x02013;1.9), five are expressed in varying levels in adult rodent somatosensory DRG neurons: Na<sub>v</sub>1.1, Na<sub>v</sub>1.6, Na<sub>v</sub>1.7, Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 and Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Given the participation of multiple Na<sub>v</sub>s in pain signalling, progress in delineating the individual roles of specific Na<sub>v</sub> isoforms in DRG neurons would be accelerated if subtype-selective inhibitors were available.</p><p>In this study we characterize two novel arylsulfonamides: a clinical compound, PF-05089771 (for a list of relevant clinical trials see [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]) and a structurally related preclinical tool compound, PF-05198007. Both demonstrate high potency and a high degree of Na<sub>v</sub> subtype selectivity, properties which are gained through a drug/channel interaction that is distinct from that of the classical non-selective pore-blocking drugs such as local anaesthetics. We examined the effects of selective Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 block in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> preparations with the principal aim of exploring how Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 influences nociceptor function.

To investigate this, current-clamp recordings were made from acutely dissociated mDRG neurons in which a series of sequentially larger current steps was applied in order to accurately determine the action potential rheobase. PF-05198007 significantly increased rheobase (control: 173 &#x000b1; 37 pA <italic>vs</italic> PF-05198007: 239 &#x000b1; 47 pA, n = 7, p &#x0003c; 0.01, ANOVA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152405.g003">Fig 3</xref>), an effect that returned to the control level following washout (control: 173 &#x000b1; 37 pA <italic>vs</italic> wash: 176 &#x000b1; 35 pA, p &#x0003e; 0.05, ANOVA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152405.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). The effect of PF-05198007 on rheobase confirms that Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 is important in setting action potential threshold in small-diameter DRG neurons. Subsequently, the effect of PF-05198007 on additional parameters of the action potential waveform was investigated. In current-clamp mode, single action potentials were evoked from -70 mV at 10 second intervals by 20 ms current steps to approximately 1.3 x rheobase. The aim of this protocol was to provide reliable action potential generation whilst minimizing any contaminating influence of the current step to the action potential waveform. In 6/13 small-diameter DRG neurons tested, PF-05198007 (30 nM) application resulted in action potential failure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152405.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) with the remaining 7 cells continued to exhibit action potential firing in the presence of PF-05198007. In the case of the latter, PF-05198007 impacted the action potential waveform whereby action potentials appeared delayed and were of smaller amplitude relative to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152405.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). The representative phase plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152405.g004">Fig 4C</xref> reveals the extent of waveform attenuation in the presence of PF-05198007. In particular, there was a reduction in the rate of voltage change during both the upstroke and repolarization phases, coupled with a reduction in the peak amplitude. PF-05198007 application resulted in a significant depolarization of action potential threshold (control: -27.8 &#x000b1; 2.0 mV <italic>vs</italic> PF-05198007: -22.8 &#x000b1; 1.6 mV, n = 10, p &#x0003c; 0.01) and a reduction in both spike amplitude (control: 43.0 &#x000b1; 3.3 mV <italic>vs</italic> PF-05198007: 37.7 &#x000b1; 3.9 mV, n = 10, p &#x0003c; 0.05) and upstroke slope (control: 137 &#x000b1; 19 mV/ms <italic>vs</italic> PF-05198007: 86 &#x000b1; 11 mV/ms, n = 10, p &#x0003c; 0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152405.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). In addition to confirming an important contribution to action potential threshold, these findings might suggest that Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 also contributes to the action potential upstroke phase. Alternatively, the changes in voltage trajectory that accompany a loss of threshold current might affect subsequent non-Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 sodium channel conductances so that the effects of PF-05198007 on amplitude and upstroke slope occur as an indirect consequence of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 block. We tested this hypothesis by performing voltage-clamp experiments on mDRG neurons in which an action potential recorded from the cell under study was used as the command voltage (action potential voltage-clamp; Blair and Bean, 2002). The inward current component of the overlayed traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152405.g004">Fig 4E</xref> (middle panel) shows an increased latency following PF-05198007 application accompanied by a decrease in the peak amplitude (in both cases p &#x0003c; 0.05, n = 7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152405.g004">Fig 4E, 4F and 4G</xref>). The subtraction of the residual current in the presence of PF-05198007 from the control current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152405.g004">Fig 4E</xref> lower panel) reveals an inward current that approximates to the Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 current flowing during the action potential. Comparison of this current time-course to that of the the action potential waveform illustrates that the peak of the PF-05198007-sensitive current occurred towards the peak of the action potential rising phase, suggesting a role for Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 not only in defining threshold but also in the action potential rising phase.</p><fig id="pone.0152405.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0152405.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>PF-05198007 increases action potential rheobase in small diameter mDRG neurons.</title><p>A.

Together, this constellation of gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations demonstrates an essential and non-redundant role for Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 in pain [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Here we describe <italic>in vitro</italic> pharmacological properties of two subtype-selective Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 compounds: a clinical compound PF-05089771 and a structurally-related preclinical tool compound PF-05198007. Using these selective inhibitors we have confirmed a functional role of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 that spans the sensory neuron axis&#x02014;from the cutaneous free nerve endings, through to the DRG cell body, dorsal root and central terminals in the spinal cord.</p><sec id="sec026"><title>Pharmacological properties of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 subtype-selective compounds</title><p>The potency of PF-05089771 against human Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 channels stably expressed in HEK293 cells (IC<sub>50</sub>, 11 nM) was 10-fold and 16-fold higher than the closest sodium channel isoforms Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>v</sub>1.6, respectively. Other sodium channel subtypes that have been shown to play important roles in the pain pathways and that are expressed in DRG neurons, Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 and Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], are essentially unaffected by PF-05089771. A lack of validated heterologous expression system for Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 prohibited evaluation of the potency of PF-05089771 against this channel, which has been shown to play an important role in human pain conditions [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The potency and selectivity of PF-05089771 have been achieved by targeting a novel binding region of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 proposed to be in the VSD4 [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The interaction of PF-05089771 with this novel binding site is further supported by the inability of mutations altering the local anesthetic and TTX binding sites in Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 to significantly alter the potency of PF-05089771 examined <italic>in vitro</italic>. The selectivity gained through interacting with the channel at this site is consistent with the variability of critical amino acids across sodium channel isoforms, supporting a modulatory effect of PF-05089771 on the VSD of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7. Finally, this is also the case for several species orthologues of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 where PF-05089771 was found to preferentially inhibit human, mouse, cynomolgus monkey and dog Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 over rat Na<sub>v</sub>1.7. The rat orthologue possesses two variant residues at the VSD4 interaction site and uniquely displays a histidine residue at position M1, differentiating rat from the other species that were tested. Thus, the unprecedented selectivity profile achieved by PF-05089771 and the cross-species differences in Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 orthologue potency can be explained through the novel binding interaction of this class of compounds.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 dominates TTX-S current in small-diameter DRG neurons</title><p>Several lines of evidence have suggested that Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 is the predominant Na<sub>v</sub> TTX-S subtype expressed in C-fibres, while Na<sub>v</sub>1.7, Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 and Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 are the main TTX-S subtypes present in A-fibres [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

We found that high Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 expression translates at the functional level because the majority of the isolated TTX-S current in the cell body of small-diameter mouse and human DRG neurons was blocked by Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 inhibitors. This data is consistent with published work showing that TTX-S current in small-diameter DRG neurons from the Na<sub>v</sub>1.7<sup>Nav1.8 Cre</sup> mouse is reduced by 70% compared to WT [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

These data are consistent with recorded changes in rheobase following Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 silencing in cultured nodose sensory neurons [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and dynamic clamp analysis, using a Hodgkin-Huxley model of hNa<sub>v</sub>1.7 gating [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

Indeed, using the action potential voltage-clamp technique [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] we found that Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 conducts during the upstroke as well as the during initiation stage of the action potential.

These findings agree with previous reports demonstrating reduced Substance P release from spinal cord slices of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 knockout mice (Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 ablated in advillin-expressing neurons) following electrical stimulation of attached dorsal root [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and the reduced frequency of spontaneous EPSCs in mouse lamina II neurons following the application of a Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 blocking antibody [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

In this scenario, Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 block can occur at both dorsal root and outer laminae. Here, the specific contributions of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 to both conduction and synaptic release in the spinal cord were further investigated using PF-5198007. Specifically, we observed a reduction in C-fibre mediated EPSC amplitudes recorded from SG neurons (with corresponding slowing of C-fibre conduction velocity) following local application of PF-05198007 to dorsal root, implicating Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 in axonal conduction. In support of this, significant block of A-and C-fibre action potentials in vagal sensory neurons has been reported following shRNA knockdown of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and similar findings have been obtained from sciatic nerve in studies using toxins that selectively inhibit different Na<sub>v</sub> subtypes including Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0152405.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].
