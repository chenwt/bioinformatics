Previous work implicated RNA as an important cofactor in chromatin insulator activity, although the precise mechanisms are not yet understood.

Colocalization occurs mainly at promoters but also boundary elements such as <italic>Mcp</italic>, <italic>Fab-8</italic>, <italic>scs</italic> and <italic>scs&#x02032;</italic>, which overlaps with a promoter. Surprisingly, exosome associates primarily with promoters but not gene bodies of active genes, arguing against simple cotranscriptional recruitment to RNA substrates. Similar to insulator proteins, exosome is also significantly enriched at divergently transcribed promoters. Directed ChIP of exosome in cell lines depleted of insulator proteins shows that CTCF is required specifically for exosome association at <italic>Mcp</italic> and <italic>Fab-8</italic> but not other sites, suggesting that alternate mechanisms must also contribute to exosome chromatin recruitment. Taken together, our results reveal a novel positive relationship between exosome and chromatin insulators throughout the genome.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The exosome is a multisubunit complex conserved from archaea to humans that is the major cellular 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; RNA degradation machinery. Involved in the turnover of normal as well as aberrant RNAs, the exosome additionally plays a major role in RNA processing and maturation [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B1">1</xref>)]. The exosome consists of a core complex including a hexameric ring of RNase PH homology domain-containing subunits (Ski6/Rrp41, Rrp42, Rrp43, Rrp45, Rrp46 and Mtr3) capped by a trimer of S1/KH domain-containing subunits (Csl4, Rrp4 and Rrp40) [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B2">2</xref>)]. It has been shown that yeast exosomes channel RNA through the center of the core complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B3">3</xref>), but it is the association of either of the hydrolytic RNases Dis3/Rrp44 and Rrp6 with the yeast and human core exosome that provides enzymatic activity of the complex. A contrasting view in <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggests that exosome subunits can function independently or form a continuum of various functional complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B4">4</xref>).</p><p>Although the core exosome and Dis3 localize to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, the Rrp6 component is predominantly nuclear, suggesting specialized activities for the exosome in the nucleus. Rrp6 alone or the entire exosome have been implicated in several nuclear RNA quality control and surveillance pathways [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B5">5</xref>)]. Depletion of exosome levels or mutation of exosome components leads to stabilization of cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) in yeast, antisense promoter transcripts in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B7">7</xref>), as well as other aberrant RNAs. In yeast, Nrd1-dependent transcription termination of certain non-coding genes and CUTs from intergenic regions also involves recruitment of the exosome to promote transcript degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B8 gkt037-B9 gkt037-B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>), raising the possibility of chromatin proximal exosome activity. In these cases, it is not known whether the exosome associates with chromatin in order to carry out its surveillance activities. Toward this end, an overexpressed tagged version of Rrp6 was shown to associate with chromatin of yeast protein coding genes using whole open reading frame cDNA mircroarrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B11">11</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it was demonstrated that certain exosome subunits associate with at least some actively transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B13">13</xref>) and may be recruited to chromatin through interaction with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation factors Spt5 and Spt6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B14">14</xref>). Nevertheless, a high-resolution genome-wide study of exosome chromatin association has yet to be performed in any organism.</p><p>Distributed throughout the genome, chromatin insulators are DNA&#x02013;protein complexes that organize chromatin into independent transcriptional domains. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, there are at least five chromatin insulator families that can be categorized by the association of particular DNA-binding proteins. These classes include the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), Suppressor of Hairy-wing (Su(Hw)), GAGA factor (GAF), Zeste-white 5 (Zw5) and boundary element-associated factor (BEAF-32) [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B16">16</xref>)]. For example, the <italic>hsp70</italic> genes at 87A7 are located between the <italic>scs</italic> and <italic>scs</italic><italic>&#x02032;</italic> boundary elements, bound by Zw5 and BEAF-32, respectively, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B18">18</xref>). Zw5 and BEAF-32 interact with each other, and this interaction may promote chromatin looping observed between <italic>scs</italic> and <italic>scs</italic><italic>&#x02032;</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B19">19</xref>). In addition, the <italic>Fab-8</italic> insulator is a well-characterized <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory region of the <italic>Abdominal-B</italic> (<italic>Abd-B</italic>) locus in the bithorax complex that harbors binding sites for the zinc-finger DNA-binding protein CTCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B21">21</xref>). CTCF is required for <italic>Fab-8</italic> insulator function and looping interactions among insulators, enhancers and promoters at <italic>Abd-B</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B22 gkt037-B23 gkt037-B24 gkt037-B25">22&#x02013;25</xref>). Multiple insulator complexes share a common component, Centrosomal protein 190 (CP190), a zinc-finger and BTB/POZ domain-containing protein that may play a global role in chromatin organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B26">26</xref>). Since enhancers must often activate their target promoters from long distances, it is likely that insulators act as tethering sites for chromosomal loops that can constrain enhancer&#x02013;promoter interactions and possibly protect a region from its surrounding chromatin environment.</p><p>Depending on their context, chromatin insulators could either repress or promote transcription based on the nature of the higher order chromatin interactions to which they contribute. Recent studies show that several insulator proteins, particularly CP190 and BEAF-32, associate with certain transcriptionally active promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B27 gkt037-B28 gkt037-B29">27&#x02013;29</xref>). In fact, BEAF-32 appears to be required for transcription at a number of the promoters to which it binds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B28">28</xref>). How insulator proteins are targeted to specific promoters is unknown; however, insulator protein recruitment correlates with specific transcription initiation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B30">30</xref>). The precise role of insulator proteins at the promoter is still unclear, but these findings suggest that insulator proteins may regulate transcription in a more direct manner than previously suspected.</p><p>Earlier work suggests that the catalog of insulator-associated factors and potential regulators is not yet complete. The CP190/CTCF class of insulators interacts with Argonaute2, which promotes <italic>Fab-8</italic> activity as well as insulator-dependent looping at this site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B25">25</xref>). Moreover, the <italic>gypsy</italic> class of insulator proteins has been shown to physically interact with the ubiquitin and SUMO ligase Topors and Lamin, a major component of the nuclear matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B31">31</xref>). Recent work also showed the association of Top2 with <italic>gypsy</italic> insulator complexes, and this factor appears to be important for the stability of the Mod(mdg4)2.2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B32">32</xref>). Of particular interest to this study is the finding that the Rm62 helicase interacts with CP190 in an RNA-dependent manner, suggesting that RNA may be a component of the <italic>gypsy</italic> insulator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B33">33</xref>). Finally, the RNA-binding protein Shep was recently identified as the first known tissue-specific regulator of <italic>gypsy</italic> insulator activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B34">34</xref>). Here, we sought to identify additional RNA-related chromatin insulator factors and examine their potential functional significance.</p><p>In this study, we identified the exosome as a novel interactor of CP190 insulator complexes. Genome-wide profiling of exosome components compared with insulator proteins by staining of polytene chromosomes as well as high-resolution ChIP-seq in two different cell lines reveals highly overlapping genome-wide association profiles of the exosome with CP190, BEAF-32 and CTCF insulator proteins. Unexpectedly, we find that the majority of exosome binding sites are situated at the promoters of transcribed genes but not throughout gene bodies or 3&#x02032; ends. Exosome chromatin association correlates with active transcription; however, transcript levels at exosome binding sites are not significantly changed in response to exosome depletion. Finally, we found that depletion of BEAF-32 or CP190 has no effect on exosome chromatin association, but reduction of CTCF levels reduces exosome association with the CTCF-dependent <italic>Mcp</italic> and <italic>Fab-8</italic> insulators. These results reveal a previously unknown association between exosome and chromatin insulators throughout the genome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation and ChIP-seq</title><p>Cells were fixed by addition of 1% formaldehyde to cell media for 10 min at R.T. with gentle agitation.

Similar profiles obtained with antibodies to two distinct exosome components suggests that the intact exosome may associate with chromatin at these sites and furthermore verifies the specificity of the antibodies.

Strong enrichment between Rrp6 and Rrp40 is observed with factors such as RNA Pol II and H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt037-F4">Figure 4</xref>B). These results were not unexpected given previous work indicating physical interaction between exosome and transcription elongation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B14">14</xref>). Based on this work as well as another study suggesting that the Rrp4 exosome component associates with gene bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B12">12</xref>), we anticipated that exosome peaks would be observed at the middle and/or 3&#x02032;-end of genes. In striking contrast, we found that the distribution of exosome peaks with respect to genes is heavily biased to the TSS and not gene bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt037-F4">Figures 4</xref>C and D). Plots of average Rrp6 or Rrp40 signal in S2 cells normalized to input within 1 kb of an annotated TSS reveal a strong enrichment of exosome components slightly upstream of TSSs, whereas little to no enrichment is observed in the vicinity of polyadenylation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt037-F4">Figure 4</xref>E). Similar TSS enrichment is also observed for exosome binding in S3 cells (data not shown).</p><p>Based on preferential binding to the TSS and the fact that the exosome is the major RNA degradation machinery, we hypothesized that exosome recruitment to chromatin may occur in a transcription-dependent manner. When exosome signal in S2 cells is examined at TSSs separated into transcriptionally active or inactive based on the presence of Pol II and H3K4me3, enrichment is observed only for active TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt037-F5">Figure 5</xref>A).

As expected, a clear bias toward expressed genes is observed for exosome ChIP signal at the TSS. Strong enrichment is seen for exosome at a set of promoters that display promoter-proximal enriched Pol II (PPEP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt037-F4">Figure 4</xref>B), suggesting that exosome preferentially associates with genes with paused Pol II.

Consistent with our finding that exosome colocalizes with BEAF-32 genome-wide, BEAF-32 has previously been shown to associate with cell cycle genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B29">29</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrate that the genome-wide exosome chromatin binding profile shares features with that of CP190, BEAF-32 and CTCF insulator proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Lack of stabilized transcripts at exosome-bound regions</title><p>We wished to address whether chromatin regions bound by the exosome correspond directly to sites of active RNA degradation. A previous study in human cells revealed the stabilization of an &#x0223c;1.5 kb polyadenlyated divergent transcript in the opposite orientation at promoters of many genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B6">6</xref>). In order to determine whether a similar phenomenon occurs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we performed dsRNA knockdown of GFP as a control, as well as <italic>Rrp6</italic> and <italic>Rrp40</italic> in S3 cells, harvested total RNA, and performed rRNA depletion followed by non-directional RNA-seq. Efficient knockdown of exosome components was confirmed by western blotting (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt037/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S6</ext-link>), although residual protein could be detected by ChIP (data not shown). Visual inspection of our RNA-seq data did not uncover obvious evidence of upstream divergent transcription in either control or exosome knockdown libraries (data not shown). RNA-seq libraries sequenced to a depth of over 20 M reads from two biological replicates each of control versus knockdown cell lines were analysed for differential expression specifically in the 500 bp intergenic region upstream of exosome-bound TSSs using the DESeq algorithm, and no statistically significant upregulation of these exosome-bound upstream regions was observed (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt037/-/DC1">Supplementary Tables</ext-link> S3 and S4).</p><p>As an alternate approach, we also examined distributions of genome-wide RNA fold changes upon exosome subunit knockdown at sites upstream of TSSs either bound or unbound by exosome. For exosome-bound upstream regions, an approximately equal number of sites show an increase or decrease of RNA-seq reads in Rrp6 or Rrp40 depleted cells compared with control cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt037/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S7</ext-link>). In contrast, regions upstream of TSSs unbound by exosome actually display slightly increased median expression in Rrp6 depleted cells. Furthermore, no statistically significant changes in expression were detected at intergenic exosome peaks by DESeq analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt037/-/DC1">Supplementary Tables</ext-link> S3 and S4). Similar results were obtained with oligo-dT selected RNA-seq libraries from either S2 or S3 cells (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that exosome chromatin recruitment does not necessarily correspond to regions of transcript degradation, and we find no clear evidence for extensive divergent transcription even when the major cellular RNA degradation machinery is depleted.</p><p>Given that exosome is implicated in snoRNA maturation in yeast, we examined whether depletion of exosome subunits leads to stabilization of snoRNA or putative precursors. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the majority of snoRNAs are derived from introns of protein coding or non-coding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B65">65</xref>). We used DESeq expression analysis to examine mature snoRNAs and intron regions harboring snoRNAs in rRNA depleted exosome knockdown versus control S3 libraries. We were unable to detect evidence for genome-wide stabilization of mature snoRNA or precursors (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt037/-/DC1">Supplementary Tables</ext-link> S3 and S4); however, we did observe accumulation of two likely snoRNA precursors with 3&#x02032; extensions when either Rrp6 or Rrp40 is knocked down (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt037/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S8</ext-link>). Both of these snoRNA genes are bound by exosome, in addition to 61 of 249 annotated snoRNAs genome-wide considering either S2 or S3 cells. Two-way overlap between exosome and snoRNA genes is enriched over random expectation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt037-F4">Figure 4</xref>B), and interestingly, exosome preferentially associates with a class of chromatin-associated snoRNAs (ca-snoRNAs, 21 of 40) suggested to be involved in maintaining open chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B62">62</xref>). These results suggest that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> exosome machinery affects processing of at least a subset of snoRNA transcripts and might perform this function in association with chromatin.</p></sec><sec><title>Exosome binding at the TSS does not correlate with exosome-dependent transcript regulation genome-wide</title><p>We wondered whether exosome may be recruited to genes to enhance transcript degradation. In order to address this possibility, we performed mRNA expression profiling using control, <italic>Rrp6</italic>, and/or <italic>Rrp40</italic> knockdown RNA-seq libraries from S2 and S3 cells using the DESeq algorithm, this time at the gene-level for annotated genes. Similar to a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B66">66</xref>), we identified hundreds of transcripts with altered expression profiles upon knockdown, the majority of which are stabilized upon exosome depletion (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt037/-/DC1">Supplementary Tables</ext-link> S5&#x02013;S7). Strikingly, we found that transcripts that increase in exosome knockdowns are actually less likely to harbor an exosome peak at the TSS compared with transcripts unaffected by knockdown (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt037/-/DC1">Supplementary Table S8</ext-link>). Negative enrichment is likely due to the fact that exosome associates with higher expression genes whereas transcript stabilization is biased toward lower expression transcripts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt037/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S9</ext-link>). Hence, no obvious genome-wide correlation is apparent between exosome-dependent effects on gene expression and exosome chromatin association.</p><p>Curiously, depletion of exosome in S3 cells led to stabilization of an aberrant transcript at the <italic>Abd-B</italic> locus. The <italic>Abd-B</italic> gene is expressed in posterior cells later in embryonic development and is regulated by a host of downstream <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements including the CTCF-dependent boundary elements <italic>Mcp</italic> and <italic>Fab-8</italic>. Upon close visual inspection, we noted stabilization of an &#x0223c;20 kb polyadenylated transcript extending between downstream of the RE isoform promoter to beyond the RA isoform promoter particularly in <italic>Rrp6</italic> but also in <italic>Rrp40</italic> depleted cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt037/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S10</ext-link>). We verified by directional RT-PCR that the transcript is transcribed in the same orientation as the <italic>Abd-B</italic> gene (data not shown), which is normally expressed in S3 but not S2 cells. Transcription in this region was not observed in exosome depleted S2 cells, suggesting that the transcript requires the same factors needed for normal <italic>Abd-B</italic> expression. We also observed evidence for expression of a similar transcript during the 4&#x02013;10 h window of embryonic development based on modEncode oligo-dT selected RNA-seq data from whole embryos (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt037/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S10</ext-link>). Aberrant expression of this nature was not observed extensively throughout the genome, and the functional or mechanistic significance of this stabilized transcript is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Exosome subunits are essential in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title><p>To date, specific mutations in exosome subunit genes have not been reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, precluding <italic>in vivo</italic> analyses of exosome function in the context of organismal development. We obtained a panel of UAS-inducible transgenic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) hairpin lines directed against exosome subunit genes from the Vienna <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNAi Center and tested the effects of knockdowns using various Gal4-drivers on general development and adult viability.

For Rrp40, signal is strongest at promoters, lower at <italic>Fab-8</italic> and <italic>scs</italic><italic>&#x02032;</italic>, and essentially at background levels at <italic>scs</italic> and <italic>Mcp</italic>. The BEAF-32 insulator protein is also very highly enriched at these promoter regions as well as its characterized binding site <italic>scs</italic><italic>&#x02032;</italic>. We note that the <italic>scs</italic><italic>&#x02032;</italic> insulator overlaps the <italic>aurora</italic> promoter, which is also part of a divergently transcribed gene pair. However, BEAF does not associate with <italic>scs</italic>, <italic>Mcp</italic> or <italic>Fab-8</italic> insulators. In contrast, CP190 and CTCF insulator proteins preferentially associate with characterized binding sites <italic>Mcp</italic> and <italic>Fab-8</italic> and to a lesser extent with certain promoters. Therefore, exosome subunit binding partially mirrors that of insulator proteins at these insulator and promoter sites.</p><p>As a control for knockdown efficiency, we next verified that BEAF-32, CP190 and CTCF knockdowns reduce chromatin association of the respective target protein at all binding sites. We thus examined interdependence of insulator proteins to their respective binding sites. BEAF-32 is not significantly affected by knockdown of either CP190 or CTCF at <italic>scs</italic><italic>&#x02032;</italic> or <italic>scs</italic> insulator sites or at the <italic>polo</italic>, <italic>CycB</italic> or <italic>bel</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt037-F6">Figure 6</xref>B). Furthermore, CP190 chromatin association at these sites is unaffected by BEAF-32 depletion, consistent with a recent study showing independence of BEAF-32 and CP190 binding despite extensive genome-wide overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B67">67</xref>). Confirming previous work, CP190 ChIP is reduced in CTCF depleted cells at the insulator sites <italic>Mcp</italic> and <italic>Fab-8</italic>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B25">25</xref>) but is mainly unaffected at the <italic>polo</italic>, <italic>CycB</italic> and <italic>bel</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt037-F6">Figure 6</xref>B). Similar to a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B67">67</xref>), CTCF binding is unaffected by either BEAF-32 or CP190 depletion at all sites tested including the <italic>Fab-8</italic> insulator, which contrasts with dependence on CP190 previously identified in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B25">25</xref>). This result may be due to differences in cell type or expression state of the <italic>Abd-B</italic> locus. Interestingly, Rrp6 chromatin association is substantially reduced at <italic>Fab-8</italic> and at <italic>Mcp</italic> and weakly reduced at the <italic>CycB</italic> promoter uniquely in CTCF depleted cells, whereas binding to all other loci tested remains constant under all knockdown conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt037-F6">Figure 6</xref>B). Similarly, Rrp40 ChIP signal is specifically reduced at <italic>Fab-8</italic> in CTCF depleted cells.</p><p>In order to determine whether CTCF plays a genome-wide role in recruitment of the exosome to chromatin, we examined Rrp40 localization in polytene chromosomes of wildtype compared with <italic>CTCF<sup>y+2</sup></italic> mutants. This mutant produces little or no CTCF protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B22">22</xref>) and displays strongly reduced <italic>Abd-B</italic> looping interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B25">25</xref>). We found no significant differences at this level of resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt037-F3">Figure 3</xref>), and Rrp6 was similarly unaffected (data not shown). These results indicate dependence on CTCF for exosome recruitment to the <italic>Mcp</italic> and <italic>Fab-8</italic> insulators and possibly the <italic>CycB</italic> promoter or other untested sites. We were unable to assess whether insulator protein chromatin association is dependent on exosome components using the depletion strategy because sufficient levels of knockdown could not be achieved in order to fully remove Rrp6 or Rrp40 from chromatin (data not shown). Our results indicate that the exosome is at least partially dependent on CTCF for chromatin association.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Here, we present the first high-resolution map of exosome chromatin association in any organism. In contrast to expectations based on the prior literature, we find that exosome binds mainly promoters but not other genic regions of actively transcribed genes. Our results support the conclusion that exosome associates with chromatin in a transcription-dependent manner; however, exosome is not recruited to all actively transcribed genes. At the genome-wide level, exosome associates extensively with the CP190, BEAF-32 and CTCF insulator proteins. In support of this finding, our results uncover a previously unknown physical association between exosome and chromatin insulators. At the <italic>Mcp</italic> and <italic>Fab-8</italic> insulators, exosome recruitment is reduced by CTCF depletion. However, at most other sites tested, insulator proteins are dispensable for exosome chromatin association. Our results provide new insights into potential functions of the nuclear exosome on chromatin.</p><sec><title>Genome-wide profiling of exosome chromatin association</title><p>Our findings demonstrate that exosome associates physically with CP190 insulator complexes, and both exosome and specific insulator factors colocalize extensively throughout the genome. We found that exosome copurifies with CP190 insulator complexes isolated from embryonic nuclear extracts. Since CP190 is a component of multiple chromatin insulator complexes, we relied on parallel genome-wide colocalization approaches in a variety of cell types in order to ascertain the specificity of the interaction. Comparison of genome-wide profiles of exosome and insulator proteins on larval salivary gland polytene chromosomes revealed extensive overlap between exosome and the insulator proteins CP190 and BEAF-32, but low correspondence with CTCF, Su(Hw) and Mod(mdg4)2.2. Similarly, high-resolution ChIP-seq profiling in S2 cells confirmed the specific overlap of exosome with CP190 and BEAF-32 and was also able to detect significant overlap with CTCF that was not apparent in polytene chromosomes. Differential detection of the positive correlation between exosome and CTCF using the two techniques could either be due to differences in cell type or developmental stage examined, or alternatively, the higher resolution of the ChIP-seq method compared with the cytological approach. We analysed our ChIP-seq data in greater detail in order to take advantage of genome-wide profiling data of chromatin-associated factors in the same cell type compiled by other studies and the modENCODE consortium.</p><p>We found that exosome colocalizes with CP190, BEAF-32 and CTCF insulator proteins at a specific subset of active promoters. It is currently unclear how this specificity of recruitment is achieved. Previous work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> showed that exosome interacts physically with transcription elongation factors and colocalizes extensively with these factors on polytene chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B14">14</xref>). Another study demonstrated that transfected epitope tagged Rrp4 and Rrp6 can crosslink to the 3&#x02032;-end of several genes tested, in support of a cotranscriptional RNA surveillance model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B12">12</xref>). However, our high-resolution ChIP-seq data clearly shows that exosome recruitment to genes occurs in sharp peaks preferentially at promoters compared with coding regions. Likewise, localized binding is also observed for CP190, BEAF-32 and CTCF to promoters.</p><p>Importantly, overlap between exosome and insulator proteins is also observed at well-characterized insulator sequences. Exosome ChIP signal is apparent at many known CP190, CTCF or BEAF-32-dependent insulator sites such as <italic>scs</italic>, <italic>scs</italic><italic>&#x02032;</italic>, <italic>Mcp</italic> and <italic>Fab-8</italic>, and these were further confirmed by directed ChIP. Despite extensive overlap with CP190, BEAF-32 and CTCF insulator proteins, we found that only CTCF is required for exosome recruitment to any sites examined in this study. Depletion of CTCF reduces exosome recruitment to both <italic>Mcp</italic> and <italic>Fab-8</italic> whereas other insulator proteins are dispensable. Since reduction of CTCF levels reduces <italic>Abd-B</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B25">25</xref>), it is possible that reduced exosome chromatin association is a consequence of a change in transcription state in the general vicinity. Finally, considering that insulator proteins do not appear to be required for exosome association with other sites tested including co-occupied promoters, additional alternate mechanisms must exist to recruit exosome to chromatin.</p></sec><sec><title>Exosome chromatin association is dependent on active transcription</title><p>Our results suggest that exosome is recruited to chromatin in a transcription-dependent manner. Previous work showed that exosome is recruited to heat shock genes upon transcriptional induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B14">14</xref>). Likewise, we found that exosome associates preferentially with active over inactive promoters. These findings would be consistent with an RNA-based mechanism of recruitment to chromatin. However, specific association of exosome with the promoter and not gene bodies implies that exosome is not simply cotranscriptionally recruited to and stably associated with an elongating transcript since its ChIP signal would likely extend further 3&#x02032; into the gene as has been observed for a variety of RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B69">69</xref>). If exosome is indeed recruited through direct RNA interaction, nascent RNAs may only be accessible to the exosome during a brief window, such as prior to capping, before assembly into protein-rich ribonucleoparticles. However, even if recruited to a transcript cotranscriptionally, exosome may not be able to load on the majority of transcripts for degradation since the 3&#x02032;-end would not be accessible. Another possibility is that exosome specifically recognizes short RNAs associated with stalled Pol II. Finally, exosome recruitment could depend on assembly of the transcriptional apparatus but not the RNA itself. In this case, the full or partially formed exosome complex could be poised for degradation at promoters but not actively engaged.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Stabilization of transcripts as a result of exosome depletion</title><p>We were unable to obtain evidence for substantial transcript stabilization corresponding to regions to which exosome associates with chromatin. We did observe exosome at a subset of snoRNA genes, but we only observed a few cases of snoRNA precursor accumulation in exosome knockdowns. Given the strong enrichment of exosome at the TSS and previous reports that divergent transcription is stabilized at human and yeast promoters in exosome depleted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B71">71</xref>), we looked for evidence of stabilized transcripts using both oligo-dT selected and rRNA depleted RNA-seq libraries of exosome knockdown cells. However, we found no evidence for divergent transcription upstream of annotated promoters regardless of exosome depletion, consistent with a previous study of uni-directional genome-wide transcription initiation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B72">72</xref>). One possibility is that divergent upstream transcription does not occur in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and bidirectional transcription from a single promoter may be specific to certain species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B73">73</xref>). Other purely technical possibilities are that our RNA-seq libraries were of insufficient depth or failed to capture aberrant transcription or altered stability since a conventional size selection step was used for sequencing, which in effect constrains the lower limit of captured RNA to 80 nt. Perhaps development and use of specialized cloning protocols could successfully identify aberrant transcripts or mild effects on transcript stabilization.</p><p>In order to test the possibility that exosome is recruited to chromatin in order to increase the efficiency of RNA surveillance, we also looked for evidence of stabilization of transcripts in exosome knockdown cells at genes at which exosome is associated at the promoter. We note that our knockdowns could not fully remove exosome from chromatin; therefore, sufficient depletion may not have been achieved in order to observe an effect on target RNAs. We did observe stabilization of many transcripts in exosome depleted cells; however these genes do not generally correspond to exosome binding sites. In fact, we observed a negative relationship between the two data sets likely because exosome tends to be recruited to more highly transcribed genes whereas the transcripts stabilized in exosome knockdown cells tend to be lowly expressed in wildtype cells. Although we cannot rule out that cotranscriptional recruitment is a mechanism to promote efficient RNA surveillance on a subset of genes, this does not appear to be a widespread or efficient mechanism. Another possibility is that recruitment of exosome to chromatin poises the degradation machinery for action under specific yet unknown conditions or to degrade transcripts synthesized <italic>in trans</italic> to binding sites.</p><p>Although not a focus of our study, our expression analysis in exosome subunit depleted cell lines revealed mainly stabilization of low expression transcripts. Our results generally confirm a previous study, which methodically depleted each individual exosome subunit in S2 cells and performed gene expression profiling by microarray (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B66">66</xref>). In that study, substantially varying expression profiles were obtained with individual subunit knockdowns, supporting a previously suggested model that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> exosome functions not as a singular degradation machine but as independently functioning, partially redundant subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B36">36</xref>). A genome-wide expression profiling of conditional exosome mutants in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> also detected limited subunit-specific effects on transcript levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B74">74</xref>). We did observe markedly different expression profiles between <italic>Rrp6</italic> and <italic>Rrp40</italic> knockdowns; however, this was likely due to arrest of cell proliferation in Rrp6 but not Rrp40 depleted cells. Our results are consistent with cell cycle arrest specifically observed in Rrp6 knockdown cells as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B36">36</xref>), and these effects substantially confound our expression analyses. Intriguingly, we did find that both exosome subunits preferentially associate with promoters of cell cycle genes, suggesting that exosome could play a direct role in regulation of cell cycle gene transcript regulation. It would be interesting to examine exosome chromatin association at different stages of the cell cycle given that expression of many cell cycle regulators are tightly controlled and regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional relevance of exosome&#x02013;insulator complex association</title><p>Our findings raise the possibility that exosome contributes to insulator activity or regulation, perhaps through an RNA-based mechanism. RNA may contribute to higher order insulator-dependent interactions and has been postulated to be an important component of the <italic>gypsy</italic> insulator complex in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B34">34</xref>) and the CTCF/cohesin insulator complex in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B75">75</xref>). Thus association of exosome with insulator complexes could regulate the abundance or activity of insulator-associated RNAs, which in turn affect RNA-mediated interactions between insulator complexes and factors capable of regulating insulator activity. A feasible scenario is that exosome regulates expression of the <italic>Abd-B</italic> locus through CTCF-dependent recruitment to the <italic>Mcp</italic> and <italic>Fab-8</italic> insulators. Thus far, no specific RNA has yet been implicated in insulator activity at <italic>Abd-B</italic>. However, a complex array of intergenic transcripts arising from the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory region of <italic>Abd-B</italic> has been shown to regulate expression of the downstream homeotic gene <italic>abd-A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt037-B76 gkt037-B77 gkt037-B78">76&#x02013;78</xref>). Therefore, exosome surveillance and degradation activity may be particularly important at this complicated gene region. Isolation of conditional or loss-of-function exosome mutants should help elucidate the precise role of exosome in chromatin insulator activity.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>ACCESSION NUMBERS</title><p>GSE41950.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt037/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online: Supplementary Tables 1&#x02013;9 and Supplementary Figures 1&#x02013;10.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Funding for open access charge: <funding-source>Intramural Program of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</funding-source> [<award-id>DK015602-05</award-id> to E.L.].</p><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
