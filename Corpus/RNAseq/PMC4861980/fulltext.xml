Molecular targeted therapies are not in routine use and novel therapeutic targets are required. Our previous microarray data indicated sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) metabolism and signalling was deregulated in OSCC. In this study, we have investigated the contribution of S1P signalling to the pathogenesis of OSCC. We show that the expression of the two major enzymes that regulate S1P levels were altered in OSCC: SPHK1 was significantly upregulated in OSCC tissues compared to normal oral mucosa and low levels of SGPL1 mRNA correlated with a worse overall survival. In <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, S1P enhanced the migration/invasion of OSCC cells and attenuated cisplatin-induced death. We also demonstrate that S1P receptor expression is deregulated in primary OSCCs and that S1PR2 is over-expressed in a subset of tumours, which in part mediates S1P-induced migration of OSCC cells. Lastly, we demonstrate that FTY720 induced significantly more apoptosis in OSCC cells compared to non-malignant cells and that FTY720 acted synergistically with cisplatin to induce cell death. Taken together, our data show that S1P signalling promotes tumour aggressiveness in OSCC and identify S1P signalling as a potential therapeutic target.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains a major world health issue and is particularly prevalent in India and South East Asia. More than 250,000 new cases are diagnosed each year and, despite advances in cancer therapy, approximately 50% of patients die within 5 years<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Patients are often given multimodal treatment comprising surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> but loco-regional recurrences, distant metastases and second primary tumours occur frequently and are responsible for the poor patient prognosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Whilst our understanding of the molecular basis for the development of OSCC is improving<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, molecular targeted therapies are not in routine use and new approaches to manage the disease are urgently required.</p><p>Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid that is derived from its membrane-bound precursor, ceramide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Ceramide is converted to sphingosine by the action of ceramidases and, subsequently, S1P is generated when sphingosine is phosphorylated by activated sphingosine kinases (SPHK1 and SPHK2). S1P can be dephosphorylated back to sphingosine by sphingosine phosphatase or irreversibly degraded by S1P lyase (SGPL1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. The balance between S1P and its metabolic precursors, ceramide and sphingosine, the so called sphingosine rheostat, regulates cell fate with a shift towards ceramide inducing cell growth arrest and apoptosis, whereas S1P production promotes cell survival<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. The effects of S1P are largely due to the binding to one or more of a family of five G-protein coupled receptors, termed S1PR1-5<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, which then stimulate multiple signalling cascades<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p><p>S1P is involved in a wide variety of cellular processes, such as proliferation, apoptosis, migration and angiogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> and S1P can contribute to tumorigenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. In part, the cancer-promoting effects of S1P result from alterations in S1PR expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Although aberrant S1P signalling has been demonstrated in a number of human tumours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, there is limited information on the role of S1P in the pathogenesis of OSCC. SPHK1 expression has been reported to be upregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> and SPHK1-deficient mice were resistant to 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO)-induced carcinogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p><p>A number of specific agonists and antagonists of S1P signalling have been developed as research tools and potential therapeutics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Notably, 2-amino-2-[2-(4-octylphenyl)]-1,3-propanediolhydrochloride (FTY720; fingolimod), an immunomodulatory drug has recently been approved for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis. After phosphorylation, FTY720 binds to four of the S1PRs (S1PR1/3/4/5) and although FTY720 has an initial agonist activity on these receptors, it subsequently causes receptor internalization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. In addition to modulating the S1PRs, FTY720 can inhibit SPHK1 activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> and activate the tumour suppressor, protein serine/threonine phosphatase type 2A (PP2A)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Due to the pleiotropic properties of the drug, FTY720 can inhibit proliferation and migration of a variety of cancer cell lines, and promote their apoptosis and chemo-sensitivity. FTY720 also inhibits tumour growth, angiogenesis and metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we examined the expression of SPHK1, SGPL1 and the S1PRs in OSCC tissues and determined the effects of S1P on OSCC-derived cell lines. We show that SPHK1 is significantly over-expressed in OSCC, whilst low levels of SGPL1 correlates with poor patient survival. We also show that S1P can protect OSCC cells from cisplatin-induced death as well as enhance their migration and invasion. Our data also show that S1P receptor expression is deregulated in primary OSCCs and that S1PR2 is over-expressed in a subset of tumours, which in part mediates S1P-induced migration of OSCC cells. Lastly we show that FTY720 induced significantly more apoptosis in OSCC cell lines compared to non-malignant cells. Taken together, our data show that S1P signalling promotes tumour aggressiveness in OSCC and that S1P inhibitors and/or sphingosine analogues have promise as novel therapeutic agents.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Deregulation of the sphingosine rheostat in OSCC</title><p>Analysis of our own microarray data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> showed that the expression of a number of genes involved in sphingolipid metabolism and signalling were deregulated in OSCCs. There are 63 genes on the HG-Focus array that are associated with sphingolipid metabolism and S1P signalling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref>). Of these 63 genes, 11 and 24 genes were differentially expressed between OSCCs and normal oral mucosa from UK and Sri Lankan patients, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A,B</xref>). Notably, the expression of SPHK1 was strongly up-regulated, whilst levels of SGPL1 were reduced in OSCCs compared to normal oral mucosa. Therefore, we examined the expression of SPHK1 and SGPL1 in an independent set of tumours (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;52) and non-malignant control tissues (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;5) by QPCR. The expression of SPHK1 was significantly up-regulated in the OSCCs compared to normal oral tissues (<italic>&#x003c1;</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Although the mRNA levels of SGPL1 were not significantly different (&#x003c1;&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05) between the normal and malignant tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>), Kaplan Meier survival analysis revealed that low levels of SGPL1 mRNA correlated with a worse overall survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>; &#x003c1;&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). No significant difference in the overall survival was observed between OSCCs with low and high expression of SPHK1 (&#x003c1;&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05; data not shown). Taken together, our data from three independent cohorts of patients shows that the sphingosine rheostat is deregulated in OSCC and this deregulation has clinical significance.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>S1P protects OSCC cells from cisplatin induced death and promotes tumour cell migration and invasion</title><p>We next investigated the phenotypic impact of S1P on OSCC cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic>. We used clonogenic assays to evaluate the effect of S1P on long-term survival in response to the chemotherapeutic drug, cisplatin, commonly used to treat OSCC patients. Whilst treatment with S1P alone had no effect on the clonogenic growth of H357 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>), S1P caused a significant increase in the clonogenic survival of cells treated with cisplatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p>We next examined the influence of S1P on the motility, migration and invasive capacity of OSCC cells. In colony dispersal assays, treatment of established colonies with 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;M S1P induced loss of cell-to-cell adhesion as cells visibly dissociated and became less tightly clustered. Treatment with 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;M S1P caused the colonies to disperse into single cells that had migrated away from the original centre of the colony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Quantification of colony scatter confirmed a highly significant increase in cell motility following treatment with either 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;M or 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;M S1P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>; <italic>&#x003c1;</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). S1P-induced cell motility was greatly attenuated in the presence of inhibitors of, Rac1 and MEK 1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>; <italic>&#x003c1;</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), suggesting activation of multiple pathways downstream of the S1P receptors are involved in S1P-induced migration and cell motility. Similarly, S1P significantly enhanced the migration of OSCC cells in transwell assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>) and promoted tumour cell invasion in collagen invasion assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>S1PR2 is over-expressed in OSCCs and mediates S1P-induced cell migration</title><p>We next explored which S1P receptors might mediate the effects of S1P on OSCC cell migration. QPCR analyses showed that the expression of the S1PRs was heterogeneous and the majority of primary OSCCs expressed all five receptors. S1PR2 and S1PR4 were significantly upregulated in OSCCs compared to normal oral mucosa (&#x003c1;&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>). The Kaplan Meier survival distributions for low and high expression of the individual S1PRs were not statistically significantly different (&#x003c1;&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05; data not shown). As S1PR2 has been more strongly implicated in carcinogenesis, the expression and cellular localisation of S1PR2 protein were examined in 41 formalin fixed, paraffin embedded primary OSCCs and 3 non-neoplastic tonsil samples used as a source of normal squamous epithelium. We did not include morphologically &#x02018;normal&#x02019; epithelium adjacent to the tumours in our analysis because of potential &#x02018;field&#x02019; effects. 32 out of 41 (78%) OSCCs demonstrated S1PR2 staining which was membranous, cytoplasmic and/or nuclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>). We showed that while there was weak/moderate staining in normal tonsillar epithelium (mean H-score of 68; range 5&#x02013;120; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>), S1PR2 was over-expressed (H-score &#x0003e;120; range 120&#x02013;285) in 16 of 41 tumours (39%). To investigate the functional role of S1PR2, we took advantage of the S1PR2 agonist, CYM5478, and the S1PR2 antagonist, JTE013, to examine cell migration <italic>in vitro</italic>. These compounds were shown to be specific using a TGF-&#x003b1; shedding assay that measures GPCR activation (Herr <italic>et al.</italic>, manuscript under review)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. The cell lines used (H357 and H400) expressed all S1P receptors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1</xref>). JTE013 reduced S1P-induced migration of H357 and H400 cells, while CYM-5478 induced migration of these cells, an effect which could be blocked by JTE013 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>), thereby demonstrating that the pro-migratory effects of S1P on OSCC cells are mediated, at least in part, by S1PR2.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>FTY720 inhibits the viability and clonogenic survival of OSCC cells by inducing apoptosis</title><p>As we showed that the sphingosine rheostat and S1PR expression are deregulated in OSCC, we examined the cytotoxicity of FTY720 on two OSCC cell lines (H357 and H400), one immortalised normal keratinocyte (HaCaT) and two normal oral fibroblasts (NHOF4 and NHOF6) using MTT assays. FTY720 demonstrated selective cytotoxicity with a lower IC<sub>50</sub> in the OSCC cells (approximately 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M) compared to HaCaT (&#x0003e;20&#x02009;&#x003bc;M) and the NHOFS (&#x0003e;30&#x02009;&#x003bc;M; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>)). In addition, FTY720 significantly impaired the clonogenicity of H400 cells (&#x003c1;&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>). As FTY720 can be phosphorylated by SPHK2 to generate FTY720-P, a modulator of all S1PRs except S1PR2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, we sought to determine whether the effect of FTY720 on the cell survival of OSCC cells is S1PR-dependent or -independent. H357 and H400 cells expressed SPHK2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1</xref>) indicating that these cells can phosphorylate FTY720. Treatment of H400 with FTY720-P had no effect on cell viability (400&#x02009;nM-10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M), whilst in H357, FTY720-P had no effect at 400&#x02009;nM but caused a dose dependent reduction in cell viability at higher concentrations (35% reduction at 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p><p>Flow cytometric analysis and apoptotic DNA laddering demonstrated that FTY720 induced cell death through apoptosis. Treatment of H400 with 10 and 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;M of FTY720 for 12 and 24&#x02009;hours increased both early and late apoptotic cell populations in flow cytometry analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5D</xref>). FTY720 also induced DNA fragmentation in H400 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5E</xref>). The apoptosis induced by FTY720 was concomitant with the activation of caspase-3/7, -8 and -9, indicating that this drug activates both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5F</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>FTY720 inhibits ERK and Akt phosphorylation</title><p>To investigate the downstream pathways through which FTY720 induces apoptosis, we examined its effects on ERK and Akt signalling. FTY720 inhibited both ERK and Akt pathway activation in both H357 and H400 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A,B</xref>). To further elucidate the significance of these pathways in FTY720 induced apoptosis, we treated both H357 and H400 cells with increasing concentrations of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (LY294002) and MEK1/2 (UO126) inhibitors for 24&#x02009;hours prior to MTT assay. The inhibition of ERK and Akt phosphorylation by UO126 and LY294002 was confirmed by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S2</xref>). LY294002, but not UO126, induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C,D</xref>), suggesting that the inhibition of Akt by FTY720 might be responsible for its effects on cell survival. However, expression of constitutively active Akt did not rescue the cells from the cytotoxic effects of FTY720 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S3</xref>), suggesting that other pathways are also involved in FTY720-induced apoptosis in OSCC cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Combination of FTY720 and cisplatin shows enhanced cell killing in OSCC cells</title><p>We next tested the effect of FTY720 on the sensitivity of OSCC cell lines to cisplatin.

Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time that both the synthesis and catabolism of S1P is deregulated in OSCC, which would lead to increased production of S1P. Therefore, we measured S1P levels in plasma from a small group OSCC patients and normal individuals using LC-MSMS to determine if circulating S1P levels might be a useful biomarker. However, there were no significant differences between the groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S4</xref>), indicating that elevated levels of S1P are likely to be localised within the tumours and surrounding tissues.</p><p>Having shown that OSCCs are likely to produce elevated amounts of S1P resulting from the deregulation of SPHK1 and SGPL1 expression, we examined the effect of exogenous S1P on the behaviour of OSCC-derived cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic>.

We opted to validate the expression of S1PR2 by immunohistochemistry because this receptor is thought to be more involved in cancer pathogenesis and we confirmed that the S1PR2 was protein was elevated in 39% of tumours. This has functional significance because we showed that activation of this receptor promotes the migration of OSCC cells. Interestingly, we detected S1PR2 expression in the membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus of tumour cells and it has been shown recently that S1PR4 functions to prevent nuclear accumulation of S1PR2 to enhance the growth of ER negative breast cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. As we showed that S1PR4 is also over-expressed at the mRNA level in OSCCs, the functional cooperativity of these receptors in the pathogenesis of OSCC clearly warrants investigation.</p><p>Our data showed there was heterogeneity in the expression of the different S1PRs and when we classified the expression of the individual S1PRs into high or low expression, 29 of 52 (55%) of the OSCCs showed relatively high expression of three or more of the receptors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S5</xref>), suggesting that other receptors might mediate some of the pro-tumorigenic effects of S1P. Interrogation of RNASeq data from a large (&#x0003e;500 tumours) HNSCC Cancer Genome Atlas data set also revealed a general deregulation of S1PR expression with approximately 30% of tumours showing up-regulation (1.5 fold) of one or more of the S1PRs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. These data indicate that there may be some redundancy between the receptors in mediating the pro-tumorigenic effects of S1P. Indeed, the S1PR1/3 antagonist, VPC23019, significantly inhibited S1P-induced OSCC cell migration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S6</xref>), consistent with other reports in different tumour types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>.</p><p>A number of strategies have been proposed to inhibit the pro-oncogenic effects of S1P. We opted to use FTY720 because this drug exhibits pleiotropic effects on the SPHK1-S1P-S1PR axis and affects various aspect of cancer pathogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. We show that FTY720 selectively induced cytotoxicity in OSCC cells compared to non-transformed epidermal human keratinocytes (HaCaT) and normal human oral fibroblasts. Similar results have been reported in other cancer types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. FTY720 induced both caspase-8 and -9 activation in OSCC cells, indicating that this drug is involved in both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways, results that are similar to those in multiple myeloma and chronic myelogenous leukemia cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. We also show that FTY720 synergizes with the chemotherapy drug, cisplatin, in inducing cell death in OSCC cell lines. FTY720 has been shown to increase the cisplatin sensitivity of lung cancer cell through the activation of PP2A<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref> and enhance cell death in combination with cisplatin by inhibiting the Akt and epidermal growth factor (EGF) pathways in melanoma cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, FTY720-P had no effect when used at 400 nM, a dose which is known to modulate the S1PRs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, which suggests that the effects of FTY720 are independent of the S1PRs. The cytotoxicity of FTY720-P in H357 cells at higher concentrations is most likely due to the de-phosphorylation of the drug to FTY720<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. FTY720 treatment of OSCC cells resulted in the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation, although the effects of the drug could not be rescued by the ectopic expression of constitutively active Akt. The mechanisms involved in mediating the effects of FTY720 in OSCC cells remain to be determined but could include the inhibition of SPHK1 and/or activation of PP2A, amongst others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. In our study, treatment of cells with the SPHK1-selective inhibitor PF-543 (0.05&#x02013;10&#x003bc;M; 72&#x02009;hours) did not reduce the viability of OSCC cells (data not shown), in agreement with a previous report using HNSCC cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. However, PF-543 treatment did not result in an accumulation of ceramide in HNSCC cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>, so a more comprehensive analysis with different SPHK1 inhibitors is required to conclusively investigate the effects of SPHK1 inhibition in OSCC cells.</p><p>In conclusion, we show for the first time, using three independent cohorts of patients, that the synthesis and catabolism of S1P is deregulated in OSCC, which would lead to an accumulation of S1P in the tumour and the associated microenvironment. We demonstrate that S1P contributes to a more motile and invasive phenotype in OSCC cells and that there is a general deregulation of the S1PRs in OSCC, with a subset of tumours over-expressing S1PR2 at both the mRNA and protein level. Lastly, we found that FTY720 induces selective apoptosis in OSCC cells compared to normal and non-transformed cells and that the drug might synergise with cisplatin in inducing cell death. Collectively, our results highlight the potential of targeting S1P and its signalling pathways in OSCC patients.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Materials</title><p>Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P; D-erythro S1P; Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, USA) was dissolved in 95% methanol, dried under a stream of nitrogen gas and stored at &#x02212;20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in aliquots of 100&#x02009;nmol.
