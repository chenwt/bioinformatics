Latitudinal clines, which correlate with environmental conditions such as temperature, UV radiation, humidity, and pathogen abundance, present an ideal system for studying local adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For example, it is common to find across many species that body size is smaller nearer the tropics, and this is associated with increases in environmental temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Direct evidence that such clines are driven by adaptation has come from reciprocal transplant experiments showing reduced fitness at different latitudes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and from an understanding of the function of the phenotypic differences in different environments. More indirectly, evidence for adaptation comes from the observation that the same latitudinal patterns evolve repeatedly either in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] or in laboratory conditions that mimic latitudinal differences such as temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> there is clinal variation of phenotypic traits along the east coasts of Australia and the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Despite these areas having only been colonized in the past few hundred years, in many cases parallel clines occur on the two continents. Typically tropical populations have smaller bodies, greater resistance to high temperature, reduced tolerance of low temperature and lack the ability to enter reproductive diapause in the winter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The clear link of these phenotypes to changes in climate, together with the fact that they occur across multiple continents, suggests that these clines are a product of local adaptation that is maintained by spatially varying selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In some cases the genetic basis if these phenotypic differences is known, and the polymorphism has been found to vary clinally. For example, a single amino acid change in the <italic>couch potato</italic> gene is associated with reproductive diapause and shows clinal variation that closely mirrors changes in the trait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The advent of new sequencing and genotyping technologies has allowed the search for clinal variation to be extended to the entire <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This resulted in large numbers of clinally varying SNPs being discovered, and the finding that parallel clines were commonly found in the US and Australia suggested that many different genes across the genome might be involved in local adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, recent analyses suggest that clinal patterns may instead result from demographic processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Both Australian and US populations of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> have been founded from both African and European populations, with African flies contributing primarily to populations nearest the tropics on both continents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, much of the clinal variation in genetic markers may simply reflect admixture between European and African flies and not local adaptation, and parallel clines of genetic variants alone cannot be taken as evidence of local adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>A small number of studies have investigated geographical variation in gene expression in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. When populations of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> from Maine USA and Panama were compared, numerous genes were found to be differentially expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. <italic>D. simulans</italic> populations collected from the same locations also showed differences in gene expression, and these frequently involved the same genes changing in expression in the same direction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The observation that the same patterns have arisen in parallel in the two species strongly suggests that these differences in gene expression are in part driven by spatially varying selection pressures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In Australia transcriptional differences have been identified using microarrays between northern and southern Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. When flies from tropical and temperate regions of Australia are reared at both hot and cold temperatures, there is an excess of genes that are downregulated at the temperature that is most unlike the flies&#x02019; natural environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The genes showing these patterns were clustered in small groups, which suggests some of the changes may be due to chromatin regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This observation that plasticity in gene expression is linked to environmental variation suggests that this variation is in part an adaptation to maintain correct levels of gene expression when flies colonized regions with different temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Selection on gene expression has long been argued to be the major source of evolutionary change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and therefore may be important to local adaptation. Local adaptation via changes in gene expression has recently been demonstrated to be more common than by amino acid substitutions in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Modification of expression can occur via <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory elements (CREs), which are physically linked to the genes whose expression they control, or <italic>trans</italic>-acting elements, which are physically distant. CREs tend to influence one or a few gene targets, often in specific tissues or at specific times, whereas <italic>trans</italic> factors can control the expression of many genes. This means that the modification of CREs during evolution may result in fewer pleiotropic changes than changes to <italic>trans</italic> acting factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Therefore, it is expected that CREs are an important source of local adaptation, as they allow the fine-tuned alteration of gene expression with fewer associated fitness costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>The effects of <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>-acting polymorphisms can be distinguished by measuring the relative expression of the two alleles of a gene within a single individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Polymorphisms acting in <italic>trans</italic> are expected to alter the expression of the two alleles equally, while <italic>cis</italic>-acting polymorphisms will result in the expression of the alleles on the two chromosomes differing. This allele-specific expression (ASE) can be detected by measuring the relative abundance of SNPs in RNAseq reads, with deviations from a 50:50 ratio indicating ASE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Such analyses must be undertaken with care, as RNAseq reads are less likely to map to a reference genome when SNPs cause mismatches to the reference genome, generating false signals of ASE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. These problems have been overcome in a variety of ways, allowing <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory variation to be studied on a genome-wide scale.</p><p>To study latitudinal variation in gene expression, we used 52 isofemale lines from two Australian and two United States populations, chosen to represent temperate and tropical or sub-tropical environments from each continent (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>; 11&#x02013;14 lines per population with 4 of these lines per population having biological replicates). We genetically cloned a haploid genome from each line, and then crossed these genomes to the strain of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> that was sequenced to produce the standard reference genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Local adaptation to pathogens is common in natural populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> latitudinally differentiated genomic regions are enriched for genes involved in the immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and some tropical populations have higher resistance to infection than temperate populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. To increase the amount of sequence data from immunity genes, we inoculated the progeny of the cross with a cocktail of heat-killed <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic> (gram-positive) and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (gram-negative) bacteria to upregulate genes involved in the immune response. These bacteria were chosen as they activate the Toll and IMD pathways, which are the two main immune signaling pathways of <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. We then measured both total gene expression and allele-specific gene expression (ASE) using RNA-seq.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Parallel differences in total gene expression between temperate and tropical populations in Australia and the United States. <bold>a</bold> Temperate (<italic>blue</italic>) and tropical or sub-tropical (<italic>red</italic>) populations were sampled from Victoria and Queensland in Australia (<italic>circles</italic>) and Maine and Florida in the United States (<italic>triangles</italic>). <bold>b</bold> Mean per gene log<sub>2</sub> fold expression differences between tropical and temperate populations were estimated separately for each continent.

We tested for latitudinal differences in expression by looking for an excess of genes that had significantly different expression levels between latitudes in at least one continent and that tended towards the same direction on both continents (i.e. higher expression in both temperate populations or in both tropical populations). In the United States 193 of 8717 genes were differentially expressed between the temperate and sub-tropical populations with a genome-wide false discovery rate of 20% (59 of these genes had a false discovery rate of 5%). Of these, in 83% of cases (159 of 192 genes tested in both populations) the direction of expression was the same between the temperate and tropical populations in Australia, reflecting an excess of genes with the same direction of change on both continents (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>; 95% binomial confidence interval: 77&#x02013;88%). If only the 59 genes with a false discovery rate of 5% in the US are considered, then in 90% of cases the direction of expression was the same between the temperate and tropical populations in Australia (95% binomial confidence interval: 80&#x02013;95%). Furthermore, the relative expression of genes in our temperate and sub-tropical populations in the United States was positively correlated with published microarray data comparing Europe with Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] (Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation: &#x003c1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.10, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.7&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>). This pattern was largely driven by genes upregulated in tropical compared to temperate populations. When the reciprocal analysis was done, we found far fewer genes were significantly differentially expressed between latitudes in Australia (2 of 8739).</p><p>The genes with parallel latitudinal differences in expression are enriched for certain functional categories (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). This includes the immune response, including antimicrobial peptides (<italic>Dro</italic>, <italic>AttD</italic>, <italic>Drsl4</italic>, <italic>Drsl5</italic>, and <italic>Listericin</italic>), a thioester-containing protein (<italic>Tep4</italic>), two prophenoloxidases (<italic>PPO1</italic> and <italic>PPO2</italic>), and two lectins (<italic>Lectin-galC1</italic>, <italic>lectin-33A</italic>) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). These immunity genes are all more highly expressed in the tropics. We also find higher expression in tropical populations of genes involved in pesticide resistance (<italic>Cyp6g1</italic>, <italic>alpha-Est7</italic>), melanisation and pigmentation (<italic>yellow-b</italic>, <italic>yellow-e</italic>, <italic>Rh3</italic>), oxidation-reduction reactions (including several cytochrome P450 genes that can affect susceptibility to toxins, <italic>Sodh-1</italic>, <italic>antdh</italic>, <italic>desat2</italic>), metabolism (<italic>Mal-A1</italic>, <italic>Mal-A2</italic>, <italic>Mal-A4</italic>, <italic>Mal-A6</italic>, <italic>Mal-B1</italic>), cuticle formation (<italic>Cpr60D</italic>, <italic>Cpr65Au</italic>, <italic>Cpr49Ab</italic>), and reproduction (<italic>Cys</italic>, <italic>Obp19d</italic>, <italic>PebIII</italic>, <italic>NLaz</italic>, <italic>ssp7</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Variation in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements alters gene expression</title><p>Gene expression can be affected by variation in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements, which will affect expression in an allele-specific manner, or <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors, which will affect both alleles equally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Because <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory variation causes allele-specific differences in expression (ASE), it can be detected by testing whether RNA-seq reads originating from the two alleles deviate from the expected 1:1 ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. For each gene, we took the sequence reads that contained a SNP and counted the numbers that came from the reference genome and fly line sampled from the wild [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. As we have biological replicates of 12-16 genotypes for each gene we analysed (4 genotypes in each population had a biological replicate), we can detect heterogeneity in ASE using a generalized linear mixed model that accounts for any non-genetic variation in the ratio of reads from the two alleles, such as might arise during the sequencing process. Of the 3626 genes that met our coverage requirements, 660 (18%) had significant ASE with a genome-wide false discovery rate of 20% (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2).</p><p>Using our estimates of ASE, we divided the alleles of each gene into high and low expression groups (estimated from the ratio of reads from the reference genome and the fly line sampled from the wild; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). As expected, we found a strong correlation between ASE and total gene expression, which was measured separately using the total number of reads mapping to each gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). In 85% of cases, lines carrying the high expression allele had higher total gene expression than lines carrying the low expression allele (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). We also found that the allele that was more frequent in the population (the major allele) usually had higher expression than the less frequent minor allele (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>; combining data from all populations). Of the 221 genes with a minor allele frequency below 30% in the population, 76% (168 genes) had higher expression of the major allele. This may suggest the presence of low frequency slightly deleterious mutations reducing gene expression, as might be expected if new mutations reduce gene expression more often than they increase it.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Identifying high and low expression alleles. Two genes with allele specific expression (ASE) are shown. ASE was detected as significant variation in the ratio of sequence reads from wild alleles sampled from natural populations and the reference allele across the different fly genotypes.

We found that genes were twice as likely to have significant ASE if they also had parallel latitudinal differences in total gene expression (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). This enrichment was not driven by differences in power between genes with and without latitudinal differences in total expression, as down-sampling to correct for this yielded similar results (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2). Across all genes with ASE, the difference between tropical and temperate populations in ASE and total expression tends to go in the same direction in both Australia (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>, Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation &#x003c1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.377, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;15</sup>) and the United States (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>, Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation &#x003c1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.118, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0024). This pattern holds if the analysis is restricted to just those genes with significant latitudinal differences in total gene expression, although it is only significant in Australia (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>, black solid circles; Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation US: &#x003c1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.158, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.128; Australia: &#x003c1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.464, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.21&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>). Together, these results demonstrate that the frequency of CRE polymorphisms vary in response to latitude and in similar ways across the two continents.</p><p>Our method for detecting ASE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] aims to minimize the effects of mapping bias, which occurs when alleles more similar to the reference genome are more likely to map, leading to false detection of ASE. Briefly, we minimized this bias by mapping first to the reference genome and then to a genome updated to include SNPs found in the first round of mapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In addition, we only used SNPs in a high quality SNP database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] for measuring ASE. Because all our fly lines were crossed to the reference genome strain we can detect the effect of mapping biases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. We found that the average proportion of reads from the reference genome allele was 50.1% and 37 of 52 lines have above 50% reference alleles, suggesting a small bias remains. However, we could rule out mapping bias as a confounding factor by repeating all our analyses separately using just genes that were biased towards or away from the reference genome (&#x0003e;55% or &#x0003c;45% reads with the reference allele) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures S3 and S4). Inversions, which are thought to suppress recombination between locally adapted alleles, vary in frequency along latitudes in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, and the <italic>In(3R)P</italic> inversion is thought to carry genes associated with adaptation to latitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. We find no evidence that genes that are latitudinally differentiated in total expression are clustered within inversions or chromosome arms (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3), nor that latitudinal correlations in ASE are driven by particular regions of the genome (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have found that changes in gene expression and allele specific expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> from recently colonized temperate and tropical or sub-tropical regions in the northern and southern hemispheres are correlated. A key question is whether these differences reflect demography or local adaptation. If these differences were already present in ancestral African and European populations, unequal colonization by these founding populations may have contributed to or produced the observed differences in Australia and the United States populations. Indeed, tropical populations in both Australia and the United States have a greater proportion of African ancestry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, it is also plausible that selection has been important in establishing some of the parallel clines, as it is known that within Australia gene expression in tropical and temperate populations respond differently to changes in a temperature in a way that suggests there has been local adaptation to maintain gene expression at different temperatures. Additional evidence that selection can play a role in establishing latitudinal clines in gene expression comes from the observation that parallel clines exist in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, it is clear that there is parallel local adaptation to latitude in phenotypic traits on both continents and it is likely that gene expression differences contribute to these differences.</p><p>The functional categories of genes that have parallel clines in expression are compatible with these differences arising due to local adaptation, regardless of whether selection was acting in the ancestral European and African populations, or in Australia and the United States. For example, immune response genes are more highly expressed in the tropics, which is consistent with previous observations of higher resistance to infection in some tropical <italic>Drosophila</italic> populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and increased pathogen diversity closer to the equator in other species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Similarly, we found differences in genes involved in pigmentation, the repair of UV damage to DNA, detoxification pathways and reproduction. It is possible that these contribute to latitudinal clines in traits like reproductive rate and pigmentation that are thought to be local adaptations. Similar patterns are also seen in humans, where a recent meta-analysis has shown that expression of genes involved in the immune response, UV radiation response, and diabetes pathways are correlated with latitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Unexpectedly, we found far greater latitudinal differences in total gene expression in the US than in Australia. This difference may be explained by the larger climatic difference between the populations in the United States (Florida versus Maine) as compared with Australia (Queensland versus Victoria) resulting in larger differences in gene expression. Alternatively, it could be the result of different colonization processes on the two continents &#x02013; for example Australia and the United States may have been colonized from different populations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have found extensive latitudinal differences in gene expression which are correlated with <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory differences between the same populations. Many of the genes involved have functions that may be important in adaptation to local environmental conditions. A challenge for the future is to disentangle any effects of selection from demography, and to determine whether any selection has acted in recently colonized new world populations or the old world populations from where these came. One approach is to show the adaptive significance of individual genes we identified &#x02013; for example, does increased expression of <italic>(6-4) photolyase</italic> result in reduced DNA damage in tropical populations? Alternatively, genome-wide approaches could be taken such as examining changes in ASE at different temperatures, showing parallel changes in situations where population admixture is not a problem (eg across seasons, with altitude or across species), or attempting to disentangle selection and demography analytically.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Fly lines and crosses</title><p>

The number of reads mapped per annotated protein-coding gene was enumerated using HTSeq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and differential gene expression analysis was performed using edgeR version 3.2.4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Principle component analysis revealed three clear outliers in total gene expression (1 line from Bowdoinham, 2 lines from Homestead), and these were excluded from subsequent analyses. Prior to differential gene expression analysis, reads were down-sampled to a fixed coverage level (6,968,765 reads per sample) by randomly sampling paired reads prior to alignment, and 10 samples were analysed per population without replication. Separately for the United States and Australia, we estimated differential expression between tropical and temperate populations. To filter out lowly expressed genes, we required that each gene have at least 1 count per million (cpm) in at least 10 samples to be retained. This resulted in 8717 genes being analysed in the United States and 8739 in Australia. EdgeR was also used to obtain per-gene estimates of cpm for each individual.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], including an exploration of the performance of the methods on the sequences from one of the samples described here. To estimate ASE, reads were first aligned as described above, and non-uniquely mapped reads were discarded. To call SNPs use the software VarScan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. We then filtered the called SNPs by requiring them to have an increasing number of supporting reads (base quality greater than 19) as the depth of coverage increased. This threshold was set such that the probability of the number of errors exceeding this threshold was less than 0.0001 if every read had the lowest possible quality score and a systematic bias resulted in all errors causing the same incorrect nucleotide to be called (a phred score of 20, which equates to an error rate of 1 in 100) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In addition to this we eliminated SNPs at positions with fewer than 15 total reads, SNPs with more than two states (i.e. alleles), and SNPs that were not in genes (those that did not intersect with the GTF transcript annotation file) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

This step avoids a bias towards mapping reads that are more similar to the reference genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Because one of our genomes is the published reference, this alternate reference is correctly phased and should contain SNPs found in the wild isofemale line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Note that the reference genome strain carries multiple phenotypic markers that ensure it has not been contaminated. Finally, reads from both alignments were combined using a custom script to ensure no read was included twice, and the SNP calls were used to get the per-gene counts for reads mapping to reference and wild genomes. Where different SNPs assigned the same read to both the reference and non-reference allele, either the read or the SNP was removed following the approach of Quinn et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>We separately tested each protein-coding gene for ASE using a generalised mixed effects model (GLMM) implemented by maximum likelihood in R version 3.0.2. We only included genes where at least 12 samples had biological replicates. In the GLM the reference and wild read counts were treated as binomially distributed response variables using a logit link function using the R function <italic>glmer</italic>. The fly genotype was treated as a random effect. Overdispersion was accounted for by also including biological replicate as a random effect (i.e. a residual variance was estimated). We tested for ASE by dropping the random effect of fly genotype from the model and testing whether this was significant using a likelihood ratio test. False discovery rates were calculated using the Benjamini and Hochberg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] method with the R function <italic>p.adjust</italic>. For each gene, we also estimated the mean proportion of reads mapping to the reference allele using the GLM to allow us to separate genes into those biased towards and away from the reference allele.</p><p>For each gene with ASE, we divided the lines into two groups, those with a high or a low expression allele, based on the ratio of reads mapping to the wild versus reference genome alleles (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). To do this we first sorted lines in order of the log<sub>2</sub> ratio of reads coming from the wild vs. reference alleles (where read counts from biological replicates were summed together). We then divided this list of lines into two groups. The first group contained the lines with the top log<sub>2</sub> ratios and ranged in size from 1 to n-1, where n was the number of non-replicated lines. The second group was composed of the remaining lines. For each grouping, we fitted the GLM described above with the addition of a fixed effect of Group. We then extracted the log likelihood scores from these models, and the best grouping was taken to be the one with the maximum likelihood. The group with the mean log<sub>2</sub> wild/reference ratio closest to 0 (i.e. similar levels of expression of wild and reference alleles) was taken to be the reference CRE group, and the other group was the alternate CRE group. If the alternate group had a log<sub>2</sub> wild/reference ratio greater than 0, the wild allele was assumed to have higher expression than the reference allele, otherwise it was assumed to be lower. Examples for groups fit using this method are given in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. To obtain the effect of population on ASE, we extracted mean ASE for each population by including Population as a fixed effect in the model described in the previous paragraph. We tested for the significance of latitude by including Latitude, Continent and a Latitude X Continent interaction in the model described in the previous paragraph.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec15"><title>Additional files</title><p>
