TREM-1 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, active through the DAP12 signaling pathway, with an unknown ligand. Activation through TREM-1 induces inflammatory cytokines including IL-8, MCP/CCL2 and TNF. We now show that TREM-1 was expressed in the skin of healthy and psoriatic patients, and there was increased soluble TREM-1 in the circulation of psoriasis patients. In psoriasis lesions, TREM-1 was co-localized with dendritic cells as well as CD31<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells. TREM-1 expression was reduced with successful NB-UVB, etanercept and anti-IL-17 treatments. An <italic>in vitro</italic> model of PGN-activated monocytes as inflammatory myeloid DCs was developed to study TREM-1 blockade, and treatment with a TREM-1 blocking chimera decreased allogeneic Th17 activation as well as IL-17 production. Furthermore, TREM-1 blockade of <italic>ex vivo</italic> psoriatic dendritic cells in an alloMLR also showed a decrease in IL-17. Together, these data suggest that the TREM-1 signaling pathway may be a previously unidentified therapeutic target to prevent the effects of inflammatory myeloid DCs in psoriasis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P2">Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease of unknown etiology, and dendritic cells (DCs) are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of skin lesions (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Lowes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). There are two main subgroups of myeloid DCs in psoriasis: blood dendritic cell antigen (BDCA)-1/CD1c<sup>+</sup> resident DCs, and a subset termed &#x0201c;inflammatory DCs&#x0201d; which includes &#x0201c;TNF- and iNOS-producing DCs&#x0201d; or Tip-DCs (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Zaba <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009b</xref>).

Further studies have shown that human inflammatory DCs similarly produce TNF and iNOS (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Lowes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), are negative for BDCA-1, and also produce IL-12p40, IL-23p19, and IL-20 (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Zaba <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009a</xref>; <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Zaba <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).</p><p id="P3">To further characterize these inflammatory DCs, in 2010 we defined their transcriptome using global genomic profiling (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Zaba <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). FACS-sorted psoriasis inflammatory DCs (HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup>BDCA-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells) and resident DCs (HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup>BDCA-1<sup>+</sup> cells) were hybridized, and their expression profiles were compared to generate a list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), defining the psoriatic inflammatory myeloid DCs transcriptome. Using this approach, TRAIL and TLR2 were identified as markers of inflammatory DCs (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Zaba <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Now, while interrogating this transcriptome using bioinformatics approaches (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis), <italic>Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) Signaling</italic> was identified as the third highest canonical pathway enriched in this transcriptome, with <italic>NK cell</italic> and <italic>IL17A</italic> signaling being the top two pathways.</p><p id="P4">TREM-1 (CD354), first described over ten years ago by Bouchon <italic>et al,</italic> is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, constitutively expressed on monocytes and neutrophils in peripheral blood (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Bouchon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Bouchon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Matesanz-Isabel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). It has also been identified on airway epithelial cells, hepatic endothelial cells, NK cells, DCs, B and T cells (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Matesanz-Isabel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Rigo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). TREM-1 is activated synergistically with TLR agonists and interacts with epidermal antimicrobial peptide (cathelicidin/LL37) (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Amatngalim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). As TREM-1 lacks an intracellular domain, downstream signaling by an unknown ligand is mediated through a DAP12 adaptor protein (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Tessarz and Cerwenka, 2008</xref>). Several transcription factors are activated including JAK2, STAT3/5, and NF&#x003ba;B. Ultimately, activation of TREM-1 signaling pathway results in the downstream production of a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF, MCP/CCL2, MIP-1&#x003b1; and IL-8, amplifying innate and adaptive immune responses. However, soluble TREM-1 may play a role as an inhibitor by binding the unknown ligand and preventing binding to the TREM-1 surface receptor (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Bouchon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>).</p><p id="P5">TREM-1 may be involved in infectious and non-infectious inflammation, as well as autoimmunity. TREM-1 pathway activation has been reported in pneumonia, pancreatitis, peptic ulcer disease, sepsis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and gout (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Ford and McVicar, 2009</xref>).

Furthermore, TREM-1 blockade has been shown to improve the clinical course of a murine model of inflammatory bowel disease (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Schenk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), and prolong survival in murine sepsis (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Gibot <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).

As PGN is likely to be a more general agonist, we chose to use PGN-treated monocytes to continue these studies, considering that they presented a useful model to study TREM-1 blockade.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>TREM-1 blockade reduced Th17 cells in an in vitro alloMLR</title><p id="P17">CD14<sup>+</sup> selected monocytes were cultured overnight with PGN, then washed, and co-cultured with allogeneic T cells in the presence of an inhibiting TREM-1 chimera (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Bouchon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Bouchon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), a construct with TREM-1 protein fused to Fc region of IgG1, added on day 1 and 3.

There was also a reduction in IL-17 production in the presence of the blocking TREM-1 chimera in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>).

Specifically, the mean reduction in total IL-17-producing cells was 66% with ustekinumab, comparable to the 50% reduction in IL-17 producing cells in the presence of TREM-1 blockade. These results indicate that TREM-1 blockade could reduce the effect of psoriatic DC activation of Th17 cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S10"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P19">Psoriasis is a complex inflammatory process, and although much more is known about the involvement of the adaptive immune system and the central role of the IL-23-Th17 axis in this disease, questions still remain. These data show the presence of TREM-1 expression in psoriasis and a reduction with treatment, providing preliminary pre-clinical support for TREM-1 as a potential therapeutic target.</p><p id="P20">Initial review of this <italic>TREM-1 Signaling</italic> pathway suggests that this is a pathway involved in the innate immune system. Activation of the TREM-1 receptor (by its unknown ligand) augmented by TLR agonists, leads to DAP12 recruitment, and ultimately production of cytokines such as IL-8, MCP/CCL2, and TNF. These mediators all contribute to acute inflammation, leading to recruitment of neutrophils and mononuclear cells. The high level of TREM-1 expression on circulating neutrophils in both normal and psoriatic subjects (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Bouchon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), and recent evidence that neutrophils may produce IL-17 (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Lin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) suggests a role in early inflammatory processes. The observation that acute high dosage NB-UVB also causes activation of the <italic>TREM-1 Signaling</italic> pathway likewise supports a role for TREM-1 in acute inflammation.</p><p id="P21">However, while TREM-1 signaling may be an early event in psoriasis pathogenesis, it may also be involved in ongoing inflammation. Early studies showed that TREM-1-activated monocytes could participate in both the early innate and adaptive immune responses (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Bleharski <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). In this setting, activation of TREM-1 on monocytes induced IL-8 and IL-1&#x003b2;, and also upregulated MHC Class II and co-stimulatory molecules such as CD86, leading to augmented T cell proliferation and IFN&#x003b3; production. Furthermore, although innate early response cytokines such as IL-8 and IL-1&#x003b2; are elevated in psoriasis, they return to baseline in both those that respond to successful treatment with etanercept, and those that do not respond (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Zaba <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009c</xref>). Therefore, it is of interest that TREM-1 signaling genes that were differentially regulated in psoriasis only returned to baseline in those that responded to treatment, but not in those patients that did not improve. TREM-1<sup>+</sup> cells and mRNA were also reduced only in responders to NB-UVB. IL-17 blockade also led to a reduction of TREM-1 genes as early as 2 weeks. These data suggest that there is persistent activation of the TREM-1 pathway during the maintenance of psoriasis lesions. In fact, the failure to turn off the TREM-1 signaling pathway may be part of the &#x0201c;psoriatic tendency&#x0201d; leading to maintenance of psoriasis lesions.</p><p id="P22">Recently, mutations in CARD14 were found in familial psoriasis vulgaris (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Jordan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012a</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Jordan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012b</xref>). Transfection of the CARD14 mutation into keratinocytes leads to increased NF&#x003ba;B activation, and production of many cytokines such as IL-8 and CCL20. For the psoriasis patients harboring mutations in CARD14, this suggests there may be a lower threshold for epidermal activation initiating psoriasis lesions. It was of interest then that TREM-1 protein expression was detected on keratinocytes by immunohistochemistry and FACS. Furthermore, the TREM-1 signaling pathway was also significant in the transcriptome of the keratinocytes with this CARD14 mutation. The relationship between TREM-1 and CARD14 remains to be evaluated, but they may share common mechanism of action as they can both activate NF&#x003ba;B.</p><p id="P23">Antimicrobial peptide human &#x003b2;-defensin 3 (BD3) upregulated co-stimulatory molecules CD80, CD86, and CD40 on monocytes via TLR1 and TLR2 in a MyD88-dependent manner (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Funderburg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). This was specific to the myeloid cells, as BD3 did not have this effect on plasmacytoid DCs. These observations brought our attention to the concept that an endogenous keratinocyte peptide could activate monocytes to become potential antigen-presenting cells. Monocytes as precursors of inflammatory DCs have also been shown recently in a murine model of LPS-stimulation (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Cheong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), as well as the initial description of Tip-DCs (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Serbina <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003a</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Serbina <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003b</xref>). Use of PGN-activated monocytes as a model of inflammatory DCs established a useful system to test TREM-1 blockade. Monocytes cultured overnight with PGN developed into antigen presenting cells capable of robust allogeneic T cell proliferation, cytokine production, and Th1/Th17 activation. In this <italic>in vitro</italic> system, treatment of the PGN-activated monocytes with TREM-1 inhibiting chimera reduced the percentage of Th17 cells by half, and decreased the secretion of IL-17 into the supernatant, suggesting that blocking TREM-1 suppresses Th17 cells.</p><p id="P24">We have previously shown that both CD11c<sup>+</sup>BDCA-1<sup>+</sup> resident DCs and CD11c<sup>+</sup>BDCA-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> inflammatory myeloid DCs can activate allogeneic Th1/Th17 cells <italic>ex vivo</italic> (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Zaba <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009a</xref>). While we first identified the TREM-1 Signaling pathway in the transcriptome of the inflammatory myeloid DCs, TREM-1 was present on both DC subsets, and the TREM-1 chimera decreased bulk psoriatic DCs induction of allogeneic Th17 cell activation and IL-17 production. This suggests that blockade of TREM-1 on both resident and inflammatory myeloid DCs may be a potential therapeutic strategy, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9</xref>. Further studies are warranted to determine which population may be more important. As the mechanism of action of the TREM-1 chimera is considered to be via binding to the TREM-1 ligand, it is possible that DCs and/or T cells in the alloMLR may produce the ligand for TREM-1.</p><p id="P25">The addition of TREM-1 blockade in this <italic>ex vivo</italic> system reduced the percent Th17 cells and IL-17 production in a magnitude similar to IL-23p40 blockade (ustekinumab, Stelara, Janssen, an FDA-approved treatment for psoriasis). While time consuming and technically difficult due to the small numbers of cells available for study, this assay offers a useful method for assessing the effect of potential therapeutics in a human system to develop pre-clinical data. Overall, these data support the potential importance of TREM-1 in psoriatic inflammation and warrant further study of TREM-1 as a therapeutic target.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S11"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p id="P26">Further details are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Material and Methods</xref>.</p><sec id="S12"><title>Skin and Blood Samples</title><p id="P27">Skin biopsies and blood were obtained from normal volunteers and psoriasis patients under a Rockefeller University Institutional Review Board approved protocol.
