We have identified the cysteine protease inhibitor Cystatin 6 (CST6) as a consistently repressed TBX2 target gene, co-repressed through a mechanism involving Early Growth Response 1 (EGR1). Exogenous expression of CST6 in TBX2-expressing breast cancer cells resulted in significant apoptosis whilst non-tumorigenic breast cells remained unaffected. CST6 is an important tumor suppressor in multiple tissues, acting as a dual protease inhibitor of both papain-like cathepsins and asparaginyl endopeptidases (AEPs) such as Legumain (LGMN). Mutation of the CST6 LGMN-inhibitory domain completely abrogated its ability to induce apoptosis in TBX2-expressing breast cancer cells, whilst mutation of the cathepsin-inhibitory domain or treatment with a pan-cathepsin inhibitor had no effect, suggesting that LGMN is the key oncogenic driver enzyme. LGMN activity assays confirmed the observed growth inhibitory effects were consistent with CST6 inhibition of LGMN. Knockdown of LGMN and the only other known AEP enzyme (GPI8) by siRNA confirmed that LGMN was the enzyme responsible for maintaining breast cancer proliferation. CST6 did not require secretion or glycosylation to elicit its cell killing effects, suggesting an intracellular mode of action. Finally, we show that TBX2 and CST6 displayed reciprocal expression in a cohort of primary breast cancers with increased TBX2 expression associating with increased metastases. We have also noted that tumors with altered TBX2/CST6 expression show poor overall survival. This novel TBX2-CST6-LGMN signaling pathway, therefore, represents an exciting opportunity for the development of novel therapies to target TBX2 driven breast cancers.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>TBX2</kwd><kwd>CST6</kwd><kwd>LGMN</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>TBX2 is a member of the T-box family of transcription factors, which play important roles in developmental gene regulation [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. T-box proteins bind DNA and regulate gene expression through highly conserved 180-200 amino acid T-box motifs. TBX2 is an embryonically restricted gene normally expressed in the milk ridge during the development of the duct system of the mammary gland in the mouse [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. TBX2 was first linked to cancer through its ability to facilitate senescence bypass in <italic>Bmi<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse embryo fibroblasts [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and was found to be a potent immortalizing gene downregulating <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> (<italic>p19<sup>ARF</sup></italic>, <italic>p14</italic><sup>ARF</sup> in humans). TBX2 was also shown to bind to and repress the p21<sup>WAF1</sup> promoter both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in <italic>vivo</italic> [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and to have a role in maintaining proliferation and suppressing cell senescence in melanoma cells [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It promotes anchorage-independent growth and bypass of apoptotic pathways in adrenocortical carcinomas [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The Retinoblastoma protein Rb1 is another key tumor suppressor gene whose function is altered by TBX2 resulting in cell cycle perturbations [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. We have previously shown addiction of TBX2-amplified cell lines to elevated TBX2 protein expression and that TBX2 transcriptionally represses the breast tumor suppressor gene N-myc Down Regulated Gene 1 (NDRG1) through interaction with EGR1 to promote cell proliferation and inhibit cellular senescence [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Oncogene addiction is thought to arise from dependence on a specific oncogenic pathway due to deactivation of an analogous redundant pro-survival pathway [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The oncogene is therefore not required for normal growth prior to its aberrant activation. This is usually evident from the lack of addiction to the oncogene in cell lines derived from corresponding normal tissue [reviewed in [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]]. In addition, some oncogenic events can generate a requirement of secondary oncogenic addictions [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Cystatin 6 (CST6), also called cystatin E/M, was first identified as a cysteine protease inhibitor which showed a significant downregulation in breast cancer mRNA samples compared to matched normal control mRNAs [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Cystatins constitute a large family of protease inhibitors known to target lysosomal cysteine proteases and Asparaginyl Endopeptidases (AEPs). CST6 has been postulated to be a tumor suppressor gene in breast tissue [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], reducing breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, matrigel invasion, and adhesion to endothelial cells [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. More recently, loss of CST6 expression has been reported in a number of other cancer types including cervical, glioma, prostate and gastric cancers [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>],[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>],[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>],[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Loss of CST6 expression in breast cancers has been attributed to promoter hypermethylation [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. CST6 has been shown to be important for skin differentiation which was shown to be disrupted in <italic>cst6</italic>-deficient mice, accompanied by uncontrolled activity of a specific AEP called Legumain (LGMN) [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. LGMN is a known oncogene, an indicator of poor prognosis in colorectal and breast cancers and has been reported to be overexpressed in the majority of human solid tumors [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>In this study we identify CST6 as a novel TBX2 repressed target through a mechanism involving EGR1. We show that exogenous expression of wild-type CST6 induces apoptotic effects in TBX2 expressing breast cancer cells but not in non-tumorigenic breast cells. CST6-induced apoptosis is dependent on inhibition of the protease LGMN since CST6 mutants lacking LGMN (but not cathepsin) inhibitory activity were also unable to induce apoptosis. We also demonstrate that the secretion or glycosylation of CST6 was not required for this cell killing effect. We conclude that CST6 represents an important barrier to breast tumorigenesis which is targeted and bypassed by TBX2 transcriptional repression and we discuss the implications of these findings for breast tumorigenesis and the potential for novel therapeutic opportunities.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><p>CST6 was identified as a strongly repressed TBX2 transcriptional target in a microarray analysis of MCF7 cells following TBX2 siRNA knockdown (data not shown). Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A and 1B</xref> show RqPCR values for TBX2 and CST6, respectively, following siRNA knockdown of TBX2 in three different breast cancer cell lines. CST6 was also upregulated in MCF7 cells following tetracycline-induced (-tet) expression of a truncated dominant negative TBX2 (DN-TBX2, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1.A</xref>), missing the putative C-terminal repression domain [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Conversely, CST6 was downregulated following exogenous expression of wild-type TBX2 in U2OS cells (lacking endogenous TBX2 expression, Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1.B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1.C</xref>). To help define mechanistically how TBX2 repressed CST6 we generated a luciferase reporter construct of the CST6 proximal promoter (-959/+30). This construct was TBX2-responsive (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), showing strong repression of luciferase following exogenous expression of TBX2 in U2OS cells. Exonuclease mapping of the -959/+30 reporter showed that even the shortest region (-101/+30 upstream of the CST6 transcriptional start site) was TBX2 responsive (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>TBX2 represses the CST6 proximal promoter</title><p>(A) RqPCR analysis showing TBX2 mRNA levels in MCF7, T47D, and BT474 cells transiently transfected with TBX2 siRNA (TBX2si) or scrambled control (Scr).

However, following SDM of both sites we observed no abrogation of TBX2 repression, indicating that they were not required (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). We suspected that CST6 may be repressed by TBX2 through an EGR1-dependent mechanism similar to another characterized target NDRG1 (7). Accordingly, siRNA knockdown of EGR1 in MCF7 cells (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2.A</xref>) completely abolished the ability of TBX2 to repress the -959/+30 reporter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), accompanied by upregulation of CST6 mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). However, we could not definitively show exactly which EGR1 site was responsible since SDM of the four most conserved EGR1 sites did not completely abolish TBX2-mediated repression (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2.B</xref>). We were, however, able to localize both TBX2 and EGR1 to the CST6 proximal promoter by ChIP assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), with a region immediately upstream of the proximal promoter (-1150/-933) serving as an internal negative control. We could also show the requirement for EGR1 in this repression mechanism as siRNA knockdown of EGR1 (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2.C</xref>) resulted in a total loss of TBX2 recruitment to the CST6 promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). Together these data show that TBX2 represses CST6 through a proximal promoter region through an EGR1-dependent mechanism.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>TBX2 represses CST6 through an EGR1-dependent mechanism</title><p>(A) Luciferase reporter assay of U2OS cells transiently transfected with an empty luciferase vector (pGL3-basic), a CST6 promoter construct (-959/+30), or -959/+30 with two putative TBX2 binding site mutations (-857 and -172, respectively) and co-transfected with an empty expression vector (pDEST) or a TBX2 expression construct (TBX2).

We wanted to assess the contribution of CST6 re-expression to this cell-killing phenotype. Exogenous expression of CST6 resulted in dramatic cell death in TBX2-expressing cells with non-tumorigenic cells totally unaffected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, viability decreased by up to 90%, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The most dramatic cell kill effect was observed in the OCUB-M cell line. This cell line expresses mutant p53 and is ER&#x003b1; negative. In our initial screen of breast cancer cells we found the OCUB-M cells to be amongst those having an aberrant overexpression of TBX2. Even though these cells do not appear to have TBX2 levels comparable with MCF7 cells [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], they appear to be clearly addicted to the expression of TBX2 to a far greater extent, displaying a more dramatic cell killing phenotype following CST6 expression. We noted that CST6-induced cell growth inhibition was due to apoptosis since exogenous expression resulted in PARP cleavage of MCF7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) and caspase-3 cleavage of T47D could be detected as early as 24 hours post transfection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). CST6 is known to be localized to lysosomes but we observed no loss of lysosomal integrity on specific lysosomal staining following CST6 overexpression in MCF7 cells (using LysoTracker Red DND-99 dye, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>, with a matched western blot shown in Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3.A</xref>) Autophagy is known to act as a prelude to apoptosis following specific stimuli [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], characterized by the accumulation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-phosphatidylethanolamine (LC3BII), a protein associated with the autophagosome membrane. The amount of LC3BII increased significantly upon CST6 overexpression in MCF7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>) indicative of the presence of autophagy. We therefore conclude that CST6 induces an autophagy related series of events culminating in the apoptosis of breast cancer cells.</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>CST6 induces apoptosis in a cancer-specific manner</title><p>(A) Crystal violet staining of MCF7, T47D, OCUB-M, MCF10A and HME1 cells transfected with either empty vector (EV) or the CST6 expression construct (CST6).

Exogenous expression of FLAG-tagged wild-type CST6 (and a cathepsin inhibitory-defective point mutant (CST6-W135A) both resulted in significant apoptosis whilst the LGMN inhibitory-defective mutant (CST6-N64A) showed a complete loss of cell killing activity in both MCF-7 and T47D cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A and 4D</xref>, respectively) quantified as approximately 80% and 60% (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B and 4E</xref>). Western blotting confirmed that all three constructs showed equivalent expression (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C and 4F</xref>). LGMN activity assays in MCF-7 cells showed that while WT and CST6-W135A effectively inhibited LGMN activity, EV and the CST6-N64A mutant did not (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>). In contrast, the effect on Cathepsin B inhibition was weaker but the W135A mutant showed a clear reduction in Cathepsin B inhibition as expected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4H</xref>). Cathepsins (notably cathepsin B) have well described roles in proliferation and metastases. However, when we used the pan-cathepsin inhibitor, E-64-d, in the TBX2-expressing cell lines MCF7 and T47D we observed that complete inhibition of cathepsin activity did not result in any obvious growth difference or apoptosis (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4.A</xref>, quantified relative to control in S4.B), whilst a cathepsin B-specific assay showed that 10mM E-64-d resulted in complete inhibition of cathepsin B activity (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4.C</xref>). To specifically target cathepsin B an siRNA approach produced approximately a 90% knockdown (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4.D</xref>) but no corresponding cell growth inhibition (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S4.E and S4.F</xref>) despite a corresponding 90% reduction in enzyme activity (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4.G</xref>). In fact cathepsin B knockdown actually resulted in the increased growth of MCF-7 cells, possibly reflecting the fact that it also plays a role in apoptosis via the Tumor Necrosis Factor &#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;) pathway.</p><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>CST6 induces apoptosis through inhibition of asparaginyl endopeptidase activity</title><p>(A) Crystal violet staining of MCF7 cells transfected with empty vector (EV) or WT-FLAG-tagged CST6 (CST6 WT) or FLAG-tagged mutants CST6-N64A and CST6-W135A.

Following transfection of MCF7 cells with a FLAG-tagged CST6 we were able to detect two prominent forms of CST6 from cell media (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Whilst we could clearly visualize CST6 by immunofluroescence (IF) in directly transfected cells, we could not detect CST6 re-entry into na&#x000ef;ve cells, even by incubating cells overnight with concentrated media (as shown by Western blotting, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, or by IF, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). There was also no evidence of cell killing observed following incubation with CST6-containing concentrated media (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S5.A, S5.B and S5.C</xref>). We generated an N-terminal deletion mutant of CST6 lacking the signal peptide (CST6 del 1-28) which we could show was not secreted into media (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>) but was fully functional in cell killing (Figures 6D and E) indicating that CST6 secretion was not required for apoptosis. A LGMN activity assay of the lysate showed that CST6 del1-28 lost partial ability to inhibit CST6 but was still be to kill cells efficiently (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>). Several Cystatins (such as Cystatin F) are known to be glycosylated, an event which facilitates their entry into neighboring cells [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, a FLAG-tagged CST6 mutant N137A was equally expressed alongside wild-type CST6 in transfected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6G</xref>), equally proficient in killing expressing cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6H and 6I</xref>) and retained full inhibitory activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6J</xref>). Together these data show that CST6 does not require secretion, cellular re-entry or glycosylation for the induction of apoptosis.</p><fig id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>CST6 does not require secretion or glycosylation to inhibit LGMN activity</title><p>(A) Western blot showing expression of FLAG-CST6 in MCF7 cells transfected with empty vector (EV) and or CST6 expression vector (lanes 1 and 2), concentrated media (lanes 3 and 4) and naive cells treated with a 1:2 dilution of EV and CST6 concentrated conditioned media (lanes 5 and 6), and a 1:4 dilution of EV and CST6 (lanes 7 and 8).

In agreement with the cell line data we noted that CST6 expression inversely correlated with TBX2 expression (<inline-graphic xlink:href="oncotarget-05-1609-i001.jpg"/>-0.365,p-value =0.005). We observed that tumors expressing TBX2 showed an increased tendency towards metastasis while CST6 expressing tumors showed a trend towards a decrease in metastatic potential. In small subset of five TBX2-expressing tumors where chemoresponse data was available, we observed a modest trend towards chemoresistance. We also compared our data with the larger publically available datasets from <italic>The Cancer Genome Atlas</italic> (<italic>TCGA</italic>). In line with previous findings, CGH studies showed that TBX2 appeared to be amplified in approximately 10% of breast cancers. Microarray and RNAseq studies showed a consequent upregulation of TBX2 mRNA in these tumors (dataset from [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and a provisional dataset currently in press, Nature). CST6 expression, if altered, was generally downregulated observed in about 5% of the tumors in both datasets. Tumors with altered TBX2 and CST6 expression also showed very poor overall survival by microarray studies (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">figure S6.A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study we show for the first time that the putative breast tumor suppressor gene CST6 is consistently repressed by the oncogenic transcription factor TBX2 through a mechanism involving EGR1. Exogenous expression of wild-type CST6 in TBX2 expressing breast cancer cells resulted in significant apoptosis whilst non-tumorigenic breast cells remain unaffected. We show through a number of alternative approaches (siRNA knockdowns, pan-cathepsin inhibition and SDM) that CST6-induced apoptosis is due to its ability to specifically inhibit the AEP protease LGMN and not cathepsin-type proteases. Accordingly, LGMN activity assays confirmed that the observed CST6 growth effects were consistent with specific inhibition of LGMN. Whilst both LGMN and CST6 are known to be secreted proteins, neither the secretion nor glycosylation of CST6 was required for its cell killing function. We conclude that through its ability to counteract LGMN activity, CST6 represents an important barrier to breast tumorigenesis, a function which is abrogated by TBX2 transcriptional repression. These findings have obvious implications for breast tumorigenesis and highlight potential therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of TBX2 overexpressing or CST6-deificient breast cancers.</p><p>Aberrant TBX2 expression is likely to be just one of many pathways leading to loss of CST6 in cancers. CST6 loss in breast cancers has been shown to be associated with loss of both ER&#x003b1; and the progesterone receptor [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. One of the mechanisms of CST6 downregulation is promoter methylation which was shown to be strongly associated with poor prognosis in operable breast cancers [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Indeed CST6 was amongst the 10 most hypermethylated genes in comparisons between breast cancers and matched normal breast tissues [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The mechanism responsible for CST6 promoter methylation is still unknown but it has been reported to be associated with aberrant AKT1 activation and disablement of the negative AKT regulator INPP4B in breast epithelial cells [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It has also been shown that hypermethylator breast cell lines which overexpress total DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity (and in particular DNMT3b) had significantly reduced levels of a number of genes including CST6 [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Whilst there is no evidence for TBX2 recruitment of DNMTs to target promoters, the C-terminal region of TBX2 has been shown to coimmunoprecipitate with HDAC1 in mouse melanoma cells to target repression of the key cell cycle inhibitor p21<sup>WAF1</sup> [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. TBX2 is also known to interact with histone H3 and to colocalize with regions of pericentric heterochromatin [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We hypothesize that TBX2 acts to target EGR1-responsive genes to facilitate histone methylation and deacetylation and to enforce a non-permissive heterochromatin microenvironment around promoters such as CST6.</p><p>LGMN expression is known to correlate with a lower rate of apoptosis, and increased metastasis and tumor invasion [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Whilst it correlates with poor prognosis in multiple tumor types [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], the role of LGMN in promoting tumorigenesis remains a mystery. One downstream pathway which may be involved is the Matrix Metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) pathway. LGMN is known to cleave pro-MMP2 leading to its activation, even in the presence of its natural inhibitor TIMP-2 [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. LGMN has been shown to colocalize with integrins, at the cell surface &#x02018;invadopodia&#x02019; of invading cells where it participates in the cleavage and activation of MMP2 to help drive invasion and metastasis [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We propose that the loss of CST6 expression observed in breast and many other solid tumor types would lead to elevated LGMN activities, elevated MMP2 signaling and enhanced proliferation, invasion and metastasis, reflecting the poor prognosis of LGMN expressing tumors.</p><p>Whilst the hallmarks of cancer are multifactorial, there are numerous examples demonstrating how aberrations in key oncogenes are clear driver events in cancer pathogenesis. Activation of other oncogenes may be rate-limiting events responsible for specific phases of cancer development such as initial transformation events whilst later events such as the progression or maintenance of tumor viability may require completely different oncogenic mechanisms [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Additionally, tumor cells may also be addicted to particular biological processes such as oncogenic Ras-mediated transformation and tumor growth being dependent on autophagy [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. From a breast cancer perspective, a prime example of how to effectively target oncogene addiction is demonstrated by the success of trastuzumab treatment of HER2 positive breast cancers. The apparent &#x02018;addiction&#x02019; to LGMN for cell survival that we have observed in breast cancer cell lines and the high activity of LGMN previously reported across a range of cancer types has made targeting this enzyme an attractive prospect for the development of novel inhibitors. Potent and selective LGMN inhibitors of <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> and pig kidney LGMN have previously been developed [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Cell permeable, potent inhibitors have also been designed against recombinant mouse LGMN [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. There have been a number of alternative therapeutic strategies developed to exploit the hyperactivity of LGMN in different tumor types. For example, elevated tumor LGMN activity has recently been used as the basis for developing LGMN-cleavage strategies to activate Auristatin prodrugs [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], in addition to more conventional chemotherapeutic agents such as etoposide [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] or doxorubicin [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The doxorubicin prodrug completely arrested the growth of a variety of neoplasms, including multidrug-resistant tumors <italic>in vivo</italic> and significantly extended survival without evidence of myelosuppression or cardiac toxicity [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In addition liposomal nanoparticles encapsulating doxorubicin coupled to a LGMN inhibitor showed high potency, good stability and little cross reactivity with other cysteine proteases [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The prevalence of CST6 loss and LGMN hyperactivation across many tumor types therefore represents an exciting opportunity for the development of novel targeted therapies.</p><p>In summary, we have identified a novel pathway regulated by the breast cancer oncogene TBX2. We show for the first time that TBX2 mediated transcriptional repression of CST6 is an important event for maintaining the tumorigenesis of a subset of breast cancers, through aberrant activation of the protease LGMN. These findings provide an opportunity for the development of specific targeted treatment for multiple tumor types, linking an imbalance of Oncogene-Tumor Suppressor expression (TBX2-CST6) with a defined enzymatic hyperactivity (LGMN). We suggest that the development of cell permeable LGMN inhibitors may be an important advance in the clinical management of poor prognosis breast cancers and multiple other tumor types.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Maintenance of cell lines:</title><p>Full details of the maintenance of the MCF7, T47D, BT474, U2OS and MCF7-DN cells are provided in [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].
