These have been identified in a wide variety of tissues and cell types from many eukaryotes, and are now known to be mostly circular, cytoplasmic, and non-coding. Although there is no uniformly ascribed function, several have been shown to be involved in gene regulation. Accurate identification of these transcripts can, however, be difficult due to artefacts from a wide variety of sources.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here, we present a computational method, PTESFinder, to identify these transcripts from high throughput RNAseq data. Uniquely, it systematically excludes potential artefacts emanating from pseudogenes, segmental duplications, and template switching, and outputs both PTES and canonical exon junction counts to facilitate comparative analyses. In comparison with four existing methods, PTESFinder achieves highest specificity and comparable sensitivity at a variety of read depths. PTESFinder also identifies between 13&#x000a0;% and 41.6&#x000a0;% more structures, compared to publicly available methods recently used to identify human circular RNAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>With high sensitivity and specificity, user-adjustable filters that target known sources of false positives, and tailored output to facilitate comparison of transcript levels, PTESFinder will facilitate the discovery and analysis of these poorly understood transcripts.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12859-016-0881-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>RNAseq</kwd><kwd>circRNA</kwd><kwd>PTES</kwd><kwd>Splicing</kwd><kwd>mRNA processing</kwd><kwd>Software</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (GB)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/J014516/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Izuogu</surname><given-names>Osagie G.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000275</institution-id><institution>Leverhulme Trust (GB)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RPG-2012-795</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jackson</surname><given-names>Michael S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust (GB)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT089225MA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elliot</surname><given-names>David J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Recently, there has been an increased interest in a novel class of transcripts where the exon order differs from that found in the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Once considered cloning artefacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] or products of aberrant splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], it is now established that the majority of these molecules represent circular RNA species (circRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], although some linear transcripts have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thousands of these novel transcripts have now been identified in a variety of eukaryotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], many are conserved across species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], suggesting functional relevance, and two (from <italic>CDR1</italic> and <italic>SRY</italic>) have been shown to harbour numerous miRNA binding sites and act as miRNA sponges to modulate gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Recent reports also implicate circRNAs in synaptic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and some have expression patterns that correlate with diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and may act as biomarkers for ageing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Despite these reports, the function of the vast majority of these transcripts has not been established.</p><p>The defining feature of these transcripts at the sequence level is the presence of a splice junction with exons in an order inconsistent with their position in the genome. As this feature alone does not enable inference of structure or mechanistic origins, we use the term Post-Transcriptional Exon Shuffled (PTES) transcripts to collectively describe this population of RNA molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Recent reports have shown that the vast majority of these transcripts emanate from known genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], utilise known splice junctions, and that their biogenesis competes with splicing of canonical transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Transcripts arising from PTES specifically exclude chimeric RNAs without known splice junctions, and a class of circular RNAs comprised of spliced introns, ciRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Many computational methods for identifying chimeric RNA molecules from high-throughput RNA sequence data have been described. The majority of these are designed to detect heterotypic trans-splicing and fused genes, so are not suitable for PTES detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], or require post processing steps to analyse reads supporting different types of splicing events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Recently, however, a number of programs for PTES discovery have been described and used primarily for circRNA characterisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Most analyse reads which fail to fully align to a reference sequence, and split these into two or more segments which are then independently aligned to define rearrangements. Some make use of gene annotation to guide discovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], while others adopt an unbiased genome-wide approach to capture structures which do not utilise known splice junctions or are non-genic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In addition, the occurrence of PTES can be inferred when two paired end reads map to the transcriptome in a configuration that is not consistent with a linear transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>The identification of PTES exon junctions within RNAseq data is, however, confounded by known artefacts. False positives can arise from template switching during cDNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], from genes with duplicated exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], from transcription read-through between genes in close proximity due to weak termination signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and from closely related genes within duplicons or tandem arrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although experimental enrichment has been combined with informatic approaches to define bona-fide circRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], many classes of false positive structures are not directly excluded by existing identification methods. For example, reads defining 7 of the 20 most abundant human circRNAs reported by Memczak <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] map with high sequence identity to the reference sequence and include 4 which are indistinguishable from linear RefSeq entries (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Furthermore, a recent experimental analysis of previously identified PTES trancripts concluded that many are template switching artefacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and template switching predominantly leads to rearragements where the breaks do not occur at splice junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Examples of Intragenic False Positives. Schematic diagrams showing inferred structure and key sequence relationships for 4 of the 20 most abundant circRNAs reported in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In each case, the inferred structure shares 100&#x000a0;% identity to a linear transcript spanning the defining exon-exon junction.

It then applies a series of mapping and alignment filters to systematically remove known classes of false positives. It does not make use of paired end (PE) mapping information as the lack of intervening sequence precludes such filtering and may affect specificity. We first describe the implementation of this method, and then investigate the effects of different filtering criteria. The program requires certain user adjustable parameters; we therefore also explore systematically the choice of these parameters. Finally, through analysis of real and simulated data, we compare PTESFinder to other publicly available methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] which have been used to identify circRNA transcripts in both cell lines and tissues.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Implementation</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Pipeline for PTES discovery</title><p>PTESFinder requires as input files: RNAseq data in FASTQ format [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], genomic reference in FASTA format, and an annotated transcriptome reference in BED format [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The pipeline is split into three phases (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>): A discovery phase to identify putative PTES structures within RNAseq data and define PTES transcript models, an evaluation phase to assess these PTES models, and a filtering phase to exclude potential false positives.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Overview of PTES Discovery Pipeline. The workflow includes three major phases: Discovery phase, Evaluation phase and Filtering phase. Putative PTES structures discovered using 20&#x000a0;bp anchor reads are evaluated by aligning full FASTQ reads to the models. The filtering phase includes stringent criteria designed to systematically exclude all known classes of false positive structures</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12859_2016_881_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Discovery phase</title><p>Short sequences from both ends of each FASTQ read (anchors, default length: 20&#x000a0;bp) are aligned to the transcriptome reference using Bowtie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] with tolerance for a single mismatch. Pairs of anchors from the same read that map to the same gene and in the same orientation, but which map in inverted order with respect to their order in the sequencing read, are then identified. This excludes reads emanating from fused genes and sense-antisense template switching artefacts. Retained anchor pairs are then used to determine the exon junctions which define putative PTES events and create sequence models (constructs) of the inferred products. These constructs are generated by concatenating the last 65&#x000a0;bp of the 5&#x02032; exon and the first 65&#x000a0;bp of the 3&#x02032; exon. The segment size of 65 is used by default, with the full exon sequence used if an exon is smaller than 65&#x000a0;bp. This parameter is adjustable to accommodate various RNAseq read lengths, and we recommend that it be at least 10&#x000a0;bp shorter than the read length to ensure that only reads mapping across PTES defining junctions are processed in subsequent filtering steps (although as described below these filters would eliminate such reads).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Evaluation phase</title><p>All the original reads are then re-mapped to PTES constructs generated in the discovery phase. This serves two purposes. First, as RNAseq reads can be short, this enables reads with putative PTES exon junctions close to their termini to be accurately mapped. Second, it enables read mapping scores obtained using the PTES constructs to be directly compared to scores obtained from genomic and transcriptomic alignments for filtering purposes (see below). Optionally, evaluation can also be &#x02018;guided&#x02019; by supplying constructs of previously discovered PTES structures, effectively bypassing the discovery phase.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Filtering phase</title><p>To eliminate potential false positives originating from the genome under investigation, all the original reads are mapped to both genomic and transcriptomic references. The number of edits required for alignment (NM field in SAM format [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]), and the number of perfectly aligned base pairs, are used to remove reads which align as well or better to either of these reference sequences than to the PTES constructs. To reduce template switching artefacts, which have heterogeneous junction points within short regions of often imperfect sequence homology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], reads which do not align perfectly to the exon junctions which define PTES are also removed using junctional filters. First, a user adjustable minimum junction span (JSpan) parameter is applied to ensure that there are no mismatches or indels within &#x02018;n&#x02019; nucleotides either side of the junction position, where n is an even integer. Second, to eliminate reads with regions of low quality alignment, a user adjustable segment percent identity (PID) parameter is also applied independently to the segments on either side of the PTES junction, such that for a read to be retained both must meet or exceed the specified PID when aligned to the PTES construct. These user adjustable filters rely on alignment summaries provided by the NM field, MD field and Cigar in the SAM files [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The output includes the coordinates of the exon end involved in the junctions, a descriptor of the PTES (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for details) and the number of reads supporting the structure. This is presented in BED format [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. A second file contains additional information, read counts of all canonical exon junctions from transcripts where a PTES structure has been identified, to facilitate comparison with PTES counts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Assessment of pipeline and comparisons to other methods</title><p>RNAseq data from Jeck <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] were analysed at various combinations of JSpan and PID (JSpan range: 4&#x02013;14; PID range: 60&#x02013;100&#x000a0;%). All analyses were performed with and without genomic and transcriptomic filters applied to enable reads discarded by each filtering criterion to be identified. The numbers of PTES structures identified and supporting reads were also recorded. To assess sensitivity and specificity, simulated datasets were generated using all published PTES structures within circbase.org [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. For each dataset, 5000 PTES junctions were randomly selected along with 5000 canonical junctions, and constructs were generated for each junction by concatenating the full sequence of both exons involved in each case. 100&#x000a0;bp simulated reads with random start positions within each construct were then generated.

For each simulation, transcripts correctly identified by each method were determined by comparing genomic coordinates of identified transcripts with the genomic coordinates of transcripts expected to be recovered from within each dataset. The numbers of correctly identified PTES transcripts (true positives &#x02013; TP), incorrectly identified PTES transcripts (false positives &#x02013; FP), PTES transcripts incorrectly excluded (false negatives &#x02013; FN), and canonical junctions correctly excluded (true negatives &#x02013; TN), were used to estimate sensitivity: TP / (TP&#x02009;+&#x02009;FN), specificity: TN / (TN&#x02009;+&#x02009;FP), and false discovery rate (FDR): FP / (TP&#x02009;+&#x02009;FP).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>PTESFinder uses established RNAseq tools (Bowtie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], Bowtie2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and Bedtools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]) to identify putative PTES structures, and then systematically excludes known classes of false positive structures by applying genomic, transcriptomic and junctional (JSpan &#x00026; PID) filters (see methods).

Upon manual analysis, most of the excluded reads with NM&#x02009;=&#x02009;16 were found to support a false positive structure from 5.8&#x000a0;s rRNA (NR_003285.1.1). Comparable rRNA derived structures have been identified previously and filtered manually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, reads supporting this structure have been removed to show the underlying distribution of mapping quality scores.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Reads excluded by specific filters have different origins</title><p>To investigate the activity of specific filters further, the mapping co-ordinates of reads removed by the genomic filter were first compared to the co-ordinates of annotated pseudogenes and segmental duplications. This established that ~74&#x000a0;% of reads excluded by the genomic filter had superior alignments to segmental duplications, and ~12&#x000a0;% had superior alignments to pseudogenes. The 417 reads identified by the genomic filter but not by the transcriptomic filter were also found to be enriched for reads derived from segmental duplications and pseudogenes (e.g. Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S1A).</p><p>We next used BLAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] to manually investigate the 228 reads excluded specifically by the transcriptome filter which mapped perfectly to putative PTES constructs (NM&#x02009;=&#x02009;0, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). These support 7 putative PTES structures from 4 genes (Inset, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). However, BLAT analysis established that they all also mapped contiguously with ~100&#x000a0;% identity to the transcriptome due to high sequence identity between neighbouring exons. For example, 126 reads which support a putative single exon PTES structure (exon 10 of <italic>HNRNPH1</italic> circularized) map with ~100&#x000a0;% identity to exons 10 and 11 of the canonical <italic>HNRNPH1</italic> transcript (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S1B) due to high sequence identity between these neighbouring exons. As a result, these reads cannot be taken as supporting evidence for PTES. It is noteworthy that such structures will pass any qualitative filter criterion requiring only unambiguous mapping to PTES constructs, illustrating the value of the transcriptome filter.</p><p>Finally, manual analysis of a subset of the 7036 reads identified only by the junctional filters established that these support structures with distinct patterns of suboptimal mapping, such as low alignment quality specific to only one of the two exons in the structure (e.g. Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S1C top 2 panels), and low sequence identity specifically at the junction (e.g. Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S1C lower 2 panels), the latter being consistent with the expected pattern of alignment for template switching artefacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>As one further assessment of the filters, we analysed RNAseq data derived from fibroblast RNA which had been pre-digested with RNase R. This selectively removes linear RNAs, and enriches for circRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], and has been shown to significanty increase the recovery of PTES reads. However, we would anticipate that this would also selectively remove false positives derived from pseudogenes and segmental duplications which mimic PTES structures, without necessarily reducing reverse transcription artefacts such as template switching. Only ~12&#x000a0;% of reads from the RNAseR digested sample which map to PTES sequence constructs are identified by the genomic and transcriptomic filters (Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1), compared to 69&#x000a0;% in the undigested sample. Furthermore, only 17&#x000a0;% of these map to segmental duplications, compared to 74&#x000a0;% in the undigested sample. In contrast, the proportion of reads excluded by the junctional filters is considerably higher after RNAseR digestion, consistent with expectation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>PID Has greater impact than JSpan</title><p>To investigate the impact of varying the user defined JSpan and PID parameters which comprise the junctional filter, the same data was re-analysed using 54 different combinations of these parameters, both with and without the genomic and transcriptome filters applied (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). This established that varying the PID has a greater impact than varying the JSpan, with 5691 reads filtered with maximal PID (100&#x000a0;%) and lowest JSpan (4) compared to only 1235 reads filtered with the maximal JSpan (14) at lowest PID (60&#x000a0;%). Furthermore, varying the PID between 60&#x000a0;% and 75&#x000a0;% has little impact at any JSpan value, but above 75&#x000a0;% there is a linear relationship with the number of reads filtered. As the default junctional filter parameters failed to identify some reads excluded by the other filters (110 and 1421, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), this analysis was repeated using only these reads to establish the JSpan and PID parameters required to identify them. Over 99&#x000a0;% of these reads are excluded with the most stringent junctional filter parameters (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Furthermore, the vast majority are filtered with a PID of 85&#x000a0;%, suggesting this is a logical setting for this parameter. The JSpan setting only has a major impact at low PIDs (60&#x02013;75&#x000a0;%).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Effect of varying junctional filter parameters. <bold>a</bold> Number of reads passing filter at different combinations of JSpan and PID. <bold>b</bold> Percentage of reads only excluded by transcriptome and genomic filters at default settings, which are filtered at different combinations of JSpan and PID</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12859_2016_881_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Specificity, sensitivity and comparison with other methods</title><p>To assess the sensitivity and specificity of the pipeline and compare it to other methods, simulated reads were generated from previously identified PTES and associated canonical transcripts, and analysed at various read depths of coverage using default parameters. In addition to assessing PTESFinder for <italic>de novo</italic> PTES discovery, the use of constructs of previously reported structures for guided discovery was also assessed (see methods), as were four publicly available methods which have previously been employed to identify circRNA transcripts: MapSplice v 2.1.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] used in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], CIRI v. 1.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], circRNA_finder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and the method used by Memczak <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Results from 100 simulated datasets are presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a-c</xref>, and illustrate that sensitivity varies considerably with coverage, and between methods. At read coverage of 2, the sensitivity of PTESFinder is below 0.6. This can be attributed to PTES junctions occurring within the terminal 20&#x000a0;bp of reads, as the low tolerance for mismatches during anchor mapping will result in their elimination. However, sensitivity reaches &#x0003e;90&#x000a0;% at coverage of 10 or higher for both guided and unguided analyses, with guided PTESFinder being equally or more sensitive than all other methods at all read depths. Strikingly, the sensitivity of MapSplice is low, remaining below 0.5 at all read depths. In contrast, specificity is over 0.97 for all methods at all read depths (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>), although PTESFinder achieves the highest specificities averaged across all depths (over 0.999) for both <italic>de novo</italic> and guided PTES discovery, with all canonical junction reads being correctly identified as such within the simulated data.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] using all 5 methods (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). To allow direct comparison to PTESFinder, the number of putative circRNA structures identified which utilise 2 RefSeq splice sites was recorded for all other methods (bracketed), as the total numbers include structures from intergenic and intronic regions of the genome. For all 4 samples analysed, CIRI consumed &#x0003e;90Gb of memory, resulting in incomplete analyses. It was therefore not analysed further. Of the remaining 4 methods, PTESFinder identified on average 15&#x000a0;% more structures than the Memczak method and ~70&#x000a0;% more than MapSplice. The latter is consistent with our finding that MapSplice, which was used in their analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], has low sensitivity at all depths of sequence coverage (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). However, circRNA_finder reported the highest number of putative circRNA transcripts from both exonic and non-exonic regions of the genome, reporting approximately 31&#x02013;42&#x000a0;% more structures with RefSeq co-ordinates than PTESfinder (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>&#x000a0;Number of PTES transcripts identified from Human Fibroblast samples using four methods</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Method</th><th/><th>SRR444974</th><th>SRR445016</th><th>SRR444975</th><th>SRR444655</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Memczak<sup>a</sup>

Of 9287 reads re-analysed, approximately 20&#x000a0;% (1840) are defined as mutilocus or sense-antisense fusions, and a further 19&#x000a0;% (1775) are eliminated by the junctional, genomic, and transcriptomic filters indicating likely false positives (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). The remaining 61&#x000a0;% (5672) are not aligned, indicating that their anchors map suboptimally to RefSeq. Furthermore, plotting the distribution of the number of reads supporting each structure identified by circRNA_finder only, by PTESFinder only, and by both methods (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>), revealed that the vast majority of structures identified by circRNA_finder alone are supported by a single read. This is in sharp contrast to structures identified by both methods, or by PTESFinder alone. While these single-read structures may include <italic>bona fide</italic> low frequency circRNAs, they are also likely to contain false positives caused by suboptimal mapping, consistent with the lower specificity of circRNA_finder with our simulated data.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Comparisons with real RNAseq data &#x00026; published results. <bold>a</bold> Approximately 64&#x000a0;% (4675) of PTES transcripts utilising 2 RefSeq (known) splice sites were identified by both circRNA_finder and PTESFinder from SRR444975 (<bold>b</bold>) Read exclusion criteria for PTES transcripts identified by circRNA_finder only, when analysed by PTESFinder (<bold>c</bold>) Distribution of read numbers supporting PTES transcripts identified by circRNA_finder only, by PTESFinder only, and by both (raw counts reported by PTESFinder shown) (<bold>d</bold>) PTESFinder identified over 50&#x000a0;% (1052) of transcripts reported in Memczak <italic>et al</italic>.

These were, however, achieved at higher computing memory cost (~30GB).</p><p>We then used PTESFinder to analyse RNAseq reads previously mined in two further studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Consistent with the above, it identified 13&#x000a0;% more distinct structures from leukocyte and HEK293 data than were reported by Memczak <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] (2217 as opposed to 1950 Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>), and 41.6&#x000a0;% more structures than reported by Salzman <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] from leukocyte data (1875 as opposed to 1324, (data not shown)). As both structures and supporting reads were reported by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], it was possible to re-analyse the 898 structures identified exclusively by their method using PTESFinder. This established that none correspond to structures which PTESFinder is designed to identify (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>): 503 (56&#x000a0;%) are derived from intronic, and intergenic regions, and of the 1420 reads supporting the remaining 395 genic structures, 492 were excluded by PTESFinder due to low map quality (200) or multiple map locations (292), 89 reads were excluded by PTESFinder filters, and the remaining 839 possessed at least 1 exon boundary which did not map to known splice junctions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>). Again, while some of these latter reads will undoubtedly correspond to <italic>bona fide</italic> PTES structures (as a number of genic PTES utilising non-Refseq splice sites have been confirmed experimentally (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]), further BLAT analysis established that 13 mapped in a linear fashion to 6 annotated pseudogenes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S2).</p><p>Approaches to PTES discovery involve a compromise between the ability to detect all potentially rearranged transcripts, and the ability to identify artefacts generated as a result of the sequence and structural complexity of eukaryotic genomes, and of current library construction methods. It is now clear that the majority of transcripts with re-arranged exon order utilize known exon junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] which are processed by the spliceosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. As a result, methods which utilise existing transcript annotation from the genome under study, such as PTESFinder and those employed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], benefit from the reduced noise inherent in this approach and are suited to quantitative analyses of PTES structures that can be characterized using existing annotations.</p><p>The use of known/experimentally verified splice sites does reduce the misidentification of template switching artefacts or unspliced pseudogenes as bona fide PTES transcripts. However, it does mean that not all rearranged transcripts will be identified. Although a recent analysis of human data unconstrained by existing annotation suggests that circRNAs which function as miRNA sponges are rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], discovery of transcripts which do not utilise known splice sites (including any which are not processed by the spliceosome) requires a genome-wide approach unconstrained by existing annotations. Such approaches are, however, inherently more susceptible to artefacts. The analyses presented above illustrate both the problem of false positive structures, the trade off between sensitivity and specificity in all methods designed to identify rearranged transcripts, and the utility of multiple filters designed to target distinct populations of known artefacts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A major challenge in PTES identification is to discriminate between bona fide PTES structures and a wide variety of false positives with distinct origins. Currently, no method which has been used for PTES discovery explicitly excludes all known classes of false positive reads. To that end, we have developed PTESFinder to identify both linear and circular PTES transcripts from high throughput RNAseq data. Compared to publicly available methods recently used in circRNA discovery, PTESFinder achieves higher specificity and sensitivity, and generates output tailored for downstream comparative analyses of transcript abundance, making it an appropriate tool to investigate these RNAs within complex mammalian genomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Availability and requirements</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><bold>Project name:</bold> PTESFinder</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Project home page:</bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ptesfinder-v1.sourceforge.net/">http://ptesfinder-v1.sourceforge.net/</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Operating system(s):</bold> Linux</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Programming language:</bold> Shell, Java 1.6</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Other requirements:</bold> Bowtie 1.1.1 &#x00026; 2.2.4, BedTools 2.22.0</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>License:</bold> OSI-Approved Open Source (Artistic License 2.0)</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Any restrictions to use by non-academics:</bold> None</p></list-item></list></p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec15"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12859_2016_881_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
