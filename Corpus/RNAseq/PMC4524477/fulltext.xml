Large-scale gene duplication events and subsequent paralog divergence are thought to be required for generating evolutionary novelty. Such an event has been proposed for spiders, but not tested. We de novo assembled transcriptomes from three cobweb weaving spider species. Based on phylogenetic analyses of gene families with representatives from each of the three species, we found numerous duplication events indicative of a whole genome or segmental duplication. We estimated the age of the gene duplications relative to several speciation events within spiders and arachnids and found that the duplications likely occurred after the divergence of scorpions (order Scorpionida) and spiders (order Araneae), but before the divergence of the spider suborders Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae, near the evolutionary origin of spider silk glands. Transcripts that are expressed exclusively or primarily within black widow silk glands are more likely to have a paralog descended from the ancient duplication event and have elevated amino acid replacement rates compared with other transcripts. Thus, an ancient large-scale gene duplication event within the spider lineage was likely an important source of molecular novelty during the evolution of silk gland-specific expression. This duplication event may have provided genetic material for subsequent silk gland diversification in the true spiders (Araneomorphae).</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Theridiidae</kwd><kwd><italic>Latrodectus</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Steatoda</italic></kwd><kwd>expression</kwd><kwd>patterns of selection</kwd><kwd>neofunctionalization</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Evolutionary novelty at the molecular level is often attributed to gene duplication events followed by divergent molecular evolution, allowing one of the gene copies (paralog) to gain a different function (<xref rid="evv110-B49" ref-type="bibr">Ohno 1970</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B39" ref-type="bibr">Kaessmann 2010</xref>). Genome-wide studies of paralog pairs demonstrate that genetic innovation arises through changes in protein structure and gene regulation (e.g., <xref rid="evv110-B41" ref-type="bibr">Kassahn et al. 2009</xref>). Duplicated gene pairs are implicated in the evolution of new phenotypes in numerous taxa (<xref rid="evv110-B13" ref-type="bibr">Braasch et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B56" ref-type="bibr">Sato et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B16" ref-type="bibr">Chapman et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B33" ref-type="bibr">Hoffmann et al. 2012</xref>). Large-scale duplication events, such as whole-genome duplications, generate vast quantities of paralog pairs that could evolve new functions (<xref rid="evv110-B49" ref-type="bibr">Ohno 1970</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B40" ref-type="bibr">Kasahara 2007</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B41" ref-type="bibr">Kassahn et al. 2009</xref>). These events, while most commonly studied in plants (e.g., <xref rid="evv110-B67" ref-type="bibr">Vision et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B38" ref-type="bibr">Jiao et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B2" ref-type="bibr">Albert et al. 2013</xref>), are also found throughout the eukaryote phylogeny as revealed by whole-genome sequencing projects (<xref rid="evv110-B44" ref-type="bibr">Langham et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B40" ref-type="bibr">Kasahara 2007</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B59" ref-type="bibr">S&#x000e9;mon and Wolfe 2008</xref>), and may be vital for the evolution of a novel tissue (e.g., <xref rid="evv110-B40" ref-type="bibr">Kasahara 2007</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B61" ref-type="bibr">Soltis et al. 2007</xref>).</p><p>Spiders (order Araneae) represent an excellent test case for examining the role of duplicated genes in the evolution of novel tissue-specific functions implicated in adaptation and species radiation. The common ancestor of spiders evolved specialized abdominal glands for the production of silk approximately 400 Ma (<xref rid="evv110-B58" ref-type="bibr">Selden et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B24" ref-type="bibr">Foelix 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B62" ref-type="bibr">Starrett et al. 2012</xref>). Following this innovation, spiders diversified into over 44,000 described species that are important predators in almost all terrestrial ecosystems (<xref rid="evv110-B24" ref-type="bibr">Foelix 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B51" ref-type="bibr">Platnick 2014</xref>). Modifications to silk gland morphology, web-architecture, and silk genes within spiders likely contributed to their adaptive success (<xref rid="evv110-B11" ref-type="bibr">Bond and Opell 1998</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B9" ref-type="bibr">Blackledge et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B26" ref-type="bibr">Garb et al. 2010</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with the hypothesis that gene duplication is important for the evolution of functional novelty, the primary protein components of silk fibers are encoded by members of a gene family called spidroins&#x02014;spider fibrous proteins (<xref rid="evv110-B32" ref-type="bibr">Hinman and Lewis 1992</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B31" ref-type="bibr">Guerette et al. 1996</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B28" ref-type="bibr">Gatesy et al. 2001</xref>). The number of spidroin paralogs is positively correlated with the number of functionally distinct silk gland types (<xref rid="evv110-B27" ref-type="bibr">Garb et al. 2007</xref>, <xref rid="evv110-B26" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B62" ref-type="bibr">Starrett et al. 2012</xref>). For instance, members of the suborder Mygalomorphae (tarantulas and their kin) possess undifferentiated spherical-shaped silk glands and only two or three spidroin paralogs (<xref rid="evv110-B27" ref-type="bibr">Garb et al. 2007</xref>, <xref rid="evv110-B26" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B62" ref-type="bibr">Starrett et al. 2012</xref>). In contrast, within the suborder Araneomorphae (so called true spiders), the Araneoidea (a clade of orb web weaving spiders and their kin) possess seven morphologically differentiated silk gland types that each synthesizes a task-specific fiber or glue (<xref rid="evv110-B68" ref-type="bibr">Vollrath and Selden 2007</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B24" ref-type="bibr">Foelix 2010</xref>). One or more unique spidroin paralogs are highly expressed in each of six of these gland types (e.g., <xref rid="evv110-B31" ref-type="bibr">Guerette et al. 1996</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B26" ref-type="bibr">Garb et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B43" ref-type="bibr">Lane et al. 2013</xref>).</p><p>The duplication events underlying the diversification of spidroins and other silk-expressed genes have been difficult to address due to the limited genomic resources available for spiders. Nevertheless, a whole genome or segmental duplication event has been proposed to have occurred within the spider lineage based on the presence of two copies of at least three of the <italic>Hox</italic> genes in the wandering spider, <italic>Cupiennius salei</italic>, but only one in most other arthropods (<xref rid="evv110-B57" ref-type="bibr">Schwager et al. 2007</xref>). More recently, a multitissue transcriptomic analysis of the Western black widow (<italic>Latrodectus hesperus</italic>) greatly expanded the potential number of genes involved in silk production: Over 600 transcripts uniquely or significantly more expressed in silk glands than other tissues were identified, which we refer to as silk-specific transcripts (SSTs) (<xref rid="evv110-B19" ref-type="bibr">Clarke et al. 2014</xref>), many of which appear to be members of gene families.</p><p>Here, we use a comparative transcriptomics approach to examine the role of gene duplications in the evolution of silk gland-specific gene expression. Even though transcriptomes lack information about gene arrangement, which is typical evidence for whole-genome duplications, phylogenetic and molecular distance analyses of thousands of gene families can be used to test for a concentration of duplication events to a specific point in a phylogeny. The presence of multiple paralog pairs of similar age is strong evidence of a large-scale duplication event (e.g., <xref rid="evv110-B70" ref-type="bibr">Wolfe and Shields 1997</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B67" ref-type="bibr">Vision et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B48" ref-type="bibr">McKain et al. 2012</xref>). Transcriptomes de novo assembled from deep RNA-sequencing successfully identified whole-genome duplication events in the Agave lineage (<xref rid="evv110-B48" ref-type="bibr">McKain et al. 2012</xref>), and the raw sequencing reads used in transcriptome assembly provide estimates of tissue-specific transcript abundance.</p><p>We generated multitissue transcriptomes for three closely related cobweb weaving spider species, the Western black widow <italic>L. hesperus</italic>, the brown widow <italic>Latrodectus geometricus</italic>, and the false black widow <italic>Steatoda grossa</italic> (Theridiidae). We chose these species to validate tissue-specific gene expression patterns found in the black widow, but the choice of three close relatives also facilitated analyses of paralogs based on de novo assembled transcriptomes. Specifically, homologous transcripts found in all three species are likely correctly assembled and are likely to encode proteins. In addition, using close relatives permitted high-confidence paralogy assignments as there is less scope for reciprocal gene loss compared with more distantly related species. We then compared our transcriptomes with recently published arachnid genomes or transcriptomes spanning the phylogenetic range in which a large-scale duplication event was expected to occur to determine the relative phylogenetic placement of duplication events occurring in different gene families. We also examined the role of large-scale and/or isolated gene duplication events in the evolution of silk-specific gene expression in spiders. We hypothesize that a duplication event would be more likely to retain both paralogs if at least one is an SST compared with if both are generally expressed, because tissue-specific expression is a typical correlate of paralog retention (<xref rid="evv110-B1" ref-type="bibr">Adams et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B36" ref-type="bibr">Huerta-Cepas et al. 2011</xref>). If true, we further predict that SSTs will have higher rates of amino acid replacements because paralogous gene pairs evolve, on average, under relaxed purifying selection compared with genes without paralogs (as in <xref rid="evv110-B47" ref-type="bibr">Mano and Innan 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B72" ref-type="bibr">Yang and Gaut 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B60" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al. 2013</xref>). We tested these predictions by comparing duplication and sequence evolution patterns between gene families with and without SSTs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>cDNA Libraries and Sequencing</title><p>Adult <italic>L. hesperus</italic> were collected in Riverside (Riverside County, CA) in March 2009, July 2010, and August 2011.

High-quality, nonribosomal RNA reads derived from the same species and tissue were combined and initial transcripts assembled using Trinity with default settings (<xref rid="evv110-B30" ref-type="bibr">Grabherr et al. 2011</xref>). Trinity produces multiple transcripts (usually interpreted as isoforms) that belong to the same component (interpreted as genes). Only the longest transcript for each component was retained for combination of the tissue-specific assemblies to remove potential isoforms. Tissue-specific assemblies were combined into a single draft transcriptome for each species by comparing the Trinity transcripts using BLAT (<xref rid="evv110-B42" ref-type="bibr">Kent 2002</xref>), clustering those that matched each other along the boundaries of each transcript by at least 98% identity over the full length of the match (of at least 50 bp). The 98% identity was chosen as the cutoff to allow for mismatches that might arise through sequencing errors. CAP3 was used to generate contiguous sequences (contigs) for each cluster (<xref rid="evv110-B35" ref-type="bibr">Huang and Madan 1999</xref>).

Second, the BUSCO scripts compare the number of homologous genes in the test transcriptomes with the number of homologous genes that the benchmark species has in the BUSCO data set (further details available at <ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://cegg.unige.ch/OrthoDB7/BUSCO/README.txt">ftp://cegg.unige.ch/OrthoDB7/BUSCO/README.txt</ext-link>, last accessed June 19, 2015).</p></sec><sec><title>Generation of Gene Clusters in <italic>Latrodectus</italic>, <italic>Steatoda</italic>, and Other Arachnids</title><p>We used a multistep approach to cluster genes with three levels of taxonomic inclusion followed by phylogenetic analyses to delineate putative gene families (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="evv110-F2">fig. 2</xref>).

By requiring sequence homology among all three species we had confidence that the transcripts were correctly assembled and were likely protein coding. Even though we required representatives of all three species, we should still capture a high proportion of within species paralogs due to the fact that the three species are closely related and will have been unlikely to have differentially lost a significant number of paralogs.

Silk glands almost certainly evolved in the common ancestor of all spiders approximately 400 Ma (<xref rid="evv110-B58" ref-type="bibr">Selden et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B24" ref-type="bibr">Foelix 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B62" ref-type="bibr">Starrett et al. 2012</xref>).

The median molecular distance (d<italic>S</italic>) of older paralog pairs suggests the duplication event occurred around the same time as the divergence of the spider suborders, Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae, approximately 380 Ma (<xref rid="evv110-B6" ref-type="bibr">Ayoub et al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B62" ref-type="bibr">Starrett et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B71" ref-type="bibr">Wood et al. 2013</xref>). For comparison, the well-studied ancient whole-genome duplication event near the origin of the flower is closer to 160 Ma (<xref rid="evv110-B2" ref-type="bibr">Albert et al. 2013</xref>).

The absence of numerous ancient paralogs within the scorpion, <italic>M. martensii,</italic> genome (<xref rid="evv110-B14" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al. 2013</xref>) supports the placement of the large-scale duplication event either exclusively within the spider lineage or in a subclade of arachnid orders including spiders but not scorpions (<xref rid="evv110-B53" ref-type="bibr">Regier et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B10" ref-type="bibr">Bond et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B23" ref-type="bibr">Fern&#x000e1;ndez et al. 2014</xref>). Because our analysis did not include any Mesothelae representatives we are unable to confidently assign the older duplication event to the common ancestor of all living spiders.</p><p>If the ancient duplication event predates or coincides with the common ancestor of all living spiders, then it could have contributed to the origin of the silk spinning apparatus (e.g., spinnerets, silk glands, and fibers). It has been proposed that large-scale duplication events can have morphological consequences as the presence of four <italic>Hox</italic> clusters in vertebrates, which suggests two polyploidy events at their root, is associated with diversification of the vertebrate body plan (<xref rid="evv110-B49" ref-type="bibr">Ohno 1970</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B34" ref-type="bibr">Holland et al. 1994</xref>). In the wandering spider, <italic>C. salei</italic>, duplicated <italic>Hox</italic> genes (<italic>Ubx</italic> 1 and 2) are both expressed in the abdominal limb buds that will eventually develop into spinnerets (<xref rid="evv110-B57" ref-type="bibr">Schwager et al. 2007</xref>). Both fossil and developmental genetic evidence suggest that spider spinnerets are homologs of abdominal appendages found on the fourth and fifth somites of horseshoe crabs, <italic>Limulus</italic>, which are basal chelicerates (<xref rid="evv110-B58" ref-type="bibr">Selden et al. 2008</xref>). Other arachnids do not develop homologs of these particular abdominal appendages, suggesting that the genes for appendage development were suppressed in the common ancestor of arachnids, but reactivated in spiders for spinneret formation (<xref rid="evv110-B58" ref-type="bibr">Selden et al. 2008</xref>). Reactivation might have been facilitated by a large-scale duplication event that included duplicating the <italic>Hox</italic> genes, allowing the evolution of the silk organs (e.g., spinnerets and possibly glands) and thus silk production in the spiders. If true, we predict that multiple older paralogs are coexpressed in the embryonic spinnerets and silk glands in spiders.</p><p>Even if the ancient duplication event occurred after the origin of the silk glands, it appears that it was instrumental in the evolution of transcripts with silk gland restricted expression. Black widow SSTs (with the exception of the spidroins) were almost exclusively paralogous with generally expressed transcripts, suggesting massive regulatory divergence after the duplication event. Additional functional specialization of SSTs is supported by their consistently higher amino acid replacement rates than other transcripts even when controlling for gene family size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evv110-F7">fig. 7</xref><italic>B</italic>). It is also likely that SSTs are coexpressed or physically interact with spidroins, which can result in correlated evolutionary rates as has been seen for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref rid="evv110-B18" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al. 2012</xref>).

The first outcome suggests that the bimodal distribution of d<italic>S</italic> for our paralog pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evv110-F4">fig. 4</xref>) may derive from multiple independent duplication events with a high rate of paralog retention during a restricted time frame (discussed by <xref rid="evv110-B64" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al. 2003</xref>). However, bimodal distributions of d<italic>S</italic> are almost exclusively associated with large-scale duplication events when complementary syntenic or karyotype evidence is available (see the extensive list in introduction to <xref rid="evv110-B65" ref-type="bibr">Vanneste et al. 2013</xref>). It is possible that highly saturated synonymous substitutions rates (d<italic>S</italic> &#x0003e; 2) could lead to incorrect inferences of the scale of the duplication event (<xref rid="evv110-B65" ref-type="bibr">Vanneste et al. 2013</xref>), but we restricted our paralog pairs to those with less saturation (d<italic>S</italic> &#x0003c; 2). Also, as multiple spidroin expansions postdate the divergence of Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae (<xref rid="evv110-B27" ref-type="bibr">Garb et al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B7" ref-type="bibr">Ayoub and Hayashi 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B25" ref-type="bibr">Gaines and Marcotte 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evv110-B62" ref-type="bibr">Starrett et al. 2012</xref>), it is possible that paralogs deriving from ancient small scale duplication events might have contributed to the evolution of silk gland-specific transcripts. However, phylogenetic analyses of the spidroin gene family indicate a minimum of three paralogs present in the common ancestor of Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae (<xref rid="evv110-B62" ref-type="bibr">Starrett et al. 2012</xref>), suggesting paralogs deriving from the ancient duplication event may have created early duplicates in the spidroin gene family.</p><p>In conclusion, we propose that a large-scale (e.g., whole genome or chromosomal) duplication event in spiders generated genetic material for the diversification of silk glands and fibers. Although sequencing complete spider genomes from each suborder should resolve the timing and scale of this event, our transcriptomes proved a powerful resource for identifying this large-scale duplication and demonstrating its importance in the evolution of tissue-specific transcripts. Unequal retention of paralogs in Araneomorphae and Mygalomorphae may have contributed to silk gland differentiation between the two suborders. However, our limited knowledge of the specific nonspidroins expressed in each specialized gland and their retention in different species currently restricts this analysis. Although the exact role that the large-scale duplication event played in the phenotypic and ecological diversification of spiders remains unknown, its placement prior to the divergence of the major spider suborders strongly suggests its importance in the ecological success of spiders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evv110/-/DC1">Supplementary tables S1&#x02013;S4</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evv110/-/DC1">supplementary figures S1&#x02013;S5</ext-link> are available at <italic>Genome Biology and Evolution</italic> online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbe.oxfordjournals.org/">http://www.gbe.oxfordjournals.org/</ext-link>).</p>
