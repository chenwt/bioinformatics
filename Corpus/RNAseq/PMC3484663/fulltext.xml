Piccolo and Bassoon are partially functionally redundant and play roles in regulating the pool of neurotransmitter-filled synaptic vesicles present at synapses. In mice, each protein contains two N-terminal zinc finger domains that have been implicated in interacting with synaptic vesicles. In all teleosts examined, both the Bassoon and Piccolo genes are duplicated. Both teleost <italic>bassoon</italic> genes and one <italic>piccolo</italic> gene show very similar domain structure and intron-exon organization to their mouse homologs. In contrast, in <italic>piccolo b</italic> a single exon that encodes a zinc finger domain is amplified 8 to 16 times in different teleost species. Analysis of the amplified exons suggests they were added and/or deleted from the gene as individual exons in rare events that are likely the result of unequal crossovers between homologous sequences. Surprisingly, the structure of the repeats from cod and zebrafish suggest that amplification of this exon has occurred independently multiple times in the teleost lineage. Based on the structure of the exons, I propose a model in which selection for high sequence similarity at the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of the exon drives amplification of the repeats and diversity in repeat length likely promotes the stability of the repeated exons by minimizing the likelihood of mispairing of adjacent repeat sequences. Further analysis of <italic>piccolo b</italic> in teleosts should provide a window through which to examine the process of domain amplification.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name> DJS Export </meta-name><meta-value>v1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Multidomain proteins are very common in eukaryotes and exon shuffling during evolution has been proposed as a primary mechanism for the creation of new multidomain protein architectures (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Gilbert 1987</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Patthy 1999</xref>). It has also been recognized that gene duplication, and in particular whole-genome duplications (WGDs), likely had a great impact on the evolution of protein families by providing a period during which such exon shuffling was much less constrained (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Wolfe and Li 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Davis and Petrov 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Semon and Wolfe 2007</xref>). In addition to exon shuffling, amplification of repeated domains has also contributed to the diversification of protein architecture, and such domain amplification has been particularly pervasive in multicellular vertebrate evolution (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bjorklund <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). In the new era of whole-genome sequencing, the potential to examine these evolutionary events in more detail has become tantalizingly feasible. Furthermore, in some species experimental manipulation of the organism may provide the ability to experimentally test certain predictions of models for mechanisms driving protein structure diversification.</p><p>Teleosts provide a potentially rich source of data to address these questions at a bioinformatics level and potentially at an experimental level. A WGD occurred early in the teleost lineage and it is estimated that approximately 80&#x02013;85% of duplicated genes have been lost in the species that have been examined in molecular detail (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jaillon <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Brunet <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). Molecular analysis of distinct teleost species has revealed the extensive amplification of specific gene families such as the MHC I complex in cod (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Star <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>) and the TRIM protein family in zebrafish and salmonids (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Van der Aa <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). The vast number of teleost species should provide a vast wealth of sequence data to more precisely define how these unique amplification of gene families occur.</p><p>Domain expansion within proteins has been less extensively studied, although it likely has also played a significant role in expanding the diversity of genes in vertebrate evolution (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bjorklund <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). The utility of teleost diversity in addressing this problem has been much less well examined. Herein, I describe the unusual amplification of a zinc finger encoding exon in the Bassoon/Piccolo family of active zone proteins in teleosts. I characterize the structure of the Bassoon and Piccolo genes in multiple teleosts by using available whole-genome sequence (WGS) data. I demonstrate that a zinc finger&#x02212;encoding exon in one of the two Piccolo genes has expanded from one copy to 8 to 16 copies in different teleost species. I characterize the relationship of these exons and propose a model for the amplification of the exons in the teleost lineage. The features of this domain amplification in teleosts provide a unique and potentially powerful model to understanding mechanisms driving and limiting domain duplication.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>DNA sequencing of cod, tilapia, and green spotted puffer zinc finger repeats</title><p>I obtained a cod (<italic>Gadus morhua</italic>) from a local fish market, a green spotted puffer (<italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis</italic>) from a local tropical fish market, and tilapia genomic DNA from Andrew Stuart at the Benaroya Research Institute.

In mouse Piccolo and zebrafish <italic>pcloa</italic>, as well as all of the non-teleost Piccolo homologs I examined, the two zinc finger domains are distributed across 3 exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Each zinc finger consists of 4 di-cysteine CXXC motifs in a &#x0223c;60 aa domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In mouse Piccolo each zinc finger domain spans an intron-exon boundary with the first 3 CXXC motifs located in the 3&#x02032; end of an exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and the last CXXC motif located in the 5&#x02032; of the subsequent exon. Thus, in each gene a single &#x0201c;central&#x0201d; exon (exon 3 in mouse Piccolo and zebrafish <italic>pcloa</italic>) encodes both the last CXXC motif of the first zinc finger on the 5&#x02032; boundary of the exon and the first 3 CXXC motifs of the second zinc finger on the 3&#x02032; boundary of the exon. By contrast, analysis of the genomic region of zebrafish <italic>pclob</italic> (in Zv9) revealed 15 exons with similar structure in tandem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In addition to the highly conserved zinc finger CXXC motifs at the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; of each exon, there was also a highly conserved inter zinc finger (IZF) domain of 22 aa in the middle of each exon (discussed later). In zebrafish <italic>pclob</italic> the exons ranged in size from 702 bp to 1350 bp, but similarly to the &#x0201c;central&#x0201d; exon 3 of all the non-teleost vertebrates I examined and zebrafish <italic>pcloa</italic>, they all started and ended in frame 0. By contrast, the remainder of the <italic>pclob</italic> gene was organized with identical domain structure and identical intron-exon structure as mouse Piccolo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, zebrafish <italic>pclob</italic> is organized such that it has the potential to encode a protein very similar to mouse Piccolo, but with 16 N-terminal zinc fingers, rather than 2 zinc fingers.</p><p>Although zebrafish <italic>pclob</italic> exhibits multiple additional &#x0201c;central&#x0201d; exons compared with the mouse Piccolo gene, these additional exons could be spliced in different ways during processing of the primary <italic>pclob</italic> RNA transcript. One possibility is that these 15 exons represent a set of alternative &#x0201c;central&#x0201d; exons allowing for a set of 15 similar, but distinct, two zinc finger domain Pclob isoforms to be expressed. On the other hand, all exons might be used producing a Pclob protein with 16 zinc fingers with almost twice the mass of mouse Piccolo. To distinguish between these possibilities, I used oligonucleotides designed to hybridize specifically to individual repeats and performed PCR amplifications from first strand cDNA synthesized from RNA isolated from 5-day-old zebrafish embryos. Because the exons are large, I did not attempt to amplify across the entire set of 15 exons (13,497 bp), but rather amplified across pairs of exons. These results demonstrate that each exon is spliced into mature transcripts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.112.003624/-/DC1/FigureS2.pdf">Figure S2</ext-link>). I only detected the skipping of a single central exon (the 14th), and this product was much less abundant than then the larger splice product containing the exon (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.112.003624/-/DC1/FigureS2.pdf">Figure S2</ext-link>B). Independently, I analyzed RNAseq data in v64 of Ensembl. Similar to the PCR analysis, the RNAseq data indicated that the gene was highly expressed in both 14-day-old male and female heads, consistent with the previously documented neuronal function of mouse Piccolo (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.112.003624/-/DC1/FigureS3.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link>). Furthermore, in these samples, all adjacent exon splice products were present in approximately equal abundance, and few exon skipping products were present (although in other tissue samples some evidence of exon skipping was found). These data suggest that the primary mature RNA transcript of zebrafish <italic>pclob</italic> in neurons is predicted to encode an 9009 aa Piccolo-related protein with 16 zinc fingers, a PDZ domain and two C2 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>One dual zinc finger and one multizinc finger in each sequenced teleost genome</title><p>Finding the structure of zebrafish <italic>pclob</italic> unusual, I analyzed the genomic structure of Piccolo-related genes of multiple other teleosts as well as coelacanth, lizard, and frog. In most cases, the annotation of the genes was incorrect, and thus I manually annotated each gene using the mouse and zebrafish genes as guides (because the mRNA structure of these genes is known). In the case of tilapia, cod, and green spotted puffer, specific primers were used to amplify small regions from the Piccolo genes to correct sequencing errors and fill small gaps in the available genomic sequence (see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic> for details). I only identified a single Piccolo homolog in coelacanth, lizard, and frog, and each of these genes exhibited identical domain structure and intron-exon structure to the mouse Piccolo and zebrafish <italic>pcloa</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.112.003624/-/DC1/TableS1.xls">Table S1</ext-link>, and data not shown). In contrast, the stickleback, fugu, green spotted puffer, medaka, tilapia, and cod genomes all contained two Piccolo homologs. In each case, one ortholog exhibited the same domain and intron-exon structure as zebrafish <italic>pcloa</italic> and Piccolo. Furthermore, in each case, the zinc finger domain was greatly amplified in the other ortholog, although the genes from different species contained different numbers of &#x0201c;central&#x0201d; exons varying in number from 8 to 16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Apart from the additional zinc finger &#x0201c;central&#x0201d; exons, the domain structure of these Piccolo related genes resembled mouse Piccolo and zebrafish <italic>pcloa</italic>. The only exceptions were two additional introns present in the identical position in a large exon just before the PDZ domain encoding exon present in all the teleosts other than zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, all teleosts, and only the teleosts among all the vertebrate genomes I examined, appear to contain a second Piccolo related gene with multiple additional exons encoding zinc finger domains.</p></sec><sec id="s11"><title>Bassoon is duplicated without zinc finger domain expansion in teleosts</title><p>Piccolo is closely related to Bassoon, and functional analysis of these genes in mouse has revealed that they are at least in part functionally redundant (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Mukherjee <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). In particular, both Bassoon and Piccolo proteins have two N-terminal zinc finger domains and an extended region with coiled coil character and the portion of both genes that code for these domains exhibit similar intron-exon organization. Thus, Bassoon appears to be a Piccolo-like gene lacking the PDZ and C2 domains (or vice versa). Thus, I searched the coelacanth, lizard, frog, and various teleost genomes for homologs of mouse Bassoon. Because the Bassoon homolog was incorrectly annotated in most species, I manually annotated each gene, and confirmed the manual annotation using the v64 Ensembl RNAseq data for the zebrafish homologs. The zebrafish Bassoon homologs found on chr 8 and chr 11 were named <italic>bassoon a (</italic>symbol <italic>bsna)</italic> and <italic>bassoon b (</italic>symbol <italic>bsnb)</italic>, respectively. As is the case for Piccolo, I found two Bassoon homologs in each teleost genome I analyzed, and one Bassoon homolog in coelacanth, frog, and lizard. However, by contrast with Piccolo, the two Bassoon homologs in each teleost showed identical domain structure to mouse Bassoon and very similar intron-exon structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.112.003624/-/DC1/TableS2.xls">Table S2</ext-link>). The two homologs were slightly divergent, which was reflected by small differences in intron-exon boundaries of the two homologs outside the zinc finger domain region. Thus, despite having very similar structural zinc finger domains and intron-exon boundary organization, Bassoon zinc finger domains have not amplified in number in teleosts.</p><fig id="fig4" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 4&#x02002;</label><caption><p>Intron-exon structure of teleost <italic>bassoon</italic> genes.

To ensure the probes were specific for individual genes the probes were designed to anneal to the most divergent region of the proteins, a region after the zinc finger domain. The resulting &#x0223c;850- to 950-bp probes shared only small 100-200 bp regions with limited homology (&#x0003c;75% identity) with the closest homolog.

Thus, I first performed a clustering analysis of sequences from these species. Specifically, I aligned the sequences using MUSCLE and then constructed phylogenic trees using a neighbor joining approach. Analysis of the zinc finger domain tree revealed that analogous exons of each of these species are clustered together in the same branch, and are thus likely to have evolved from a common ancestor. Furthermore, the differences in exon number (and hence exon organization) appear to result from the addition or deletion of single exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In particular, fugu and spotted puffer appear to represent an ancestral state of 9 repeats whereas medaka has lost repeat 7, tilapia has duplicated repeat 3, and stickleback has both lost repeat 8 and duplicated repeat 9 two times in separate events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

First, I examined the alignments of the repeats from all species and identified a previously unrecognized conserved motif in the Piccolo and Bassoon family. This motif was not previously defined as a unique domain because it occurs only in one copy (between zinc finger 1 and 2) in currently characterized and annotated Piccolo and Bassoon genes, and thus was simply viewed as part of the general conservation between Piccolo and Bassoon genes. In the central region between the CXXC motif encoded in the 5&#x02032; of the exon and the three CXXC motifs encoded in the 3&#x02032; of the exon is a highly conserved serine- and threonine-rich 22 aa sequence of consensus: SVTGKMFGFGSSIFSSASTLIT.

Both of these species have retained the ancestral 9 repeat organization I proposed previously. A detailed look at the alignment between these repeats illustrates that a few repeats contain primarily nucleotide substitutions and only a minor contribution from insertions and deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). For example, fugu-puffer repeat 1 divergence consists of 57 nonsynonymous substitutions, and 2 one aa insertions (one in each species leaving the repeat length identical). However, the differences between most pairs of repeats consisted of multiple insertions and deletions in addition to extensive non-synonymous substitutions. These range from small 1 to 4 aa insertions and deletions, to larger repeated insertions. For example, repeat 8 from fugu contains an insertion of 10 tandem repeats of PPQAPPTAQAK (or close variations thereof) between the IZF and the three CXXC motifs.</p><fig id="fig8" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 8&#x02002;</label><caption><p>Alignment of green spotted puffer and fugu repeated zinc finger domains.

For example, repeats 2, 5, and 6 all show distinct deletions of sequence just C-terminal to highly conserved CXXC motif. Because these deletions are present in both fugu and spotted puffer, they represent relatively old events that occurred between the time of the divergence puffers from the percomorphs (analyzed herein) and the divergence of spotted puffer from fugu. Analysis of the more distantly related stickleback, tilapia, and medaka, which also retain strong evidence of an ancestral 9 repeat organization, shows substantially more insertion and deletions found on both sides of the central IZF motif, thus shifting the spacing between the zinc finger and the IZF domain (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.112.003624/-/DC1/FigureS12.pdf">Figure S12</ext-link>). The change in size of repeat exons was much more extensive than the change in size in the other conserved exons of the <italic>pclob</italic> genes. Specifically, of the last 18 exons of <italic>pclob</italic> (which encode the terminal PDZ C2A and C2B domains), 11 are identical in size in all the teleosts I examined, and 4 others are different by less than 3 aa in size (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.112.003624/-/DC1/TableS1.xls">Table S1</ext-link>). In contrast, the zinc finger exons are largely divergent in size (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.112.003624/-/DC1/TableS1.xls">Table S1</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.112.003624/-/DC1/FigureS13.pdf">Figure S13</ext-link>). Thus, this analysis suggests that the repeated zinc finger exons are under strong selective pressure to maintain a 5&#x02032; CXXC domain encoding the C-terminus of a zinc finger, a central domain encoding the IZF domain, and a 3&#x02032; domain coding for the three N-terminal CxxC portion of the zinc finger. In contrast, there appears to be little selective pressure to maintain the spacing between these domains.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s18"><title>Discussion</title><p>Proteins containing domain repeats are relatively common in multicellular organisms ranging from approximately 9 to 17% in species that have been examined and account for almost 50% of all domains found in vertebrate proteins (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bjorklund <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). Previous analysis of the structure of multidomain proteins has provided some insight about the mechanisms leading to repeat expansion (and loss) in proteins (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bjorklund <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), but our understanding of the mechanisms driving such domain expansion during evolution remains limited. Here I describe and analyze a case in which the zinc finger domain present in the neuronal protein Piccolo has greatly expanded selectively in the teleost lineage after the WGD that occurred shortly after the divergence of teleosts from the terrestrial vertebrate lineage (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Amores <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Taylor <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jaillon <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kasahara <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). The analyses reveal that the zinc finger domain has expanded in only one of the two teleost homologs. Furthermore, the amplification occurred at least in part by via duplication of single exons, and evidence suggests that expansion of this domain has occurred multiple independent times in the teleost lineage.</p><p>A WGD is thought to have occurred after divergence of the teleostei from chrondrostei (paddlefish and sturgeons) and holostei (gars and bowfins) approximately 320&#x02212;370 million years ago (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kasahara <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Amores <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Analysis of genome wide gene structure in sequenced teleosts suggests that rediploidization after the WGD occurred rapidly with the loss of one of the duplicated copies in &#x0223c;75 to 85% of genes (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jaillon <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Woods <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Brunet <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). Most current models of rediploidization (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Force <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>) postulate that duplicate genes have been retained either due to gene neofunctionalization (where one gene acquires a new function that is selected for) or gene subfunctionalization (where each paralog loses reciprocally a component of the ancestral function, for example, reciprocal loss of regulatory elements or protein expression domains). The similarity and broad expression of the <italic>piccolo</italic> genes and the unique structure of <italic>pclob</italic> argue for neofunctionalization being the mechanism at work for the maintenance of two Piccolo homologs in teleosts, though functional analysis of mutants in the genes will be required to make a definitive conclusion on the matter.</p><sec id="s19"><title>Function of the zinc finger domain repeats</title><p>The zinc finger domain of Piccolo belongs to a small family of zinc fingers that coordinate two zinc ions using a series of 4 pairs of cysteines found in Bassoon, Piccolo, RIM, and Rabphilin 3A (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Fenster <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>). In the case of RIM and Rabphilin, the zinc finger domain has been demonstrated to interact small synaptic vesicle membrane-associated GTPases (Rab3 and Rab27) via the zinc finger region (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). The zinc finger itself does not interact with the Rabs, but the zinc finger is required for the interaction. Structural analyses of both the RIM and Rabphilin zinc finger interacting with Rab3 revealed that alpha helices both N-terminal and C-terminal of the zinc finger are coordinated by the zinc finger (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Ostermeier and Brunger 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Dulubova <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). In closely related FYVE zinc fingers, the domain binds directly to membranes. Specifically, the fingers coordinate basic residues and histidine that mediate binding to phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate at the membrane surface (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Misra and Hurley 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Stenmark <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). Experimental evidence suggests that the zinc finger domains of Piccolo and Bassoon likely interact with synaptic vesicles. Immunoelectron microscopy has shown that Bassoon can associate with vesicles (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Sanmarti-Vila <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>). A green fluorescent protein fusion to the zinc finger domains of Bassoon colocalizes with synaptic vesicles whereas a fusion to the whole protein is more restricted specifically to the cytomatrix of the active zone of the synapse (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Dresbach <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>). The molecular mechanism by which an interaction with vesicles might be mediated is currently not clear. The Bassoon zinc finger region binds to pra1 (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Fenster <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>), a protein which binds to prenylated Rab proteins and the synaptic vesicle protein synpatovrevin/VAMP (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Martincic <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>). The identification of the highly conserved IZF domain suggests that it could be a key player in the functional interactions mediated by the zinc finger /IZF repeats. That the IZF domain is exceedingly rich in serine and threonine would make it an excellent target for phosphorylation that could mediate reversible interaction with synaptic vesicles either directly or indirectly. Biochemical studies using the IZF domain may provide a new approach to defining the molecular mechanism by which the zinc finger act in Piccolo vesicle clustering function. In addition, the molecular, genetic, and physiological tools available for the study of zebrafish and medaka provide promising avenues for defining the role of the zinc finger domain in Piccolo protein in neuronal function.</p></sec><sec id="s20"><title>Aligning repeated exons with diverse lengths</title><p>Performing phylogenetic analysis on genes that contain significant variation in sequence due to insertions and deletions is very challenging. The relationships deduced from trees constructed using sequence data are highly dependent on the quality of the alignment (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Thompson <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>). Aligning sequences with significant insertions and deletions is complicated because weighting the choice between maintaining an ungapped but nonhomologous alignment <italic>vs.</italic> positioning and sizing of gaps is difficult (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Cartwright 2009</xref>). In addition, phylogenic trees usually are constructed after removing regions of the alignment containing gaps, thus the number and position of gaps inserted into a sequence can greatly influence the resulting phylogeny. Although some methodologies that use gap information have been created and evidence indicates that significant information is present in gaps (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Loytynoja and Goldman 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Rivas and Eddy 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Dwivedi and Gadagkar 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Dessimoz and Gil 2010</xref>), use of these approaches is not well established in the literature, and thus I did not attempt to use these methods to align the zinc finger repeats. In the case of the zinc finger repeat exons, removing all sequences that are not conserved in all repeats leaves insufficient data to construct statistically significant trees as the divergence in size of repeats is extensive (from 207 to 618 aa in length). I therefore opted to use all columns that were ungapped in at least 50% of the sequences. Furthermore, I modified the gap opening and extension parameter of MUSCLE to limit the number of gaps introduced in the alignment. Because these decisions are to some extent arbitrary, I also aligned the sequences using Clustal X under default parameters and MUSCLE under default parameters and constructed trees for all 3 alignments (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.112.003624/-/DC1/FigureS15.pdf">Figure S15</ext-link> for trees, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.112.003624/-/DC1/FigureS14.pdf">Figure S14</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.112.003624/-/DC1/FigureS16.pdf">Figure S16</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.112.003624/-/DC1/FigureS17.pdf">Figure S17</ext-link> for alignments). Although differences are apparent in the trees obtained using the different alignments, the fundamental conclusions made about the distinct clustering of cod, zebrafish and percomorph repeats are the same regardless of alignment parameters. Thus, although the complexity of aligning repeats of different lengths likely has introduced some uncertainty in the precise trees I obtained, they are unlikely to have misled us about the general evolutionary principles that govern the origins of the repeat exons. The subsequent discussion assumes the phylogenetic analysis is basically sound.</p></sec><sec id="s21"><title>Model of amplification and deletion</title><p>Analysis of the repeats from percomorphs and zebrafish indicate that repeats have been added and lost from <italic>pclob</italic> in discrete events that inserted or deleted single exons. In the case of percomorphs, fugu, and spotted puffer repeat organizations are representative of a proposed ancestral state of <italic>pclob</italic> zinc finger exons in the percomorph lineage. Insertions and deletions of single repeat exons have occurred in medaka, stickleback and tilapia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Similarly, the phylogenetic tree of zebrafish repeats is consistent with repeats 12-15 having appeared through individual single exon duplication events. Multiple methods have been proposed to account for repeat amplification and contraction including strand slippage (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Petruska <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>), retrotransposition (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Xiao <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>), gene conversion (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>), and illegitimate recombination (either nonhomologous or unequal crossover mediated) during meiotic recombination (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Van Rijk and Bloemendal 2003</xref>). Strand-slippage is primarily associated with trinucleotide repeat amplification and is thus unlikely to be relevant to Piccolo. Furthermore, the amplified repeat domains are also not associated with putative transposon sequences. Finally, although I cannot formally eliminate gene conversion as a plausible mechanism for the exon amplifications I describe, gene conversion tracts tend to be smaller [usually less than 300 bp (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>)] than the zinc finger exons repeated in <italic>pclob</italic>. Thus, I propose a model based on unequal crossovers between repeats. Specifically, I propose that unequal crossovers between homologous 5&#x02032; CxxC, central IZF, or 3&#x02032; three CxxC encoding regions of adjacent exons (and more rarely between more distantly spaced exons) can account for the changes in repeat spacing in the percomorphs and for the expansion of repeat exons 12&#x02212;15 in zebrafish. Although larger numbers of similar events also could explain the amplification from 1 to 9 central repeat exons that occurred prior to the diverge of the percomorph species I examined, analysis of the phylogenetic trees do not yield a simple set of events that can account for the observed repeat order and number.</p></sec><sec id="s22"><title>Zebrafish and cod <italic>pclob</italic>: evidence for independent amplification of zinc finger repeats in teleosts</title><p>The analysis of <italic>pclob</italic> suggests that the zinc finger exon structure of fugu and spotted puffer represent an ancestral state present before divergence of medaka and the puffers &#x0223c;190 million years ago. Although cod diverged from the percomorphs before this time (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Setiamarga <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>), the zinc finger exons from cod are both much more numerous and much less divergent than in the percomorphs. However, the cod repeats do fall within the percomorpha repeat clade, suggesting some relationship between the two. At least three possible scenarios could account for this difference. First, the repeats in the cod lineage were lost by unequal crossover and then more recently reamplified from a single or a few repeat exons. Second, the repeat number in the cod lineage could have amplified greatly (likely to more than 24 repeats) with much of this amplification occurring via recurrent amplification of a small subset of repeats. Subsequently, the repeats more closely related to the percomorphs were lost by unequal crossover, leaving the current 16 repeats. Third, it is possible that multiple gene conversion events harmonized the repeat structure after cod repeats amplification from the ancestral 9 repeat state. I favor the first scenario as it requires the least additional events (one unequal crossover event which deletes 8 repeats). In the case of zebrafish, the repeats show no significant relation to the percomorpha repeats but unlike the cod repeats are very diverse in sequence (except for repeats 12&#x02212;15). The simplest explanation for this divergence is that the amplification of <italic>pclob</italic> zinc fingers was initiated independently after the divergence of zebrafish and the euteleostei (cod and percomorphs &#x0223c;280 Mya). Thus, I propose that amplification of repeats in <italic>pclob</italic> has occurred independently at least 3 times in the teleost lineage.</p></sec><sec id="s23"><title>Frequency of duplication and amplification events</title><p>The analysis of the percomorph species that diverged from &#x0223c;50 million years ago (green spotted puffer and fugu) to 175 million years ago (stickleback and medaka) indicate that loss or insertion of a whole repeat exon is a very rare event, occurring only 2 and 3 times, respectively, since the divergence of the five percomorphs I examined. In contrast, the repeats in cod appear more closely related, suggesting that repeat expansion may also occur more frequently than every 50&#x02212;100 million years. In addition, I also found that zebrafish repeats 12 through 15 are closely related, suggesting they amplified more recently. Why this dichotomy in stability of repeats? I propose that the exon repeats are maintained via two different mechanisms of selection. The universal emergence of duplicated zinc finger repeats in teleosts suggests strong selection pressure to amplify the zinc finger repeats. However, repeated homologous sequences are unstable because they promote unequal crossovers during meiotic recombination. I propose that three distinct regions in each exon are under negative selective pressure (for conservation): the zinc finger domain CxxC motifs at both edges of the exon and the IZF motif in the middle of the exon. This results in three short regions in each exon that maintain high homology between the repeated exons and thus maintain the potential for unequal crossover events that mediate repeat expansion or contraction. In addition, positive selection for rapid divergence of the sequences between these conserved regions within the repeated exons drives divergence of the repeats thus reducing the extent of repeat-repeat homology and stabilizes amplified repeat exons. Such a model would predict a scenario in which after an amplification, the event repeat number would be unstable and then over time, as positive selection drives divergence of the repeats, amplification and deletion of repeats would become progressively less frequent. The cod repeat arrangement represents an earlier state in this process of repeat stabilization and the percomorphs a more mature state of the process.</p></sec><sec id="s24"><title>No other examples of drastic expansion of a single of two homologs in teleosts or other species</title><p>Gene amplification in the teleost lineage has been extensively studied and numerous examples of selective gene amplification in teleosts have been described. For example, the MHC I family has been greatly amplified in cod (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Star <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>) and the TRIM gene family has differentially amplified in different teleost species (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">van der Aa <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). In addition, there are numerous examples of domain amplification in the vertebrate lineage, including well-studied examples such as nebulin in which a super repeat of 7 actin binding domains has been amplified multiple times in many different vertebrate lineages (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bjorklund <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). However, I am not aware of another example of extensive amplification of a domain specifically in one of two ohnologs in the teleosts. The amplification of a whole gene is under different constraints from amplification of a domain because during amplification of a domain like the zinc finger domain of <italic>pclob</italic>, there is continued selection for function of each domain. By contrast, during amplification of whole genes such as the TRIM and MHC I families each duplicated gene presumably can be selected on independently of the other amplified genes.</p><p>To assess how unusual the case of <italic>pclob</italic> zinc finger domain amplification is, I used Ensembl Bio-Mart to identify all &#x0201c;genes&#x0201d; (as defined by Ensembl gene models) duplicated in zebrafish that have only a single mouse homolog. I then asked among these gene duplications that had been maintained in zebrafish, how many of these zebrafish gene pair contained different numbers of total identified domains from their mouse homolog. I analyzed 1598 genes with two co-orthologs in zebrafish, but only one in mouse. Among these, in 791 cases both zebrafish genes had the identical total number of PFAM domains as the mouse gene. Among the remaining trios, only 371 had one zebrafish ortholog with an identical domain count as the mouse gene, and the other zebrafish gene with a distinct domain count. Among these only 132 had an increased domain count compared with the mouse gene, and only four genes had an increase of three or more domains compared with the mouse homolog. The sole case with a four-domain increase was the increase in C2 domains in <italic>esyt1b</italic> to 9 from the 5 found in the mouse <italic>esyt1</italic> and zebrafish <italic>esyt1a</italic>. This increase has been previously documented and is present in all teleosts examined and consists of a internal duplication which likely occurred early in the teleost lineage (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Craxton 2010</xref>). Two of the three other cases were the result of misannotation (<italic>PEAR1</italic> and <italic>SPEG</italic>), and the last case (<italic>SHARPIN</italic>), one of the zebrafish genes, has added three new domains.</p><p>Poor annotation of the zebrafish genome constrained the stringency of the analysis. For example, I did not detect <italic>pclob</italic> because this gene has not been properly annotated, likely due to the duplications I describe herein. Among the 371 aforementioned cases, many differences between one ortholog in zebrafish and the mouse gene were loss of domains, and it is likely that many of these cases are the result of poor annotation (which should improve greatly as RNAseq data are incorporated into gene structure annotation). In summary, although the bioinformatics analysis was constrained by data quality, the case of <italic>pclob</italic> zinc finger domain amplification appears to be very rare among all characterized zebrafish genes. Thus, it likely represents an unusually prolific case that may be particularly useful in defining mechanisms that are capable of driving domain amplification and contraction during evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s25"><title>Evolution of <italic>pclob</italic></title><p>Although I have examined and documented the expansion of the number of zinc finger domains in <italic>pclob</italic> in the teleosts, it remains unclear whether duplication of Piccolo provided a unique evolutionary advantage to teleosts or if it might generally provide advantages to vertebrates. <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> is pseudo-tetraploid due to a recent WGD [20&#x02212;55 Mya (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chain and Evans 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Semon and Wolfe 2008</xref>]), is extensively studied experimentally, and is likely to be completely sequenced in the near future. Several species of South American rats are also thought to have undergone recent WGD, although the timing of this event has not been defined (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Gallardo <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). It will be interesting to explore whether recent tetraploidization events also have driven the expansion of Piccolo in amphibians and terrestrial vertebrates.</p><p>The teleost lineage should also prove intriguing for further study of the <italic>pclob</italic> family.

In addition, the large diversity of teleost species including radiation of African cichlid species in the rift lake Valley (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Seehausen 2006</xref>) should provide a unique experimental laboratory to examine the molecular mechanisms driving the evolution of domain repeats in detail unthinkable even a few years ago.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material">
