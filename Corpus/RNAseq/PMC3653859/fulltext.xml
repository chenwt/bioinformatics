Under conditions of elevated glutamate, the excessive activation of GluRs causes internalization of pathologic levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, culminating in bioenergetic failure, organelle degradation, and cell death. Efforts to characterize cellular and molecular aspects of excitotoxicity and conduct therapeutic screening for pharmacologic inhibitors of excitogenic progression have been hindered by limitations associated with primary neuron culture. To address this, we evaluated glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in highly enriched glutamatergic neurons (ESNs) derived from murine embryonic stem cells. As of 18 days in vitro (DIV 18), ESNs were synaptically coupled, exhibited spontaneous network activity with neurotypic mEPSCs and expressed NMDARs and AMPARs with physiological current:voltage behaviors. Addition of 0.78&#x02013;200 &#x003bc;M glutamate evoked reproducible time- and dose-dependent metabolic failure in 6 h, with a calculated EC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.44 &#x003bc;M at 24 h. Using a combination of cell viability assays and electrophysiology, we determined that glutamate-induced toxicity was specifically mediated by NMDARs and could be inhibited by addition of NMDAR antagonists, increased extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> or substitution of Ba<sup>2+</sup> for Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Glutamate treatment evoked neurite fragmentation and focal swelling by both immunocytochemistry and scanning electron microscopy. Presentation of morphological markers of cell death was dose-dependent, with 0.78&#x02013;200 &#x003bc;M glutamate resulting in apoptosis and 3000 &#x003bc;M glutamate generating a mixture of necrosis and apoptosis. Addition of neuroprotective small molecules reduced glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in a dose-dependent fashion. These data indicate that ESNs replicate many of the excitogenic mechanisms observed in primary neuron culture, offering a moderate-throughput model of excitotoxicity that combines the verisimilitude of primary neurons with the flexibility and scalability of cultured cells. ESNs therefore offer a physiologically relevant platform that exhibits characteristic NMDAR responses, and appears suitable to evaluate molecular mechanisms of glutamate-induced excitotoxicity and screen for candidate therapeutics.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (IAA number AOD12058-0001-0000) and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency &#x02013; Joint Science and Technology Office, Medical S&#x00026;T Division (grant number CBM.THRTOX.01.10.RC.021).

Glutamoreceptive neurons are highly abundant within the CNS, and over-activation of glutamate receptors (GluRs) is a common modality of excitogenic injury that is implicated in a variety of CNS disorders and neural degenerative disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064423-Olney1">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064423-McDonough1">[5]</xref>. The ionotropic GluRs (iGluRs) are classified into three groups based on their pharmacology and structural properties: NMDA receptors (NMDARs); AMPA receptors (AMPARs); and kainate receptors (KARs). AMPAR and KAR primarily allow Na<sup>+</sup> influx, whereas NMDAR is a coincidence-gated, high-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel that is both ligand-gated and voltage-dependent. Ionotropic GluR activity is dynamically regulated by several factors, including expression level and subunit composition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064423-Traynelis1">[6]</xref>. While all three receptor groups have functional roles in neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity, synaptic NMDAR activity is primarily associated with plasticity, whereas AMPAR and, to a lesser extent KAR, mediate post-synaptic depolarization and neurotransmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064423-Lau1">[7]</xref>. Under conditions of elevated extracellular glutamate, the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through NMDARs is believed to elicit pathogenesis through activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent proteases, altered phosphoproteomes, mitochondrial dysfunction, bioenergetic failure and cytosolic release of pro-apoptotic enzymes. At sufficiently high doses of glutamate, this process culminates in excitogenic cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064423-Aarts1">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Treatments to mitigate neuronal damage during excitotoxic injury remain elusive, in part because of an incomplete understanding of the cellular processes initiated by excessive iGluR activation. Attempts to elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings of excitotoxicity in primary neurons have resulted in inconsistent findings, suggesting that variability in the origin, handling or treatment of primary cultures may influence experimental outcomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064423-Singleton1">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064423-Muller1">[10]</xref>. In addition to sample variability, primary neuron use is limited by ethical, technical and regulatory constraints, restricting the ability of many labs to elucidate how differences in culture or handling may affect excitogenic progression.</p><p>We have previously shown that highly enriched cultures of glutamatergic neurons (ESNs) derived from suspension-cultured murine embryonic stem cells exhibit developmental, functional, transcriptional and morphological characteristics of primary neurons, and are responsive to a variety of neurotropic stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064423-Hubbard1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064423-McNutt1">[12]</xref>. In contrast to most primary neuron cultures and neuroblastoma cell lines, differentiation of ESN reproducibly generates a glutamatergic neuron subtype with minimal contamination by GABAergic neurons and glial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064423-McNutt1">[12]</xref>. Hypothesizing that ESNs may offer a new model for excitotoxic injury, we first evaluated the functional expression of post-synaptic ionotropic glutamate receptors using electrophysiology and pharmacological agonists/antagonists. We then characterized the consequences of glutamate treatment on neuron morphology, gene expression and time- and dose-dependent appearance of neurotoxic markers. To evaluate the potential for therapeutic screening, we assessed the effect of several small molecule antagonists on excitotoxicity in a moderate-throughput format. The findings suggest that stem cell-derived neurons comprise a sensitive platform for excitotoxicity research that faithfully replicates neurotypic responses to excitogenic stimuli while offering the scalability, genetic tractability and flexibility of cultured cell lines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Reagents</title><p>Mono-sodium glutamate, 2-amino-3-(5-methyl-3-oxo-1,2- oxazol-4-yl)propanoic acid (AMPA) kainic acid (KA), &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), gadolinium chloride, and saponin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

TTX and cesium were used to block Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channel currents, respectively. For characterization of mEPSCs, neurons were patched and recorded in voltage-clamp mode at &#x02212;80&#x000d7;mV. For I-V curves, neurons were held at &#x02212;70 mV and stepped from &#x02212;100 mV to +60 mV in regular increments. At each potential, neurons were sequentially perfused with (i) ERB for 15 sec; (ii) ERB with 50 &#x000b5;M NMDA or 100 uM kainate for 10 sec; and (iii) ERB for 35 sec to restore a baseline response. Perfusions were conducted using a three barrel Fast Step system (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). I-V responses were determined by subtracting the current measured during the initial ERB perfusion from peak currents during administration of agonist. Currents were re-measured during the washout step and compared to the baseline readings to confirm that the response was fully reversible and verify the integrity of the patch. For measurement of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free ERB NMDAR currents, the perfusate was formulated as above, but without Mg<sup>2+</sup>. For AMPAR I-V curves, Kainate (100 uM; KA) was used as a non-desensitizing agonist of AMPAR channels to avoid neurotoxicity induced by simultaneous application of AMPA and cyclothioheximide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064423-Itazawa1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064423-LevchenkoLambert1">[15]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>ESN cultures were lysed with denaturing cell extraction buffer (Life Technologies) and harvested by scraping.

Metabolic conversion of PrestoBlue to a fluorescent product was measured with a Synergy MX plate reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT) using excitation of 535 nm and emission of 595 nm. To evaluate potential glial contributions to metabolic activity, wells were treated with 5 mM glutamate subsequent to measurements of metabolic activity, and fluorescence intensities were subtracted from experimental wells. Microscopic evaluation of cultures confirmed that addition of 5 mM glutamate did not induce any detectable toxicity in the rare glia, whereas all neurons exhibited PI uptake or nuclear condensation within 2 h.

These data confirm the role of NMDARs in glutamate-induced toxicity and are consistent with a pathogenic role for Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The ability of ESNs to replicate the complex gating of NMDARs suggests that they may be well-suited for exploration of the cellular and molecular components of NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity.

Primary neuron cultures typically suffer from origin-specific variations in the relative proportions of excitatory neuron subtypes, inhibitory neurons and glial cells; this variability is likely to introduce variability in measurements of glutamate sensitivities and excitogenic responses. In principle, the highly enriched glutamatergic composition of ESNs offers several advantages over complex cell populations: a narrower range and variability of biological responses; minimal contributions by inhibitory neurons that might reduce NMDAR activation; and few glial cells to absorb exogenous glutamate and release neurotrophic factors. ESNs were shown to replicate known responses of primary neurons to glutamate, including toxicity mediated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through NMDARs and physiological behaviors of post-synaptic iGluRs. The high degree of purity and scalable derivation facilitates the use of &#x02018;omics&#x02019;-based approaches to evaluate short- and long-term cellular responses to excitotoxicity. These data suggest that ESNs are a novel cell model for excitotoxicity research that combines the verisimilitude of primary neurons with the flexibility of continuous cell lines. The identification of an ESN-based excitotoxicity model should enable detailed biochemical and molecular processes involved downstream of NMDAR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx that are difficult or impossible to address in neurogenic cells or primary neurons. This model is currently being used to conduct mechanistic investigations into excitotoxic injury, with the objective of identifying assays and points of intervention to facilitate therapeutic screening.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0064423.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>NMDA treatment causes a dose-dependent reduction in ESN viability at 24 h.</bold> The data are expressed as fold-change relative to 0 &#x000b5;M NMDA.
