Topo IV is a bacterial type II topoisomerase involved in the removal of catenation links both behind replication forks and after replication during the final separation of sister chromosomes. We have investigated the global DNA-binding and catalytic activity of Topo IV in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> using genomic and molecular biology approaches. ChIP-seq revealed that Topo IV interaction with the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> chromosome is controlled by DNA replication. During replication, Topo IV has access to most of the genome but only selects a few hundred specific sites for its activity. Local chromatin and gene expression context influence site selection. Moreover strong DNA-binding and catalytic activities are found at the chromosome dimer resolution site, <italic>dif</italic>, located opposite the origin of replication. We reveal a physical and functional interaction between Topo IV and the XerCD recombinases acting at the <italic>dif</italic> site. This interaction is modulated by MatP, a protein involved in the organization of the Ter macrodomain. These results show that Topo IV, XerCD/<italic>dif</italic> and MatP are part of a network dedicated to the final step of chromosome management during the cell cycle.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>DNA topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes that solve the topological problems associated with replication, transcription and recombination. Type II Topoisomerases play a major role in the management of newly replicated DNA. They contribute to the condensation and segregation of chromosomes to the future daughter cells and are essential for the optimal transmission of genetic information. In most bacteria, including the model organism <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, these tasks are performed by two enzymes, DNA gyrase and DNA Topoisomerase IV (Topo IV). The distribution of the roles between these enzymes during the cell cycle is not yet completely understood. In the present study we use genomic and molecular biology methods to decipher the regulation of Topo IV during the cell cycle. Here we present data that strongly suggest the interaction of Topo IV with the chromosome is controlled by DNA replication and chromatin factors responsible for its loading to specific regions of the chromosome. In addition, our observations reveal, that by sharing several key factors, the DNA management processes ensuring accuracy of the late steps of chromosome segregation are all interconnected.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-JCJC-1204-0</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2804-2192</contrib-id><name><surname>Esp&#x000e9;li</surname><given-names>Olivier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-13-BSV6-0012-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2804-2192</contrib-id><name><surname>Esp&#x000e9;li</surname><given-names>Olivier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR sisters (ANR-10-JCJC-1204-0), and ANR Magisbac (ANR-14-CE10-0007).

Our current understanding of these topological modifications comes from extensive studies on replicating plasmids [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] These studies suggest that positive supercoils are formed ahead of the replication fork, while precatenanes are formed on newly replicated sister strands. At the end of a replication round, unresolved precatenanes accumulate in the region of replication termination and are converted to catenanes between the replicated sister chromosomes. Neither precatenanes or catenanes have been directly observed on chromosomes but their presence is generally accepted and failure to resolve them leads to chromosome segregation defects and cell death [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Topo IV is a type II topoisomerase formed by two dimers of the ParC and ParE subunits and is the main decatenase in <italic>Esherichia</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. <italic>in vitro</italic>, its activity is 100 fold stronger on catenated circles than that of DNA gyrase [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Topo IV activity is dependent on the topology of the DNA substrate; Topo IV activity is strongest on positively supercoiled DNA and has a marked preference for L-braids, which it relaxes completely and processively. Topo IV can also unlink R-braids but only when they supercoil to form L-plectonemes [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic>, DNA gyrase appears to have multiple targets on the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> chromosome [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], whereas Topo IV cleavage sites seem to occur less frequently [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Interestingly, Topoisomerase IV activity is not essential for replication itself [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] but is critical for chromosome segregation [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The pattern of sister chromatid separation has been shown to vary upon Topo IV alteration, leading to the view that precatenanes mediate sister chromatid cohesion by accumulating for several hundred kilobases behind the replication forks keeping the newly replicated DNA together [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The regulation of Topo IV and perhaps the accessibility of the protein to chromosome dimers was proposed to be an important factor controlling chromosome segregation [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Topo IV activity can be modulated by a number of proteins including MukB and SeqA. MukB, is an SMC-related protein in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and is reported to bind to the C-terminus of Topo IV [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] to enhance Topo IV unlinking activities [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. MukB also appears to be important in favoring the formation of Topo IV foci (clusters) near the origin of replication [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. SeqA, a protein involved in the control of replication initiation, and Topo IV also interact [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These interactions may play a role in sister chromatid segregation at the late segregating SNAP regions near the origin of replication of the chromosome [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Beside its role in the resolution of precatenanes, Topo IV is mostly required in the post-replicative (G2) phase of the cell cycle for the resolution of catenation links. Indeed, <italic>Espeli et al</italic>. showed that Topo IV activity is mostly observed during the G2 phase, suggesting that a number of catenation links persist after replication [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Recent cell biology experiments revealed that in G2, the terminal region (<italic>ter</italic>) opposite <italic>oriC</italic> segregates following a specific pattern [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Sister <italic>ter</italic> regions remain associated from the moment of their replication to the onset of cell division. This sister-chromosome association is mediated by the Ter macrodomain organizing protein, MatP [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. At the onset of cell division, the FtsK DNA-translocase processes this region, releasing the MatP-mediated association. This process ends at the <italic>dif</italic> site, when the dimeric forms of the sister chromosomes are resolved by the XerC and XerD recombinases. A functional interaction between the MatP/FtsK/XerCD-<italic>dif</italic> system and Topo IV has long been suspected. FtsK interacts with Topo IV, enhancing its decatenation activity <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and the <italic>dif</italic> region has been reported as a preferential site of Topo IV cleavage [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This functional interaction has been poorly documented to date and is therefore remains elusive.</p><p>In this study we have used genomic and molecular biology methods to characterize Topo IV regulation during the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cell cycle on a genome-wide scale. The present work revealed that Topo IV requires DNA replication to load on the chromosome. In addition, we have identified two binding patterns: i) regions where Topo IV binds DNA but is not engaged in a cleavage reaction; ii) numerous sites where Topo IV cleavage is frequent. We show that Topo IV-mediated removal of precatenanes is influenced by both local chromatin structure and gene expression. We also demonstrate that at the <italic>dif</italic> site, Topo IV cleavage and binding are enhanced by the presence of the XerCD recombinase and the MatP chromosome-structuring factor. The enhancement of Topo IV activity at <italic>dif</italic> promotes decatenation of fully replicated chromosomes and through interaction with other DNA management processes, this decatenation ensures accurate separation of the sister chromosomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Topoisomerase IV binding on the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> chromosome</title><p>To identify Topo IV binding, we performed ChIP-seq experiments in ParE and ParC Flag tagged strains. The C-terminus fusions of ParE and ParC replaced the wild-type (WT) alleles without any observable phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006025.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). We performed three independent experiments, two ParE-flag IPs and one ParC-flag IP, with reproducible patterns identified in all three experiments. A Pearson correlation of 0.8, 0.9 and 0.7 was observed for ParC-ParE1, ParE1-ParE2 and ParC-ParE2 respectively. A map of enriched regions observed in each experiment is represented on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g001">Fig 1A</xref> (red circles). Four of the highly-enriched sites are illustrated at a higher magnification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g001">Fig 1A</xref>&#x02014;right panels. Interestingly one of these sites corresponds to the <italic>dif</italic> site (position 1.58Mb), which has previously been identified as a strong Topoisomerase IV cleavage site in the presence of norfloxacin [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We also observed strong enrichment over rRNA operons, tRNA and IS sequences. To address the significance of the enrichment at rRNA, tRNA and IS, we monitored these sites in ChIP-seq experiments performed in the same conditions with a MatP-flag strain and mock IP performed with strain that did not contain any flag tagged protein. Both MatP and Mock IP presented significant signals on rRNA, tRNA and IS loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006025.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). This observation suggested that Topo IV enrichment at rRNA, tRNAs and IS was an artifact of the ChIP-Seq technique. By contrast no enrichment was observed at the <italic>dif</italic> site in the MatP and mock-IP experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006025.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), we therefore considered <italic>dif</italic> to be a genuine Topo IV binding site and compared every enriched region (&#x0003e;2 fold) with the <italic>dif</italic> IP. We filtered the raw data for regions presenting the highest Pearson correlation with the <italic>dif</italic> signal (&#x0003e;0.7). This procedure discarded many highly enriched regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g001">Fig 1A</xref> orange circles). We identified 19 sites throughout the chromosome where Topo IV IP/input signal suggested a specific binding for at least two of the experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, outer circle histogram, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006025.s012">S1 Table</xref>). Most Topo IV binding sites span a 200 bp region. These sites frequently overlapped intergenic regions, with their mid-points located inside the intergenic region, and did not correlate with any identifiable consensus sequence. In addition to <italic>dif</italic>, which exhibited a 10-fold enrichment, three other sites were strongly enriched. These sites corresponded to positions 1.25Mb (9.4x), 1.85Mb (31x) and 2.56Mb (19x) on the chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, right panels). Beside these specific sites, Topo IV IP showed non-specific enrichment in the <italic>oriC</italic> proximal half of the chromosome. This bias was not a consequence of locus copy number, as the enrichment remained after copy number normalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). We used MatP-Flag IP [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and a control IP in a strain that does not contain a Flag tagged gene to differentiate non-specific Topo IV binding from experimental noise (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006025.s003">S3A Fig</xref>).

In the complementary ter-proximal region, gene dosage (input reads) was higher than the ChIP-seq profile, suggesting that the nonspecific Topo IV binding was lower or lasts for a shorter time in the cell cycle (since these data are population-averaged). The Terminus region that is depleted in Topo IV binding (1.6Mb) surpassed, by far, the size of the Ter macrodomain (800kb).</p><fig id="pgen.1006025.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1006025.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Topo IV binding pattern of replicating chromosome.</title><p>A) Circos plot of the ChIP-seq experiments for ParC-flag and ParE-flag.

We performed ChIP-seq experiments in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli dnaC2</italic> strains under conditions suitable for cell cycle synchronization of the entire population. Synchronization was achieved through a double temperature shift, as described previously [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Using these conditions, in each cell, S phase is initiated on one chromosome, lasts for 40&#x02013;45 min and is followed by a G2 phase (20 min) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006025.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). We analyzed ParE binding before the initiation of replication, in S phase 20 min (S20) and 40 min (S40) after the initiation of replication and in G2 phase. The synchronization of replication in the population was monitored by marker frequency analysis of the Input DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The profile observed for bacteria that did not replicate at non-permissive temperature was strictly flat, but the S20 replication profile presented two sharp changes of the marker frequency slope around positions 500kb and 2700kb. This suggested that each replication fork had crossed approximately 1000 to 1300 kb in 20 min. The S40 replication profile demonstrated that most cells had finished replication, with the unreplicated region being limited to 300 kb around <italic>dif</italic> in no more than 20% of the bacteria. In G2 phase the marker frequency was flat. We used flow cytometry to demonstrate that at G2, the amount of DNA in each bacterium was double compared to that of the G1 bacteria, indicating that cytokinesis has not yet occurred (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006025.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). We analyzed Topo IV binding at specific binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Binding at these sites was strongly impaired in the absence of replication. Binding at every site started in the S20 sample and was maximal in the S40 or G2 samples, without showing any marked decrease, even in the <italic>oriC</italic>-proximal region. These observations suggest that Topo IV binds to specific sites during S phase. However, since enrichment was observed for non-replicated loci and was maintained for a long time after replication, it was not compatible with a model of Topo IV migration with the replication forks. Synchronization experiments with a higher temporal resolution are required to clarify this observation.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Only certain Topo IV binding sites correspond to Topo IV cleavage sites</title><p>To measure Topo IV cleavage at the binding sites, we took advantage of the fact that norfloxacin covalently links Topoisomerase II to the gate segment of DNA and prevent its relegation [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

We performed IPs in the presence of norfloxacin as a crosslinking agent instead of formaldehyde. Following this step, all downstream steps of the protocol were identical to that of the ChIP-Seq assay. We referred to this method as NorflIP. The NorflIP profile differed from the ChIP-seq profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Regions immunoprecipitated with Topo IV-norfloxacin cross-links were frequently observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g002">Fig 2C</xref> orange circle). Similarly to the ChIP-seq experiments, the NorflIP profile revealed strong enrichment over the rRNA operons and IS sequences but not at the tRNA genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006025.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). We used a Southern blot cleavage assay to demonstrate that these signal did not correspond to Topo IV cleavages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006025.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). The NorflIP peaks correspond to a ~170 bp forward and reverse enrichment signal separated by a 130 bp segment, which is not enriched. This pattern is the consequence of the covalent binding of Topo IV to the 5&#x02019; bases at the cleavage site. After Proteinase K treatment the cleaving tyrosine residue bound to the 5&#x02019; extremity resulted in poor ligation efficiency and infrequent sequencing of the cleaved extremities. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006025.s006">S6A and S6B Fig</xref>) This observation confirmed that we were observing genuine Topoisomerase cleavage sites.

We verified several Topo IV cleavage sites by Southern blot, a significant cleaved DNA fragment was observed at the expected size for each of them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). Southern blotting experiments following DNA cleavage in the presence of norfloxacin on synchronized cultures revealed that, like its binding, Topo IV cleavage is coordinated with DNA replication.

We further analyzed the distribution of cleavage sites in the terminus and the <italic>oriC</italic> regions.

Since the cleavage signal spans approximately 200bp, nearly 50% of the sites overlapped, at least partly, with intergenic regions that account for only 11% of the genome.

NorflIP and ChIP-seq data were compared on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g003">Fig 3A</xref>. Despite the lack of corresponding ChIP-seq enrichment at the position of most highly enriched NorflIP sites, a number of consistencies were observed between these two data sets. Overall the NorflIP and ChIP-seq datasets had a Pearson correlation of 0.3 and the averaged data (1 kb bin) revealed a Pearson correlation of 0.5.

Sixty eight genes present both Fis binding [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and Topo IV cleavage (P value 2x10<sup>-03</sup>). Thirty-three of the 172 manually validated cleavage sites overlapped at least partially with a Fis binding site, 80 of them are located less than 400 bp away from a Fis binding site. At the genome scale this correlation is difficult to observe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), but close examination clearly revealed overlapping Topo IV cleavages and Fis binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Fis binding sites are more numerous than Topo IV cleavage sites, therefore a large number of them do not present enrichment for Topo IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). By contrast, Topo IV peaks are excluded from H-NS rich regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g003">Fig 3A, 3B and 3C</xref>). Only one of the 172 manually validated Topo IV cleavage site overlapped with an H-NS binding site. As observed for highly expressed regions TopoIV cleavage sites were frequently observed at the border of H-NS rich regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Moreover H-NS rich regions contain less Topo IV than the rest of the chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g003">Fig 3A&#x02013;3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006025.s009">S9A Fig</xref>).

In rare occasions binding of H-NS has been observed in regions with a regular AT content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), notably Topo IV binding and cleavage were also reduced in these regions. This observation suggested that H-NS itself rather than AT content limits the accessibility of Topo IV to DNA. This observation was confirmed by the identification of Topo IV cleavage in regions with an AT content ranging from 20 to 80% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006025.s009">S9C and S9D Fig</xref>).</p><p>We performed Southern blot analysis of Topo IV cleavage on representative sites to test whether gene expression and chromatin factors influenced Topo IV site selection.

Second, since these loci also contain a Fis binding site overlapping Topo IV cleavage signal, we deleted the <italic>fis</italic> gene. However, deletion of the <italic>fis</italic> gene did not modify Topo IV cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>). Finally we performed cleavage assays in the presence of rifampicin to inhibit transcription. To limit the pleiotropic effects of rifampicin addition we performed the experiment with a 20 min pulse of rifampicin. Rifampicin treatment abolished Topo IV cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g003">Fig 3E</xref>).

We could not obtain <italic>parCts xerC</italic> mutants by P1 transduction at any tested temperature. We obtained <italic>parEts xerC</italic> and <italic>parEts xerD</italic> mutants at 30&#x000b0;C. The <italic>parEts xerC</italic> double mutant presented a growth defect phenotype at 30&#x000b0;C and did not grow at temperature above 35&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). The <italic>parEts xerD</italic> mutant presented a slight growth defect at 37&#x000b0;C compared to <italic>parEts</italic> or <italic>xerD</italic> mutants. None of the <italic>parEts</italic> mutant grew above 42&#x000b0;C. Next, we used quinolone sensitivity as a reporter of Topo IV activity. To this aim, we introduced mutants of the FtsK/Xer system into a <italic>gyrA</italic><sup><italic>nalR</italic></sup> (<italic>nalR</italic>) strain; Topo IV is the primary target of quinolones in such strains. The absence of XerC, XerD, the C-terminal activating domain of FtsK or <italic>dif</italic> exacerbated the sensitivity of the <italic>nalR</italic> strain to ciprofloxacin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). We therefore concluded that the impairment of Topo IV was more detrimental to the cell when the FtsK/Xer system was inactivated. Among partners of the FtsK/Xer system the absence of XerC was significantly the most detrimental, suggesting a specific role for XerC in this process.</p><p>The above results suggest an interaction between Topo IV and the XerCD/<italic>dif</italic> complex. We therefore attempted to detect this interaction directly <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>). We performed EMSA with two fluorescently labeled linear probes, one containing <italic>dif</italic> and the other containing a control DNA not targeted by Topo IV in our genomic assays. Topo IV alone bound poorly to both probes (Kd &#x0003e; 100nM). Binding was strongly enhanced when XerC or both XerC and XerD were added to the reaction mix. In contrast, Topo IV binding to <italic>dif</italic> was slightly inhibited in the presence of XerD alone. These results were consistent with the observation that deletion of the XerC box but not of the XerD box inhibited Topo IV cleavage at <italic>dif</italic> and pointed to a specific role for XerC in Topo IV targeting. The control fragment showed that these effects are specific to <italic>dif</italic>. Topo IV-XerC/<italic>dif</italic> complexes were stable and resisted a challenge by increasing amount of XerD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006025.s010">S10A Fig</xref>). The positive influence of XerCD on TopoIV binding was also observed on a negatively supercoiled plasmid containing <italic>dif</italic>. In the presence of XerCD (50nM), a delay in the plasmid migration was observed with 40nM of TopoIV. By contrast, 200 nM was required in the absence of XerCD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006025.s010">S10B Fig</xref>). The Southern blot cleavage assay showed that overexpression of the ParC C-terminal domain (pET28parC-CTD) strongly reduced cleavage at <italic>dif</italic> but enhanced cleavage at the Topo IV site located at 2.56Mb. This suggested that, as observed for MukB [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], Topo IV might interact with XerC through its C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g004">Fig 4G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Topo IV activity at <italic>dif</italic> depends on dynamics of the <italic>ter</italic> region and chromosome circularity</title><p>We assayed the effects of the reported Topo IV modulators and proteins involved in chromosome segregation the activity of Topo IV at <italic>dif</italic>.

The Topo IV cleavage site at position 1.9Mb is included in the Ter macrodomain, but cleavage at this site was almost unchanged in the absence of MatP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Introduction of a <italic>matP</italic> deletion into the <italic>nalR</italic> strain yielded an increase in ciprofloxacin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g005">Fig 5D</xref>).

To address this question, we used <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strains harboring linear chromosomes [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In this strain, expression of TelN from the N15 phage promotes linearization of the chromosome at the <italic>tos</italic> site inserted a 6kb away from <italic>dif</italic>. Indeed, chromosome linearization suppresses the phenotypes associated with <italic>dif</italic> deletion [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We analyzed cleavage at the <italic>dif</italic> site by Topo IV in the context of a linearized chromosome. Cleavage was completely abolished; showing that Topo IV activity at <italic>dif</italic> is not required on linear chromosomes. This effect was specific to the <italic>dif</italic> site, since cleavage at the 1.9Mb site remained unchanged after chromosome linearization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). We next assayed if the phenotypes associated with <italic>matP</italic> deletion, i.e., formation of elongated cells with non-partitioned nucleoids [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], depend on chromosome circularity. Strikingly, most of the phenotypes observed in the <italic>matP</italic> mutant were suppressed by linearization of the chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g005">Fig 5G</xref>). Interestingly, the frequency of cleavage at <italic>dif</italic> sites inserted far (300 kb) from the normal position of <italic>dif</italic> or in a plasmid were significantly reduced compared to the WT situation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006025.s011">S11 Fig</xref>) confirming that Topo IV cleavage at <italic>dif</italic> is specific to circular chromosomes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec012"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Specific Topo IV binding and cleavage sites on the chromosome</title><p>Whole genome analysis of Topo IV binding by ChIP-seq revealed approximately 10 Topo IV binding sites across the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> genome. Among them, only 5 sites were strongly enriched in every experiment and these were mapped to positions 1.25, 1.58 (<italic>dif</italic>), 1.85, 2.56 and 3.24 Mb. We did not identify any consensus sequence that could explain specific binding to these sites. Band shift experiments at the <italic>dif</italic> site and the 1.25 Mb site revealed that Topo IV binding is not sequence-dependent.</p><p>This led us to favor models involving exogenous local determinants for Topo IV binding as it is the case for the <italic>dif</italic> site in the presence of XerC. Because XerC is only known to bind to <italic>dif</italic>, we could speculate that other chromatin factors might be involved in Topo IV targeting. Topo IV and Fis binding sites [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] overlap more frequently than expected (Nust P value 10e-03 [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Topo IV and Fis binding sites overlap at the positions 1.25 and 2.56 Mb; it is therefore possible that Fis plays a role in defining some Topo IV binding sites. However our EMSA, cleavage and ChIP experiments did not show any cooperative binding of Topo IV with Fis. In spite of its co-localization with Topo IV, Fis does not contribute in defining Topo IV binding or cleavage sites. Nevertheless, the role of the chromatin in Topo IV localization was also illustrated by the strong negative correlation observed for the Topo IV and H-NS bound regions. H-NS rich regions were significantly less enriched for nonspecific Topo IV binding than the rest of the chromosome.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Topo IV mediated DNA cleavage sites</title><p>We postulated that loci where Topo IV is catalytically-active could be identified by DNA cleavage mediated by the quinolone drug norfloxacin. We designed a new ChIP-seq strategy that consisted of capturing DNA-norfloxacin-Topo IV complexes. We called it NorflIP. Three independent experiments show that Topo IV was trapped to a large number of loci (300 to 600) with most of these loci observed in two out of three experiments. A hundred of these loci were identified in all three experiments. <italic>Dif</italic> presented a strong signal in the NorflIP as in the ChIP-seq but this is not the case for most of the other ChIP-seq peaks. NorflIP peaks presented a characteristic pattern suggesting that they are genuine DNA-norfloxacin-Topo IV complexes. Considering that norfloxacin does not alter Topo IV specificity, our results suggest that for Topo IV the genome is divided into five categories: i) Loci where Topo IV binds strongly but remains inactive for most of the cell cycle; ii) Loci where Topo IV is highly active but does not reside for very long time; iii) Loci where we observed both binding and activity (<italic>dif</italic> and 2.56 Mb); iv) regions where Topo IV interacts non-specifically with the DNA and where topological activity is not stimulated; v) regions where non-specific interactions are restricted (the Ter domain, chromatin rich regions (tsEPODs [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], H-NS rich regions). Detection of norfloxacin-mediated genomic cleavage by pulse field electrophoresis has previously revealed that when Topo IV is the only target of norfloxacin the average fragment size is 300&#x02013;400 kb while it drops to 20 kb when Gyrase is the target [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This suggests that, for each cell, no more than 10 to 20 Topo IV cleavages are formed in 10 min of norfloxacin treatment. To fit this observation with our data, only a small fraction (10&#x02013;20 out of 600) of the detected Topo IV cleavage sites would actually be used in each cell. This might explain why Topo IV cleavage sites were hardly distinguishable from background in the ChIP-seq assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This is in good agreement with the estimation that the catalytic cycle only provokes a short pause (1.8 sec) in Topo IV dynamics [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The mechanism responsible for the choice of specific Topo IV cleavage sites is yet to be determined. As indicated by our findings that deletion of the cleavage site resulted in the formation of a new site or sites in the vicinity, cleavage is not directly sequence-related. We observed several biases that might be involved in determination of cleavage sites (GC di-nucleotide skew, GATC spacing, positioning near gene ends or intergenic regions, proximity with highly expressed genes and Fis binding regions). Interestingly inhibition of transcription with rifampicin inhibits Topo IV cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This raises the possibility that transcription, that can be stochastic, may influence stochastic determination of Topo IV activity sites. The influence of transcription could be direct, if RNA polymerase pushes Topo IV to a suitable place, or indirect if the diffusion of topological constraints results in their accumulation near barriers imposed by gene expression [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This accumulation could then, in turn, signal for the recruitment of Topo IV.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Replication influences Topo IV binding and activity</title><p>Synchronization experiments revealed that, like Topo IV binding at specific sites, Topo IV cleavage activity is enhanced by chromosome replication. Enrichment was the highest in late S phase or G2 phase; it seems to persist after the passage of the replication fork at a defined locus. Enrichment in asynchronous cultures was significantly reduced compared to S40 or G2 synchronized cultures suggesting that Topo IV is not bound to the chromosome for the entire cell cycle. Unfortunately our experiments did not have the time resolution to determine at what point of the cell cycle Topo IV leaves the chromosome and if it would leave the chromosome during a regular cell cycle. The role of DNA replication of Topo IV dynamics has recently been observed by a very different approach [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The authors propose that Topo IV accumulates in the <italic>oriC</italic> proximal part of the chromosome in a MukB and DNA replication dependent process. These observations are in good agreement with our data and suggest that Topo IV is loaded on DNA at the time of replication, accumulate towards the origin of replication and remains bound to the DNA until a yet unidentified event triggers its release. Formation of positive supercoils and precatenanes ahead and behind of the replication forks respectively, could be the reason for Topo IV recruitment. One could hypothesize that MukB is used as a DNA topology sensor that is responsible for redistribution of Topo IV. However we only detected a modest effect of <italic>mukB</italic> deletion on Topo IV cleavage at <italic>dif</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006025.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Putative events responsible for Topo IV release could be, among others, complete decatenation of the chromosome, SNAPs release, or stripping by other proteins such as FtsK.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Non-specific Topo IV binding</title><p>Non-specific Topo IV binding presents a very peculiar pattern; it is significantly higher in the <italic>oriC</italic> proximal 3Mb than in the 1.6Mb surrounding <italic>dif</italic>. This pattern is not simply explained by the influence of replication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006025.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, ChIP-seq and ChIP-on-Chip experiments have already revealed a similar bias for DNA gyrase [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and SeqA [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The CbpA protein has been shown to present an inverse binding bias [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], with enrichment in the terminal region and a reduction in the <italic>oriC</italic> proximal domain. The HU regulon has also presented a similar bias [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The terminus domain defined by these biases always comprises the Ter macrodomain but it extends frequently beyond the extreme <italic>matS</italic> sites. The role of MatP in the definition of these biases has not yet been tested. The group of G. Mushelishvili proposed a topological model to interpret the DNA gyrase and HU regulon biases, suggesting that HU coordinates the global genomic supercoiling by regulating the spatial distribution of RNA polymerase in the nucleoid [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Topo IV could benefit from such a supercoiling gradient to load on the chromosome. Interestingly, the strongest Topo IV binding and cleavage sites are localized inside the Terminus depleted domain. One possibility could be that these sites minimize Topo IV binding to adjacent nonspecific sequences. Alternatively one can propose that a regional reduction of non-specific binding creates a selective advantage for optimal loading on to specific sites.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title><italic>Dif</italic> and the control of decatenation</title><p><italic>Dif</italic> was the strongest Topo IV cleavage site detected by NorflIP, it was also detected in the ChIP-seq assays. We have used Southern blot to analyze the determinants involved in this activity. The binding of XerC on the xerC box of <italic>dif</italic> and the region downstream of the <italic>xerC</italic> box are essential. <italic>In vitro</italic>, XerC also strongly favors binding of Topo IV at <italic>dif</italic>. Interestingly XerD and the <italic>xerD</italic> box did not improve Topo IV binding or cleavage. We propose that XerC works as a scaffold for Topo IV, simultaneously stimulating its binding and its activity. Topo IV activity at <italic>dif</italic> is also dependent on the circularity of the chromosome, suggesting that when topological constraints can be evacuated through chromosome ends, Topoisomerase IV does not catalyze strand passage at <italic>dif</italic>. This suggests that topological complexity is directly responsible for Topo IV activity. Topo IV cleavage activity at <italic>dif</italic> is not influenced by SeqA or FtsK, which are two known Topo IV partners. Interestingly, <italic>mukB</italic> and <italic>matP</italic> deletion mutants slightly reduced this activity. The synergistic effect observed when a <italic>matP</italic> deletion is combined with a <italic>parEts</italic> mutation suggests that MatP indeed influences Topo IV activity. The phenotypes of the <italic>matP</italic> mutant are rescued by the linearization of the chromosome. A similar rescue has been observed for the <italic>dif</italic> mutant [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Therefore it is likely that a significant part of the problems that cells encounter in the absence of <italic>matP</italic> corresponds to failure in chromosome topology management, either decatenation or chromosome dimer resolution [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In conclusion, we propose that genomic regulation of Topo IV consists of: (1) Topo IV loading during replication, (2) Topo IV binding to specific sites that may serve as reservoirs, (3) Topo IV activation to remove precatenanes or positive supercoils in a dozen of stochastically chosen loci (4) XerC and MatP ensuring the loading of Topo IV at the <italic>dif</italic> site for faithful decatenation of fully replicated chromosomes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec018"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec019"><title>ChIP-seq assay</title><p>ParE-flag and ParC-flag C-terminus fusions were constructed by lambda red recombination [<xref rid="pgen.1006025.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].
