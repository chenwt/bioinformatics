Nutritional environment and nourishment during development has been shown to be broadly associated with caste determination across social insect taxa such as bees, wasps, and termites. In primitively social insects such as <italic>Polistes</italic> paper wasps, caste remains flexible throughout adulthood, but there is evidence that nourishment inequalities can bias caste development with workers receiving limited nourishment compared to queens. Dominance and vibrational signaling are behaviors that have also been linked to caste differences in paper wasps, suggesting that a combination of nourishment and social factors may drive caste determination. To better understand the molecular basis of nutritional effects on caste determination, we used RNA-sequencing to investigate the gene expression changes in response to proteinaceous nourishment deprivation in <italic>Polistes metricus</italic> larvae.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We identified 285 nourishment-responsive transcripts, many of which are related to lipid metabolism and oxidation-reduction activity. Via comparisons to previously identified caste-related genes, we found that nourishment restriction only partially biased wasp gene expression patterns toward worker caste-like traits, which supports the notion that nourishment, in conjunction with social environment, is a determinant of developmental caste bias. In addition, we conducted cross-species comparisons of nourishment-responsive genes, and uncovered largely lineage-specific gene expression changes, suggesting few shared nourishment-responsive genes across taxa.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, the results from this study highlight the complex and multifactorial nature of environmental effects on the gene expression patterns underlying plastic phenotypes.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12864-015-1410-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Phenotypic plasticity</kwd><kwd>Nourishment</kwd><kwd>Social castes</kwd><kwd>Transcriptomics</kwd><kwd><italic>Polistes</italic></kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Phenotypic plasticity provides an important adaptive mechanism by which morphology, physiology, and/or behavior can be adjusted to biotic and abiotic environmental factors including temperature, nutrition, population density, and predator presence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. There are a number of striking examples of phenotypic plasticity in insects: dimorphic horn development in dung beetles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], seasonal color polyphenism in butterflies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and wing polyphenism in aphids (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]). One of the best-studied models of insect phenotypic plasticity is reproductive castes in social insects, especially social Hymenoptera (bees, ants, and wasps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]). In most social insects, genotypic differences do not account for differences between reproductive (queen) and non-reproductive (worker) castes (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]). Instead, environmental factors induce differences in hormone titers and gene expression (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]), leading to the development of queens or workers, which vary in physiology and behavior and for advanced social species, in morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>One particular environmental factor, food availability, is especially important for caste polyphenism in social insects. Differential nourishment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and nutrition-related genes and pathways (e.g. storage proteins such as vitellogenin and hexamerin, insulin/insulin-like signaling (IIS) pathways) have been linked to caste differences in honey bees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], paper wasps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and termites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This suggests that the influence of nutrition on caste formation may be broadly shared across diverse taxa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. There have been numerous studies investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying queen-worker caste determination in advanced eusocial species, especially honey bees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In honey bees, nutritional differences for larvae fed either royal jelly or worker jelly precede a developmental switch resulting in alternative caste phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Nutrition is also important for caste differences in primitively eusocial species, which lack morphological castes, but we know much less about the molecular mechanisms that underlie the formation of their more subtle behavioral and physiological castes. In primitively eusocial species such as paper wasps, differential nourishment does not strictly determine caste but can lead to a caste bias, whereby female larvae that are fed larger quantities of food are more likely to be future reproductive queens (called &#x0201c;gynes&#x0201d;) as adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, the ultimate caste fate of a female is decided during adulthood. First-brood offspring of an established nest are capable of independent reproduction, but instead they perform allomaternal care (worker behavior) as a response to cues emitted by larvae in the nest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Subsequent social reinforcement of worker behavior often occurs via dominance behaviors by the queen or other workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Primitively eusocial taxa such as <italic>Polistes</italic> are an informative group for understanding the evolution of eusociality and the origins of castes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Across the annual colony cycle of primitively social wasps in the genus <italic>Polistes</italic>&#x000b8; the quantity of larval nourishment changes according to seasonal changes in the adult-to-larva ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. First-brood offspring produced early in the colony cycle have been reared by a single nest-founding queen or few queens, which also perform all colony tasks such as nest building, foraging, egg laying, and brood rearing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. At this early time in the colony cycle the adult-to-larva ratio is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], which leads to low feeding rates and more limited larval nourishment compared to offspring reared by workers and produced later in the colony cycle (future queens or &#x0201c;gynes&#x0201d;). Physiological evidence of nourishment-related differences between workers and gynes collected from naturally-founded colonies in the field include greater fat body stores in gynes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], greater quantities of the storage protein <italic>hexamerin 1</italic> in gynes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and greater quantities of four additional proteins in gynes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Experimental studies show that nourishment inequalities that correspond to early-season and late-season larval development contexts are associated with development of offspring having characteristics of worker and gyne phenotypes, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the established role of nourishment in caste differences in <italic>Polistes,</italic> social factors, such as dominance behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and maternal influences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] also play a role. Jeanne and Suryanarayanan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] propose a hypothesis for caste determination in primitively social wasps that incorporates not only nourishment variability, but also social environmental inputs from maternal care, specifically vibrational signals called antennal drumming. Antennal drumming may be an example of a maternal manipulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] that directs larvae toward a worker developmental trajectory, and this effect may interact with nourishment induced changes in caste phenotype. Thus, nourishment is likely to act in concert with social environmental factors in determining differences in gyne and worker caste development in <italic>Polistes.</italic></p><p>In this study, we investigated the effect of experimental proteinaceous nourishment deprivation during larval development on caste-related gene expression in a primitively eusocial species, the paper wasp <italic>Polistes metricus</italic>. We had three main goals. First, we explored the transcriptional responses of wasp larvae to high and low nourishment levels during laboratory rearing using RNA-sequencing. Second, we tested the hypothesis that nourishment level relates to caste-related gene expression; specifically that low nourishment is associated with more worker-like gene expression patterns, and high nourishment is associated with more gyne-like expression patterns. To do this, we compared nourishment differential expression to a set of nearly 800 previously identified genes associated with caste development in field-reared <italic>P. metricus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and we did so on multiple levels: individual transcripts, pathways and biological functions. Third, we tested whether the molecular mechanisms underlying the response to nourishment are conserved across taxa by comparing our results to two other nourishment deprivation studies in fruit flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and dung beetles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Our overall goal was to better understand the extent and nature of the role of nourishment and nourishment-related genes in caste development in a primitively social wasp species.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Differential expression analysis</title><p>To assess differential gene expression, we mapped reads to a previously assembled de novo transcriptome for <italic>P. metricus</italic>; the transcriptome was based on both the sequence data described here in conjunction with additional samples described in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. By comparing expression patterns from head samples from 8 individual wasp larvae under high and low nourishment, we identified 284 <italic>P. metricus</italic> differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) that differed between low and high nourishment treatments, using DESeq (FDR&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]), heretofore referred to as &#x0201c;<italic>P. metricus</italic> nourishment-responsive DETs&#x0201d;. Of these DETs, 207 (72.9%) were upregulated in low compared to high nourishment larvae (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> is a heat map of the scaled DET read counts across <italic>P. metricus</italic> nourishment samples. Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> includes the list of <italic>P. metricus</italic> nourishment-responsive DETs). Thus, despite the fact that they had less food available, low nourishment led to a majority of genes having higher gene expression, and thus did not simply cause a general shutdown in transcription.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Heat map of the relative expression (sample read counts scaled by library size then across each gene) for the 284 differentially expressed transcripts between nourishment manipulation levels by sample.</bold> Samples are clustered based on relative expression across all differentially expressed transcripts (top), and transcripts are clustered based on relative expression across all samples (left).

The variability of gene expression amongst biological samples is not completely surprising; our previous work has found high inter-individual variation in gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], effects of lab rearing (JM Jandt, JL Thomson, AC Geffre, AL Toth: Rearing environment may bias social traits: A case study with <italic>Polistes</italic> wasps, submitted), and variable effects of nourishment level on physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Validation of select expression patterns via comparison to qRT-PCR data</title><p>It is important to validate RNA-Seq data using another method such as quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). However, for this study, we had limited samples and quantities of RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], so we could not perform qRT-PCR validation on actual samples from this experiment. In lieu of the sample limitations, we instead made a comparison to pre-existing data on nourishment-responsive expression patterns from adult brains of <italic>P. metricus</italic> under starved vs. ad lib food conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Although not ideal because of differences in tissue type and life stage, this comparison still provides a useful point of comparison to validate whether the expression patterns uncovered in this RNA-Seq study are robust.</p><p>Of 24 candidate genes, Daugherty et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] identified 10 genes with differential expression in adult <italic>P. metricus</italic> brains reared under low and high nourishment conditions using qRT-PCR. We tested for a correlation (Spearman) in the log<sub>2</sub> fold changes between the 24 candidate genes from Daugherty et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and the orthologous transcripts in this study, i.e. best BLAST hits between the primer sequences from Daugherty et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and the <italic>P. metricus</italic> transcriptome (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S3 is a visual representation of the log<sub>2</sub> fold changes for both studies; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref> lists the log<sub>2</sub> fold change for each gene/transcript and the directionality for differentially expressed genes). For some genes, there is more than one best BLAST hit to the <italic>P. metricus</italic> transcriptome, so all transcripts were used for the correlation analysis. The gene <italic>PmTOR</italic> is absent from the <italic>P. metricus</italic> transcriptome, so this gene was removed from the analysis. Although none of the orthologous transcripts are significantly differentially expressed in the RNA-seq study, we nonetheless identified a significant positive correlation in log<sub>2</sub> fold changes between these two studies (Spearman &#x003c1;: 0.54, p-value = 0.001), which provides support for our observed RNA-Seq results.</p><p>One reason we may not have observed statistically significant differential expression of these candidate genes in the RNA-Seq study, despite the strong correlation with the qRT-PCR data, is because of the limited statistical power. Differential expression calls are more stringent in this RNA-Seq study compared to the qRT-PCR analysis because familywise error correction is more severe due to the larger number of genes (over 75,000 compared to 24 genes). Furthermore, the qRT-PCR study has a larger sample size (n = 47) compared to the RNA-Seq study (n = 8), which provides greater statistical power for detecting differential expression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Comparison to caste-related gene expression</title><p>Next, we investigated how <italic>P. metricus</italic> nourishment-responsive DETs compared to caste-related gene expression. A previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] compared gene expression in field-collected, early season (worker-destined) larvae to late season (gyne-destined) larvae, and identified 736 caste-related DETs. Both low nourishment (described above) and worker-destined larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] show a pronounced bias towards upregulated gene expression (72.9% upregulated in low nourishment and 91.7% upregulated in worker-destined larvae). This pattern generally agrees with the prediction that worker-destined and nourishment-deprived larvae have similar transcriptional states.</p><p>There was a statistically significant but relatively small overlap (43 transcripts) between the nourishment-responsive and caste-related DETs (Chi-square with Yates&#x02019; correction: p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001). Of these shared DETs, the directionality of gene expression change was unexpected: eight (18.6%) were upregulated in low nourishment larvae compared to high nourishment larvae, whereas 38 (88.4%) were upregulated in worker-destined larvae relative to queen-destined larvae (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a for a Venn diagram of the number of unique and overlapping caste and nourishment-responsive DETs, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1 for a heatmap of the overlapping caste and nourishment-responsive DETs, and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref> for the list of overlapping DETs). To further explore these data beyond examining an overlap of gene lists, we performed a combined statistical analysis of data from both the nourishment level and caste contrasts, and the results also indicate some overlap in gene expression patterns across the two studies (see Methods, with complete description of the approach and results in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Taken together, these results partially support our prediction of gene expression similarity between nourishment-responsive and caste-related gene expression but suggest some unanticipated dissimilarities between them.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>

Using best BLAST hits to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, very few transcripts (799 = 1.0% of the transcriptome) were annotated with enzyme codes for the KEGG analysis with Blast2GO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for a list of transcripts annotated with enzyme codes by KEGG pathway). The presence of many transcripts without homology is a shortcoming of the dataset, but is expected and standard for Illumina-based data from non-model species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Only 7% (20) of the nourishment DETs were known members of KEGG pathways, therefore we identified very few (7 of 118) KEGG pathways with at least one DET. We then looked to see if these seven pathways were also related to caste differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Four of the seven pathways also had caste-related DETs (including glycerolipid metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, and purine metabolism; listed in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>), but this amount of overlap was not statistically significant (Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, p-value = 0.12).

However, this overlap between paper wasps and dung beetles is again consistent in the directionality of nourishment-responsiveness with shared DETs being upregulated in low nourishment individuals (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>).

We identified 285 nourishment differential expression transcripts (DETs) between larvae raised experimentally on low vs. high nourishment, many of which are associated with lipid metabolism and oxidation-reduction activity. Most (73%) of the <italic>Polistes</italic> nourishment-responsive transcripts are upregulated in larvae with low nourishment, which is opposite to the pattern observed in other insects including fruit flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and dung beetles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. There were few conserved nourishment-responsive transcripts across species, and these were related to aminoglycan metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and oxidation-reduction activity. Among transcripts corresponding to those functions, our data show some cross-species consistency in the direction of expression in response to nourishment deprivation. The overall picture from our preliminary cross-species comparisons is that it is largely different genes that show transcriptional responses to nourishment stress across insect orders. However, it is important to note that transcriptional similarities across these three systems may be underestimated from our analysis because of inconsistencies in the datasets such as analyzing different life stages and tissue types. Further work with directly comparable datasets is needed in order to better understand the extent of conservation of nourishment-responsive gene expression across taxa.</p><p>Nourishment inequalities have long been considered the most important environmental determinant of castes in <italic>Polistes</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. If nourishment plays a major role in caste bias in <italic>P. metricus</italic>, we predicted that worker-destined larvae from natural nests in the field would have similar transcript expression patterns as experimental low nourishment larvae. With respect to directionality of overall transcript expression, this was the case &#x02014; most DETs were upregulated in worker-destined larvae (92.1%) and in low nourishment larvae (72.9%). This work agrees with previous work in honey bees that also showed more genes with worker-biased expression in larvae, but more genes with queen-biased expression later in development (pupal stage) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We also found a small but statistically significant overlap (43 common transcripts) between nourishment-responsive and caste-related DETs in <italic>Polistes</italic> (Chi-square with Yates&#x02019; correction: p &#x0003c; 0.0001; Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1). Focusing on the 43 common DETs, however, shows that the majority of these were upregulated in worker-destined larvae but down-regulated in low nourishment larvae, which is opposite to our prediction and to the pattern of all DETs. This suggests that while nourishment restriction in the laboratory may lead to upregulation of transcript expression in some of the same pathways that are related to worker development, this manipulation did not succeed in causing a full shift to worker-like transcript expression patterns.</p><p>There was also a significant overlap in nourishment-responsive and caste-related expression at the GO functional level, with terms related to metabolism, protein binding, and oxidation reduction activity (Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). On the level of pathways, we identified a few shared KEGG pathways between nourishment and caste datasets (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>), which may be due to the low annotation rate of nourishment-responsive DETs. Although there is limited overlap at the level of KEGG pathways, we did observe the expected pattern of directionality in gene expression, with the majority of DETs upregulated in low nourishment and worker-destined larvae for all pathways.</p><p>Overall, our data suggest that nourishment level caused a partial shift in gene expression, with low nourishment individuals being more worker-like and high nourishment individuals being more gyne-like. However, it is pertinent to note that the nourishment manipulation may not have resulted in a strong nutritional stress; i.e., wasps may have compensated for low proteinaceous food availability by consuming more sugar. In a recent study examining adult wasps reared from the same nests as the larvae analyzed here, the nourishment manipulation caused only a partial shift in caste-related physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In that study, total lipid and protein hemolymph levels in adults were not affected by low nourishment, whereas adults that had been reared with low nourishment showed greater ovary development after two weeks of being fed while in isolation. This counterintuitive observation corresponds to previous studies showing that adult workers collected in the field have greater ovary development than better-nourished gynes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and substantial evidence that workers are in a physiological state ready to reproduce upon emergence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], whereas gynes are in reproductive diapause until after the overwintering period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Taken together, the physiological data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and transcriptomic data (this study) indicate that nourishment alone did not completely shift the developmental trajectory of larvae towards one caste or another.</p><p>One important caveat of our study is that the effects of the nourishment treatment on gene expression and physiology may be influenced by laboratory rearing, which may produce conflicting results compared to a natural field setting (JM Jandt, JL Thomson, AC Geffre, AL Toth: Rearing environment may bias social traits: A case study with <italic>Polistes</italic> wasps, submitted). Lab-reared wasps typically have higher lipid stores perhaps due to both overfeeding and inactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], and lab-rearing can perturb caste-related gene expression (JM Jandt, JL Thomson, AC Geffre, AL Toth: Rearing environment may bias social traits: A case study with <italic>Polistes</italic> wasps, submitted). Two genes (<italic>inositol oxygenase</italic> and <italic>Hsp90alpha</italic>) known to exhibit caste-specific gene expression are perturbed due to lab rearing, but neither gene was differentially expressed in the current study. In addition, the low and high nourishment samples in our study were reared by single foundresses with unrestricted access to sucrose as opposed to the two feeding levels for caterpillars that they fed to larvae. Diets with a high carbohydrate to protein ratio can cause an increase in lipid levels in the insect fat body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The effects of lab-rearing could thus be a factor in some of the non-overlap we observed between nourishment-responsive and caste-related DETs in the current study. Nonetheless, our data do suggest that low nourishment can trigger expression of some of the same genes and pathways that are associated with worker caste development in <italic>Polistes metricus.</italic></p><p>Our results provide insight into the role of nourishment in the differential gene expression patterns that lead to different castes in <italic>Polistes</italic>. Our results also support the notion that nourishment inequalities alone cannot explain all caste variability in gene expression. Instead, caste-related gene expression bias is likely to be additionally influenced by social factors such as dominance behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], vibrational communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and/or epigenetically mediated environmental influences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Further work on gene expression in relation to nourishment, other influences on caste determination in <italic>Polistes,</italic> and interactions among them can further advance our growing understanding of caste determination in primitively social wasps.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study provides new data on nourishment-responsive gene expression in the context of caste development for <italic>Polistes metricus</italic>, a model for studying the evolution of social insect castes. We identified suites of nourishment-responsive transcripts in developing <italic>P. metricus</italic> larvae. Interestingly, most transcripts were upregulated when larvae experienced proteinaceous nourishment deprivation; thus, reduced food level did not shut down gene expression but instead resulted in active transcription of many genes including several involved in lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and oxidation-reduction processes. By comparing to previously reported caste-related gene expression patterns from the same species, we uncovered some similarity in transcripts, pathways, and gene functions related to both nourishment deprivation and worker caste-biased expression. However, many caste-associated genes were not found to be nourishment-responsive, so there are additional factors (likely including many social environmental factors) that influence caste-related gene expression. These results support the notion that nourishment level during development can somewhat bias development into queen or worker caste as adults, but leave room for other factors, and thus underscore the complex and multifactorial nature of caste development.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Samples</title><p>We collected adult female <italic>P. metricus</italic> wasps in early March 2009 near Raleigh, NC, as they were exiting the attic of a house in which they had passed the winter in behavioral quiescence and reproductive diapause. Single wasps were placed in cages 30&#x000a0;cm in length, width, and height constructed of clear plastic with plastic screen on the top and two sides. An opening in the top was covered with a piece of hardboard 10&#x000a0;cm square with a nest from a previous season attached to the underside. Nests were trimmed to seven cells ca. 0.5&#x000a0;cm deep, and meconia (larval feces) of the original nest occupants were removed. Each seven-cell nest therefore served as a &#x0201c;starter&#x0201d; nest on which the newly-captured wasps could initiate construction and then expand as their own. Construction paper was the pulp source for nest construction.</p><p>Caged wasps were placed on wire racks in a growth chamber 1.2&#x000a0;m &#x000d7; 2.5&#x000a0;m &#x000d7; 2.1&#x000a0;m in the North Carolina State University Phytotron. The chamber contained incandescent lights on a 16&#x000a0;L/8D cycle; fluorescent lights came on 2&#x000a0;h following and went off 2&#x000a0;h before the incandescent lights. Light intensity was 21 micromoles/sec/m<sup>2</sup> in the incandescent-only morning and evening periods and 225 micromoles/sec/m<sup>2</sup> during the both-lights midday. Chamber temperature was 20&#x000b0;C at night and 30&#x000b0;C during full light, with a gradual ramp-up in the morning and ramp-down in the evening. Each day, we repositioned cages in a rotation pattern to distribute any light or temperature variation in the chamber across all colonies over the course of the experiment.</p><p>Each cage was provided with ad libitum sucrose (rock candy) and a water source (15&#x000a0;ml tube plugged with cotton). Both high and low nourishment groups had equal access to sucrose, but differed in the amount of proteinaceous food provided. Proteinaceous nourishment was provided in the form of late 3<sup>rd</sup> or early 4<sup>th</sup>-instar <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> larva ca. 2.0&#x000a0;cm in length. Low nourishment foundresses received one caterpillar every fourth day. After May 22, the feeding schedule for low nourishment foundresses was accelerated to one caterpillar every three days. In the high nourishment treatment, foundresses were provided with caterpillars <italic>ad lib</italic>, adjusted each day to one caterpillar above the number that had been consumed since the previous day&#x02019;s provisioning. For this experiment, we collected the largest final instar larva in each nest immediately following spinning of a cocoon by the third larva in the nest to do so. Those three larvae were allowed to develop into adults that then were analyzed for developmental and physiological characteristics. These results were published separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. For our study, four larvae per treatment were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80&#x000b0;C prior to RNA extraction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>RNA-extraction and RNA-sequencing</title><p><italic>Polistes</italic> possess behaviorally distinct, not morphologically distinct castes, thus we were especially interested in developmental expression changes in larval brains. This led us to choose larval heads as the target tissue for our analysis. Whole heads were used rather than whole brains because of concerns about larval brain dissection quality and low RNA yields. We acknowledge that it is likely that the nourishment manipulation caused additional gene expression changes in other tissues we did not sample. However, we did not use whole bodies for two reasons: 1) our primary interest in brains and behavioral castes, and 2) the fact that brain gene expression differences in social insects can be subtle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], meaning that high levels of expression from the fat body and other tissues could have drowned out expression patterns from the brain.</p><p>To preserve RNA during dissection, we removed the head region (indicated by dark coloration) of each individual larva, while kept on dry ice, using a sterilized razor blade. From these individual larval heads, we extracted total RNA using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Quigen), which was quality controlled using spectrophotometry (NanoDrop 2000) and a Bioanalyzer (Agilent). The High-Throughput Sequencing and Genotyping Unit of the W.M.
