Validation of results by western blot, confocal microscopy and enzyme analysis helped to strengthen findings and further our understanding into the role of these specialized cells.

In plants, successful single cell type analysis has been undertaken for only a handful of cell types, including pollen grains, but also, due to ease of isolation, cells of the epidermis, such as root hairs, guard cells and trichomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Trichomes are highly differentiated cell types found on the aerial epidermis of most plants. These specialized cells vary morphologically and functionally, with roles in plant defence, stress tolerance, water collection, seed dispersal and leaf structure. They can range from simple unicellular hair-like extensions to multicellular complex appendages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. They are classified as non-secreting or glandular-secreting trichomes; the latter can secrete a vast array of substances including lipophilic compounds, proteins, ions, sugars and secondary plant products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Halophyte plant species have evolved several different types of trichomes ranging from bi- or multi-cellular glands of the Poaceae, which actively excrete salt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], to non-glandular (non-secreting) trichomes called epidermal bladder cells (EBC). These EBC are attached to either the epidermis via stalk cells, as in the Chenopodiaceae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], or stalk-less as in the Mesembryanthemaceae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the halophyte <italic>Mesembryanthemum crystallinum</italic> these single celled EBC are present on leaves, stems and flower buds. Cell morphology changes with plant age and metabolic/stress state of the plant. In young plants the EBC are small and flattened to the leaf surface and stem, whereas in adult plants that are undergoing Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), and particularly those exposed to salt, the cells swell up and appear as liquid filled balloons. On average, the diameter of EBC can be 1&#x000a0;mm with an average cell volume of 500&#x000a0;nl; although volumes in excess of 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Early work on the physiology of EBC in <italic>M. crystallinum</italic> concluded that these cells were predominantly involved in water storage during times of reduced water availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, we now know that they are also substantial stores for sodium ions. EBC have been shown to accumulate as much as 1.2&#x000a0;M Na<sup>+</sup> which is thought to be sequestered into the large central vacuole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Evidence that EBC are essential for salt tolerance of <italic>M. crystallinum</italic>, comes from studying a mutant that had reduced numbers of these specialized cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Mutant plants showed diminished Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation capacity, reduced leaf and stem water content and a significant reduction in seed number, however the gene involved was not identified.</p><p>Initial proteomic profiling of the EBC extract isolated from salt-treated adult <italic>M. crystallinum</italic> plants by single cell sampling techniques and shot-gun LC-MS/MS was only able to identify 84 proteins at high confidence. These belonged to diverse functional classes, including proteins involved in ion and water homeostasis, but also photosynthesis related proteins and proteins associated with CAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Understanding which proteins are critical and central for bladder cell function and adaptation to salt stress can only be obtained by direct comparisons between EBC from untreated plants and plants that have been salt-treated. In this study, we carry out large-scale complementary quantitative proteomic studies using both a label and label-free approach to identify salt-responsive proteins in the EBC extract. Using these approaches, we were able to identify 438 proteins at high confidence and show significant changes between treatment conditions in 54 of these. In order to confirm these results a number of the proteins were then validated by western blot analysis. In parallel, an ionomics analysis was carried out to determine the ion profile of the bladder cells and how this may change under salinity stress with the accumulation of sodium in these cells. These results, combined with our previous transcriptomics and metabolomics profiling data, allow for an integrated view of the adaptive responses occurring in the bladder cells to salt-treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Quantitative proteomic analysis</title><p>To identify salt-responsive proteins in EBC extracts, a study combining complementary 2D-DIGE and 1D-PAGE with label-free LC-MS/MS (GeLC-MS/MS) based quantification methods was performed to compare proteins in extract from salt-treated plants to EBC extract from untreated control plants with the aim to maximize the coverage of the proteome. The use of distinctive approaches, which exploit alternative technologies requiring unique sample handling procedures, helped to obtain a greater coverage of the salt-responsive proteome.</p><p>Spot maps from 2D-DIGE gels resolved on average 1384 spots in each of the four gels following automatic detection in the DIA module of the Decyder 6.5 software; a representative image of one of the gels is shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>A. The majority of the protein spots were observed within a pH range of 4 to 7, but there were also numerous protein spots in the acidic and basic regions of the gels, including a large smear of unresolved protein which ran at the basic limit (pH&#x000a0;11) of the IEF gel. The BVA module of the Decyder 6.5 software was used for inter-gel matching and was performed by means of automatically land marking spots in the Cy2 internal standard images from each gel and then manually confirming matched spots. To ensure robust matching a minimum of 30 spots were landmarked and confirmed in each of the gels. Statistical analysis was then performed on matched spots to identify differentially abundant proteins between the control and salt-treated EBC samples. This is performed automatically by normalizing spot volumes against the internal standard. To be included for downstream LC-MS/MS analysis statistically significant, differentially abundant proteins were required to fulfil several criteria: (1) Spots must be present and matched in all spot maps from all gel images (12/12). (2) Spots which showed differential abundance between experimental conditions based on the Log standardized protein abundance were required to have a Student <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.03. (3) Spots should not be observed to overlap with adjoining protein spots on the gel as this could result in contamination with unrelated neighbouring proteins which would result in false positives. Following this filtering, differentially expressed proteins were narrowed down to 22 proteins (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Of these, 16 were shown to increase in abundance and six were shown to decrease in abundance, in the salt-treated samples compared to the control samples; with 13 of the 22 spots showing fold-changes greater than&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Graphical view of the standardized log abundance of these spots in control vs salt-treated samples from each of the four biological replicates as well as the average standardized log abundance is shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>B.

We were unable to detect protein in three spots (923, 1064, and 1290) and in two of the spots (740 and 1123) we identified more than one protein. These 19 spots corresponded to 14 different proteins. Products expressed from a single gene can migrate to multiple spots on 2D gels for a variety of reasons indicating protein modifications leading to a change in overall protein charge and/or molecular weight (MW) such as splice variants, proteolytic cleavage products, and processed proteins, as well as post-translational modified proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>In parallel, a complementary proteomics approach was carried out using GeLC&#x02013;MS/MS, in which protein, from EBC extracts collected from control and salt-treated plants under the exact same conditions as for the 2D-DIGE analysis, was separated by 1D-GE. Each lane, representing one biological replicate of a total of 3, was then sliced into seven pieces as indicated in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>. This was followed by in-gel digestion and analysis of the resulting tryptic peptide mixtures by LC-MS/MS. In total, 1731 unique peptides derived from 438 proteins were identified in the six EBC samples. For subsequent analyses, only those proteins that were detected in all three biological replicates of either control or salt-treated samples (or both) by at least two unique peptides were considered (225 proteins). For the analysis of the presence/absence of the proteins in different biological replicates, unweighted spectral counts were used.</p><p>A quantitative comparison between control and salt-treated EBC samples using spectral counting as a measure of protein abundance and applying several methods including Total spectra count (TSC), Weighted spectra count (WSC), Exponentially Modified Protein Abundance Index (emPAI), and Normalized Spectral Abundance Factor (NSAF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] was applied to identify salt-responsive proteins (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Quantification by spectral count has been shown to be a simple but reliable index for relative protein quantification and has been proven to be both reproducible and accurate over a large dynamic range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. To evaluate the significance of comparative quantification by each of the spectral count methods Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test was performed on the data as this has been shown to be most appropriate when comparing three or more replicates as was the case in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and differences were assigned to be significant at either a <italic>p</italic> value of&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05 (*) or a <italic>p</italic> value of&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.01 (**), and the fold change of abundance of salt-treated to control was selected as greater than&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In total, 40 proteins (approximately 18&#x000a0;%) met the criteria and showed significant changes in salt-treated samples as compared to control, untreated samples. Of these 14 were significant using all four spectral count methods, while 13 and 12 were significant using three or two methods, respectively (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Only one of the proteins was significant using only a single method. Two of the proteins identified were exclusive to the salt-treated samples and four were only detected in the control samples, showing reported fold changes of either infinity, or zero, respectively (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). We chose not to give these proteins an arbitrary fold-change value as it has been shown that errors in protein ratios can be made when minimum spectral counts in one sample equals zero [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].<graphic xlink:href="12870_2016_797_Tab2_HTML.gif" id="MO1"/><table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Salt-responsive proteins identified by GeLC-MS Label Free Quantitative Proteomics</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12870_2016_797_Tab2_HTML" id="MO20"/><table-wrap-foot><p>

To verify this we followed the diurnal fluctuations in pH and organic acids in the EBC extract. EBC from salt-treated plants showed the classic day/night changes in pH characteristic of CAM which were absent in the untreated control plants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). These changes were directly related to the nocturnal storage of CO<sub>2</sub> in the form of organic acids and the subsequent remobilization and decarboxylation of the organic acids during the light period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. As malate is the predominant form of organic acid stored in most CAM plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], the malate content of the EBC was measured from the end of the dark period to the end of the light period (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Diurnal fluctuations in malate content in salt treated plants correlated closely with the changes in pH measured in EBC, however at the end of the light period there was a more rapid reduction in malate levels than was reflected by changes in the pH. This suggested the presence of additional organic acids such as citrate in the EBC, whose decarboxylation during the day has been shown to be delayed in comparison to malate in species undergoing CAM metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Metabolomic profiling of EBC extracts at the start of the light period has shown the presence of other dicarboxylic acids, however only maleate, a trans-isomer of fumaric acid, was shown to be significantly altered following salt treatment at this time of day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

In combination with multi-omics approaches, we can begin to build a comprehensive integrated picture of cellular processes within the bladder cell. In this study, we performed both label and label-free proteomics and carried out ionomics analysis of the EBC extracts from control and salt-treated plants, to complete our omics analysis of these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>The complementary nature of the quantitative proteomics technologies used in this study (2D-DIGE and 1D-GE label free) is underscored by the lack of overlap in the proteins identified (Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This highlights the advantage of combining different approaches and techniques to obtain a greater coverage of the proteome. Differences in sample handling, from the composition of the sample buffers to the gel separation conditions, combined with the physicochemical properties of the proteins in the sample result in unique differences in protein profiling between the two approaches helping to maximize the number of proteins identified. Using GeLC-MS/MS we were able to identify 141 more proteins than had previously been identified employing shotgun LC-MS/MS; an increase of 2.7 fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These numbers are based on the identification of at least two unique peptides and the protein being present in all three biological replicates of either control or salt-treated samples for GeLC-MS/MS (this study), or two of four biological replicates from our previous LC-MS/MS profiling study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Using this criteria, only 11 proteins were exclusive to the previous LC-MS/MS analysis. Obtaining comprehensive protein profiles from very complex samples is challenging due to the large number of proteins present in the sample over a wide dynamic range in abundance. In the EBC extract a cysteine protease makes up nearly 50&#x000a0;% of the identified spectra in the samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and is the most abundant protein on SDS-PAGE gels (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref> - asterisks). The high abundance of this protein would result in an under sampling of the low abundant proteins in the fraction. GeLC-MS/MS helped to overcome this problem by decreasing sample complexity, and when directly compared to LC-MS/MS in this study and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], it was shown to perform better in the number of protein identifications, reproducibility of identifications and % coefficient of variance on spectral counts.</p><p>Multi-omics data integration is challenging for plant-derived pathways and particularly for non-model plants, however, better insight into functional networks can be gained if we incorporate data compiled from different technologies. From information from this study and our previous omics analysis of EBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], a picture is emerging of a metabolically active cell, photosynthetically active and undertaking CAM, with salinity treatment resulting in decreased abundance of photosynthetic machinery proteins, increases in enzymes involved in photorespiration, glycolysis and proteins specific for CAM. (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). High metabolic activity highlights the considerable energy cost to drive compatible solute synthesis and Na accumulation in the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. From the 54 proteins that showed significant fold changes with salt treatment and were present in all biological replicates, a high proportion of those identified can be classified as transport proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Of these, four were subunits of the peripheral cytoplasmic V<sub>1</sub> sector of the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, V-ATPase; VHA-G, VHA-A, VHA-B and VHA-E (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Western blot analysis using subunit specific antibodies confirmed the increase in VHA-B and VHA-E, (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and results were corroborated for VHA-A and VHA-B from our previous EBC transcriptomics study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Transcriptomics data also revealed changes in additional VHA V1 subunits, including VHA-D, VHA-F, VHA-H, but also subunits of the V<sub>0</sub> membrane sector, VHA-c and VHA-d (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). While these were not detected in the proteomics study, western blot analysis was able to confirm the change in abundance of VHA-c (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These results for EBC extracted total protein are in agreement to results reported for whole leaf microsomal proteomic analysis of <italic>M. crystallinum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In that study significant changes in subunits VHA-A, VHA-E, but also VHA-a, were identified; additionally, although not significant, changes in relative abundance were also measured for VHA-B, VHA-G, VHA-H, VHA-c and VHA-d [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, results would comprise a mix of protein originating from up to 15 cell types with diverse functions in the leaf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In plants, the V-ATPase is not only present on the vacuolar membrane (tonoplast) but also endosomal vesicular compartments, where it has a role in luminal pH control, vesicle trafficking and generation of an electrochemical gradient for ion transport. Recent evidence employing V-ATPase mutants showed that the tonoplast localized V-ATPase does not play a role in salt tolerance, as despite lacking a functional tonoplast V-ATPase, mutants were still able to accumulate sodium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Moreover, although capturing multiple full-length transcripts for tonoplast localized Na/H exchangers (NXH), none of them showed significant induction in response to salt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and no NHX proteins were identified in our quantitative proteomics analysis (Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Therefore, changes in abundance of V-ATPase in EBC observed in this study may be important for energizing the uptake of sodium into endosomal vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], which are then delivered to and fuse with the tonoplast. Additionally, V-ATPase activity would be essential for turgor generation to facilitate rapid cell expansion of the EBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The role of the V-ATPase in determining cell shape and size through turgor generations has been demonstrated by studying Arabidopsis VHA-C mutants, which showed reduced cell expansion of specific cell types due to reduced turgor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Integration of transcript, protein, metabolite and ionome data into EBC metabolic pathways.
