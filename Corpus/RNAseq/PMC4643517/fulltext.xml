With recent development it is nowadays possible to analyze ultra-low input sample material down to single cells. Nevertheless, investigating such sample material often limits the analysis to either the genome or transcriptome.

Amongst them, transcriptome as well as whole-genome sequencing were of prime interest. Both sequencing methods have tremendously accelerated our understanding of both the more dynamic function of RNAs and the more static composition of the genome within a functional cell. Transcriptome sequencing focuses on deciphering the complex expression pattern of RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], therefore identifying novel expressed RNAs and transcript variants as well as isoforms which in turn lead to a better understanding of cell regulation, function and networks. Whole-genome sequencing has for example highlighted insights into the subtle differences amongst the human population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] or major genomic re-arrangements found in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] with both having a significant impact on cell fate and the living organism.</p><p>Major improvements for the preparation of sequencing libraries for RNA-seq as well as DNA-seq have emerged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]; continually reducing the input amount needed which is generally in the microgram range. Within recent years the field of single-cell sequencing for transcriptome and genome sequencing has advanced significantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. There are already many examples available were either RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], or DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] have been analyzed down to the single-cell resolution. Recently, studies with the combined analysis of the genome and transcriptome of the same cell have also been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This is especially advantageous for applications where only a small fraction of the sample should be analyzed, or more importantly, where the sample is composed of a few cells only. Such scenarios include for example early embryonic development which starts from a single cell expanding to a few dozen cells within the first developmental stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The elucidation of intra-tumor heterogeneity in biopsies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] as well as in <italic>in-vitro</italic> grown primary tumor spheres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], or the characterization of circulating tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] rely on the analyses of limited cell material. In addition, <italic>in-vitro</italic> cultured stem cells from both mouse and human are limited in the number of cells if sub-population and sub-colony differences in terms of gene expression are under investigation. For all settings, already subtle changes in genome integrity can have a major impact on the expression and regulation of RNAs, and proteins within cells.</p><p>Despite the advancements for both areas of sequencing minute amounts of either RNA or DNA, an assay enabling the combined sequencing of RNA and DNA from the very same sample still in the ultra-low input range would add to our understanding of the regulation and developmental processes affected by both, the function of genome integrity as well as RNA expression and gene function.</p><p>Here we describe a method which enables the preparation of whole transcriptome amplified cDNA as well as the generation of whole-genome amplified DNA from the same ultra-low input material derived from a sub-colony of <italic>in-vitro</italic> cultivated human embryonic stem cells. Firstly, whole transcriptome amplified cDNA was prepared from mRNA only by using oligo-dT coupled magnetic beads, following cDNA synthesis, 3'-tailing and PCR amplification. Secondly, after magnetic coupling of the mRNA/oligo-dT beads, whole-genome amplified DNA was prepared from the retained DNA by Phi29 mediated amplification. Both, the amplified cDNA as well as DNA were subjected to standard procedures for multiplex short fragment library preparation enabling Illumina sequencing. Using this approach, both the transcriptome as well as the genome of the same sample could be analyzed on both levels of nucleic acids present in cells, the RNA and DNA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ultra-low input RNA sequencing</title><p>In brief, cells for RNA-seq were collected from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) serving as biological samples.

After cell lysis, the solution was supplemented with oligo-dT coupled magnetic micro-beads and transferred to columns placed in a magnetic field for further processing. To selectively enrich mRNA out of the total RNA, cDNA synthesis was performed with oligo-dT coupled magnetic beads. After on column cDNA synthesis, beads with cDNA were retained by centrifugation followed by 5&#x02032;-tailing and PCR amplification. The size distribution of amplified cDNA ranged from 200&#x02013;3000 base pairs. PCR products were fragmented by sonication to 150 to 300 base pairs and multiplex fragment library preparation was performed for paired-end Illumina sequencing. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> gives an overview of the developed methodology.</p><p>In this study we report data from sequencing of two hESC samples in the low sub-colony range (150&#x02013;200 cells, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) which were analyzed by 100 base pair paired-end sequencing on a single flow cell on an Illumina HiSeq instrument. We obtained 314.2 million raw reads on a single lane, after barcode mapping for sample allocation we obtained 65.2 million reads for RNA-seq sample 1 and 58.8 million reads for RNA-seq sample 2 respectively. Furthermore 190.5 million reads belonged to whole genome sequencing performed for sample 1. The RNA-seq reads were mapped with Tophat resulting in 58.9 and 54.7 million mapped reads (90.2 and 93.5&#x000a0;%) correspondingly. The number of duplicate reads was found to be 1.9&#x000a0;% for the WGA-DNA sample and 54.6 and 52.8&#x000a0;% for the RNA-seq sample 1 and 2 respectively. Duplicate read counts were based on mapped reads with the same start and end point. In total 11,755 Refseq genes with a read coverage of&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;5 reads were identified (sample 1: 8523; sample 2: 10,908; overlap: 7676) in both hESC samples.</p><p>Next imperative parameters for RNA-seq were determined based on the Refseq dataset, specifically the total length of mRNA showing sequence coverage and coverage distribution along the 5'- to 3'-orientation. Since we performed cDNA synthesis by oligo-dT priming it is common sense to observe a bias towards the 3&#x02032;-end of genes, especially for long transcripts (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The median length of Refseq cDNAs observed were around 900&#x02013;1100 base pairs ranging from approximately 450 to 2000 base pairs (lower and upper quartile) with single cDNAs longer than 10&#x000a0;kb (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). The average coverage distribution along the 5'- to 3'-orientation of Refseq genes was calculated for transcript size intervals of 0&#x02013;1&#x000a0;kb, 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;kb, 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;kb, 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;kb, 4&#x02013;5&#x000a0;kb and 5&#x02013;15&#x000a0;kb. For transcripts in the range of 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;kb normalized coverage was almost 80&#x000a0;% over the full transcript length with decreasing coverage towards the last 15&#x000a0;% of bases at the 5&#x02032;-end. For transcripts ranging from 2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;kb normalized coverage was at least 50&#x000a0;% (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Subsequently we evaluated the correlation between both RNA-seq samples. This was done by comparing FPKM values obtained for expressed Refseq genes resulting in a Pearson&#x02019;s correlation factor of 0.85 for RNA-seq sample 1 and sample 2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Comparison of RNAseq data in terms of transcript identification. <bold>a</bold> Read coverage across transcripts with coverage for transcripts of sizes 0&#x000a0;kb-1&#x000a0;kb, 1&#x000a0;kb-2&#x000a0;kb, 2&#x000a0;kb-3&#x000a0;kb, 3&#x000a0;kb-4&#x000a0;kb, 4&#x000a0;kb-5&#x000a0;kb and 5&#x000a0;kb-15&#x000a0;kb.

The BeadArray experiments were performed with the appropriate amount of mRNA in comparison to the low input RNA-seq experiments. A comparison of expressed Refseq genes for both RNA-seq samples and the Illumina BeadArray showed a high degree of concordance for both methods. For analysis only genes were included which gave rise to FPKM &#x0003e;0.5 for NGS data and <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c;0.05 in BeadArray and were considered significant. In total 13,630 genes were identified in both RNA-seq samples whereas the BeadArray identified 10,834 genes. The total overlap between both sequencing experiments and the BeadArray was found to be 3486 Refseq genes. Moreover the overlap for RNA-seq sample 1 and BeadArray was found to be 4081 and for RNA-seq sample 2 to be 5172, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Next, a Consensus Pathway Data Base (CPDB) overrepresentation analysis was performed to identify congruence of BeadArray and NGS experiments in terms of overlapping genes and categories (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Significant genes from all experiments were analyzed in CPDB for categories using pathways from KEGG, Reactome, BioCarta and Wikipathways and compared for categories with a <italic>p</italic>-value threshold of 0.05. In total 506 categories were identified for the BeadArray experiment and 375 and 415 categories for RNA sequencing sample 1 and sample 2 respectively. Overall overlap for all experiments was found to be 238 and for BeadArray and combined RNA samples 322 categories. For RNA sequencing sample 1 and RNA sample 2 only the overlap was found to be 320 categories.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Overlap between microarray and sequencing measurements. <bold>a.1</bold> Venn diagram displaying overlap of significant genes found in the Illumina microarray and next-generation sequencing (NGS) experiments.

The DNA contained in the human embryonic stem cells was collected during magnetic coupling of the mRNA/oligo-dT complexes and before cDNA synthesis was performed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The retained DNA was subjected to Phi29 mediated whole genome amplification (WGA) producing high molecular mass DNA. The WGA DNA was subjected to sonication (range 200&#x02013;250 base pairs), followed by paired-end fragment library preparation and multiplex sequencing on the same flow cell as the mRNA samples on an Illumina HiSeq instrument. In total 190.5 million reads corresponding to the DNA of sample 1 were obtained. From these 153.5 million reads (80.6&#x000a0;%) could be mapped to hg19, giving rise to an average 6-fold genome coverage. The coverage for individual chromosomes ranged from 3-fold coverage for the X-chromosome to 13-fold coverage for chromosome 19 respectively. Furthermore chromosome coverage on a single base pair resolution was found to be &#x02265;90.0&#x000a0;% for twelve chromosomes (chromosomes 2&#x02013;5, 7, 10&#x02013;12, 17&#x02013;20).

Aiming the great advantages of a combined analysis, latest studies include different approaches for genome and transcriptome sequencing of the same cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Within the pre-NGS era the analysis of single cells was performed by a combination of microarray-based techniques for gene expression and comparative genomic hybridization to study genomic aberrations from the same cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Enabling a profound transcriptome as well as genome analysis by next generation sequencing from minute amounts of sample material will have many applications and will enable the study of rare cells. These rare cells may originate from cell-type specific differentiation of stem cells, but also from cancer tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], circulating tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and early embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] amongst others. Furthermore, it is known that micro-heterogeneity plays a fundamental role not only for stem cell function but for many biological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Having tools to dissect these micro-heterogeneities on a transcriptomic as well as genomic level can help to further understand the underlying function of biological processes and might become of clinical relevance not only in cancer therapies but also in personalized medicine like pharmacogenomics or prenatal diagnosis.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that a combined transcriptome and genome analysis is feasible from minute amounts of sample material. Sequencing was performed from 150&#x02013;200 hESC which equals about 200&#x000a0;pg total RNA according to the findings of Islam et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and about 1&#x000a0;ng of DNA for a diploid genome. In our approach the developed method for combined transcriptome and genome sequencing generated robust and quantitative data for studying gene expression, isoforms etc. on one hand and the genome on the other hand. This appears an especially advantageous situation in the case of studying cancer where remarkable chromosome instability causes genome heterogeneity and is directly linked to alterations in transcriptome dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The effect of genomic copy number variations and SNPs on the transcriptome has been investigated with an integrative approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A further elucidation of the impact of genomic alterations on the phenotype of a cell can be analyzed preferentially by the presented method, where DNA and RNA are sequenced from the very same cell material.</p><p>Obtaining full length coverage of expressed genes is vital for the identification of isoforms and splice variants. Therefore we specifically evaluated the average coverage along Refseq genes from the 5'- to the 3'-end. We found noteworthy variation in terms of average coverage from the 5'- to the 3'-end with significant more reads observed at the 3&#x02032;-end of the transcript. Hence our RNA-seq data reflect a bias towards the 3'-end mainly attributed to the application of oligo-dT primed cDNA preparation. This finding is in agreement with findings of other groups who analyzed minute amounts of sample material down to single cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Other protocols offer highly multiplexed single-cell sequencing, nevertheless only a limited number of bases either from the 5'-end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] or the 3'-end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] are sequenced to enable mainly gene expression studies. The duplication rate for mapped reads found in both RNA-seq samples is in line with comparable approaches eg by Adiconis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] where also an oligo-dT RNA preparation was performed and a duplication rate for low input samples of ~20&#x000a0;% (SMARTseq) and ~90&#x000a0;% (TRUseq) was reported. In their publication Dey et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] do not present any information about duplicate reads observed in DNAseq and RNAseq, presumably due to their unique combined RNA and DNA amplification approach. The number of duplicate read counts observed by Macaulay et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] ranged from 10 to &#x0003c;50&#x000a0;% for genome sequencing depending on cell line and cell number analyzed, unfortunately no read count for duplicate reads are given for RNA-seq, only the number of total and mapped reads are presented. Therefore the duplicate reads we found for RNA-seq seem currently more or less normal, nevertheless it is desirable to reduce the number in future, to make sequencing more efficient.</p><p>Purification of mRNA from the much more abundant ribosomal RNA using magnetic micro beads coupled to oligo-dT primers has become a widely established method in the last years. The recovery of complementary poly-T sequences is relatively high, whereas non-target RNAs represent an insignificant part of the enriched molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Beyond the high target selectivity, the practicability and short assay duration of the method, further advantages are its compatibility to modifications. It has been shown that chemical conditions can also be changed to preserve proteins in their native state for further proteomic analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, the abovementioned 3&#x02032; skew bias has been faced in different approaches, like the cDNA transcription using SMARTer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] or the additional mRNA enrichment by its 5&#x02032;cap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The latter procedure also deals with the intricate capturing of mRNAs with short poly-A tails since its length might be influenced in the course of translational control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Some new protocols avoid a physical separation of RNA from DNA because it might be detrimental when automatic liquid handling is conducted in small volumes. In such approaches, the oligo-dt primer contains an additional barcode sequence to identify the amplified cDNA within the pool of genomic DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The limitation of all methods using oligo-dT primer to target polyadenylated mRNA is the inability to detect microRNAs or lncRNAs, which are also of importance for the transcriptome and the cell&#x02019;s phenotype.</p><p>All current NGS platforms require prior amplification of DNA if minute amounts of DNA are analyzed. Novel approaches specifically utilized for single-cell whole genome amplification promise an improved genome coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, compared to established methods locus dropout is still observed and comparable to the results we obtained for whole genome sequencing. Alternatively a transposon-mediated library preparation strategy omitting any amplification reaction prior to NGS library preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] may offer an alternative approach for the method presented here.</p><p>Several aspects of the presented method offer room for improvement. Beyond the separation of the mRNA the preparation of amplified cDNA as well as WGA DNA involves many discrete steps which are prone for technical variation, such as the magnetic coupling and binding of mRNA to the column, the elution of DNA from the column, the PCR amplification of the double-stranded cDNA and library preparation which adds another step of PCR amplification. Secondly, retaining full length coverage of expressed RNAs in ultra-low input preparations is especially challenging. Furthermore locus drop out on the genomic DNA is more likely to occur with decreasing cell numbers within the WGA reaction. All these technical challenges are exacerbating if the cell number is decreased down to single cells and all currently available methods need to cope with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion the presented approach for combined ultra-low mRNA and whole-genome sequencing from minute amounts of starting material offers new possibilities for many applications where limited material is available. Furthermore it enables one to directly study both the transcriptome and genome in one analytical approach from the same sample material which might be of interest for both basic as well as clinical research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Cell culture and cell picking</title><p>Human embryonic stem cells (line H1) were obtained from WiCell Research Institute.
