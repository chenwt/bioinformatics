CIN may prompt rapid accumulation of mutations and genomic alterations. Thus, CIN can promote carcinogenesis. This CIN process results from a mutation in certain genes or environmental challenge such as smoking, and is highly prevalent in various cancers, including lung cancer. A better understanding of the effects of CIN on carcinogenesis will lead to novel methods for cancer prevention and treatment. Previously Shugoshin-1 (Sgo1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x0002b;</sup>) mice, a transgenic mouse model of CIN, showed mild proneness to spontaneous lung and liver cancers. In this study, adoptive (T/B-cell based) immunity-deficient RAG1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Sgo1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x0002b;</sup> double mutant mice developed lung adenocarcinomas more aggressively than did Sgo1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x0002b;</sup> or RAG1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, suggesting immune system involvement in CIN-mediated lung carcinogenesis. To identify molecular causes of the lung adenocarcinoma, we used systems biology approach, comparative RNAseq, to RAG1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and RAG1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Sgo1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x0002b;</sup>. The comparative RNAseq data and follow-up analyses in the lungs of naive Sgo1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice demonstrate that, (i) glutathione is depleted, making the tissue vulnerable to oxidative stress, (ii) spontaneous DNA damage is increased, (iii) oncogenic Wnt signaling is activated, (iv) both major branches of the immune system are weakened through misregulations in signal mediators such as CD80 and calreticulin and (v) the actin cytoskeleton is misregulated. Overall, the results show multi-faceted roles of CIN in lung carcinoma development in Sgo1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice. Our model presents various effects of CIN and will help to identify potential targets to prevent CIN-driven carcinogenesis in the lung.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Aneuploidy has been predicted to cause cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> Aneuploid cells are created through genomic instability, which has two major modes, mitotic error-mediated chromosome instability (CIN) and DNA metabolism-mediated microsatellite instability, which are not mutually exclusive. CIN can lead to a variety of outcomes in post-mitotic cells, including tetraploidy, chromothripsis, DNA damage and aneuploidy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> Further, the gain of oncogenes or loss of tumor suppressors may result. Thus, CIN can serve as a mutator.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> In addition, CIN can produce DNA damage and facilitate mutagenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> Micronuclei formation and chromothripsis may also occur, leading to extensive genome shuffling and mutation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Thus, CIN is mutagenic on a cellular level. Carcinogenic environmental factors, such as hepatitis virus infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> and smoking,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> can produce CIN. These cell biological observations and other evidence strongly suggest a role of CIN in carcinogenesis.</p><p>Tumor-mass sequencing data indicate that the genes that are frequently mutated in colon cancer function to prevent CIN, suggesting that progressive CIN is an integrated process in colonic carcinogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> Most primary lung cancers carry loss of heterozygosity, which is associated with CIN, further implicating CIN in lung carcinogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> CIN can be caused by mutations in various genes, many of which are <italic>bona fide</italic> mitotic regulators, such as mitotic spindle checkpoint components BubR1 and Mad2, the mitotic motor Cenpe, and chromosome cohesion regulators such as Sgo1. CIN model mice, transgenic mice with mutations in mitotic regulators, were created to investigate the effects of CIN on carcinogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup></p><p>The consequences of CIN and aneuploidy <italic>in vivo</italic> have been identified and characterized using animal models. Aneuploidy causes gross transcriptome changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> and imbalances in protein generation, producing proteotoxic effects that lead to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, lysosomal stress and overwhelmed autophagy in the cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> Mouse studies showed that high rates of CIN and aneuploidy do not always translate directly to high rates of cancer, and that CIN can be both oncogenic and tumor suppressing in different organs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> Therefore, the relationship between CIN and carcinogenesis is not straightforward and is organ specific. Cell death is a determining factor. A high rate of CIN and aneuploidy can lead to cell death rather than tumorigenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> Another possible determining factor is the involvement of immune system and its surveillance to remove aneuploid cells. G Kroemer&#x02018;s group showed that tetraploid cells express specific cell surface antigens, including calreticulin (an &#x02018;eat me' signal), and proposed that immune surveillance specifically targets the tetraploid cells to suppress cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> Although whether immune surveillance is involved in removing CIN cells <italic>in vivo</italic> remains to be investigated further, there are reports supportive to the notion linking smoking, CIN and immune function, such as, tobacco smoking is known to decrease immune functions in lung,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> and lung cancers with smoking signatures respond better to immune checkpoint PD1 inhibitor therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup></p><p>Shugoshin-1 (Sgo1) regulates chromosome cohesion and centrosome integrity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> Sgo1 expression is abnormal in various human cancers, including colon, lung and liver cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> The inner centromere-Shugoshin mitotic network was shown to be dysfunctional in numerous cancers, suggesting that proper Sgo1 function is crucial to preventing CIN and cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> To further investigate carcinogenesis for cancer prevention, we generated Sgo1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x0002b;</sup> CIN model mice, and have demonstrated the involvement of CIN in carcinogenesis in several organs, including the colon, liver and lungs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> The colon in particular showed a modified carcinogenesis profile after treatment with the carcinogen Azoxymethane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> In the Sgo1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x0002b;</sup> CIN model mice, the lungs and liver were also prone to spontaneous carcinogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> Spontaneous hepatic and lung carcinogenesis were reported in other CIN models, including BubR1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x0002b;</sup> and Mad2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> suggesting that these cancers may be common consequences of CIN.</p><p>CIN has shown to be at least correlational, if not causal, to carcinogenesis in the lung.

However, the cancers did not cause a significant increase in lethality because of the smaller size by 12 months of age. The RAG1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> background facilitated lung carcinoma development in Sgo1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x0002b;</sup> such that it manifested as lethality by 12 months of age. Gross liver tumors were not observed, although histological abnormalities such as nuclear pleomorphism (variation of nuclear size), megamitochondria and binucleation were observed in mice with Sgo1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x0002b;</sup> background.

Glutathione is a major cellular anti-oxidant, and this GST downregulation would decrease the efficacy of detoxification and the oxidative stress response through glutathione conjugation. We suspected that lungs of Sgo1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice are vulnerable to oxidative stress because of a decrease in the glutathione-mediated protection.

The double decreases in GSTM5 expression and total glutathione pool would have roles in weakening resistance to oxidative stress in Sgo1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x0002b;</sup> lungs, aiding in the creation of a carcinogenesis-prone condition.

The CD80 precursor was among the upregulated genes in RAG1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>Sgo1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x0002b;</sup> (4.3-fold). CD80 and CD86 work as ligands on the surface of activated B cells and monocytes, and bind to the CD28 receptors on T cells for T-cell activation and survival. However, the RNAseq analyses showed no significant differences in CD86 and CD28 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). To test whether CD80 is misregulated in naive Sgo1, we compared CD80 protein expression in control and Sgo1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x0002b;</sup>. CD80 mRNA was significantly downregulated (<italic>P</italic>=0.0031) and the protein was modestly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), suggesting partial impairment of T/B-cell activation in Sgo1 without RAG1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>.</p><p>As many immunomodulators are regulated post-translationally, we also tested protein expression of select immunomodulators. As RAG1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice depend on NK-cell function to compensate for compromised adoptive immunity, we hypothesized that NK-cell activation may also be reduced on the Sgo1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x0002b;</sup> background. Supporting this notion, protein expression of calreticulin (the &#x02018;eat-me' signal for NK cells) was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5b and c</xref>). In addition, we observed lower expression of genes indicative of NK-cell activation in the RNAseq.

The reduction was confirmed in naive Sgo1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x0002b;</sup> with quantitative reverse transcriptase&#x02013;PCR, and was not limited to the RAG1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Downregulations of T- and B-cell activation markers in Sgo1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x0002b;</sup> lung</title><p>In the above results provided, we further tested expression of markers for T-cell activation (that is, CD8, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IFN-&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>), B-cell activation (CD22; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>), and T- and B-cell activation (CD24; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>).

All of these genes are involved in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To suppress pre- or early-cancer cells and prevent cancers, various strategies can be utilized. These strategies include inhibition of oncogenic signaling, activation of cell death, activation of tumor suppressors that induce senescence, differentiation and/or non-proliferation, and immune surveillance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> However, comprehensive pathway identification is necessary to formulate an effective strategy without an oversight to antagonizing multiple pathways. For the purpose, CIN models are uniquely valuable. Cellular level CIN, caused by environmental factors or gene mutations, can manifest locally as an initial step of carcinogenesis. The use of tissue/organ-level comparative RNAseq-transcriptomics with CIN mouse models can magnify the molecular effects that occur in cells with CIN, enabling us to identify the cellular effects of CIN in the particular organ. Thus, the use of bioinformatics with a CIN model is an effective way to identify initial molecular changes in an organ of interest.</p><p>The present bioinformatic-based characterization study suggested that CIN is involved in the development of lung adenocarcinomas through the pathways newly identified in the study. We identified reprogramming in transcription in Sgo1-CIN mice lungs, leading to (1) decrease in protection by glutathione (GSTM5, glutathione pool), (2) increase in DNA damage possibly with CIN itself and with oxidative stress, (3) activation of Wnt signaling (SFRP4-&#x003b2; catenin-cyclinD, Lif1), (4) decrease in T/B-cell activation and immune surveillance (CD80, CD8, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, INF-1&#x003b1;, CD22, CD24), (5) decrease in NK-cell activation and immune surveillance (calreticulin, Itgad, Klra3, Klra9) and (6) others such as actin cytoskeleton disturbance. All can create pro-carcinogenic lung tissue environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Aneuploidy is an outcome of CIN. We anticipated that CIN-mediated transcriptomic changes would show some similarities with those in aneuploid cells. Aneuploid cells in diverse organisms, including yeast, plants, mice and humans, showed highly related gene expression patterns that are conserved between species. In aneuploid cells, genes that were involved in the response to stress were consistently upregulated, and genes associated with the cell cycle and cell proliferation were downregulated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> However, our results indicated organ-specific and nonspecific (that is, common among two or more organs) transcriptomic changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> Major nonspecific pathways that may be considered CIN signatures are involved in oxidative stress response and immune functions. We speculate that the difference between aneuploid models and CIN models is simply the characteristics of these two models. Aneuploid models carry aneuploid cells uniformly in all cells of the body, whereas CIN models can generate various outcomes after mitosis, such as apoptotic and necrotic cells, senescent cells and aneuploid cells. In CIN models, aneuploid is only one possible outcome. As a result, CIN models only occasionally carry aneuploid cells, and may do so temporarily.</p><p>In light of our results, previous results about lung tumor recurrence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> in inducible Mad2 overexpression mice may require re-interpretation. Thus far, cells with CIN were interpreted as a source of recurrence, and involvement of the immune system (or the lack thereof) in recurrence was not considered earlier. To capture various processes <italic>in vivo</italic> as a whole and to elucidate the complex competition among pro- and anti-carcinogenic events, the bioinformatic systems biology approach has demonstrated its usefulness.</p><p>Metabolic misregulation is another aspect of Sgo1-CIN our results indicated. It is consistent with reports from <italic>Drosophila</italic> mad2 model that CIN causes lethality with metabolic stress as well as oxidative stress,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> suggesting that CIN commonly affects cellular metabolism and oxidative stress pathway over various species.</p><p>Overall, our bioinformatic results indicated that CIN can influence carcinogenesis and possibly cancer recurrence through multiple pathways. The results also suggest possible countermeasures: glutathione supplementation, removal of CIN cells through targeting CIN-specific markers, Wnt signaling attenuation and immune restoration. Lung cancer is the most lethal cancer worldwide: it is predicted to claim 158&#x02009;080 lives in the United States alone in 2016. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> Thus, the rapid development of prevention measures is imperative. This study aided in identifying potential targets for the preventive drug development, and the results may lead to a combinatorial chemoprevention measure simultaneously targeting multiple pathways for better efficacy.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Generation, genotyping and characterization of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and the colonic carcinogenesis assay with Azoxymethane injections in Sgo1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x0002b;</sup> haploinsufficient mice have been described earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> RAG1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were obtained from Dr Naveena Janakiram (OUHSC).

Mechanism for the transcriptomic reprogramming warrants future investigation.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="oncsis201656f7"/></fig><table-wrap id="tbl1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Gross tumors in RAG1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, Sgo1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x0002b;</sup> and RAG1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Sgo1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x000a0;</th><th align="center" valign="top" charoff="50"><italic>RAG1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup></th><th align="center" valign="top" charoff="50"><italic>RAG1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup>
