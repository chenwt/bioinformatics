More recently high throughput sequencing has greatly increased our knowledge of diversity in the variable region by the in-depth sequencing of antibody repertoires [<xref rid="pone.0117050.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117050.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117050.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Three decades of intense scrutiny, in conjunction with the completion of the human genome project [<xref rid="pone.0117050.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117050.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], led to the assumption that the genome sequence and transcriptional products of the human immunoglobulin locus were completely characterized.</p><p>Each isotype (IGHM,IGHD, IGHG1-4,IGHA1-2,IGHE) was thought to be expressed as one of two isoforms: secreted or membrane bound which contain S or M exons respectively [<xref rid="pone.0117050.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117050.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117050.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Transcripts of all isotypes are thought to feature two exons specific to their membrane isoform, with the exception of IgA1 and IgA2 (transcribed from IGHA1 and IGHA2) which were believed to feature only one membrane exon[<xref rid="pone.0117050.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of the IGH locus and its transcripts is highly challenging due to the fact that every IGH transcript is the result of a unique somatic recombination event and can be expressed as different isotypes and isoforms. While RNAseq has been proven to be a very powerful tool for the discovery and annotation of transcript isoforms, standard RNAseq protocols rely on RNA pooled from thousands to millions of cells. As large pools of B cells will contain a highly diverse mixture of IGH transcripts standard RNAseq would result in an even more diverse pool of short read fragments that would be impossible to de-convolute. We used two strategies to analyse IGH transcripts in more detail than previously possible. First, we used single B cell RNAseq [<xref rid="pone.0117050.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117050.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] to reduce the complexity down to a single IGH transcript. Second, we used single molecule long read sequencing to analyze single IGH transcripts amplified from a bulk B cell RNA sample.</p><p>Using these strategies, we discovered novel exons in the 3&#x02019;UTR of IGHA1 and IGHA2 transcripts. We also found that in addition to the canonical secreted and membrane isoforms, all IGH isotypes and especially IGHM showed further, less abundant shorter isoforms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec002a"><title>Novel non-coding exon in IGHA 3&#x02019;UTR</title><p>We applied single cell RNAseq to human B cells to analyse complete variable and constant regions of IGH transcripts expressed by single B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0117050.g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p>For single B cell RNAseq, we amplified full length cDNA from single B cells using the C1 Autoprep system and used Nextera XT transposase to generate libraries which we sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq Sequencers. When we mapped the resulting RNAseq reads to the IGH locus we identified a B cell expressing high levels of both secreted and membrane bound isoforms of IGHA1. Interestingly, instead of one continuous exon as previously assumed (IGHA1 M), this cell appeared to have two exons (subsequently named IGHA1 M1 and IGHA1 M2) in the membrane isoform, with the second located in the 3&#x02032;UTR. While the non-coding transcript AL928768.3 containing only IGHA1 M1 and IGHA1 M2 has previously been identified, the expression of both IGHA1 M1 and IGHA1 M2 appeared to be dependent on IGHA1 expression as the exons were absent in a B cells expressing IGHM exclusively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0117050.g001">Fig. 1B</xref>).

This showed that the first 236bp exon (IGHA1 M1, chr14:106170704-106170939) codes for the complete transmembrane region and is spliced, excising a 338bp intron, to a second 122bp non coding exon (IGHA1 M2, chr14:106170301-106170423).</p><fig id="pone.0117050.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0117050.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>IGHA 3&#x02032; UTR contains novel splice junction.</title><p>a) Full length cDNA of single B cells was generated using the C1 autoprep system, fragmented using Nextera XT, and sequenced using Illumina sequencers (RNAseq).

In contrast to RNAseq single molecule long read sequencing provides continuous sequencing reads covering complete IGH transcripts, enabling us to validate splice junctions with high confidence. We amplified cDNA from bulk B cell samples by priming of the V leader segments as well as the polyA tail of IGH transcripts. We sequenced the resulting amplicons on a PacBio RS II sequencer generating 1077 full length IGH transcripts containing either S or M exons. We identified 265 transcripts featuring isoforms of the IGHA1 isotype. Most IGHA1 transcripts were of the canonical secreted isoform (260), but two membrane isoform transcripts validated the existence of IGHA1 M1 and IGHA1 M2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0117050.g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0117050.s001">S1A Fig.</xref>).

Indeed, three transcripts in our single molecule long read sequencing data corresponded to this previously unknown isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0117050.g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). By skipping the stop codon in the IGHA1 M1 exon this isoform creates a novel reading frame terminating in a stop codon shortly before the polyA signal.</p><p>As the single molecule long read sequencing data was not limited to IGHA transcripts, we expanded our analysis to IGHM. Indeed, IGHM transcripts showed abundant expression of previously unknown isoforms composed of known exons. In addition to 56 transcripts featuring canonical isoforms, we identified three previously unknown isoforms of the IGHM transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0117050.g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), which were also validated using PCR and Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0117050.g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). The first and at 106 transcripts most abundant new isoform (VDJ-M1-M2) contained only the M1 and M2 exons spliced directly to the VDJ exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0117050.g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The sequence of this isoform as derived from the consensus of single molecule reads and validated through Sanger sequencing confirmed an in-frame splicing event that leads to a functional transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0117050.s002">S2 Fig.</xref>). The second most abundant novel isoform (VDJ-M2) contained only the M2 exon spliced directly to the VDJ exon. In this case the splice junction is out-of-frame, generating a novel reading frame (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0117050.s002">S2 Fig.</xref>). The third and least abundant isoform (VDJ-CH1-M1-M2) contained CH1, M1, and M2 exons and once again encoded a functional transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0117050.s002">S2 Fig.</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0117050.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0117050.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Alternative splicing of IGHM transcripts.</title><p>a) RNA was extracted from bulk B cells and the IGH transcripts were analyzed using the PacBio sequencer (IGH-Seq) and mapped to the IGHM locus.

Different population of B cells express distinctly different IGH transcripts. Na&#x000ef;ve B cells express predominantly membrane bound IGH transcripts that are non-mutated and of either IGHM or IGHD isotype. Activated B cells express predominantly secreted IGH transcripts that is mutated and of either IGHM, IGHA(1&#x02013;2), IGHG(1&#x02013;4), or IGHE isotype.</p><p>The 3 novel isoforms we observed (VDJ-M1-M2, VDJ-M2, VDJ-CH1-M1-M2) all showed levels of somatic hypermutation similar to membrane bound IGHM and IGHD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0117050.g002">Fig. 2C</xref>) and far lower than secreted IGHM, IGHA, and IGHG. This suggests that the novel isoforms are likely expressed by naive B cells. Interestingly, alternative splicing was not unique to IGHM. By amplifying bulk B cell cDNA with primers specific to the other isotypes, gel separating distinct bands and Sanger sequencing of said bands, we also identified novel isoforms for IGHA, IGHG, and IGHD, although at lower levels than IGHM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0117050.s003">S3 Fig.</xref>). Likely due to their low abundance none of these isoforms was detected in single molecule long read sequencing and could therefore not be independently validated.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec003"><title>Discussion</title><p>The highly diverse and repetitive nature of the IGH locus and its transcript has made it hard to analyze. Here we employed several strategies to overcome these difficulties. First, instead of analyzing thousands to millions B cells, we used RNAseq to analyze complete IGH transcripts expressed by single B cells. To accomplish this we utilized the C1 Autoprep System which enables the automated amplification of full length cDNA from single cells which is then fragmented and sequenced on an Illumina sequencer. After sequencing, short reads can be computationally assembled into complete transcripts. Second, in addition to short read RNAseq, we sequenced full length IGH cDNA using the single molecule long read PacBio RS II sequencer. The resulting long reads represent complete IGH transcripts. By combining these technologies we were able to discover and validate a previously unknown splicing event in the IGH transcripts of IGHA isotypes. Instead of one continuous membrane exon (IGHA M), IGHA1 and IGHA2 feature two exons specific to their membrane bound isoform (IGHA M1 and IGHA M2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0117050.s004">S4 Fig.</xref>). This brings IGHA transcripts in line with transcripts of all other isotypes that all feature two exons specific to their membrane bound isoform. The IGHA M2 exons are located in the 3&#x02019;UTR of their respective transcripts and therefore non-coding. The IGHA1/2 3&#x02032;UTR introns possibly affect the level of membrane bound IGHA protein and are therefore excised from the final membrane IGHA mRNA. Surprisingly, the single molecule read and validation by Sanger sequencing revealed several previously unknown IGH isoforms. The most abundant previously unknown isoforms were of the IGHM isotype and contained membrane exons spliced directly to the VDJ exon. The putative proteins created by these isoforms would not be able to bind an antibody light chain or dimerize with a second heavy chain, yet would possibly still be bound to the B cell membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0117050.s004">S4 Fig.</xref>). These IGHM isoforms have likely escaped discovery until this point in time because commercial and widely used antibodies are raised against the CH1-CH2-CH3 and S exons of secreted IGHM proteins. Therefore the shorter isoforms we detected, which lack these exons in their putative proteins, would be invisible in assays employing these antibodies. Detection will further be complicated by the fact that membrane bound antibody is expressed at levels orders of magnitude lower than secreted antibodies. Future studies aiming to detect the protein products of these novel short isoforms will therefore require highly sensitive assays and custom antibodies raised against the transmembrane region of IGHM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec004"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>All study protocols and consent procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Boards at Stanford University.
