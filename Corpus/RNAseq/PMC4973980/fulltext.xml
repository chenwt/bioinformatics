This social synergism is achieved mainly by the worker bees, which form a female caste. The worker bees display diverse collaborative behaviors and engage in different behavioral tasks, which are controlled by the central nervous system (CNS). The development of the worker brain is determined by the female sex and the worker caste determination signal. Here, we report on genes that are controlled by sex or by caste during differentiation of the worker&#x02019;s pupal brain. We sequenced and compared transcriptomes from the pupal brains of honeybee workers, queens and drones. We detected 333 genes that are differently expressed and 519 genes that are differentially spliced between the sexes, and 1760 genes that are differentially expressed and 692 genes that are differentially spliced between castes. We further found that 403 genes are differentially regulated by both the sex and caste signals, providing evidence of the integration of both signals through differential gene regulation. In this gene set, we found that the molecular processes of restructuring the cell shape and cell-to-cell signaling are overrepresented. Our approach identified candidate genes that may be involved in brain differentiation that ensures the various social worker behaviors.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beye</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The project was funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dfg.de/">http://www.dfg.de/</ext-link>).

These societies consist of thousands of usually sterile female workers, a female queen and hundreds of males (drones) [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The honeybee workers have a distinct morphology and display social behaviors that are very different from those of queens and drones. Honeybee workers are usually sterile and show altruistic behaviors, including brood rearing, colony defense, and pollen and nectar foraging behavior. All of these behaviors are devoted to maintaining the colony [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The queens and drones display behaviors that are associated with reproduction, including mating and egg laying by queens. The behaviors of social workers are of special interest because the collaborative and seemingly coordinate behaviors of thousands of workers produce outcomes that far exceed the abilities of a single worker [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157980.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157980.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Workers can collectively thermoregulate a bee colony [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] or exploit food sources. Worker bees utilize sophisticated communication systems (e.g., the waggle dance behavior) in which the quality, distance and direction of a food source is communicated to other workers [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Moreover, worker bees exhibit an age-dependent division of labor [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157980.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157980.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] in which newly emerged bees perform tasks inside the nest, whereas older bees are engaged in foraging behavior. This age-dependent polyethism is, however, not fixed. Honeybee workers flexibly engage in certain tasks depending on the colonies' needs [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157980.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Even a foraging worker bee reverts physiologically and behaviorally to a nursing bee on demand [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We suggest that the wiring of the worker brain, which is specified during pupal development, ensures the ability to perform different worker tasks. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, much of the wiring of the adult brain is specified during pupal development by a genetically determined program [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157980.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We have little understanding of how a developmental program can specify a brain that controls and ensures such sophisticated innate social behaviors as displayed by the honeybee workers. This developmental program of worker honeybees originated in the last 60 to 75 million years [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] from a solitary bee ancestor.</p><p>In the honeybee, the combined action of the sex- and caste-determining pathways specifies worker differentiation, including in the brain. The sex determination pathway regulates the differences between the sexes [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], while <italic>Epidermal growth factor receptor</italic> (<italic>Egfr</italic>) signaling regulates differentiation into the different female castes of workers and queens [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Femaleness is induced by a heterozygous genotype at the <italic>complementary sex determiner</italic> (<italic>csd</italic>) gene. The heterozygous Csd proteins direct female splicing of <italic>feminizer</italic> (<italic>fem</italic>) transcripts that switches the pathway into the female state [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The female <italic>fem</italic> transcripts encode the splice regulator Fem, which directs female splicing of transcripts; among these transcripts, the honeybee <italic>doublesex</italic> (<italic>Am-dsx</italic>) gene has been identified [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Males develop when the <italic>csd</italic> genotype is hemizygous or homozygous. Those Csd proteins have not the activity to direct female splicing of <italic>fem</italic> transcripts. As a consequence, a male transcript of the <italic>fem</italic> gene, which contains a premature stop codon and encodes no functional Fem protein, is produced by default. In the absence of the Fem protein, male-spliced <italic>Am-dsx</italic> transcripts are produced. Until now, we have had little understanding of the genes that operate further downstream of the <italic>csd</italic> and <italic>fem</italic> genes in executing female development and subsequent worker and queen differentiation. The differentiation into either workers or queens is controlled by differential feeding of the female larvae with royal jelly [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157980.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0157980.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0157980.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>The control of sexual and caste development in honeybees.</title><p>Sexual differentiation is induced approximately 12 hours after egg laying and is determined by the genotype at the <italic>csd</italic> gene, which directs splicing of the <italic>feminizer</italic> (<italic>fem</italic>) transcripts. The female <italic>fem</italic> transcripts encode Fem proteins, which maintain the female-determined state through a positive feedback loop. The female caste differentiation into workers and queens is determined by the differential feeding of larvae with royal jelly. This feeding differentially regulates the Epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0157980.g001"/></fig><p>Queen development is induced when female larvae are fed exclusively royal jelly by workers throughout larval development. Worker development results when the amount of royal jelly is restricted in older female larvae. The Royalactin protein (Rol) has been characterized as an active component of the royal jelly, which is produced by the hypopharyngeal glands of workers. Rol induces queen and not worker development through the differential activation of the <italic>Epidermal growth factor receptor</italic> (<italic>Egfr</italic>) pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157980.g001">Fig 1</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This altered <italic>Egfr</italic> activity in queens directs an increase in body size and activates ovary development, which are both mediated by the activation of the S6 kinase (S6K) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The drones receive a similar shortage of royal jelly feeding in later larval stage [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157980.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, the drones exhibit the same <italic>Egfr</italic> signaling that is found in workers. So far, we have had no further understanding of which genes further downstream of the <italic>Egfr</italic> pathway regulate the brain differentiation during development of an adult female. These downstream components of the genetically encoded pathway specify the adult brain that orchestrates the very different behaviors displayed by workers and queens.</p><p>This study seeks (i) to identify candidate genes downstream of the <italic>fem</italic> and <italic>egfr</italic> pathways that are involved in differentiation of the adult worker brain, and (ii) to detect mechanisms by which the sex- and caste-determining signals are integrated into a genetically encoded program.</p><p>Here, we report the candidate genes that are regulated by either the sex or caste determination signals or by the action of both signals during pupal brain differentiation. We compared the transcriptomes of differently expressed and spliced genes in the pupal brains between workers and queens as well between workers and drones using an RNAseq approach. This comparison identified genes that are regulated by the sex- or the caste-determining signals or by both signals in the developing worker brain. We chose the pupal stage (P4 in workers and drones, P3 in queens [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]) because during pupation, the adult brain is specified such that it can orchestrate the worker behaviors and the temporal division of labor [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157980.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The identified candidate genes provide a resource for the further study of the genetically encoded developmental program of worker brain differentiation during pupal development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Bee Sources</title><p>Worker and drone pupae (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic> L.) with red pigmented eyes (P4 stage [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]) were collected from sealed brood combs maintained in the beekeeping facility at the Heinrich-Heine University of D&#x000fc;sseldorf (Germany). To produce queen pupae, female eggs were collected using the Jenter egg collecting device (Karl Jenter, N&#x000fc;rtingen, Germany) and were placed into a queenless colony. Worker of the queenless colony reared queens, which were collected in P3 stage 14 days after the eggs were laid. The P4 stage for workers and drones and P3 stage for queens were chosen because there is evidence from gross morphological studies of worker and queen brains that those stages represent similar developmental stages [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which is externally indicated by the same coloration of the compound eye (the eye color turns red, see [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>RNAseq studies</title><p>RNA was isolated using a Trizol based method. The tissues of three brains were homogenized with a pestle in 250 &#x003bc;l Trizol reagent.

The samples were then centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C and 13,000 rpm. The upper phase was combined with an equal volume of 70% ethanol. The mixture was vortexed and transferred to a spin column (RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The following washing and elution steps were all performed using the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit and the RNeasy Mini Kit (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany) by following the procedure described in the respective manuals from the provider. We added 350 &#x003bc;l RW1 buffer to the filter cartridge, which was followed by 10 &#x003bc;l RNase-free DNase and 70 &#x003bc;l RDD buffer and incubated for 15 minutes.

RNA was prepared for sequencing following the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Guide (v2, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Single-read sequencing was performed with the Illumina HiSeq 2000 system (2500 for the queen samples; Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The quality of the resulting 100 base long reads was measured using the Phred quality score that was calculated with the CLCbio Genomics Workbench software. We achieved an average Phred score of 34 for all samples, which indicated a base call accuracy of 99.95% and a probability of an incorrect base call of 4x10<sup>-4</sup>. We have provided the data in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE45408.</p><p>For our RNAseq analyses, we aligned the sequences to the NCBI honeybee reference genome (Assembly v.4.5: <ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Apis_mellifera/Assembled_chromosomes/seq/">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Apis_mellifera/Assembled_chromosomes/seq/</ext-link>) and the NCBI transcript models of the annotated genes (<ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Apis_mellifera/GFF/ref_Amel_4.5_top_level.gff3.gz">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Apis_mellifera/GFF/ref_Amel_4.5_top_level.gff3.gz</ext-link>).</p><p>We concatenated the chromosome assemblies of the reference genome for linkage groups 1&#x02013;16 and excluded unplaced sequences and the mitochondrial genome. Minor edits were made to the annotation file due to non-unique identifiers for tRNAs by deleting one of the duplicated identifiers.</p><p>We performed a bioinformatics analysis executing all commands with the default settings unless otherwise noted. Read mapping was performed using Tophat (v2.0.8) [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], Bowtie2 (v2.1.0) [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and Samtools (v0.1.18) [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] accepting only the uniquely mapped reads (option&#x02013;g 1 in the <italic>tophat</italic> command line). We created a transcript model <italic>de novo</italic> by assembling the mapped reads using the Cufflinks package (v2.0.2) [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. To annotate the transcription starts, we used the <italic>cuffcompare</italic> command in the Cufflinks package [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We added the option&#x02013;CG to the <italic>cuffcompare</italic> command so that the command accepted a GFF3 file format as the transcript model instead of the standard GTF file format. We ran Cuffdiff (part of the Cufflinks program package) to identify the significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We added the option -N to the <italic>cuffdiff</italic> command to indicate 'Upper Quantile Normalization'. This option normalizes for sequencing depth using the upper quartile counts instead of the total read counts.</p><p>We used the Spanki software program (v0.4.0)[<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] to detect significant differentially regulated splice junctions in our mapped reads. The number of reads mapped to known genes depends on the accuracy and completeness of the transcript model. Because the annotated honeybee transcript model provided by NCBI is not yet complete (especially for genes expressed in queens or drones), we relied on the detection of single differentially spliced junctions instead of identifying differentially spliced transcripts [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>The identified DEGs and differentially spliced junctions were further managed and visualized using R software and the R package CummeRbund [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which enabled the further sorting of genes according to their p-values or splicing criteria. The multiple-testing corrected q-values were set to 0.001 for DEGs and differentially spliced junctions.

To identify genes that are controlled by the sex- and caste-determination signals and that may execute the worker-related brain differentiation, we deep-sequenced the transcriptomes (RNAseq) derived from the developing pupal brains. We compared the transcript strengths and alternative splicing of transcripts controlled by the sex signal (worker/male comparison) and by the caste signal (worker/queen comparison). The worker/male comparison identified the sexual signal-derived controls resulting from the similar feeding of Rol protein to male and worker larvae. The worker/queen comparison identified the caste signal-derived gene regulations under the control of the female pathway. The differentially expressed or spliced transcripts identified in both comparisons indicated genes regulated by the combined action of the sex- and caste-determination pathways and, hence, displayed the integration of both signals.</p><p>We examined three biological replicates for each condition (the workers, the queens and the males).

This approach provides a method for detecting candidate genes involved in the specification of the worker, queen and drone brain to ensure distinct social behaviors later on in adult live. The female signal together with a worker caste signal determines a worker brain that can orchestrate the sophisticated social behaviors that are essential in forming a complex society.</p><p>We found that under the control of the sexual signal, genes were more often differentially spliced (3% of the transcribed genes in the brain) than differentially expressed (2% of the transcribed genes), suggesting that sex-dependent splicing plays a major role in executing the sexual signal in the brain. Our gene set included the splice regulator <italic>fem</italic> and the transcription factor <italic>Am-dsx</italic>, which have both been previously identified [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Genes that can bind to DNA and RNA were overrepresented in our GO analysis. This result suggests that the action of the sex- and caste-determining pathways are often executed via genes that regulate transcription or post-transcription. In a survey conducted in the brain of the fruit fly (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>), 18 differentially spliced transcripts, including the <italic>Dm-doublsex</italic> (<italic>dsx)</italic> gene, were identified between the sexes [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

Our study demonstrates that the caste regulatory differences in female brains during pupal differentiation, during which the adult brain is specified, are primarily achieved by expression differences (11%). Only 4% of the genes showed differential splicing. The GO analyses indicated that receptor-based signaling and gene regulation via transcription were overrepresented; these molecular processes play an important role in the neuronal wiring and ensure the development of complex behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We found an equal amount of DEGs that were upregulated in queens (49%) and workers (51%). In contrast, Chen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] found that in the L5 larvae stage, 72% (3467 genes) of the DEGs were up-regulated in queens and 28% (1320) were up-regulated in workers. We suggest that the substantial upregulation of transcription in the larvae may be associated with the fast growth and shorter developmental time of queens during larval development, which is not required during adult brain formation.</p><p>We detected 403 genes that were co-regulated by the sexual and caste signal. These genes may play a critical role in worker specific differentiation, as they are regulated by the female and the worker-like caste pathways [<xref rid="pone.0157980.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and can integrate the information from both pathways. Thus, these 403 genes may play a critical role in the developmental specification of the adult worker brain. The GO analysis suggested that the integration of the sexual and caste information is realized through cell signaling processes and cell shape changes in the neuronal substrate. The identified genes (S1 Supporting Information in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157980.s001">S1 File</xref>) provide a powerful avenue to further study the processes specifying a worker brain to ensure social behaviors and organization.
