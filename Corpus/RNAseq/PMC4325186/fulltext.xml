We show how our developed GeneTiles software can improve RNAseq analysis approaches by more confidently identifying a large set of markers upon infection with these bacteria<italic>.</italic> For analysis of RNAseq data currently, software programs such as Bowtie2 and Samtools are indispensable. However, these programs that are designed for a LINUX environment require some dedicated programming skills and have no options for visualisation of the resulting mapped sequence reads. Especially with large data sets, this makes the analysis time consuming and difficult for non-expert users. We have applied the GeneTiles software to the analysis of previously published and newly obtained RNAseq datasets of our zebrafish infection model, and we have shown the applicability of this approach also to published RNAseq datasets of other organisms by comparing our data with a published mammalian infection study. In addition, we have implemented the DEXSeq module in the GeneTiles software to identify genes, such as glucagon A, that are differentially spliced under infection conditions. In the analysis of our RNAseq data, this has led to the possibility to improve the size of data sets that could be efficiently compared without using problem-dedicated programs, leading to a quick identification of marker sets. Therefore, this approach will also be highly useful for transcriptome analyses of other organisms for which well-characterised genomes are available.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00251-014-0820-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>RNA deep sequencing</kwd><kwd>Host pathogen interaction</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd><kwd><italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic></kwd><kwd>Differential splicing</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>In our previous research, we have used zebrafish larval infection models to study the transcriptome response to infection by several pathogens (Ordas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2011</xref>; Stockhammer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2010</xref>; van der Vaart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2013</xref>; van Soest et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2011</xref>; Veneman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2013</xref>). In addition, we have tested the response of zebrafish larvae to infection by the opportunistic bacterium <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> as a model for biomaterial-associated infections that are often caused by this species in clinical practise (Boelens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2000</xref>; Broekhuizen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2008</xref>; Busscher et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2012</xref>; Zaat et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2010</xref>). These studies have led to a high throughput model that resulted in a large set of RNAseq data sets highlighting a new bottleneck in our research: the fast and user-friendly analysis of large datasets that can be easily visualised for comparative purposes.</p><p>In the analysis of our former transcriptome data sets, there was a need for specialised scripting languages to quickly find good marker genes for the disease. We used an existing visualisation program, Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) (Robinson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2011</xref>), that shows the data solely along a line representing the genome, thereby requiring zooming in to view the aligned reads. IGV and many other open source visualisation programs, such as MapView (Bao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2009</xref>), Tablet (Milne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2010</xref>), GenoViewer (Laczik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>) and BamView (Carver et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>), also require the user to scroll or manually search for other genes to bring these into focus; and an overview of a selection of genes based on alignment results is not available. Finally, most of these data visualisation programs do not allow the export of presented visual results, other than taking screenshots. In our previous analysis of RNAseq data, we were reliant on manual counting of reads as guided by the IGV viewer (Veneman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2013</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we used the transcriptome data set obtained from the zebrafish high throughput screening system for <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> infection (Veneman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2013</xref>) as a case study to optimise and automate the data analysis pipeline. Using the resulting software package, we also went further and added a larger RNAseq data set from <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> infection data for comparisons of specificity of the transcriptome responses. We also integrated the DEXSeq algorithm that can be used to give an estimate of probability of the occurrence of differential splicing. This has led to the identification of genes that are differentially spliced after a microbial infection in zebrafish larvae. Finally, we wanted to include a comparison with whole organism infection data in other vertebrate species. Unfortunately, there are still few available RNAseq data for this that can be mapped on Ensembl genome data; and as a result, we have only been able to compare our zebrafish infection data with the RNAseq data from a bovine digital dermatitis (BDD) model as published by Scholey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2013</xref> (Scholey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2013</xref>). However, the results are sufficient to show that our approach makes also such interspecies comparisons of RNAseq datasets very easy and this&#x000a0;can quickly lead to conclusions on conserved immune responses, even in comparisons between very different fish and mammalian infection models.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>The <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> strain O-47, containing a pWVW189-derived mCherry expression vector (De Boer L. unpublished), was grown as described in Veneman et al.

All reads that at least partially fall within the gene exon and intron regions are counted once. This is done with a python script which consists of the combination of HTseq and pysam (Anders et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2014</xref>).

Per bin, based on the annotation, two comparisons can be made, a comparison between the same exon bins in different samples (groups) and a comparison between an exon bin and its neighbour exon bins within the same group of samples. Note that, therefore, DEXSeq requires at least two groups containing at least two samples. Based on both comparisons, a likelihood test is performed resulting in a <italic>P</italic> value.

For this, the genes and/or proteins are matched to their Ensembl references on the selected genome. In addition, also the human pathways are searched for find homologs of genes using Ensembl biomart. Using these homologs, predictions of homolog pathways can be accessed; this enables to search a larger set of pathways contained in the human section of Wikipathways. It should be noted that using the human pathways to find information about zebrafish biology should be treated with caution and can only lead to suggestions for further investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Software design</title><p>RNAseq data, containing tens of millions of reads, is mostly processed using scripts. After processing, a selection of reads is analysed using RNAseq viewers. Directly browsing the processed RNAseq data is difficult due to the large dynamic range of length scales of reads (50&#x000a0;bp), exons (~200&#x000a0;bp), introns (~3&#x000a0;kb), genes (~20&#x000a0;kb) and chromosomes (~65&#x000a0;Mb). Using a minimal size of 1&#x000a0;pixel per read, a computer screen allows only for ~50&#x000a0;kb to be visible. In addition, most RNAseq viewers show introns at the same scale as exons, which in most experiments means that 90&#x000a0;% of the visible sequence data does not display aligned reads. We created an online viewer, GeneTiles (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetiles.com/">www.Genetiles.com</ext-link>), that does allow for browsing all the aligned reads, while eliminating almost completely the need for user intervention (such as zooming in). The genes in a chromosome are visible as tiles in a 2D array. The tile colour and intensity are a measure of the significance of the number of reads of experiment versus control, indicating changes in expression levels. When a tile is selected, the gene is loaded underneath, scaled to fit the width of the screen. In a schematic view, all introns are shrunk to a fixed short length to visualise the aligned reads in a graph above the exons. To accomplish fast browsing, all reads are indexed on the server directly after data processing. This indexed data is also available for download to apply custom filtering in Excel or other programs. The export functions of the tiles and genes as scalable vector graphics makes it easy for the user to modify the final visualisation for publication.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Workflow</title><p>Automated analysis of RNAseq data using GeneTiles does not need any programming steps anymore in a Linux environment by the user and performs directly a visualisation of the differentially expressed data, making it easier to interpret. To validate this new software package, RNAseq data from zebrafish bacterial infection experiments was obtained from Veneman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2013</xref>) and used as the initial test model. All programs used by Veneman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2013</xref>) are implemented, and more visualisation and export options are added in a server-based environment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Online Resource <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Therefore, the analysis pipeline of GeneTiles represents a combination of the previously described tools that have been previously shown to be useful for RNAseq analyses (Hatem et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2013</xref>). This makes it very manageable because it reduces the amount of high-end computers required in the research group for alignment and analysis, as all calculations are performed on the server. To start the analysis, the user can choose between various genomes that have been imported from Ensembl. Subsequently, the fastq files will be uploaded, followed by the option to analyse the data as single-end or paired-end. The files will be aligned automatically, after which the control or measurement treatment can be chosen. DESeq (Anders and Huber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2010</xref>) will normalise the data, and subsequently DEXSeq (Anders et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2012</xref>) will extract differentially expressed bins that indicate differential splicing. A table containing the differentially expressed genes or visualisations containing tiles or individual genes can be exported at this point.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Pipeline of RNAseq data analysis. The diagram shows the workflow of the data analysis starting at the raw fastq files until the final visualisation performed automatically by the GeneTiles server. The analysis pipeline is an open source and available in the Supplement</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="251_2014_820_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>With respect to the use of Bowtie2 aligner, we want to point out that it will fail to map reads spanning exon-exon boundaries to the genome. This problem could be solved using a splice aware aligner based on Bowtie2, such as Tophat2 (Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2013</xref>). This option will be included in a future version of the GeneTiles package. However, Tophat2 is more computationally intensive and depends on the correct predictions of splice sites. Therefore, the analysis without the splice aware aligner, as used in this paper, will remain present.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Different analysis methods</title><p>Considering that the RNA samples of the <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> infection experiments were paired-end sequenced, we had the possibility to explore the added value of paired-end over single-end sequencing. We compared the outcome of the differential expression of these two methods as well as the difference in sample sizes as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>. It can be noted that a the number of differentially expressed genes does not give an estimate of the reliability of the data; however, considering the high quality of RNAseq data, it can be assumed that adding an extra biological sample provides more relevant information than analysing a smaller group of samples by paired-end sequencing. Our data support this assumption since we found only a slight increase of 23&#x000a0;% in the differentially expressed genes when performing paired-end analysis in the four <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>-infected samples, using a <italic>P</italic> value of 0.05 as cut-off filter.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig 2</label><caption><p>Comparing single- and paired-end RNAseq analysis. <bold>a</bold> The different sample sizes (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1&#x02013;4) for analysis are visualised. <bold>b</bold> The total number of the differentially expressed genes with a fold change larger than 2 or smaller than &#x02212;2 and a <italic>P</italic> value smaller than 0.05 (<italic>solid grey bars</italic>) or an adjusted <italic>P</italic> value smaller than 0.05 (<italic>patterned dark bars</italic>). <bold>c</bold> The <italic>light grey circles</italic> of the Venn diagrams show the total number of the differentially expressed genes for all the sample sizes with a fold change larger than 2 or smaller than &#x02212;2 and a <italic>P</italic> value smaller than 0.05 as shown in (<bold>b</bold>), and the overlap of the differentially expressed genes compared to the <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4 paired-end data set.

We found a set of 359 differentially expressed genes when only analysing one sample with a <italic>P</italic> value of 0.05 and compared this large set of genes to our reference set of 203 genes (resulting from the analysis of paired-end sequence data of all four samples) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). This comparison shows a rather small overlap of only 23.7&#x000a0;% (single-end) and 27.6&#x000a0;% (paired-end). As expected, this overlap increases, and therefore, the number of false-positives decreases when adding more samples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). In order to provide a statistically more stringent analysis of the differentially expressed genes, we have also included, in the GeneTiles software, a tool for minimising false discovery based on the algorithm of Benjamini and Hochberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1995</xref> (Benjamini and Hochberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1995</xref>), using the implementation of DESeq.

The previous comparison as shown by Veneman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2013</xref>) was based on a single biological replicate of <italic>M. marinum</italic>-infected zebrafish embryos. We used this single replicate and added 5 more independent biological replicas, which led to a total of 6 replicas of <italic>M. marinum</italic>, 4 replicas of <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>-infected zebrafish embryos and a total of 9 replicas of non-infected control samples. As found before (Veneman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2013</xref>), <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> infection elicits a much smaller transcriptional host response of immune-related genes compared to <italic>M. marinum</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). However, the total number of the differentially expressed genes was increased since several genes were previously not found to be significantly regulated by <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> where they do show a response in this analysis. Another finding is the high induction of genes upon <italic>M. marinum</italic> infection compared to the <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>-infected samples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). An explanation could be that the <italic>M. marinum</italic> bacterium is a natural fish pathogen, and therefore, it is better recognised as intruder. <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> in large quantities is also pathogenic for fish; however, since it is not a natural pathogen, it could not be very well recognised as well as <italic>M. marinum.</italic> For instance, we now observe a high induction of the leptin B gene (<italic>lepb</italic>) upon infection with <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In this case, the difference with the previous study is caused by errors in the automated annotation of probes in the micro-array used in Veneman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2013</xref>), which was used as benchmark for the RNAseq analysis. The high expression of <italic>lepb</italic> found in <italic>M. marinum</italic>-infected samples is in line with the results earlier described by Wieland et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2005</xref> (Wieland et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2005</xref>), where they found a higher mycobacterial load in the lungs of leptin-deficient <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>An overview of the differentially expressed genes. <bold>a</bold> The GeneTiles output shows a much larger set of genes with a <italic>P</italic> value smaller than 0.05 with the <italic>M. marinum</italic>-infected samples compared to the <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>-infected samples.

The analysis strategy of differential splicing is schematically shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>, with an example that shows that 1 of 4 exons is spliced out from a pre-mRNA to form the mature mRNA.

Supporting this finding, the pro-glucagon gene has been described before as being differentially spliced into multiple peptides in teleost fish (Holland and Short <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2010</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Finding the differentially spliced genes. <bold>a</bold> Schematic view of the principal differential splicing, where two different mRNAs are formed from one gene. <bold>b</bold> For both the <italic>S. epidermidis-</italic>infected (FC 1.17, <italic>P</italic> value 4.62&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and <italic>M. marinum</italic>-infected (FC 4.70, <italic>P</italic> value 2.06&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup>) samples, glucagon A (<italic>gcga</italic>) was found to be differentially spliced as shown by the <italic>dark blue bar</italic> under the left exon.

However, the actual differential expression found of <italic>grnas</italic> occurs from a fusion of two genes, granulin 1 (<italic>grn1</italic>) and granulin 2 (<italic>grn2</italic>), which are located at this same position as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>The differential splicing indicated by the <italic>dark blue bars</italic> at exon 2 and 4 from <italic>grnas</italic> proved to be incorrect.

The data of Scholey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2013</xref> (Scholey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2013</xref>), describing the bovine digital dermatitis (BDD, an infectious foot disease), was used to compare the host response in the cow and zebrafish. The raw data with the accession number GSE41732 was obtained from the GEO database and analysed with the GeneTiles software package. Comparing the differential expression data from Scholey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2013</xref> (Scholey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2013</xref>), we could not validate all transcripts, since 23&#x000a0;% of the transcripts are retired and are not available anymore, due to the updated version of the <italic>Bos taurus</italic> 4.0 Ensembl annotation to the COW UMD3.1 Ensembl annotation.

Gene ontology (GO) (Huang da et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2009a</xref>; Huang da et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009b</xref>) analysis on the overlapping set of the differentially expressed genes between the cow and zebrafish showed that the differentially expressed genes are categorised in multiple response processes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). The group of upregulated overlapping genes between BDD, <italic>M. marinum</italic> and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> infection includes the following genes: prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (<italic>PTGS2</italic>); cytochrome P450, family 24, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (<italic>CYP24A1</italic>); oncostatin M receptor (<italic>OSMR</italic>); optineurin (<italic>OPTN</italic>); EPH receptor A2 (<italic>EPHA2</italic>); signal transducing adaptor family member 2 (<italic>STAP2</italic>); stathmin-like 4 (<italic>STMN4</italic>); LIM domain and actin binding 1 (<italic>LIMA1</italic>); interleukin 1, beta (<italic>IL1B</italic>); solute carrier family 3 (amino acid transporter heavy chain), member 2 (<italic>SLC3A2</italic>) and interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (<italic>IL1RAP</italic>). As expected, most of these genes are related to the immune system such as <italic>OPTN</italic>, which can activate Fas-ligand pathways to induce apoptosis or anti-inflammatory responses (Wild et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2011</xref>); and <italic>IL1B</italic> that is a well-known cytokine produced by activated macrophages, which then can indirectly activate <italic>PTGS2</italic> that also is significantly expressed (Lappas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2013</xref>).

First, the software combines several programs needed for open source RNAseq analysis such as Bowtie2, Samtools, the &#x02018;R&#x02019; statistical package, DESeq, DEXSeq, HTseq and pysam. These programs are placed in a pipeline (script) that runs these programs in the required order, with correct in- and output settings. Second, the processed data is visualised in a user-friendly way and made available for export with a choice of quantitative settings.</p><p>The advantages and ease of the use of this combined toolbox is demonstrated by analysis of the previously published RNAseq datasets from zebrafish and cow infectious disease models, as well as the new RNAseq data of a zebrafish mycobacterial infection experiments. This resulted in a highly confident innate marker set for systemic innate immune response to infection by pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacterial species in zebrafish. Furthermore, the data is viewable in a pathway view using the pathways stored at WikiPathways. In this way, it was also possible to quickly determine the effect of the number of replicates and the evaluation of potential false positive results, as is the case for the analysis of differential splicing using the DEXSeq algorithm. Comparing our experiences with our previous analyses (Veneman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2013</xref>) and the re-analyses performed here, we can estimate that we have saved several months of working time while obtaining far superior output files that could be rapidly compared to the new RNAseq data sets also from other organisms. The data analysed in this study is available at the GeneTiles website for further analysis and as demonstration material. This makes it possible to rapidly evaluate new immune markers in the datasets described in this paper but also can be used to identify new markers based on other search criteria.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Availability and requirements</title><p>The analysis is open source and available for download, as well as offered as Supplementary Material.
