It is the fourth leading cause of death in the world and is expected to be the third by 2020 <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Lopez1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. COPD is a heterogeneous and complex disease consisting of obstruction in the small airways, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Agusti1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Patients with COPD generally have an increased level of systemic inflammation and progressive loss of lung function by irreversible airflow limitations <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Rabe1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. COPD is generally caused by exposure to noxious particles or gases, most commonly from cigarette smoking <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Harvey1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004898-Shapiro1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, only 20&#x02013;25% of smokers develop clinically significant airflow obstruction <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Lokke1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, which suggests that inter-individual differences related in part to genetic susceptibility play an important role in modifying the risk of disease in individuals <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Mayer1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have recently identified several risk loci for COPD and/or smoking associated genes <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Harvey1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Kent1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004898-Pillai1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. While these studies have provided an initial look into the genetic architecture of COPD, they have been limited by size, by heterogeneity of disease phenotype, and by potential confounders relating to the amount of cigarette smoking. The smaller genetic variance component for COPD identified to date could be due to environmental factors and/or epigenetic regulation. Indeed, epigenetic changes are a factor in many diseases, including many different types of cancer <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Egger1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In the lung DNA methylation is an important factor for normal lung function <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Lepeule1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and several studies have recently confirmed that DNA methylation is significantly associated with lung cancer <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Selamat1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004898-Adcock1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Moreover, smoking, which is one of the major risk factors of COPD, is considered as one of important modifiers of DNA methylation <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Breitling1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and it is also known to cause epigenetic changes in lung tissue <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004898-BuroAuriemma1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Therefore, understanding the transcriptional regulation by epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation may shed light on understanding the biological processes associated with COPD susceptibility, severity, and COPD comorbidities such as lung cancer. Recently, DNA methylation is shown to be associated with COPD and lung function, suggesting that genetic and epigenetic pathways may contribute to COPD <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Qiu1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Vucic1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. While previous studies have provided potentially important CpG loci associated with COPD, they have not yet clarified the role variations in methylation play in regulating global gene expression and the biological consequences of such regulation.</p><p>In this study we present a novel systematic approach for identifying key regulators in COPD by integrating functional genomic, epigenetic data, and higher order phenotypic data. We studied 100 COPD and 52 control (CTRL) lung samples to investigate the relationship between methylation status of DNA and expression level of a gene either in close (<italic>cis</italic>) or far (<italic>trans</italic>) proximity to the methylated site. The primary focus of this study is not only to identify those regions that are differentially methylated between COPD cases and controls, but to resolve the gene expression changes that follow as a result of these differentially methylated regions and the biological consequences that these regulatory changes induce with respect to disease development or progression. Our integrative analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression validates the importance of DNA methylation in COPD and enables the direct identification of novel key regulators modulated by epigenetic changes in this multifactorial, systematic disease. When comparing downstream genes controlled by the key regulators with gene sets related to COPD disease severity, we identified <italic>EPAS1</italic> as the only key regulator whose downstream genes significantly overlapped with multiple gene sets related to COPD. We further show that EPAS1 protein levels are lower in lung tissues of COPD patients. <italic>Epas1</italic> is down-regulated transcriptionally by chronic smoke exposure in mice, and the <italic>EPAS1</italic> knockdown signature in human endothelial cells significantly overlaps with our predicted <italic>EPAS1</italic> downstream genes. These data combined suggest that our systematic approach can provide important insights into understanding the mechanisms underlying epigenetic regulation, via DNA methylation, that in turn alters transcriptional programs that lead to COPD pathogenesis and progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Both genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression profiles of 62 non-COPD controls (CTRL) and 148 COPD lung samples were obtained from the collaborative project, Lung Genomics Research Consortium (LGRC). To carry out an integrative analysis, we required that methylation and gene expression data were properly aligned. Therefore, we developed a multi-omic data alignment procedure to iteratively match methylation and gene expression profiles within each individual in the study <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Yoo1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Samples that could not be ambiguously matched were filtered out, leaving a final dataset for analysis consisting of 52 CTRL and 100 COPD sample pairs. Demographic characteristics of these samples are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004898.s010">S1 Table</xref>. After quality checks of methylation intensity, 1.7 M and 1.78 M methyl probes for CTRL and COPD samples, respectively, were retained for further analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004898.s011">S2 Table</xref>). We further selected common methyl probes in the CTRL and COPD groups within promoter regions and/or CpG islands. The expression data for these groups was comprised of 15,261 mRNA probes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> for details), with each methyl probe mapped to the closest genes corresponding to the mRNA probes (described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). A total of 658,108 methyl probes were located in promoter regions of these mRNA probes and were considered in all future analyses.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Differentially methylated CpG islands and differentially expressed genes are associated</title><p>Prior to integrating the molecular traits, we first characterized the differentially expressed and methylated genes between the COPD and CTRL groups. We identified 1,594 genes as differentially expressed between the COPD and CTRL groups (t-test p-value&#x0003c;0.01, corresponding to a false discovery rate, or FDR, of 0.09 based on permutation tests). We also identified 92,606 methylation probes corresponding to 8,848 genes that were differentially methylated between the COPD and CTRL groups (t-test p-value&#x0003c;0.01, FDR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.06 based on permutation tests). There are 990 genes overlapping the set of differentially methylated and expressed genes (Fisher's exact test p-value&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.009). Given methylation data are known to be noisy <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Siegmund1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Aryee1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, we focused on methyl probes located in CpG island defined by a hierarchical hidden Markov model <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, resulting in 26,143 differentially methylated probes corresponding to 6,416 genes for further analyses. Among them, 704 genes overlapped with differentially expressed genes (Fisher's exact test p-value&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6.6&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>). Additional constraints could be applied to further enrich for biologically relevant methylation, such as 1) self-consistent methyl probes (at least two methyl probes differentially methylated for a single gene), and 2) methyl probes close to transcription start sites (&#x0003c;1 kb). These filters were potentially useful for enriching for genes that are both differentially methylated and expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004898.s012">S3 Table</xref>), but were not used in the analysis because they were too stringent, resulting in smaller signature sizes.</p><p>In general, when DNA methylation levels of methyl probes in CpG islands for COPD were compared with those of CTRL samples, the COPD samples were predominantly hypermethylated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004898.s001">S1A Fig</xref>.). Results based on probe-by-probe comparison also showed that CpG islands were more likely to be hypermethylated than hypomethylated in lung tissues of COPD patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004898.s013">S4 Table</xref>). However, when comparing non-CpG island methyl probes, the pattern was very different and the numbers of hyper- and hypo- methylated probes were evenly distributed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004898.s001">S1B Fig</xref>. and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004898.s013">S4 Table</xref>). This different pattern suggested there was no global methylation level difference between COPD and CTRL samples. The main difference between them was methylation levels of CpG islands, suggesting biological importance of methylation of CpG islands in transcription regulation. The hypermethylation pattern in CpG islands was observed in a lung cancer study <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Selamat1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Recently, Vucic <italic>et al.</italic> reported that DNA methylation levels in COPD were different from ones in CTRL samples and 90% of differentially methylated CpG island probes were hypermethylated in small airways epithelium cells from COPD patients <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Vucic1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The differentially methylated or differentially expressed genes were not associated with potential biological subtypes in the samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004898.s029">S1 Text</xref>). These results suggest that there were significant differences in methylation levels between the CTRL and COPD groups and, hence, these differences may be involved in epigenetic regulations causing pathogenesis and progression of COPD.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Both differentially methylated and expressed genes are related to lung function</title><p>Of the 704 differentially methylated genes within CpG islands that are also differentially expressed between the CTRL and COPD groups, most (696 out of 704) were hypermethylated in COPD, whereas only about half of the corresponding gene expression levels (for 378 genes) were downregulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004898.s014">S5 Table</xref>). The remaining 318 genes were upregulated even when their promoter regions were hypermethylated. While this pattern does not match the expected classical inverse relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression levels, a number of studies have shown that the DNA methylation &#x02013; gene expression relationship may be more complicated <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Brenet1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004898-Han1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. While promoter methylation most often leads to gene silencing, DNA methylation of promoter regions, in some cases, can be associated with transcription activation; for example through blocking repressor proteins binding to the promoter region <xref rid="pgen.1004898-BaharHalpern1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Niesen1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.

The other set of genes that are hypermethylated and upregulated in COPD are enriched for a number of GO categories as well, including co-translational protein targeting to membrane (p-value&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2.27&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;13</sup>), protein targeting to ER (p-value&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3.07&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;12</sup>), translational initiation (p-value&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5.34&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup>), translational termination (p-value&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.23&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>), and cellular protein complex disassembly (p-value&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.06&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004898.s016">S7 Table</xref>). These results indicate that both epigenetic and transcriptional regulations contribute to COPD pathogenesis. Hence, knowing the causal relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression is critical to understand the complex and systematic molecular underpinnings of COPD.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>The relationships between gene expression and DNA methylation levels are different in the COPD and CTRL groups</title><p>While CpG islands in COPD are hypermethylated in general, variations in the expression levels of individual genes are mainly influenced by cis-acting methylation levels in a given gene's promoter region <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Brock1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Yang2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.

Therefore to elucidate more comprehensive molecular regulations of COPD disease, we developed a novel systematic approach to identify key regulators in COPD and CTRL lung tissue by integrating genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression patterns. Using our causality test, we link the variation of the expression of numerous genes to only a few key regulators that are systematically regulated by variations in DNA methylation including 126 for COPD and 67 for non-disease lung. These key regulators such as <italic>EPAS1</italic> can be targets of potential therapeutic intervention.</p><p>We also highlighted important biological pathways associated with these key regulators in normal and diseased lung by hierarchical clustering of their common downstream genes. We observed common epigenetic regulations in both CTRL and COPD samples in expression of genes involved in metabolic- and cilium related- biological processes. Although cilium-related genes display the most varying expression levels both in CTRL and COPD samples they are not associated with disease phenotypes. This is an interesting observation as in the lung ciliary-related proteins keep the airways clear of mucus and dirt, allowing one to breathe easily and without irritation. Key regulators of these genes are <italic>WDR90</italic> in CTRL and <italic>PAX9</italic> in COPD. Since mRNA levels of <italic>PAX9</italic> are associated with <italic>WDR90</italic> methylation in CTRL, this suggests the wide variance of expression of the cilium related genes are explained by epigenetic regulations via methylation level of the regulators in the same pathway.</p><p>Similarly, we observed common epigenetic regulations with metabolic processes, including RNA processing and chromatin modifications, by key regulators both in CTRL and COPD. However, unlike the ciliary-related pathway; the key regulators are not exactly the same for COPD and CTRL. These observations highlight in part potential mediators of COPD pathophysiology. In COPD, there are three groups of key regulators obtained based on their shared downstream genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004898.s004">S4B Fig</xref>.). The key regulators in the two large clusters control similar downstream genes involved in metabolic processes, RNA processing, chromatin modification, immune response and cell cycle. This type of coordinated yet diverse pathway regulation seems fitting with the current view of COPD, in that the disease pathologically is not limited to the lungs, but rather a disorder with systemic features. This view is driven in part by the strong associations of COPD with increased CVD risk, anemia, musculoskeletal diseases as well as the metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes mellitus <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Mirrakhimov1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. While the underlying molecular basis linking COPD with these comorbidities is still not fully understood, alterations in several pathophysiological features have been considered important such as systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, adipokine metabolism, insulin resistance and obesity.</p><p>Importantly, beyond the pathway level, we were able to identify genes of importance through looking at the key regulators associated with these cluster. One interesting gene was <italic>GAK</italic>, as it was predicted to regulate the largest number of downstream genes. <italic>GAK</italic> is a cyclin G associated kinase, and is known to regulate clathrin-mediated membrane trafficking <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. Recently, it has also been shown that the disruption of the kinase domain of <italic>GAK</italic>, in mice, causes embryonic lethality due to pulmonary dysfunction including notable alterations in the distribution of lung surfactant protein A <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Tabara1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>, a known biomarker of COPD disease severity <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Bowler1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>. These studies in mice were prompted by the fact that gefitinib, which is an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor and used to treat non-small cell lung cancer in humans, has significant adverse side effects in therapy, such as respiratory dysfunction, which in part has been attributed to the fact the gefitinib also inhibits <italic>GAK</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1004898-Tabara1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. While a role for <italic>GAK</italic> in COPD has not been previously linked, our observations would suggest further investigation is warranted. Importantly, about 87% of key regulators in COPD (111/126) share similar downstream genes with <italic>GAK</italic>. In addition, some of their methylation levels are highly correlated each other, indicating overall that regulation of downstream genes may be mediated by multiple key regulators in a systematic way rather than by single master controllers.</p><p>Other potentially relevant mediators of COPD pathophysiology are those key regulators that showed a different methylation profile and different downstream target gene set as compared to all other regulators, such as was the case with <italic>EPAS1</italic>. To our knowledge <italic>EPAS1</italic> has not been previously linked with COPD pathophysiology. This is despite the fact that <italic>EPAS1</italic> is one of the major mediators of the transcriptional response to physiological hypoxia, an environment typical of lung alveolar as progressive airflow limitation increases with COPD severity. <italic>EPAS1</italic> is a hypoxia-responsive transcription factor and is also known as hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF-2&#x003b1;) <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Tian1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Ema1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Interestingly, compared to the ubiquitous expression of <italic>HIF1a</italic>, another key mediator of hypoxic responses, <italic>EPAS1</italic> has relatively high levels of expression in the placenta, heart, lung and endothelial cells. Importantly, a previous study reported alveolar hypoxia increases in prevalence as disease severity increases <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Kent2" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref> and mounting evidence suggests, hypoxia is more than a signifier of advanced COPD but rather a key player in many of the maladaptive processes as well as the systemic comorbidities associated with COPD. Since sustained exposure of cultured lung alveolar epithelial cells to hypoxia maintained the induction of <italic>EPAS1</italic> expression as induced by short-term hypoxic exposure, the decreased <italic>EPAS1</italic> expression observed in COPD may in fact result in maladaptive hypoxia responses <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Uchida1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>. Thus understanding the contribution of <italic>EPAS1</italic> to disease and its mechanisms in it would be very promising for treatment of disease.</p><p>In this study we demonstrate that <italic>EPAS1</italic> methylation level is significantly associated with disease severity and that an increase in methylation decreases <italic>EPAS1</italic> gene expression. Thus we hypothesize that disease severity may be systematically controlled by altered regulation of a large set of <italic>EPAS1</italic> downstream genes. Several observations in humans and mouse have demonstrated that altered <italic>EPAS1</italic> expression can affect lung physiology. Specifically gain-of-function mutations in humans were associated with pulmonary hypertension, increased cardiac output and heart rate as well as increased pulmonary ventilation relative to metabolism <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Formenti1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. However, in a heterozygous <italic>EPAS1</italic> mutant mouse, haploinsufficiency for the oxygen-sensing factor resulted in augmented carotid body sensitivity to hypoxia, including irregular breathing, apneas, hypertension and elevated norephinephrine levels on one mouse strain background, but protection against pulmonary hypertension on a different strain <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Peng1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Brusselmans1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. There are several consequences of hypoxia in COPD which may contribute to disease severity, with pulmonary hypertension in part due to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction driven by alveolar hypoxia, being one of them.</p><p>Another possible link between hypoxia mediated COPD disease severity and <italic>EPAS1</italic> may be the fact that <italic>EPAS1</italic> is a known transcriptional activator of the VEGF <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Ema1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, which was shown in our study to be one of <italic>EPAS1</italic> downstream genes and one of EPAS1 siRNA signature genes. <italic>VEGF</italic> expression level is associated with COPD phenotypes and downregulated in COPD samples in the LGRC dataset. <italic>VEGF</italic> is involved both in the regulation of the bronchial microvascular changes as well as in the inflammatory airway changes in COPD. In patients with emphysema, low levels of VEGF are thought to promote the destruction of alveoli, since VEGF normally acts to induce the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins and acts as a survival factor for endothelial cells. The importance of VEGF in survival signals necessary for the maintenance of normal lung structure and consequences characteristics of emphysema has also been confirmed in animal studies disrupting VEGF signaling either through genetic deletion of lung <italic>VEGF</italic> or through VEGF receptor blockage. <italic>VEGF</italic> is also thought to play a dual role in the lung by regulating not only apoptosis but also efferocytosis, which is the process involved in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. The net effect of efferocytosis is anti-inflammatory because dying cells are removed before they undergo postapoptotic necrosis and anti-inflammatory mediators are released thereby suppressing further adaptive immune responses. Therefore, dysregulation of <italic>VEGF</italic> via altered <italic>EPAS1</italic> regulation could link hypoxia to mechanisms of COPD severity <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Voelkel1" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>.</p><p>One other point of interest is the fact that neonatal mice lacking complete <italic>EPAS1</italic> expression have deficient lung surfactant, such as surfactant D (SP-D), in addition to other lung abnormalities and die of respiratory failure <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Compernolle1" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>. This deficiency has been attributed to reduced expression of <italic>VEGF</italic> as VEGF rescue therapy resulted in restoration of surfactant production and less respiratory distress in the <italic>EPAS1</italic> null mice compared to wildtype. Surfactants, such as SP-D have many functional properties including anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant capacities, and protection against respiratory infections. In various mouse models, SP-D appears to play a distinct role in protecting murine lungs from the development of emphysematous changes possibly by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress in the lungs. While in humans, elevated serum SP-D level is an apparent biomarker of COPD, there is a reported inverse relationship with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels, whether elevated or decreased levels of SP-D are important in pathogenesis are still unclear <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Sin1" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>. Nonetheless, this is another clear example of how <italic>EPAS1</italic>, through modulation of <italic>VEGF</italic>, may contribute to the chronic inflammatory response and tissue destruction in COPD through augmented apoptosis, impaired efferocytosis, and abnormal tissue remodeling.</p><p>Many studies focus on genetic contribution to COPD development and phenotypes <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Castaldi1" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004898-Gingo1" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref> and a recent review paper provides an updated list of COPD associated genes <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Bosse2" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>. There are 140 COPD susceptible genes identified in at least one of COPD GWAS studies. When we overlapped these CODP susceptible genes with <italic>EPAS1</italic> downstream genes, the overlap is marginal significant (Fisher's exact test p-value&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.053), but it is the best overlap comparing with other regulator's downstream genes (the second best p-value is above 0.1). This enrichment of COPD GWAS genes in <italic>EPAS1</italic> downstream further substantiates critical role of <italic>EPAS1</italic> in the disease.</p><p>At present it is still unclear how the methylation level of key regulators, in particular the predominant hypermethylation seen in COPD is regulated upstream. A recent study has also demonstrated that DNA methylation is widely disrupted and predominantly hypermethylated in small airway epithelia of COPD patients <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Vucic2" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>. In addition to cigarette smoking, evidence has shown that hypoxia is also an important regulator of a cell's global epigenetic profile. For an example, chronic hypoxia induces a significant increase in global DNA methylation such as in human pulmonary fibroblasts <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>. Some of the underlying mechanisms that may account for global epigenetic alterations in DNA methylation include changes in the activity of epigenetic modifying enzymes such as DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) or in levels of the methyl-donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). DNA hypermethylation has also been demonstrated in PwR-1E prostate cell cultures in response to chronic hypoxia, a consequence linked to increased <italic>de novo</italic> DNMT activity due to elevated expression of <italic>DNMT3B</italic> as well as a hypoxia-induced decrease in levels of SAM suggesting an increase in SAM usage in hypoxic cells <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Watson1" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>. Interestingly, low circulating levels of folate and increased homocysteine levels, which are involved in the generation of SAM via the one-carbon cycle, have been associated with COPD patients <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Fimognari1" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>.</p><p>Compared with the number of inferred relationships that methylation variations causally regulate gene expression (methylation &#x02192; gene expression) in <italic>trans</italic>, the number of inferred relationships that gene expression variations causally regulate methylation variations (gene expression &#x02192;methylation) in COPD is small (362,095 vs. 19,173). Similar to the methylation &#x02192; gene expression relationships, the numbers of genes' methylation levels regulated by a gene's expression level in <italic>trans</italic> follow a scale-free distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004898.s008">S8 Fig</xref>.). The top putative causal regulator <italic>CDK5RAP1</italic> controls methylation levels of 152 genes in COPD. <italic>CDK5RAP1</italic> is a RNA methyltransferase <xref rid="pgen.1004898-Reiter1" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>. Both DNA and RNA transmethylations are affected by the availability of the universal methyl donor substrate S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Interesting, 44 of 126 key methylation &#x02192; gene expression regulators overlap with <italic>CDK5RAP1</italic> downstream genes (p-value&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4.9&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;57</sup>). And among the 44 genes in the overlap, 32 genes methylation levels negatively correlate with <italic>CDK5RAP1</italic> expression level and 12 of them positively correlate. This result suggests that one possible mechanism <italic>CDK5RAP1</italic> regulating methylation levels of key COPD regulators is through affecting availability of SAM.</p><p>It is worth to note that there are differences between statistical causal and biological causal relationships.

At Spearman correlation p-value&#x0003e;0.01, 42.1% of tested pairs were independent. When checking pairs selected from permuted data sets, only 21.4% of tested pairs were independent.

It is possible to set more stringent p-value cutoffs for the conditional independent test <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1004898.e079.jpg"/></inline-formula>. At p-value&#x0003e;0.05 and 0.1, the corresponding FDRs were 0.001 and<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1004898.e080.jpg"/></inline-formula>, respectively.
