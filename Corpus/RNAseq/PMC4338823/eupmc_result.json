    "RNA editing is a post-transcriptional alteration of RNA sequences that is able to affect protein structure as well as RNA and protein expression. Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is the most frequent and common post-transcriptional modification in human, where adenosine (A) deamination produces its conversion into inosine (I), which in turn is interpreted by the translation and splicing machineries as guanosine (G). The disruption of the editing machinery has been associated to various human diseases such as cancer or neurodegenerative diseases. This biological phenomenon is catalyzed by members of the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family of enzymes and occurs on dsRNA structures. Despite the enormous efforts made in the last decade, the real biological function underlying such a phenomenon, as well as ADAR's substrate features still remain unknown. In this work, we summarize the major computational aspects of predicting and understanding RNA editing events. We also investigate the detection of short motif sequences potentially characterizing RNA editing signals and the use of a logistic regression technique to model a predictor of RNA editing events. The latter, named AIRlINER, an algorithmic approach to assessment of A-to-I RNA editing sites in non-repetitive regions, is available as a web app at: http://alpha.dmi.unict.it/airliner/. Results and comparisons with the existing methods encourage our findings on both aspects."
