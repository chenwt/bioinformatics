The members of the genus <italic>Ruminococcus</italic> are found in both the ruminant and human gastrointestinal tract, where they show versatility in degrading both hemicellulose and cellulose. The available genome sequence of <italic>Ruminococcus albus</italic> 8, a common inhabitant of the cow rumen, alludes to a bacterium well-endowed with genes that target degradation of various plant cell wall components. The mechanisms by which <italic>R. albus</italic> 8 employs to degrade these recalcitrant materials are, however, not clearly understood. In this report, we demonstrate that <italic>R. albus</italic> 8 elaborates multiple cellobiohydrolases with multi-modular architectures that overall enhance the catalytic activity and versatility of the enzymes. Furthermore, our analyses show that two cellobiose phosphorylases encoded by <italic>R. albus</italic> 8 can function synergistically with a cognate cellobiohydrolase and endoglucanase to completely release, from a cellulosic substrate, glucose which can then be fermented by the bacterium for production of energy and cellular building blocks. We further use transcriptomic analysis to confirm the over-expression of the biochemically characterized enzymes during growth of the bacterium on cellulosic substrates compared to cellobiose.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The utilization of lignocellulosic biomass for production of liquid fuels is an important and promising alternative energy production. The structural polysaccharides of plant cell walls, i.e., cellulose and hemicellulose, represent a major source of fermentable sugars for potential production of biochemicals and biofuels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. However, the high cost and low enzymatic activities of cellulases, which are the enzymes responsible for converting pretreated biomass into fermentable sugars, are major challenges to biomass biorefineries<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.</p><p>Cellulose, which accounts for a major proportion of the plant cell wall, consists of linear chains of &#x003b2;-1,4 linked glucose monomers. Crystalline cellulose is highly recalcitrant due to a high degree of crosslinking formed by hydrogen bonds, whereas amorphous cellulose is less rigid and more easily accessible to enzymatic degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. In order to degrade cellulose, different classes of cellulolytic enzymes function synergistically to release the glucose monomers, and these enzymes include endoglucanases, exoglucanases, and &#x003b2;-glucosidases. Endoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.4) randomly cleave internal regions of cellulose, producing shorter chains and also new chain ends. Exoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.91) bind to the reducing or non-reducing ends and processively release cellobiose, the repeating units in cellulose, as the major end product. Finally, &#x003b2;-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.21) catalyze the conversion of cellobiose into glucose. The synergistic activity of these enzymes on cellulose degradation is reported elsewhere in details<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Some microorganisms encode genes for cellobiose phosphorylases, which use phosphate to cleave cellobiose, releasing glucose and glucose-1-phosphate in an energy conserving step<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p><p>Fibrolytic bacteria and fungi use three predominant mechanisms to degrade recalcitrant plant cell wall polysaccharides, namely a free enzyme system, a cellulosomal system, and a Polysaccharide Utilization Loci system (PULs). In the free enzyme system, proteins are secreted and diffuse independently of one another and work synergistically to degrade plant cell wall polysaccharides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. For example, the model filamentous fungus <italic>Trichoderma reesei</italic> secretes an effective cocktail of free carbohydrate-active enzymes to degrade both cellulose and hemicellulose<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. In contrast, cellulosomes are multi-enzyme complexes produced by certain anaerobic microorganisms, such as <italic>Clostridium thermocellum</italic>, <italic>Clostridium cellulolyticum</italic>, <italic>Ruminoccocus flavefaciens</italic> and <italic>Ruminococcus champanellensis</italic>, for efficient and ordered degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. In the cellulosomes, multiple cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes are physically linked to a tethering protein scaffold, termed scaffoldin. Both catalytic domains and non-catalytic accessory modules are linked to facilitate binding to the substrate and are active against a variety of substrates such as cellulose, xylan, and pectin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In a recently unraveled polysaccharide degradation strategy, it has been shown that members of the Bacteroidetes phylum, including several complex polysaccharide degrading <italic>Bacteroides</italic> spp and <italic>Prevotella</italic> spp, have evolved a polysaccharide deconstruction strategy where the genes encoding a complex network or machinery of sensors, transporters, and degradative enzymes are all clustered in a genome, an example being the xylan utilization system or XUS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p><p>Glycoside hydrolases (GH), the enzymes responsible for the cleavage of glycosydic bonds are grouped into families on the basis of amino acid sequence in the Carbohydrate Active enZYme (CAZY) database<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. These enzymes have different structural folds, different mechanisms, and a wide range of substrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Currently, 44 of the 115 glycoside hydrolase families have been reported to contribute to plant cell wall degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Some of the major glycoside hydrolases that are involved in cellulose degradation are GH1, GH3, GH5, GH6, GH7, GH8, GH9, GH12, GH44, GH45, GH48, GH61,GH74, and GH94<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Among them, GH family 9 is the second largest cellulase family and contains both endoglucanases and processive endoglucanases with varying domain architectures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Most of the GH9 family enzymes have low or no activity on crystalline cellulose, but have activity on soluble cellulose derivatives, including carboxymethyl cellulose and phosphoric acid swollen cellulose<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p><p>The rumen is home to a consortium of microorganisms that have evolved to efficiently degrade and ferment plant cell wall polysaccharides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. The primary organisms responsible for the degradation of plant cell walls are <italic>Fibrobacter succinogenes</italic>, <italic>R. flavefaciens</italic> and <italic>R. albus</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Specifically, <italic>R. albus</italic> 8 is a gram positive, fibrolytic, anaerobic bacterium and appears to be one of the most active cellulolytic bacteria in the rumen, with the capacity to degrade both cellulose and hemicellulose<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Although <italic>R. albus</italic> 8 has not been shown to produce a cellulosomal complex, related species <italic>R. flavefaciens</italic> and <italic>R. champanellensis</italic>, have been described to possess the capacity to synthesize a cellulosome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p><p>In the present report, we analyzed the draft genome sequence of <italic>R. albus</italic> 8 and identified a total of 22 genes encoding different glycoside hydrolases including 17 putative endoglucanases (GH5), 3 putative cellobiohydrolases (GH9) and 2 putative cellobiose phosphorylases (GH94), that may have roles in cellulose degradation. To explore the mechanism of cellulose hydrolysis utilized by this bacterium, we have undertaken a systematic approach to characterize the function of each of the predicted cellulose targeting genes. Here, the genes encoding the putative cellobiohydrolases, i.e., <italic>ra3055</italic>, <italic>ra1589</italic>, and <italic>ra1743</italic>, along with the putative cellobiose phosphorylases, <italic>ra2122</italic> and <italic>ra2664</italic>, were heterologously expressed and biochemically characterized. In order to further assess the roles of each domain within the polypeptide with the most active cellobiohydrolase activity or Ra3055, truncational variants of the polypeptide were expressed and biochemically characterized. Furthermore, synergistic interactions of an endoglucanase with an exoglucanase and the cellobiose phosphorylases were explored to gain insight into the complete cellulose deconstruction mechanism of <italic>R. albus</italic> 8.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cloning and expression of cellobiohydrolases from <italic>R. albus</italic> 8</title><p>In an earlier report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, we discovered that seven endoglucanases from <italic>R. albus</italic> 8 hydrolyze cellulosic substrates to oligosaccharides, including cellobiose and cellotriose, with a far less proportion of glucose. Among these enzymes, endoglucanase Ra0903 was the most active on PASC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. To determine which genes the bacterium likely uses in addition to the endoglucanases to completely depolymerize cellulose, we used a bioinformatics approach to identify genes encoding potential enzymes that may further hydrolyze the end products of the <italic>R. albus</italic> 8 endoglucanases to fermentable sugars. Three genes encoding GH9 modules, likely functioning as cellobiohydrolases, were identified. The modular organization of the three gene products (Ra3055, Ra1589, and Ra1743) are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>. Both Ra3055 and Ra1589 are made up of a CBM4_9, an Ig-like motif, and a GH9 catalytic domain followed by a C-terminally located CBM37. The modular architecture of Ra1743 is not different from that of Ra3055 and Ra1589, except for the absence of the CBM37. Each gene product was purified to near homogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>) and tested for the capacity to hydrolyze a number of cello-oligosaccharides. None of the polypeptides could hydrolyze cellobiose (or glucose with a degree of polymerization-DP- of 2). In contrast, all three polypeptides released cellobiose from cellotriose (DP3), cellotetraose (DP4), cellopentaose (DP5), and cellohexaose (DP6). The enzymatic activity of Ra3055 was the most active on each of the substrates, and in some cases (DP3, DP5 and DP6), the enzyme released glucose in addition to cellobiose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). For a cellobiohydrolase, this was expected as cleavage of a cello-oligosaccharide with an odd number of degree of polymerization (DP) will leave a glucose unit. The enzymes were also tested for activity on amorphous cellulose, i.e., phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) and the model crystalline cellulose Avicel. Here also, Ra3055 showed a far superior activity compared with the other two proteins. In each case the enzymes released more reducing ends on PASC than Avicel. Based on the hydrolytic activity of the polypeptides on the substrates and their end products, we have assigned cellobiohydrolase activities to all three enzymes, with Ra3055 as the most active functional homolog.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The pH and temperature optima of the cellobiohydrolases of <italic>R. albus</italic> 8</title><p>The end products of the cellobiohydrolases on cellotetraose suggested that they derive from a single catalytic round. Therefore, this substrate was used to determine the pH and temperature optima of each enzyme. Both Ra1589 and Ra1743 showed temperature optima ranging between 30&#x02013;45&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Surprisingly, the temperature optimum of Ra3055 was at 55&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, a temperature at which there was no activity for the other two proteins. Furthermore, we could measure relative activities of 20% and 10% at 60&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 65&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, respectively, for Ra3055 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). In the case of pH, the range was similar again for Ra1589 and Ra1743. The two enzymes showed broad activity range with the optima at 6.0&#x02013;7.0. The pH optimum for Ra3055, in contrast was 6.5, with more than 80% activity being detected at pH 7.0 and 7.5. Furthermore, 40% of the maximum activity was detected at both pH 6.0 and pH 8.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Time course for the release of end products</title><p>We carried out an analysis to determine the time course for the release of end products for Ra3055, the most active of the three cellobiohydrolases, on an even number and odd number chain of oligosaccharides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). The <italic>R. albus</italic> 8 Ra3055 cleaved cellopentaose almost to completion within 60&#x02009;minutes and over the period the end products were almost entirely cellobiose and cellotriose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). On the other hand, the hydrolysis of cellohexaose was slow and the end products were more mixed (3 peaks) with most being cellobiose and cellotetraose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Truncational analysis to determine the contribution of various modules in Ra3055 to its enzymatic activity</title><p>A PCR approach was used to delete different modules in Ra3055 to determine their influence on the cellobiohydrolytic activity of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>). All truncational variants (TM1, TM2, TM3, and TM4) were purified to near homogeneity based on SDS-PAGE analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Based on end point reactions and compared to the non-mutated enzyme (WT), removal of the N-terminal CBM4_9 (TM1) appeared to have no influence on the hydrolysis of cellotetraose. Similar observations were made with the deletion of the C-terminal CBM37 from the polypeptide (TM2). Furthermore, cleaving both the N-terminal CBM4_9 and the C-terminal CBM37 (TM3) and thus leaving only the Ig-domain and the GH9 catalytic module (TM3) also seem to have no impact on the catalytic activity of Ra3055. However, removal of all accessory domains (TM4) led to very little hydrolysis of cellotetraose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C,D</xref>). In contrast, analysis of the activities of the different truncational variants with polysaccharides as substrates yielded unexpected results. While all of the truncational mutants showed reduced activity on Avicel and PASC compared to the full length enzyme (WT), the TM2 mutant rather showed higher release of end products. In fact, the amount of cellobiose equivalents released by TM2 was about twice that of the full length protein, whereas with other variants there were several-fold decreases in hydrolysis of the polysaccharides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4E</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Enzyme kinetics parameters of the truncational variants</title><p>To gain better insights to the effect of the different deletions on the catalytic activity of Ra3055 as a cellobiohydrolase, the impact of the deletions in the polypeptide on the kinetic parameters of the enzyme were estimated with cellotetraose as the substrate. The removal of each of the CBMs led to an increase in the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> of the enzyme; however, in each case the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> also increased with subsequent catalytic efficiency of TM1 being slightly higher while this parameter for TM2 was lower compared with the full length protein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The TM3 mutant had a similar <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> as the full length polypeptide, and a slightly higher <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> led to a similar catalytic efficiency as that of the full length polypeptide. Similar to the end point assay, cleaving of all the accessory modules, and thus leaving only the GH9 catalytic domain, led to a dramatic decrease in activity, with the catalytic efficiency dropping by close to 120-fold.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Characterization of cellobiose phosphorylases from <italic>R. albus</italic> 8</title><p>The GH9 enzymes, including Ra3055 with the highest catalytic activity, behaved as cellobiohydrolases with mainly cellobiose as end products. It was reasoned that <italic>R. albus</italic> 8 will encode enzymes that cleave the cellobiose to two glucose units for fermentation through the glycolytic pathway. A search of the genome of <italic>R. albus</italic> 8 yielded two genes encoding GH94 polypeptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>) that are likely to function as cellobiose phosphorylases. The genes were expressed and the proteins were purified to near homogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Each polypeptide was then investigated for the capacity to yield hydrolytic products from cellobiose. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>, several peaks including glucose and other cello-oligosaccharides ranging from cellotriose to cellohexaose, were observed with the incubation of Ra2122 and Ra2664 on cellobiose in the presence of inorganic phosphate. While a clear peak representing glucose-1-phosphate (G-1-P) was not observed for Ra2122, a discernible peak for G-1-P was present from the end products of Ra2664 on cellobiose.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Hydrolysis of a cellulosic substrate with an endoglucanase, a cellobiohydrolase and cellobiose phosphorylases from <italic>R. albus</italic> 8</title><p>The endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases, and cellobiose-phosphorylases are likely to cooperate to release fermentable sugars for utilization by <italic>R. albus</italic> 8. Thus, the synergistic activity of the most active enzymes of each enzyme family (endoglucanase (Ra0903), cellobiohydrolase (Ra3055) and cellobiose phosphorylase (Ra2122)) was tested. Furthermore, the different truncational variants of the cellobiohydrolase Ra3055 were tested for their effects on the synergy of the three enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>). The Ra3055 enzyme (designated WT) released mostly cellobiose from the PASC. Furthermore, the truncational variant TM2 of Ra3055 released about twice the amount of cellobiose released by the full length enzyme or WT. A combination of the cellobiohydrolase and its truncational variants (TM1, TM2, TM3, and TM4) with the endoglucanase resulted in large increases in both cellobiose and glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>). In contrast, a combination of the truncational variants and the cellobiose-phosphorylase (0.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;M each) led to release of mostly glucose, i.e., &#x0003e;90% glucose present in the reaction mixture. A combination of the 3 enzymes led to release of higher amounts of glucose in the reaction mixture. It is also of interest to note that in each case of the combinations of enzymes on PASC, the presence of TM2 resulted in the highest amounts of end products.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>, it is very clear from the chromatogram that the mixture of the endoglucanase and the cellobiohydrolase (Ra0903 and Ra3055) led to a large increase in cellobiose production. Combining the two enzymes with the cellobiose phosphorylase then led to most of the cellobiose being converted to glucose. We increased the sensitivity around the retention time at which glucose-1-phosphate elutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>) to determine the presence of glucose-1-phosphate. However, we observed a peak that appears to be present at the elution time of G-1-P even in the absence of the cellobiose phosphorylase in the reaction mixture. Thus, the release of this end product in the three-enzyme reaction mixture was inconclusive.</p><p>The synergistic activity of the 3 enzymes was further assessed with the crystalline cellulose Avicel and also pretreated sugarcane bagasse as substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>). Similar to the experiment with PASC, the endoglucanases by themselves and also in combination with the cellobiohydrolase and its truncational variants led to mostly the release of cellobiose, whereas the incubation with a mixture of the cellobiohydrolase and its truncational derivatives with the cellobiose-phosphorylase resulted in mostly glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>). As expected, the reaction with all three enzymes resulted in the highest release of end products and these were mostly glucose. As observed before, the WT and TM2 variant always yielded higher end products than all truncational variants when present in a reaction mixture. In Avicel and pretreated sugarcane bagasse, however, the mixture with the WT enzyme appears to yield more end products than the reaction with TM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6D</xref>), suggesting importance of the CBM4_9 in hydrolysis of complex substrates. We calculated the degree of synergy (DOS) based on release of glucose as the final end product. As expected, the presence of the cellobiose phosphorylase in the enzyme mixture led to a very high degree of synergy compare to other enzyme mixtures lacking the cellobiose phosphorylase or Ra2122. This observation clearly demonstrated the function of the cellobiose phosphorylase in converting most of the end products of the endoglucanase and the cellobiohydrolase to the fermentable sugar glucose. It is also noteworthy that the degree of synergy in the presence of the cellobiose phosphorylase was generally higher on the pretreated sugar cane bagasse than on the crystalline cellulose Avicel.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Substrate binding activity of Ra3055 and its truncational variants</title><p>Since the cellobiohydrolases have similar modular architecture, the truncational mutants were investigated to determine the contributions of the different modules to substrate binding. The first experiment (SI Fig. 1) involved migration of the proteins of interest through substrate infused non-denaturing PAGE. Here the results were inconclusive, since the electrophoresis with the substrate infused and non-infused gels yielded the same migration pattern. The proteins were, therefore, investigated for their capacity to bind to the crystalline cellulose Avicel. On reacting with Avicel, the full length protein (WT), and the truncational derivatives TM1 and TM2 clearly bound to the Avicel with very little amount of the polypeptide remaining in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7A</xref>). Although with TM3 and TM4 there was binding to substrates, increased amounts of the proteins were also found in solution (U under TM3 and TM4).

Although the ability of this bacterium to degrade plant cell wall polysaccharides is well known, the mechanism of cellulose degradation by <italic>R. albus</italic> 8 is little understood. Through analysis of the draft genome sequence of <italic>R. albus</italic> 8, we previously uncovered many genes predicted to be involved in cellulose depolymerization, including 17 putative endoglucanases, three putative cellobiohydrolases, and two putative cellobiose phosphorylases. The endoglucanases of <italic>R. albus</italic> 8, which represent the enzymes that initially attack the cellulose backbone were recently characterized<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. To gain insights into the role of accessory enzymes that likely function in synergy with the endoglucanases to depolymerize cellulose, we cloned and heterologously expressed the genes encoding the three putative cellobiohydrolases and two putative cellobiose phosphorylases for biochemical analysis of the gene products.</p><p>The cellobiohydrolases encoded by <italic>R. albus</italic> 8 belong to GH9, for which members display a broad spectrum of substrate specificity. The enzymatic activities of the GH9 further differs based on fusion of other modules, such as carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM), in the same polypeptide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The catalytic modules contain an (&#x003b1;/&#x003b1;)<sub>6</sub> barrel structure and other non-catalytic domains may be appended N- or C-terminally to the GH9 domain. The putative cellobiohydrolases (Ra3055, Ra1589 and Ra1743) studied here have an N-terminal CBM4_9 domain followed by an Ig-like domain, the GH9 catalytic module and a CBM37 at the C-terminus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Note, however, that the last module, i.e., the CBM37 is missing in Ra1743. The structure of the <italic>R. albus</italic> 8 enzymes are similar to those found in other Firmicutes, including the Cel9E and Cel9V of <italic>Clostridium cellulolyticum</italic>, except for the presence of dockerin domains in place of the CBM37<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. The swapping of the CBM37 for dockerins is a unique feature of <italic>R. albus</italic> species which utilize the CBM37 for direct attachment to the bacterial cell wall<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, while dockerins are indirectly attached to a bacterial cell via cellulosomes. During hydrolysis of substrates, Ra3055, Ra1589, and Ra1743 exhibited far higher activities on amorphous cellulose (PASC) compared to crystalline cellulose (Avicel) and released cellobiose as a major end product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>). The activites of the <italic>R. albus</italic> 8 proteins are analogous to the <italic>C. cellulolyticum</italic> proteins, i.e., they release predominantly cellobiose from cellulosic polysaccharides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Other GH9 cellulases with similar domain architectures, including CelK and CenC from <italic>Clostridium thermocellum</italic>, and CelE from <italic>Clostridium cellulolyticum</italic> have been reported to release cellobiose from cellulosic substrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. As previously reported in multi-domain cellulases, the GH9 enzymes of <italic>R. albus</italic> 8 likely act first by a random cleavage of cellulose and then employ a processive mode of action to release cellobiose<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>.

The Ig-like module impacts the catalytic activity of cellulases by modifying the structural stability of the enzymes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. In the present study, truncational analysis of Ra3055, the most highly expressed cellobiohydrolase relative to other glycoside hydrolases, was employed to identify the role of individual domains to catalysis and binding of amorphous cellulose and soluble cello-oligosaccharides. A series of truncational mutants of Ra3055, lacking individual or multiple domains were made (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). The removal of the CBM4_9, i.e., in Ra3055 TM1 and TM3, resulted in a drastic decrease in hydrolysis of amorphous and crystalline cellulose, while no decrease was observed in cellotetraose degradation. This finding suggests that this CBM is essential for the recognition and degradation of the polymeric cellulose. Previous reports on truncational variants in cellobiohydrolases of <italic>Clostridium thermocellum</italic> (CbhA) and <italic>Clostridium cellulovorans</italic> (EngK and EngM) and <italic>C. cellulolyticum</italic> (CelE) observed similar finding, i.e., a decrease in activity or complete loss of activity on cellulosic substrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. The crystal structure of a CBM4 fused to the Ig-like domain from the CbhA of <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> revealed that CBM4 efficiently binds to amorphous regions of cellulose<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Contrasting these results, the truncational variant lacking CBM37, i.e., Ra3055 TM2, had an increased activity on swollen cellulose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figs 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">6</xref>). Activity on Avicel and sugarcane bagasse had a similar phenomenon, with Ra3055 TM2 exhibiting similar activity to WT, while Ra3055 TM1 and TM3 only possessed very low activities compared with WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). This observation may be the result of the promiscuous nature of CBM37 in binding to a large number of polysaccharides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. This property of CBM37 may titrate Ra3055 away from the preferred amorphous regions of hydrolysis, to which CBM4_9 has high affinity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Thus, the loss of CBM37 increases the affinity to the preferred binding regions of CBM4_9 (amorphous) and therefore leading to more robust hydrolysis. Alternatively, the CBM37 domain is implicated as a shuttle used by the organism to transfer glycoside hydrolases to the plant cell wall when in close proximity, as evidenced by the CBM37 for the peptidoglycan of <italic>R. albus</italic> 8<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Here, the CBM37 may adhere the enzyme to the peptidoglycan and only hydrolyze amorphous cellulose in direct contact with the bacterium, thus decreasing competition by other organisms in its community for the end products of hydrolysis. In terms of the physiology of <italic>R. albus</italic> 8, this suggests that if the CBM37 is removed, the enzyme may be more versatile; however, this may also decrease fitness of the bacterium by reducing its effectiveness in capturing energy from its environments. The truncational variant lacking all accessory domains, Ra3055 TM4, had very low activity on all tested substrates, reflecting the importance of the appended modules to the overall function of the polypeptide. This phenomenon was also seen in truncational and site-directed mutants of the CbhA of <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> and also further revealed that hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions between the Ig-like module and the catalytic module are required for enzymatic activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>.</p><p>Due to the complexity of the ruminal microbial community, an efficent system for nutrient acquisition and utilization is essential.

Previous reports predicted that almost 75% of consumed cello-oligomers were degraded through phosphorolytic cleavage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. The conversion of cellobiose to glucose and glucose-1-phosphate (G-1P) is catalyzed by cellobiose phosphorylase (CBP) and cellodextrin phosphorylase, previously characterized from ruminal and soil microbes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. From the draft genome sequence of <italic>R. albus</italic> 8, we identified two genes encoding putative cellobiose phosphorylases (Ra2122 and Ra2664). The amino acid sequences of the polypeptides were almost identitcal (96% identity) to the cellobiose phosphorylases (Rumal_2403 and Rumal_0187) of <italic>R. albus</italic> 7 and belong to GH94. Furthermore, homologs of these proteins have been characterized from <italic>R. albus</italic> NE1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. The <italic>R. albus</italic> 8 cellobiose phosphorylases showed similar activity on cellobiose, releasing glucose and a range of cello-oligosaccharides through transglycosylation reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). A similar activity was observed in the purified cellodextrin phosphorylase from <italic>R. albus</italic> NE1 and the cell extract of <italic>R. albus</italic> B199 when the proteins were incubated with cellobiose and glucose-1-phosphate. In both cases, a decrease in cellobiose with a concomitant increase in cellotriose, cellotetraose, and cellopentaose was observed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Differences in substrate recognition between Ra2122 and Ra2664 were apparent when we analyzed the hydrolysis patterns on longer chain oligosaccharides, i.e., cellotriose and cellotetraose (SI Fig. 2). Although transglycosylation products were observed for both enzymes, differences in activity were visible when longer chain oligosaccharides were used as substrates. For example, Ra2664 released predominantly glucose from cellotriose and cellotetraose while Ra2122 produced small amounts of longer chain oligosaccharides, indicating Ra2664 as a cellodextrin phosphorylase. Since Ra2122 was only able to efficiently degrade cellobiose, this enzyme may act primarily as a cellobiose phosphorylase within the organism, in agreement with previous reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>.</p><p>To assess synergistic effects, combinatorial mixtures containing an endoglucanase (Ra0903), a cellobiohydrolase (Ra3055), and the cellobiose phosphorylase (Ra2122) were co-incubated with cellulosic substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A,D</xref>). With Ra0903 and Ra3055, synergistic release of cellobiose and glucose was observed when compared to the individual enzymes, and addition of the cellobiose phosphorylase increased the proportion of glucose in the final products. We predict that the cellobiose released as the predominant end product by Ra0903 and Ra3055 is transported into the cytoplasm by cellobiose transporters for subsequent phosphorolysis by Ra2122 and Ra2664 to glucose and G-1-P for metabolism through glycolysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. A functionally homologous system was recently characterized from an uncultured member of the ruminal Bacteroidetes derived from metagenomic sequencing.
