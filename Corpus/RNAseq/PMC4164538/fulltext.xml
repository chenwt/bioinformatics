Modern cultivars are hybrids derived from crosses between <italic>Saccharum officinarum</italic> and <italic>Saccharum spontaneum</italic>. Hybrid cultivars combine favorable characteristics from ancestral species and contain a genome that is highly polyploid and aneuploid, containing 100&#x02013;130 chromosomes. These complex genomes represent a huge challenge for molecular studies and for the development of biotechnological tools that can facilitate sugarcane improvement. Here, we describe full-length enriched cDNA libraries for <italic>Saccharum officinarum</italic>, <italic>Saccharum spontaneum</italic>, and one hybrid genotype (SP803280) and analyze the set of open reading frames (ORFs) in their genomes (i.e., their ORFeomes). We found 38,195 (19%) sugarcane-specific transcripts that did not match transcripts from other databases. Less than 1.6% of all transcripts were ancestor-specific (i.e., not expressed in SP803280). We also found 78,008 putative new sugarcane transcripts that were absent in the largest sugarcane expressed sequence tag database (SUCEST). Functional annotation showed a high frequency of protein kinases and stress-related proteins. We also detected natural antisense transcript expression, which mapped to 94% of all plant KEGG pathways; however, each genotype showed different pathways enriched in antisense transcripts. Our data appeared to cover 53.2% (17,563 genes) and 46.8% (937 transcription factors) of all sugarcane full-length genes and transcription factors, respectively. This work represents a significant advancement in defining the sugarcane ORFeome and will be useful for protein characterization, single nucleotide polymorphism and splicing variant identification, evolutionary and comparative studies, and sugarcane genome assembly and annotation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Dr. SSF was recipient of a CNPq Fellowship, MYNJ is recipient of a CAPES Fellowship.

Sucrose from sugarcane has been used for human consumption for centuries and has recently been used for bioethanol production. Biomass from sugarcane can also be used for bioenergy production; the bagasse can be burned to generate electricity <xref rid="pone.0107351-Amorim1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and can be hydrolyzed to yield simple sugars from the complex plant cell wall, which can be fermented to produce bioethanol <xref rid="pone.0107351-Sticklen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. These features place sugarcane among the best feedstock options for future bioenergy production.</p><p>Early breeding programs used two main species for sugarcane improvement: <italic>Saccharum officinarum</italic> (2n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;80, basic chromosome number x&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10) and <italic>Saccharum spontaneum</italic> (2n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;36&#x02013;128, basic chromosome number x&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8) <xref rid="pone.0107351-Irvine1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The domesticated species, <italic>Saccharum officinarum</italic>, has thick and juicy culms with high sucrose content, whereas the wild species, <italic>Saccharum spontaneum</italic>, has thin, fibrous, low-sucrose culms and higher stress tolerance <xref rid="pone.0107351-Paterson1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. As a result of interspecies hybridization and breeding strategies, sugarcane cultivars are now highly polyploid and aneuploid, with 10&#x02013;12 sets of chromosomes and a monoploid genome size of 760&#x02013;930 Mb. Among the 100&#x02013;130 chromosomes present in modern varieties <xref rid="pone.0107351-Ming1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, 70%&#x02013;80% are derived from <italic>Saccharum officinarum</italic>, 10%&#x02013;20% are derived from <italic>Saccharum spontaneum</italic>, and 10% are recombinants of these two species <xref rid="pone.0107351-DHont1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0107351-DHont3" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Recently, breeding efforts are aiming to increase energy content (GJ/ha) using <italic>Saccharum spontaneum</italic> genotypes to produce an Energycane, a higher yield cane, with increased fiber content and higher tolerance to drought.</p><p>The sugarcane complex genome represents a great challenge for molecular studies.

For example, compared with sorghum, maize, and rice, sugarcane does not have a draft genome sequence available or a well-annotated transcriptome. A multinational effort to produce a reference sugarcane genome (sugarcanegenome.org) is in progress, but many obstacles must be overcome, particularly because a high number of closely related homologs, paralogs, and alleles collapse into single contigs during the assembly.</p><p>To date, functional genomics and transcriptomics studies in sugarcane have relied primarily on expressed sequence tag (EST) and microarray datasets <xref rid="pone.0107351-deSiqueiraFerreira1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Despite their limitations, these studies produced important information on sugarcane gene functions <xref rid="pone.0107351-deSiqueiraFerreira1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0107351-Menossi1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

Thus, to obtain insights into the functions of putative trait-related genes and unknown proteins, we must first obtain full-length transcripts.</p><p>In this paper, we present the development of a protocol to produce full-length cDNA libraries for cloning and next generation sequencing (NGS), using a commercial hybrid (SP803280) and two ancestor genotypes (<italic>Saccharum officinarum</italic> and <italic>Saccharum spontaneum</italic>). We also present high-throughput sequencing data from the set of open reading frames (ORFs) in the sugarcane genome (i.e., the sugarcane ORFeome). Defining this full-length cDNA dataset will be critical for large-scale protein characterization and genome assembly and annotation, facilitating sugarcane improvement. The use of the two ancestor genotypes will help define genes and regulatory networks that may underlie the distinct phenotypes that can be useful for improving sugarcane yield and for designing new varieties for bioethanol generation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Plant materials</title><p>Leaves, immature and intermediate internodes samples from field-grown SP803280 plants were sampled after plants were cultivated for 9 months.

The pathway activity comparisons represented the likelihood that a metabolic pathway was active and the degree of activation. To calculate the relative pathway activity (PA), the pathway(s) associated with each antisense expression profile was retrieved. Then, we summed the gene intensities for each pathway to obtain the total pathway score and normalized it dividing by the proportion of detected antisense transcripts for its respective pathway. The score for PA was calculated as:<disp-formula id="pone.0107351.e001"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0107351.e001.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>where: <italic>g<sub>j</sub></italic> is the intensity of gene <italic>j</italic> identified from pathway P, <italic>N</italic> is the total number of genes detected in pathway P, and <italic>M</italic> is the total number of genes part of pathway P.</p><p>Then, the scores were log2-transformed and centered by the median value.

However, the experiments carried out in this previous analysis <xref rid="pone.0107351-CardosoSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> did not focus on full-length enrichment as described here. Instead, they aimed to identify molecular markers in the transcriptome that could be correlated to different phenotypes among the six varieties sampled, particularly resistance to rust and sucrose accumulation. Besides the GAIIx Illumina platform gives shorter reads than PGM and 454, it fits better to the expression profile analysis and the study of molecular markers, such as SSRs and SNPs. The authors produced over 445 million reads in six runs, which yielded almost five times more sequence (32 Gb) than reported here (6.6 Gb, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0107351-t002">Table 2</xref>). They reported 119,768 assembled contigs (72,269 unigenes) with an average length of 921 bp, N50 1,367 bp, and 18,624 unigenes with 1 kb or more in length. The results regarding average length and N50 are higher than those of our results (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0107351-t002">Table 2</xref>). However, the work by Cardoso-Silva and colleagues excluded all contigs shorter than 300 bp, which certainly helped to increase these two values. If we assumed the same criteria used by Cardoso-Silva (contig minimum length &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;300 bp and excluding isoforms), the N50 increased from 963 bp (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0107351-t002">Table 2</xref>) to 1,071 (data not shown). These results suggest that sequencing depth may be more important than read length to produce assemblies with longer transcripts on average, since better results of average length and N50 were achieved by shorter reads from the GAIIx platform <xref rid="pone.0107351-CardosoSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> than from similar technologies and longer reads from the 454 platform (this present study).

Despite the higher error rate of the Iso-seq method compared to other technologies, these very long reads and their circular consensus reads could be used as a scaffold for <italic>de novo</italic> assembling, and the error could be corrected by short reads from other platforms <xref rid="pone.0107351-Koren1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Comparisons with other species and among genotypes revealed a high number of sugarcane-specific transcripts, but a low number of genotype-specific transcripts</title><p>Sugarcane contigs were mapped against the predicted genes of six grasses plus the main sugarcane EST database, SUCEST <xref rid="pone.0107351-Vettore1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107351-Vettore2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sucest-fun.org">http://sucest-fun.org</ext-link>).

Since sugarcane does not have a draft genome with predicted gene models, antisense identification was performed here by mapping the reads against gene models of other grasses using only Ion PGM reads as it is the only protocol used that maintained strand orientation. We detected NATs in all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107351-g006">Figure 6</xref>); their expression was higher in leaf samples, which was particularly evident when the analysis was carried out in <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic>, <italic>Setaria italica</italic>, <italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic>, and SUCEST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107351-g006">Figure 6</xref>).

Analysis I (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0107351-t005">Table 5</xref>) considered a contig as full-length if a single contig covered more than 95% of a grass CDS with an identity of &#x02265;80%, yielding 9,960 (9,410 unique) sugarcane full-length contigs. After manual analysis of alignment results, we observed that several full-length grass genes were covered by two or more contigs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107351.s002">Figure S2</xref>). These contigs represent a single transcript that was not assembled together, probably due to the high stringency of the assembler, problems in <italic>de novo</italic> assembly, or lack of sequencing depth. Therefore, we carried out a second analysis (Analysis II, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0107351-t005">Table 5</xref>) using the same criteria of coverage and identity cited above, but considering the non-overlapping coverage of different contigs in a given gene. This analysis did not take into account the contigs identified in Analysis I and resulted in 26,384 contigs representing 4,027 genes (3,952 unique genes), with an average of 6.55 contigs per full-length gene. Finally, using the remaining contigs, Analysis III searched for contigs with a complete predicted ORF (start and stop codons) and took into account the average CDS length of full-length grass genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107351.s004">Table S2</xref>), comparing it with the length of the predicted ORF of the sugarcane contig. If the CDS size was bigger than the average CDS length, the contig was considered full-length; 4,243 contigs fit these criteria. As a result of these three analyses, we identified 40,587 contigs representing 17,563 unique, full-length genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0107351-t005">Table 5</xref>). Assuming 33,000 as the approximate total number of genes in sugarcane <xref rid="pone.0107351-Yilmaz1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, we identified 53.2% of all sugarcane full-length sequences. This number of unique full-length transcripts is much higher than reported for other plant full-length libraries, such as poplar (3,990) <xref rid="pone.0107351-Ralph1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, tomato (11,502) <xref rid="pone.0107351-Aoki1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, and <italic>Brachypodium</italic> (10,513) <xref rid="pone.0107351-Mochida1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, even though the estimated number of total genes in the genome is similar among these plants (34,000 for tomato, 31,000 for <italic>Brachypodium</italic>, and 33,000 for sugarcane).

For Analysis III, we calculated the average CDS size based on six grasses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107351.s004">Table S2</xref>), and all contigs with a predicted protein larger than this average CDS size were considered to be full-length.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The length of both sugarcane ORFs and transcripts follows the length distribution of other grasses full-length genes, especially when considered lengths over 1,500 nt for ORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107351-g009">Figure 9A</xref>) and 2,000 nt for transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107351-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). Almost 40% of sugarcane ORFs presents length ranging from 1,000 to 1,500 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107351-g009">Figure 9A</xref>), whereas close to 60% of sugarcane full-length transcripts has 1,000&#x02013;2,000 nt in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107351-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). Besides our analysis for full-length identification primarily considered only CDS coverage as mentioned above, we can see that sugarcane full-length transcripts possess 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107351-g009">Figure 9C</xref>), which reinforces that our transcripts are indeed full-length sequences or, at least, comprises the entire CDS plus part of the UTRs.</p><fig id="pone-0107351-g009" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0107351.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Length distribution of sugarcane ORFs, full-length transcripts (FL), and UTRs.</title><p>Graphs denote the comparison of sugarcane length distribution (gray bars) of ORFs (A) and full-length transcripts (B) to other grasses (colored lines).

Therefore, we further analyzed our dataset to identify, using the full-length analysis I and III, &#x0201c;full-length&#x0201d; NATs in sugarcane. However, only 46 (0.16% of contigs showing NATs) full-length sugarcane transcripts were fully overlapped by their antisense counterpart (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107351.s008">Table S6</xref>). This difference in the number of NATs (28,844) and full-length NATs (46) should be interpreted carefully, since our methodology enriched for polyadenylated RNAs and there is evidence that NATs tend to be non-polyadenylated, at least in mammals <xref rid="pone.0107351-Kiyosawa1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107351-Conley1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref> and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>
