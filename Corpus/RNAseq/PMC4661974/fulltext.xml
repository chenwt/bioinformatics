Due to unpredictable and variable harvests of wild cod, several countries including Canada, Norway, Iceland, the UK, Ireland, and the Faroe Islands (Denmark) invested in the development of Atlantic cod aquaculture to meet consumer demand for this species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Larval diet/nutrition, growth, and survival are key issues for both wild and cultured Atlantic cod populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The main food for wild marine fish larvae is zooplankton (e.g. copepods), whereas intensively cultured marine fish larvae are often fed rotifers followed by <italic>Artemia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Survival of wild cod larvae, and recruitment, are influenced by the quantity and quality of zooplankton among other factors, such as temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In culture, larval Atlantic cod exclusively fed wild zooplankton (primarily copepod nauplii) for even a brief period (2&#x000a0;weeks) have been shown to grow faster and with fewer deformities than larval cod fed only enriched rotifers, and the growth benefits associated with feeding zooplankton to cod larvae extend into the juvenile stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It is thought that differences in the nutritional composition of zooplankton and rotifers may underlie the enhanced growth performance of zooplankton-fed cod larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. For example, zooplankton often have higher levels of the &#x003c9;3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), as well as several trace elements (e.g. selenium, iodine, copper, and zinc), than rotifers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, zooplankton-fed cod larvae are reported to have higher levels of EPA, DHA, iodine, manganese, and selenium than cod larvae fed rotifers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. While nutritional quality likely plays a key role, the precise mechanisms by which consumption of zooplankton accelerates larval cod growth are not completely understood.</p><p>We used a functional genomics approach to identify genes and molecular pathways in larval cod that respond to feeding with small amounts of wild zooplankton (i.e. 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;% of live prey items). The feeding regime providing samples for this microarray-based research, as well as the impact of dietary zooplankton on larval and juvenile cod growth, are reported in Katan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. At approximately 30&#x000a0;days post-hatch (30 dph), the lengths and weights of cod larvae fed rotifers supplemented with wild zooplankton (RA-Zoo) from 2 dph began to separate from those fed either rotifers alone (RA) or rotifers enriched with protein hydrolysate (RA-PH); i.e. this was the first developmental stage where the RA-Zoo larvae were significantly longer and heavier. Thus, we selected RA-Zoo, RA and RA-PH larval samples at 9&#x02013;10&#x000a0;mm length (26&#x02013;30 dph, henceforth referred to as the 9&#x000a0;mm stage; see <xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref> for sampling details), with the goal of identifying zooplankton-responsive genes associated with the onset of the accelerated growth phase in the RA-Zoo group as compared with both other groups. The RA and RA-PH groups had virtually identical lengths and weights at this life-history stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and thus, these groups were used in the current study as &#x0201c;non-zooplankton&#x0201d; groups for the purpose of identifying a robust suite of zooplankton-responsive genes. Information on the impact of incorporating zooplankton and PH into larval diets on cod growth and survival, as well as expression of well-known growth and appetite related genes (e.g. <italic>IGF</italic>, <italic>myostatin</italic>, <italic>GH</italic>, and <italic>GHR</italic>, and <italic>NPY</italic> and <italic>CART</italic>, respectively) can be found in Katan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These genes were not differentially expressed in RA-Zoo larvae as compared to both other groups at 9&#x000a0;mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], suggesting that other factors are involved in the initial acceleration in growth rate experienced by zooplankton-fed cod larvae.</p><p>We initially conducted whole-body transcript expression profiling with the 20,000 probe (20K) Atlantic cod oligonucleotide microarray platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and then validated selected microarray-identified genes using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR). Over 19,000 of the 20K microarray&#x02019;s 50-mer oligonucleotide probes were designed based on unique candidate sequences arising from the assembly of over 150,000 ESTs from 42 cDNA libraries [23 normalized, 19 suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH)] representing various tissues, treatments, and life stages (including over 20,000 ESTs from a normalized larval cDNA library) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The EST assembly process (including steps taken to reduce redundancy), and the rationale for sequence selection and probe design for the 20K microarray platform, were previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Since it has been estimated that the Atlantic cod genome contains over 22,000 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], the 20K microarray is necessarily missing some cod genes; however, this microarray platform has been effectively used for a variety of global transcript expression profiling applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and is a suitable resource for the current larval transcriptome study.

Similarities and discrepancies between the results of our study and the RNAseq study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] will be discussed in light of the different rotifer enrichment methods that were employed (e.g. selenium enrichment in the RNAseq study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] versus no selenium enrichment in the current study).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Larval dry mass</title><p>At the 9&#x000a0;mm stage sampling time (26&#x02013;30 dph), the RA-Zoo larvae were significantly heavier than RA larvae, while RA-PH larval dry mass was not significantly different from either of the other two treatments (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Note that there were some genes in common between the oxidation-reduction and selenium homeostasis clustering studies (e.g. <italic>glutathione peroxidase 3</italic>, <italic>selenoprotein U</italic>, <italic>selenoprotein T2</italic>) (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In the hierarchical clustering analysis involving mitosis-relevant genes (e.g. <italic>cyclin B1</italic>, <italic>cyclin A2</italic>, <italic>aurora kinase B</italic>, <italic>inner centromere protein</italic>), three RA larvae grouped with the RA-Zoo in a branch separate from the remaining RA and RA-PH larvae (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Thus, compared with oxidation-reduction and selenium homeostasis, the influence of the zooplankton diet on mitosis appears to be less consistent.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Hierarchical clustering analysis for a subset of RA-Zoo responsive genes involved in oxidation-reduction.

Similar to our study, the RNAseq-based study found that there was no significant difference in the growth of cod larvae fed zooplankton versus rotifers up to 22 dph, with zooplankton-fed larvae experiencing significantly accelerated growth between 22 and 36 dph [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The RNAseq-based study evaluated larval growth, nutrient levels, and gene expression at 5 larval stages, with stage 3 (29&#x02013;31 dph, 8.5&#x02013;10.1&#x000a0;mm length) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] approximately corresponding to the 9&#x000a0;mm stage in our microarray and QPCR studies. Some of the stage 3 gene expression results from Penglase et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] are similar to our microarray results; for example, <italic>thioredoxin interacting protein a</italic> (<italic>txnipa</italic>), <italic>catalase</italic>, and <italic>glutathione-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit</italic> were down-regulated (significantly for all 3 genes in our study and for <italic>txnipa</italic> in the RNAseq study) in zooplankton-fed&#x02009;~&#x02009;9&#x000a0;mm larvae in both studies (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]). Also, both studies found that the larval redox system and growth rate were strongly influenced by feeding with copepods (even though our study included only 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;% zooplankton). However, other results from Penglase et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] do not agree with our results. In our study, <italic>glutathione peroxidase 1b</italic> (<italic>gpx1b</italic>) and <italic>selenoprotein Pa</italic> (<italic>sepp1a</italic>) were significantly up-regulated in 9&#x000a0;mm RA-Zoo larvae (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a,b</xref>), whereas Penglase et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] found that <italic>gpx1a</italic> and <italic>sepp1a</italic> were down-regulated (not significantly) in zooplankton-fed&#x02009;~&#x02009;9&#x000a0;mm cod larvae. Since glutathione peroxidases and selenoprotein P are selenium-dependent (see subsequent section), differences in their transcript expression may have been influenced by differences in rotifer enrichment methods utilized in the RNAseq-based study versus our study. In the RNAseq study, rotifer enrichment included Sel-Plex (Alltech, Denmark), a selenium-supplemented yeast, whereas in our study, rotifer enrichment included only Ori-Culture and Ori-Green (Skretting) without a selenium supplement. Therefore, the 9&#x000a0;mm RA and RA-PH larvae in our study may have been deficient in selenium, while the comparably staged rotifer-fed larvae in the RNAseq study were selenium replete due to the rotifer enrichment methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Even with adequate levels of selenium, however, the rotifer-fed cod larvae in the RNAseq study still grew more slowly than the zooplankton-fed larvae, leading Karlsen and colleagues to hypothesize that protein and taurine (which were present at lower levels in rotifers compared with copepods in that study) may be involved in copepod-associated enhanced growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>In our study, the expression results for <italic>slc6a6</italic> support the notion that taurine plays a role in the enhanced growth of zooplankton-fed cod larvae at the 9&#x000a0;mm stage. This taurine transporter-encoding transcript was shown by microarray and QPCR to be significantly down-regulated in RA-Zoo larvae compared with both other groups at 9&#x000a0;mm (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8k</xref>). In Atlantic salmon (<italic>Salmo salar</italic>), <italic>slc6a6</italic> was shown by microarray to be significantly up-regulated in distal intestine during the early response (day 3) to a soybean meal containing diet, and therefore, potentially associated with the development of soybean meal induced enteritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Therefore, the higher expression of <italic>slc6a6</italic> in both non-zooplankton groups (i.e. RA and RA-PH) suggests that the groups fed only rotifers may have had an inflammatory reaction. In Japanese eel (<italic>Anguilla japonica</italic>) testis during hCG-induced spermatogenesis, higher Slc6a6 transcript and protein expression levels are associated with lower taurine levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This inverse relationship between <italic>slc6a6</italic> expression and taurine agrees with our study. Rotifers have lower levels of taurine than <italic>Artemia</italic> or zooplankton (reviewed by Hamre et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]), and <italic>slc6a6</italic> expression was higher in cod larvae fed rotifers (9&#x000a0;mm, likely taurine deficient) but not in older cod larvae fed <italic>Artemia</italic> (13&#x000a0;mm, likely taurine replete) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8k</xref>). Interestingly, trypsin promotes the uptake of taurine into eel germ cells by transactivating Slc6a6, and <italic>trypsinogen H1-3a1</italic> was shown in our study to be induced in zooplankton-fed cod larvae. The potential roles of taurine, taurine transporter (Slc6a6), and trypsin in copepod-associated enhanced growth of cod larvae warrant further investigation.</p><p>Since the zooplankton-associated enhanced growth phenotype is first apparent when cod larvae are approximately 9&#x02013;10&#x000a0;mm long [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], we propose that transcriptome changes in zooplankton-fed larvae as compared with other larvae at ~9&#x000a0;mm provide significant insight into the mechanisms involved in the initiation of accelerated growth. In addition to oxidation-reduction, selenium-binding, and mitosis, the microarray experiment identified other key growth-relevant genes (e.g. involved in thyroid hormone production) as zooplankton-responsive. The remainder of the discussion will focus on how these genes and pathways, and their potential interactions, may be involved in enhanced growth.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Influence of zooplankton diet on oxidation-reduction processes and selenium homeostasis</title><p>Wild zooplankton (e.g. copepods) are high in LC-PUFA such as DHA and EPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Likewise, cultured marine fish larvae fed wild zooplankton have higher levels of LC-PUFA than larvae without zooplankton in the diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and wild cod larvae also have high levels of DHA and EPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. High levels of LC-PUFA in marine fish larvae, along with other factors (e.g. increased metabolic rate and oxygen demand), make this life stage particularly vulnerable to molecular and cellular damage caused by oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The antioxidant system, including enzymes such as catalase and glutathione peroxidase, is key to protecting larval fish from reactive oxygen species generated by cellular metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The current microarray experiment showed that genes encoding several important antioxidant enzymes and other proteins involved in redox homeostasis were responsive to the feeding of zooplankton at the 9&#x000a0;mm sampling time point. This agrees at the pathway level with the RNAseq results of Penglase et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], who showed that 46 redox-relevant genes were differentially expressed in cod larvae that were fed zooplankton versus rotifers. QPCR confirmed our microarray results, and revealed that the influence of dietary zooplankton on the transcription of genes related to the antioxidant system in larval cod was less apparent in 11&#x02013;13&#x000a0;mm larvae. All of the genes in the QPCR study that were annotated with the GO term &#x0201c;oxidation-reduction process&#x0201d; and/or &#x0201c;cell redox homeostasis&#x0201d; (i.e. <italic>glutathione peroxidase</italic>, <italic>dehydrogenase/reductase SDR family member 1</italic>, <italic>cytochrome P450 CYP2Y3, peroxiredoxin-1</italic>, <italic>ferritin middle subunit</italic>, and <italic>coagulation factor V</italic>) were differentially (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) expressed between zooplankton-fed larvae and both of the other two larval groups at 9&#x000a0;mm, while none of these genes were differentially expressed between RA-Zoo larvae and both RA and RA-PH larvae in the size- or age-matched comparisons (i.e. at 11&#x02013;13&#x000a0;mm). As previously stated, this may be due to dietary differences between the 11&#x02013;13&#x000a0;mm larvae (fed <italic>Artemia</italic> with or without zooplankton) and the 9&#x000a0;mm larvae (fed rotifers with or without zooplankton); the rotifers used in our study were potentially deficient in some nutrients (e.g. selenium, copper, taurine) that are known to be at higher levels in <italic>Artemia</italic> and zooplankton compared with rotifers (reviewed by Hamre et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]).</p><p>In Asian seabass (<italic>Lates calcarifer</italic>) selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity and lipid peroxidation increase through larval development, with glutathione peroxidase likely serving to detoxify lipid peroxides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Sea bass larvae fed high-DHA diets have elevated glutathione peroxidase transcript expression levels compared with larvae fed a lower DHA diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Our finding that <italic>gpx1b</italic> was significantly up-regulated (i.e. by over two-fold) in the zooplankton-fed cod larvae compared with the non-zooplankton groups at 9&#x000a0;mm, but not responsive to dietary zooplankton in 11&#x02013;13&#x000a0;mm larvae, suggests that the 9&#x000a0;mm cod larvae in this study may have been more sensitive than the 11&#x02013;13&#x000a0;mm larvae to oxidative stress potentially caused by the high-lipid (including LC-PUFA) zooplankton diet. Our microarray results also showed that some redox-relevant genes (e.g. <italic>gpx1b</italic>, <italic>gpx3</italic>) were up-regulated while others (e.g. <italic>peroxiredoxin-1</italic>, <italic>catalase</italic>) were down-regulated in zooplankton-fed cod larvae. Interestingly, similar results were seen in larval Senegal sole (<italic>Solea senegalensis</italic>) fed live <italic>Artemia</italic> nauplii as compared with larvae on inert feeds, where those fed live prey experienced enhanced growth, higher total glutathione peroxidase activity and lipid peroxidation, and lower catalase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The ontogeny of <italic>gpx1</italic>, <italic>gpx3</italic>, and <italic>catalase</italic> transcript expression was previously studied by QPCR with templates from cod larvae fed only rotifers and formulated diet (i.e. without zooplankton) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. During late larval stages (20&#x02013;62 dph with a similar temperature regime, and therefore representing a similar period of larval development, as the current study), Hamre et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] found that <italic>catalase</italic> transcript expression was stable whereas <italic>gpx1</italic> and <italic>gpx3</italic> transcripts showed increased expression in successive larval stages. These three transcripts encode enzymes that reduce metabolically generated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and therefore play key roles in the control of this reactive oxygen species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which serves as a second messenger in insulin signaling and in the signaling cascades mediated by several growth factors (e.g. EGF, FGF), also plays a significant role in diverse biological processes including proliferation, inflammation, and aging (reviewed by Sies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]). Collectively, our results suggest that the maintenance of homeostatic oxidative status in 9&#x000a0;mm cod larvae on a high-lipid zooplankton containing diet is complex, involving numerous redox-relevant genes. The RNAseq results of Penglase et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] also show that redox homeostasis is zooplankton-responsive, with some gene expression differences between that study and ours likely due to aforementioned differences in rotifer enrichment methods. Whether or not alterations in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> signaling play a role in the enhanced growth phenotype of zooplankton-fed cod larvae is currently unknown.</p><p>In our microarray study, several genes encoding selenium-dependent antioxidant enzymes (e.g. glutathione peroxidase 1b, glutathione peroxidase 3, thioredoxin reductase 3a, iodothyronine deiodinase type I) and other selenoproteins (e.g. selenoproteins H, L, Ja, and Pa) were up-regulated in zooplankton-fed cod larvae compared with the other larval groups at the 9&#x000a0;mm stage. This suggests that selenium homeostasis was altered in these zooplankton fed larvae. Selenium is an essential micronutrient that is present in copepods at much higher levels than in rotifers (3&#x02013;5 compared with 0.08&#x02013;0.09&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> dry weight, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Cod larvae fed copepods, likewise, have higher selenium levels than those fed rotifers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Since selenium levels in rotifers are well below the required level for cold-water fish (0.25&#x02013;0.30&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> dry weight) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], it has been suggested that selenium may be the trace mineral most likely to be deficient in this live feed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and this has led to studies on the effect of selenium-enriched rotifers on larval cod performance. For example, although they only assessed larval performance metrics until 26&#x02013;29 dph, (i.e. prior to the period of enhanced growth) larval cod fed rotifers enriched with selenium and iodine (to levels found in copepods) had improved survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and Penglase et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] used QPCR to show that transcripts encoding glutathione peroxidases 1 and 3 were significantly up-regulated in selenium-supplemented cod larvae at 29 dph. In light of these results, the up-regulation of <italic>gpx1b</italic> and <italic>gpx3</italic> transcripts in zooplankton-fed larvae in our study suggests that these cod genes may have responded to the high selenium levels known to be present in zooplankton. As mentioned previously, the lack of a difference in <italic>gpx1a</italic> and <italic>gpx3</italic> expression in ~9&#x000a0;mm larval cod fed rotifers versus copepods in Penglase et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] is likely due to their use of selenium supplemented rotifer enrichment.</p><p>Research involving selenium supplementation of larval diets has been conducted with marine fish species in addition to Atlantic cod. For example, Red sea bream (<italic>Pagrus major</italic>) larvae fed selenium-enriched rotifers had higher whole body selenium levels and accelerated growth and development compared with larvae fed a control diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As well, Betancor et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] used high DHA and vitamin E diets with and without selenium to show that selenium improved larval sea bass growth and prevented lipid oxidation. These data, and previous results from Ribeiro et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], led this group to speculate that selenium supplementation may be more important in earlier life stage larval sole. Both deficient and excess levels of selenium can be detrimental to fish, with selenium deficiency potentially causing reduced growth and glutathione peroxidase activity in plasma and liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], and excess selenium causing toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Therefore, an appropriate level of dietary selenium (i.e. meeting the requirement without reaching toxicity) is likely needed for optimal larval cod performance. Benner et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] showed that selenium supplementation in diets for zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) influenced behaviour and increased the brain transcript expression of several selenoprotein-encoding genes including <italic>sepp1a</italic>. In mammals, selenium supply influences the transcript expression of genes encoding some selenoproteins such as glutathione peroxidase 1 and selenoprotein W (reviewed by Hesketh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]), although selenium status does not appear to influence <italic>selenoprotein P</italic> transcript expression in rat liver (reviewed by Burk and Hill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]). Still, the known regulation of some selenoprotein-encoding genes by selenium supply supports our hypothesis that dietary selenium was at least partially responsible for the observed up-regulation of selenoprotein-encoding genes in zooplankton-fed cod larvae. In the current study, <italic>selenoprotein Pa</italic> (<italic>sepp1a</italic>) transcript was shown by microarray and QPCR to be over 3-fold up-regulated in zooplankton-fed cod larvae as compared with both other groups. In addition to functioning as an antioxidant and a selenium transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], mammalian selenoprotein P also plays roles in spermatogenesis, immunity, and neurological function (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], whereas suppressed <italic>selenoprotein P</italic> transcript expression is seen in human lung cancer and other malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Consistent with these mammalian data, transcript expression studies in fish suggest that <italic>sepp1a</italic> plays several important roles. For example, Atlantic salmon <italic>sepp1a</italic> transcript was shown by microarray and QPCR to be down-regulated in <italic>Piscirickettsia salmonis</italic> infected head kidney and cultured macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], suggesting an immune-related function. Xu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] used QPCR to show that <italic>sepp1a</italic> transcripts were up-regulated in the liver of fast-growing triploid growth hormone transgenic Atlantic salmon. Penglase et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], who as previously noted fed cod larvae with zooplankton versus selenium (and other nutrient) supplemented rotifers, reported that the transcript expression of <italic>sepp1a</italic> was higher in zooplankton-fed larvae at&#x02009;~&#x02009;5&#x000a0;mm stage, but not in 7&#x02013;25&#x000a0;mm larvae (i.e. during the accelerated growth phase). Our results and those of Penglase et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] collectively suggest that, while <italic>sepp1a</italic> may be a useful biomarker of selenium deficiency, it does not appear to be necessary for zooplankton-associated accelerated growth of larval cod.</p><p>Research in mammals suggests that the acute phase response (APR), defined as &#x0201c;a complex systemic early-defense system activated by trauma, infection, stress, neoplasia, and inflammation&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], inhibits selenoprotein P production (reviewed by Burk and Hill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]). Interestingly, transcripts encoding positive acute phase proteins (i.e. up-regulated in the APR: e.g. ferritin, ceruloplasmin, and hepcidin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta (associated with GO term &#x0201c;acute-phase response&#x0201d;) were identified by microarray in the current study as being significantly up-regulated in both RA and RA-PH larvae compared with RA-Zoo larvae at the 9&#x000a0;mm stage (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). Therefore, the suppressed <italic>selenoprotein Pa</italic> transcript expression observed in 9&#x000a0;mm RA and RA-PH larvae may be due to an APR that was potentially related to nutritional insufficiency. Since selenium deficiency in humans leads to oxidative stress and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], it is possible that selenium deficiency in the RA and RA-PH diets and larvae may have contributed to oxidative stress (as evidenced by responses of several redox related genes) and inflammation/an APR (as evidenced by up-regulation of genes encoding positive acute phase proteins). However, the results of Penglase et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], i.e. differential expression of many redox-relevant genes in cod larvae fed zooplankton versus selenium-replete rotifers, reveal that factors other than selenium are involved in the redox pathway response to dietary zooplankton. The roles and interactions of nutritional status (e.g. dietary selenium, and biomarkers of selenium homeostasis including glutathione peroxidase and selenoprotein P) and APR-associated transcripts and proteins in larval cod growth warrant further investigation.</p><p>In addition to the production of selenium-replete rotifers, mineral enrichment trials have been conducted to produce rotifers with copepod levels of selenium, manganese, copper, and zinc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Zooplankton contain higher levels of all of these minerals (as well as iodine) compared with rotifers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Interestingly, 4 genes with copper-relevant functional annotations were identified in this microarray study: 3 down-regulated (<italic>coagulation factor V</italic>, with GO term &#x0201c;copper ion binding&#x0201d;; <italic>catalase</italic>, with GO term &#x0201c;response to copper ion&#x0201d;; and <italic>ceruloplasmin</italic>, with GO terms &#x0201c;copper ion binding&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;response to copper ion&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;plasma membrane copper ion transport&#x0201d;) and 1 up-regulated (<italic>thioredoxin reductase 3a</italic>, with GO term &#x0201c;cellular response to copper ion&#x0201d;) in zooplankton-fed cod larvae compared with both other larval groups. These genes may have responded to copper deficiency in the rotifer-fed 9&#x000a0;mm larvae in our study. However, since Karlsen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] used rotifer enrichment methods that resulted in significantly higher levels of copper in rotifers and rotifer-fed larvae compared with zooplankton and zooplankton-fed larvae, respectively, and growth acceleration was still observed in the zooplankton-fed cod, copper in not likely to be a limiting nutrient for growth in larvae of this species.</p><p>Studies by our group, using the same larval batches and treatments as those used in the current functional genomics study, showed that accelerated growth in zooplankton-fed cod larvae first appeared in 9&#x02013;10&#x000a0;mm (30 dph) larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This is in agreement with Karlsen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] who reported that the onset of accelerated growth in copepod-fed cod larvae was between 22 and 36 dph. Since Karlsen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] used selenium-supplemented rotifers to ensure that the rotifer-fed larvae in their study were not selenium deficient and still saw decreased growth in the absence of copepods, it was proposed that nutrients other than selenium (e.g. taurine) may be limiting for growth in cod larvae fed only rotifers. Collectively, it appears that&#x02009;~&#x02009;9&#x02013;10&#x000a0;mm in length represents a developmental window in which larval cod growth becomes responsive to nutrients present in the zooplankton supplemented diet (i.e. nutrients that were higher in zooplankton compared with the nutrient-enriched rotifers used in Karlsen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], such as protein, taurine, iodine, and zinc). Our microarray results and the RNAseq results of Karlsen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] provide snapshots of the impact of dietary zooplankton on the larval transcriptome at this pivotal developmental stage. However, the results of these studies must be considered in light of the very different rotifer enrichment methods employed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Influence of the zooplankton diet on genes involved in thyroid hormone production</title><p>Two genes involved in thyroid hormone (TH) production [<italic>iodotyrosine dehalogenase I</italic> (alias <italic>iodotyrosine deiodinase</italic>) and <italic>putative iodothyronine deiodinase type I</italic>] were up-regulated in zooplankton-fed larvae as compared with both other groups (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Thyroid hormones, which require iodine for their biosynthesis, play key roles in controlling metamorphosis in larval fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], as well as development and metabolism in adult vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Iodothyronine deiodinases are selenoproteins (i.e. using selenium in the form of selenocysteine in the active site) that catalyze the deiodination of the prohormone thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) to the active hormone triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].

It should be noted that the current study involved the feeding of relatively small amounts of zooplankton (5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;% of live prey items), which would limit the larval intake of iodine.

<sup>a</sup>Amplification efficiencies were calculated using a 5-point 1:3 dilution series starting with cDNA representing 10&#x000a0;ng of input RNA. See <xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref> for additional details</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>To select the normalizer gene for this study, QPCR primers pairs were designed for five candidate normalizers [<italic>60S ribosomal protein L34</italic>; <italic>ATPase, H+ transporting, lysosomal, V1 subunit H</italic>; <italic>proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase, 12</italic>; <italic>RNA polymerase II elongation factor ELL2</italic>; <italic>transcription elongation factor A (SII)</italic>] that exhibited a stable expression profile in the microarray studies. The primer pairs were quality tested as described above. Furthermore, the fluorescence threshold cycle (C<sub>T</sub>) values of 24 samples representing the 8 different experimental groups [3 from the each of the RA and RA-PH (9, 11 and 13&#x000a0;mm) groups and RA-Zoo (9 and 13&#x000a0;mm) groups] were measured using cDNA representing 5&#x000a0;ng of input total RNA, and then analyzed using geNorm. <italic>RNA polymerase II elongation factor ELL2</italic> was chosen as the normalizer gene for this QPCR study as it had the best combination of amplification efficiency (92&#x000a0;%) and stability (geNorm M&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.289).</p><p>Transcript levels were measured in 8 larvae (2 larvae from each of 4 replicate tanks) for each of the 8 groups. In all cases, cDNA representing 5&#x000a0;ng of input RNA was used as template in the PCR reactions. On each plate, for every sample, the target gene and endogenous control were tested in triplicate, and a plate linker sample (i.e. a sample that was run on all plates in a given study) and a no-template control were included. The C<sub>T</sub> values were determined using the 7500 Software Relative Quantification Study Application (Version 2.0) (Applied Biosystems/Life Technologies). The relative quantity (RQ) of each transcript was determined using the Pfaffl method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], with amplification efficiencies (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) incorporated. For each TOI, the sample with the lowest normalized expression (mRNA) level was set as the calibrator sample (i.e. assigned an RQ value&#x02009;=&#x02009;1); transcript expression data are presented as RQ normalized to <italic>RNA polymerase II elongation factor ELL2</italic>.</p><p>The QPCR (RQ) data were analysed using identical statistical procedures as described for the dry mass data, except that Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance on ranks was followed by a Tukey&#x02019;s pairwise multiple comparison. <italic>P</italic> values&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 were considered to be significant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Availability of supporting data</title><p>The full microarray dataset has been submitted to NCBI&#x02019;s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with the series accession number GSE68792.
