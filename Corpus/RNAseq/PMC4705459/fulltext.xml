Here, we show that a short-term treatment of <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> mice with GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) completely and durably rescues their memory performance. In the CA1 region of the hippocampus, improvement of memory is associated with increased in long-term potentiation (LTP) and an augmentation of density of dendritic spines (DDS) onto the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells reflecting an increase in the local excitatory drive. Unbiased gene profiling analysis of hippocampi of treated <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> mice were performed two weeks and three months post treatment and identified co-expression modules that include differentially expressed genes related with and predicting higher memory, LTP and DDS in the hippocampi of PTZ-treated animals. We observed that PTZ treatment changed similar sets of genes in both <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> mice, which are known to be involved in memory consolidation and neurotransmission dynamics and could participate in the persistent effects of PTZ on memory recovery.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Thyroid hormone (TH) plays a central role in nervous system development, maturation and function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Even modest hypothyroidism during gestation induces alterations in the nervous system, which are associated with cognitive deficits, including decreases in memory performances, in infancy and adult life. The physiological effects of TH are mediated by the activation of the distinct nuclear thyroid hormone receptors &#x003b1; (THRA) and THRB that act as ligand-inducible transcription factors, differing in tissue distribution with the brain expressing predominantly THRA1 (80%, encoded by <italic>THRA1</italic> gene). Studies using knock out strategies for the distinct THRs reveal that unliganded receptor activity is probably the important factor causing the harmful effects of hypothyroidism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The unliganded receptor activity is mainly due to either deficiency in TH or to a mutation on the THR ligand binding site creating a dominant negative receptor. This mutation leads to resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) syndrome. While RTH due to <italic>THRB</italic> mutation has been known for decades, it is only recently that patients have been found harbouring <italic>THRA1</italic> mutations, which cause a dominant negative effect of the receptor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. However, even though RTH due to <italic>THRA1</italic> is expected to have at least similar prevalence than RTH due to <italic>THRB</italic> mutation (~1 in 40,000)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, the lack of specific diagnostic test makes it difficult today to clearly assess the actual number. Patients with a <italic>THRA1</italic> mutation present cognitive dysfunction in childhood and adult life<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, similar to other syndromes with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). While treatment with high doses of TH might seem an adequate therapy to rescue the metabolic disorders of patients with <italic>THRA1</italic> mutation-induced RTH syndrome, it might not be effective or sufficient to rescue cognitive function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p><p>To study potential alternative therapeutic approaches for the cognitive deficiency due to <italic>THRA1</italic> mutation, we used a mouse line with a <italic>Thra1</italic> mutation resulting in a 10-fold lower affinity to TH<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. The heterozygous mice (<italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup>) present a &#x0201c;receptor-mediated hypothyroidism&#x0201d; in the tissues in which mutant Thra1 is expressed by inhibiting wild-type receptor action in a dominant negative manner. Importantly, the <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> mice present all features observed in humans with <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-mediated RTH syndrome (growth retardation, impairment of motor coordination, metabolic changes, skeletal abnormalities and cognitive dysfunction while the circulating hormone level is near-normal), and therefore provide an excellent mouse model for investigating therapeutic treatments of neurological disorders observed in patients with unliganded THRA1 activity or the larger patient population with TH deficiency during development.</p><p>In the <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> mice, hippocampal network activity is altered and is associated with marked impairments in memory performances<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Moreover, previous work using the <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> mice or other hypothyroidism mouse models have shown a severe delay in the development of the GABAergic system in the neocortex and hippocampus of these mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. The hippocampus is the site of molecular and anatomical changes that contribute to cognitive functions such as learning and memory processes and anxiety behaviour which depend on the activity dynamics of the different neuronal circuits which are part of its network. Important orchestrators of the activity of neuronal networks are GABAergic interneurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Within the hippocampal circuit, GABAergic interneurons act to synchronize network activity, a process which is thought to control memory formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), released by GABAergic interneurons, act through two main types of GABA receptors: the ionotropic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (ligand-gated chloride ion channels) and the metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (G-protein coupled receptors). Both GABA receptors have been largely shown to regulate memory processes, a treatment with antagonists of either receptors increasing memory performance in mice. Specifically, treatments with GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors antagonists have shown to be very efficient in improving memory performance in several mouse models of syndromes that are characterized by intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). For instance, treatment with the non-competitive GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonists picrotoxin or pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) were shown to ameliorate memory functions in mouse models of the Rett and Down syndromes, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, suggesting that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonists may offer a possible therapeutic target for other syndromes associated with memory impairments.</p><p>Here, we show that low doses of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) can rescue completely the memory deficits observed in the <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> mice. Importantly, the benefits in learning and memory performances of a short-term treatment persist for several months. Focusing on the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus, we also observed in the PTZ-treated mutant mice an increase of synaptic strength between CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons, together with a subtle increase in spine density quantified on apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells, which are both hallmarks of memory performance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Moreover, we identified an increase in genetic pathways (such as the CREB, CAMKIIa and calcium signaling) regulated by PTZ in <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> and <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice hippocampi and that are commonly associated with memory processes. These changes were still observed in hippocampi of <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> and <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice three months after PTZ treatment. In addition, unbiased gene pathway analysis revealed predictive augmentation of memory performance and of LTP and density of dendritic spine (DDS) following PTZ treatment, confirming our <italic>in vivo</italic> observations.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonism rescues learning and memory deficits in <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic>

In line with this we assessed whether a low (non-epileptic) dose of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ, 5&#x02009;mg/kg/day, 17 days of treatment), a non-competitive GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist, could rescue memory performance in <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> mice. The dose of PTZ used in the study did not promote spontaneous seizure development. Moreover, the chronic treatment with PTZ did not changed the mice sensitivity in regard to proconvulsant dose of PTZ (40mg/kg) regardless of the genotype (data not shown). We used the novel object recognition task to measure visual recognition memory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. This test represents a model of declarative memory that depends on hippocampal function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). It takes advantage of a rodent&#x02019;s natural tendency to explore novel objects; an animal showing performant memory would recognize the familiar object and spend more time in exploring the novel object. Importantly, locomotor ability is not a critical factor for this task, and therefore does not influence performance of the animals in this test. To proceed to the acquisition phase of the test, <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> animals were trained for 5 days (15&#x02009;min/day) during which they could explore two identical objects. There was no significant difference between genotypes in the exploratory preference of the two similar objects, with a discrimination index not different from &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; for both <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/+</sup>and <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> animals (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05). For the testing session, one of the familiar objects used in the training session was replaced with a novel object. As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>, <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> animals showed a marked preference in exploring the novel object, while in contrast <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> mice showed similar preference for both the novel and the familiar objects. Indeed, the discrimination index in <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> mice was still close to &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; whereas it was about 26% in the <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> cohort (DI: control <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> 3.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.6, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6 <italic>versus</italic> control <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> 26&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.2, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.036), indicating that <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> mice do not discriminate between the familiar and the novel objects placed in the arena while <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice do. These data confirm previous results demonstrating a memory deficit in this mouse model of TH deficiency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Remarkably, our chronic PTZ treatment (5&#x02009;mg/kg/day, 17 days of treatment) reversed completely the detrimental effect of the <italic>Thra1</italic> mutation on learning and memory functions (DI: PTZ <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup>, 38.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.4, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4 <italic>versus</italic> control <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/+</sup>, 26&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.2, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.17) and improved memory performance in the <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> (DI: control <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/+</sup>, 26&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.2, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6 <italic>versus</italic> PTZ <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/+</sup>, 46.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.4, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.008).

Interestingly, comparing the <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> with <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> groups, we could also find that the treatment affected mostly the same set of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>), and in the same direction regardless of the genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Importantly, those genetic modifications were still observed 3 months after the end of the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C,F,G</xref>, the asterisk).</p><p>Next, focusing on the memory function category, we investigated the canonical pathways predicted to be involved. Notably, similar canonical pathways in <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> groups and <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> groups were found to be triggered by the PTZ treatment: G-coupled receptor signaling, c-AMP-mediated signaling and LTP signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D</xref>) as well as CREB signaling in neurons, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and Neurotrophin/Trk signaling (a detailed gene list is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Dataset</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the function of GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonism on pathways involved in the neurotransmission dynamics, we analyzed genes coding for the GABA and GLU pathways, which represent the main inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters, respectively, in the brain. We focused on synthesis enzymes, vesicular transporters and receptors. We observed that the synthesis enzymes for GABA (<italic>Gad1</italic> and <italic>Gad2</italic>) were down-regulated by the treatment while <italic>Gls</italic>, the GLU synthesizing enzyme, was up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4F,G</xref>). Similarly, the vesicular transporters for GABA (<italic>Slc32a1</italic>) and for glutamate (<italic>Slc17a6</italic>, <italic>Slc17a7</italic> and <italic>Slc1a6</italic>) were down- and upregulated, respectively. At the receptor level, after PTZ treatment, results for GABA receptors were more divided; 5 subunits of GABA receptors were downregulated while 7 others were upregulated in <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4G</xref>). For Glutamate, most AMPA and Kainate receptors (<italic>Gria1</italic>, <italic>Gria2</italic>, <italic>Gria3</italic>, <italic>Grik1</italic>, <italic>Grik4</italic>, <italic>Gin2a</italic>, <italic>Gin2b</italic> and <italic>Grm2</italic>) were up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4F</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that PTZ treatment dramatically and persistently changes gene expression patterns in the hippocampus and that all observed changes could contribute in rescuing durably the memory performance of <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Congenital or developmental hypothyroidism lead to delayed postnatal development along with reduced memory performance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Memory impairments are usually associated with alterations in the hippocampal inhibitory circuit that is under control of the GABAergic system. Here we provide evidence that a short-term treatment with low (non-epileptogenic) doses of a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist (PTZ) completely restores learning and memory performance in a mouse model of TH deficiency mediated by <italic>Thra1</italic> mutation. Strikingly, this complete rescue of memory behaviour remained normalized 3 months after treatment. Results obtained in hippocampal slices of <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> mice showed that antagonism of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors increased LTP, an excitatory response driver required for memory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> as well as excitatory spine density in the CA1 hippocampal region, which is known to correlate with increased memory performance. Moreover, full-transcriptome data from hippocampus of <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> mice treated with low dose of PTZ identified genes and canonical pathways presumably involved in the improvement of memory function affected by PTZ. Strikingly, these genes changes were also still noticed 3 months post-treatment. Thus, this study identifies short term treatment with low doses of GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonists as potential therapeutic agents for alleviating intellectual disabilities in TR&#x003b1;-mediated RTH or developmentally hypothyroid patients.</p><p>GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are ligand-gated ion channels complexes that bind the more potent inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, GABA, resulting in chloride influx and consequent reduction of neuronal excitability. The specificity of connections and actions of this inhibitory system has been suggested to directly participate in the synchronization of neuronal activity that is one of the underlying mechanisms that participate in memory formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. In this context, many studies have focused on adjusting the activity of the GABAergic system with the objective to affect memory performance. Hence, a decrease of GABA-mediated inhibition using GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonists has been associated with enhanced memory consolidation while its increase using GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonists, with impaired memory function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. In our experiments, the rescue of memory impairments observed in our hypothyroid mouse model is obtained using chronic administration of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist PTZ for a defined period of time. Such treatment has been hypothesized to decrease GABA-mediated inhibition and consequently to increase the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) ratio throughout the brain, including the hippocampus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. This ratio has been suggested to contribute to the network homeostasis that is crucial for proper brain function and for which the disruption might lead to syndromes characterized by IDD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. A decrease in the E/I ratio has been proposed indeed for many syndromes associated with a loss of memory performance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, including the DS, and for which similar treatment that the one used in our study has been demonstrated to ameliorate memory deficits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Remarkably, the positive effects of the chronic administration of PTZ on learning and memory functions in the <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> mice extend long beyond the time of treatment. Similar long lasting rescue of memory functions has been observed with PTZ in a DS mouse model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. This indicates that if a treatment with low doses of PTZ could improve memory performance via a reestablishment of the network homeostasis through a decrease of the inhibitory drive, which could account for a short term improvement, the persistence of these positive effects implies long lasting changes in the neuronal circuits that cannot be attributable to simply repressing inhibitory synapses over the time of treatment. Rather, specific molecular mechanisms must have been activated which resulted in permanent (or durable at least) changes. Remarkably, our data indicate that such molecular changes, assessed by gene expression profiling in the hippocampus, not only occur right after PTZ treatment, but remains three months later, irrespective of the genotype of the animal analysed. More specifically, our data show that the enzymes synthesizing GABA and its vesicular transporter are down-regulated at the end of the PTZ treatment while it is the opposite for glutamate. These changes in gene expression could conceivably participate in correcting the network homeostasis. Moreover, throughout the hippocampus, glutamate and GABA receptor subunits are reorganized. Hence, even though further investigations are required at the single cell level to identify the cell type specific modifications, our data suggest that our PTZ treatment could induce a cellular switch in neurotransmitter and neurotransmitter receptor identity which, ultimately, could also participate in regulating the network dynamics of the hippocampus and eventually memory functions.</p><p>It is generally assumed that memory involves cellular changes. LTP is widely accepted as a cellular basis of the hippocampus-dependent memory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. In our study, we show that LTP at the CA1 region increases after PTZ treatment, which is in accordance with previous studies and suggests a cellular basis for the observed learning/memory improvements. However, before treatment our data show that CA1 LTP was not significantly different between <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> mice. This lack of changes in LTP at the CA1 region in normal conditions has been reported in other mouse models of IDD such as for Fragile X syndrome (FXS) or DS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. On the other hand, in these mouse models, LTP recorded from the same animals at the perforant path-GC was impaired in mutants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. These results suggest that for some IDD, the LTP in CA1 may not be significantly changed compared to a control group despite clear learning memory impairment in the IDD mouse models. In contrast, a reduction of LTP in the dendate gyrus is commonly reported in IDD mouse models. Such changes could occur in the <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> mice and would require further investigation. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that LTP in CA1 and dentate gyrus has been suggested to have distinct physiological relevance. LTP in DG would be involved in filtering and transferring information (requiring a strong signal) and the maintenance of short-term memory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. In contrast, LTP in the CA1 region, which is induced more easily, may contribute to the formation of more solid and long-lasting memory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. It is therefore conceivable that LTP facilitation observed in the CA1 region after decreased efficiency of GABA-mediated inhibition in PTZ-treated animals forms part of the cellular basis responsible for the long-lasting memory improvements observed in treated <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> mice.</p><p>Cellular structural plasticity changes such as dendritic spine density have been shown to be related to memory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. In theory, enhanced spine formation would promote increased learning and memory performance. In the mature hippocampus, dendritic spines form the primary sites of excitatory synaptic transmission, and their number and morphology play an important role in synaptic plasticity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. LTP has been shown to induce dendritic spine structural modifications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, including new spine formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. CA1 LTP is induced by coordination of presynaptic (Schaffer collaterals, which are CA3 pyramidal neuron axons) and postsynaptic (dendritic arborization of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons) activity. On the apical side, CA1 pyramidal neurons receive synaptic inputs from Schaffer collaterals proximal to the soma and from the entorhinal cortex (via the perforant path) on distal dendrites. We report here an increase in density of dendritic spines in CA1 pyramidal neuron&#x02019;s apical tree that is presumably related to the increase of LTP due to the antagonistic action of PTZ on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, which is expected to increase excitatory drive in the neuronal network and/or correlate to new memory formation.</p><p>Potential molecular signatures for memory in the hippocampus have been under investigation for a long time. Many genes have been identified and are involved in synaptic transmission, neuronal architecture and cell signalling molecules. In our hippocampus data set, apart from the genes coding for neurotransmitters or their receptors and discussed previously, we could identify key canonical pathways triggered by PTZ treatment and leading to up-regulation of major components of memory. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), G-protein coupled receptor signalling, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cAMP-mediated signalling and CREB signalling in neurons as well as Neurotrophin/Trk signalling are all canonical pathways relevant to memory function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> and that were found to be upregulated in our data set. Several first messengers and their G-protein coupled receptors or (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) ligand/voltage dependent (Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup>) ion channels (NMDA <italic>grin2a</italic>, which have their activity facilitated by AMPA receptor <italic>gria1</italic> and <italic>gria2</italic>) are known to increase c-AMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. More specifically at the second messenger production level, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated type 1 and type 8 adenylate cyclases (<italic>adcy1</italic> and <italic>adcy8</italic>), main potent producers of cAMP, are also up-regulated. Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2a (<italic>camk2a</italic>) but not CAMK4 (<italic>camk4</italic>) is up-regulated. Moreover, cAMP response element&#x02013;binding protein, CREB co-activator P300 (<italic>ep300</italic>) and CREB binding protein CBP (<italic>crebbp</italic>) were also up-regulated. The main target of CREB complex related to memory is brain-derived neurotrophic factor (<italic>Bdnf</italic>), which is a potent modulator of synaptic transmission and plasticity in the CNS, acting both pre- and postsynaptically, and is up-regulated together with its receptor TrkB (<italic>Ntrk2</italic>) in our data set after PTZ treatment. Many genes involved in these pathways and found to be upregulated after PTZ treatment (including <italic>camk2</italic>, <italic>bdnf</italic>, <italic>ntrk2</italic>, <italic>crebbp</italic>, <italic>ep300</italic>, <italic>adcy1</italic>, <italic>adcy8</italic>, <italic>grin2a</italic>, <italic>gria1</italic> and <italic>gria2</italic>) have been shown to be decisive components in memory formation, synaptic neurotransmission, long-term potentiation and/or spine formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. Particularly, our study suggests that PTZ treatment might recruit the CaMKII&#x003b1;-BDNF-CREB&#x02013;mediated synaptic plasticity pathway to improve memory in a long lasting manner. Interestingly, these pathways are upregulated in the hippocampus after PTZ treatment regardless of the mouse genotype, in both <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> mice. This suggests that PTZ does not rescue the hippocampal genetic profile of the mutant mice but does rescue their memory phenotype by recruiting genes whose function is to ameliorate memory performance, bypassing thus the original behavioral failure.</p><p>PTZ has a broad spectrum of actions that conceivably may act synergistically to provide the positive effect on memory by establishing a new long-lasting homeostasis in the hippocampal circuits. Patients harbouring the mutation in the <italic>THRA</italic> gene are just beginning to be found but the incidence of the mutation is expected to be at least similar to that of the RTH due to <italic>THRB</italic> mutation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. A new parameter of identification has been recently established: elevated T3/T4 ratio and T3/rT3, which should aid in the identification of more patients in the near future. Moreover, thyroid hormone treatment has been inefficient in counteracting the cognitive deficits observed in patients presenting <italic>THRA1</italic> mutation-induced RTH<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Therefore, both the need and the potential for effective pharmacotherapy to alleviate memory deficits in patients with <italic>THRA1</italic> mutation-mediated RTH are real. Currently clinical trials are in progress for GABA<sub>A</sub> specific antagonist R04938581 or highly selective GABA<sub>A</sub>&#x003b1;5 negative allosteric modulator to ameliorate learning/memory performances in patients with DS.</p><p>The benefit of PTZ on memory and neuronal plasticity together with its potential neuroprotective effect via BDNF may also argue in favor of considering GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonist therapy for neurological disorders associating memory deficit to neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease. Further identification of gene expression changes of neuronal populations using single cell RNAseq from specific hippocampal areas and tracing experiments will enable us to better understand the specific site and mode of action of GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonists in regard to memory.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Animals</title><p>The <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/<italic>m</italic></sup> and their control littermates <italic>Thra1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice were used in the present study.

The RPKM normalized filtered data were tabulated and uploaded into the IPA web application (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ingenuity.com">www.ingenuity.com</ext-link>). To increase stringency in order to identify the top biological functions associated with either the mutation or the treatment, we used a false discovery rate (q-value) equal to 0.01 (over 100 genes, 99 are true positive). The biological functions that are expected to be increased or decreased according to the gene expression changes in our dataset were identified using the IPA regulation z-score algorithm which reveals the statistical measure of correlation between gene expression and relationship direction. A positive or negative z-score value indicates that a function is predicted to be increased or decreased respectively. Moreover, a function with a z-score &#x02265;2 or &#x02264;&#x02212;2 is considered as a function which is significantly increased or decreased respectively. From the selected lists we have filtered out few functional categories such as memory, LTP, DDS and listed the genes involved in each category. To view the molecular relationship between molecules and identify canonical pathways present in each selected functional category, we used IPA&#x02019;s connect tool and interaction information based on ingenuity Knowledge Database for each list. We used Qlucore Omics Explorer (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.qlucore.com">www.qlucore.com</ext-link>) for initial data analysis and &#x0201c;pheatmap&#x0201d; package from R Bioconductor (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioconductor.org">http://www.bioconductor.org</ext-link>) to perform a hierarchical clustering analysis and generated heatmaps for memory related category of genes and for glutamate and GABAergic signaling.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Wang, Y. <italic>et al.</italic> Hippocampal Transcriptome Profile of Persistent Memory Rescue in a Mouse Model of <italic>THRA1</italic> Mutation-Mediated Resistance to Thyroid Hormone. <italic>Sci.
