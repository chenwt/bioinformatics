id="P1">Haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) transplant is a widely used treatment for life-threatening conditions including leukemia; however, the molecular mechanisms regulating HSPC engraftment of the recipient niche remain incompletely understood. Here, we developed a competitive HSPC transplant method in adult zebrafish, using <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging as a non-invasive readout. We used this system to conduct a chemical screen and identified epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EET) as a family of lipids<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> that enhance HSPC engraftment. EETs&#x02019; pro-haematopoietic effects were conserved in the developing zebrafish embryo, where 11,12-EET promoted HSPC specification by activating a unique AP-1/<italic>runx1</italic> transcription program autonomous to the haemogenic endothelium. This effect required the activation of the PI3K pathway, specifically PI3K&#x003b3;. In adult HSPCs, 11,12-EET induced transcriptional programs, including AP-1 activation, which modulate multiple cellular processes, such as migration, to promote engraftment. Finally, we demonstrated that the EET effects on enhancing HSPC homing and engraftment are conserved in mammals. Our study established a novel method to explore the molecular mechanisms of HSPC engraftment, and discovered a previously unrecognized, evolutionarily conserved pathway regulating multiple haematopoietic generation and regeneration processes. EETs may have clinical application in marrow or cord blood transplantation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Transplanting zebrafish whole kidney marrow (WKM), the equivalent of mammalian whole bone marrow (WBM), can rescue lethally irradiated zebrafish as well as mutants with haematopoietic defects<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. In an effort to quantify HSPC activity in zebrafish, we developed a competitive transplantation system in a transparent mutant zebrafish, <italic>casper</italic>, which allows visualization of engraftment <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. We co-injected WKM cells from two ubiquitous green and red transgenic donors, <italic>Tg(&#x003b2;-actin:GFP</italic>)<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and RedGlo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> fish<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, into sub-lethally irradiated <italic>casper</italic> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). We could directly visualize donor-derived green and red fluorescence within the same kidney region, and calculate relative engraftment as the ratio of the green-to-red fluorescence intensity (G/R) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). This assay enables quick, quantitative, and non-invasive evaluation of marrow engraftment repeatedly over time, even up to 3 months post transplant. We validated the quantitative potential of this imaging-based approach by comparing with flow cytometry-based analysis of WKM from the same recipient. The two results were linearly correlated (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). The assay was also sensitive to changes in the relative number of green-tored donor cells. We observed an increase of recipient G/R readouts accompanying the increasing green-to-red ratio of transplanted donor cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Additionally, our system successfully detected the effects of two known chemical modulators of HSPC engraftment: dmPGE2 (16, 16-dimethyl-prostaglandin E2), a stabilized derivative of PGE2<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, and BIO (6-bromoindirubin-3&#x02032;-oxime), a GSK-3&#x003b2; inhibitor<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Green WKM transiently exposed for 4 hrs to either of these chemicals and transplanted together with untreated red WKM showed significantly enhanced engraftment capability compared to vehicle-only controls (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Therefore, within the cell dose and ratio range tested above, our zebrafish competitive transplantation system can successfully detect changes of relative engraftment of HSPCs.</p><p id="P3">To our knowledge, a screen-based forward-genetic approach to understand transplantation biology has never been attempted. We used our assay to screen 480 compounds with known bioactivities, which had been selected to cover diverse signaling pathways (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). 10 compounds significantly increased the G/R ratio reproducibly, including PGE2 and Ro 20-1724, which activates the cAMP pathway downstream of PGE2<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. The other hits target pathways that previously have not been linked to HSPC engraftment, including 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) and 14,15-EET (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). These are arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids synthesized through the cytochrome P450 epoxygenase pathway (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. A gene expression study previously reported mouse <italic>Cyp2j6</italic>, a cytochrome P450 epoxygenase, as one of the 93 genes enriched in long-term HSC<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Despite years of research on the potent effects of EETs in numerous physiological processes<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, knowledge about their direct target(s) and downstream pathway(s) is still very limited. To tackle this problem, a robust system allowing easy genetic perturbation is crucial. Since adult regeneration often reactivates pathways important for development, we decided to probe EETs&#x02019; effects on haematopoiesis during embryo development. Analogous to mammalian development, zebrafish HSPCs form from a <italic>flk1+</italic> population, named haemogenic endothelium, at 24 hpf (hours post fertilization) and become <italic>runx1+</italic> at 36 hpf in the evolutionarily conserved aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. HSPCs enter circulation after they emerge from the AGM<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, and seed the caudal haematopoietic tissue (CHT), a secondary haematopoietic site equivalent to the mammalian fetal liver (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. 11,12-EET treatment between 24&#x02013;36 hpf strongly increased the HSPC marker <italic>runx1</italic> in the AGM, and surprisingly induced <italic>runx1</italic> in a non-haematopoietic region of the tail mesenchyme, where <italic>runx1</italic> is not normally expressed (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). This indicates 11,12-EET might be inducing a conserved transcriptional program. We confirmed this AGM phenotype with <italic>in vivo</italic> time-lapse imaging of HSPC birth from the haemogenic endothelium. Tg<italic>(CD41:GFP; flk1:DsRed2)</italic> embryos treated with 11,12-EET starting at 24 hpf showed a significant increase in the number of double-positive HSPCs in the AGM from 30&#x02013;46 hpf (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c&#x02013;d</xref>). Single-cell analysis showed this change is mainly due to a significant increase in the frequency of HSPCs directly specified from the haemogenic endothelium, while no increase in the rate of cell division or AGM retention was observed (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). The additional HSPCs produced upon 11,12-EET treatment successfully homed to their next niche, resulting in increased numbers of HSPCs in the CHT, which was verified by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization for the HSPC marker <italic>cmyb</italic> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). Time-lapse imaging of Tg(<italic>Runx1+23:GFP)</italic> zebrafish showed that 11,12-EET treatment between 24&#x02013;48 hpf increased the rate of arrival of GFP+ HSPCs to the CHT (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Video 1</xref>,<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">2</xref>), presumably due to enhanced HSPC specification in the AGM.</p><p id="P5">To further dissect the molecular mechanism leading to <italic>runx1</italic> induction, we performed microarray analysis on 11,12-EET-treated 36 hpf embryos (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>). The upregulation of multiple AP-1 (Activator Protein 1) family transcription factors, including <italic>fosl2,</italic> and duplicated orthologs of human JUNB, <italic>junb</italic> and <italic>junbl</italic>, was among the most prominent changes. Whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization confirmed the induction both in the AGM and the non-haematopoietic region of the tail mesenchyme (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>, top two rows). AP-1 mRNA transcripts were detectable within 1 hr of 11,12-EET treatment and insensitive to the protein translation inhibitor cycloheximide (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4a&#x02013;b</xref>), indicating AP-1 members are immediate targets of EET signaling. In contrast, <italic>runx1</italic> induction required at least 4 hrs of 11,12-EET treatment and was completely blocked by cycloheximide (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that EET-induced AP-1 expression is necessary for increasing <italic>runx1</italic> transcription.</p><p id="P6">To genetically test this hypothesis, we globally knocked down AP-1 with anti-sense morpholinos targeting <italic>junb/junbl</italic>, which blocked <italic>runx1</italic> expression without affecting endothelial cells of the AGM (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>), suggesting that AP-1 might be required for HSPC specification from haemogenic endothelium. To test if <italic>AP-1</italic> function is autonomous to the haemogenic endothelium, we delivered a dominant-negative form of JunB protein (dnJUNB) specifically to the <italic>flk1+</italic> endothelial cells, before the induction of <italic>runx1</italic>, to functionally inhibit all AP-1 activity. Although <italic>flk1:dnJUNB</italic> did not significantly reduce the expression of <italic>runx1</italic> in DMSO-treated embryos, it suppressed the EET-induced increase of <italic>runx1</italic> in the AGM (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a&#x02013;b</xref>). Combined with the gene expression data, these genetic analyses showed that 11,12-EET activates an AP-1/<italic>runx1</italic> transcriptional cascade of cell fate specification autonomous to the haemogenic endothelium.</p><p id="P7">In an effort to define downstream signaling events for 11,12-EET, we performed a chemical suppressor screen in zebrafish embryos by examining the capability of various chemicals to suppress the 11,12-EET-induced AP-1/<italic>runx1</italic> gene signature (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Multiple PI3K inhibitors completely blocked the signature without detrimental effects to overall embryonic development (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d&#x02013;e</xref>, <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>). To interrogate specific PI3K catalytic subunits, we assayed subunit-specific chemical inhibitors and morpholinos targeting individual Class I PI3K subunits. Among &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;-, &#x003b3;-, and &#x003b4;-subunits of PI3K, only PI3K&#x003b3; loss of function specifically abrogated the <italic>runx1</italic> induction in the AGM and tail non-haematopoietic tissue (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6b&#x02013;c</xref>). Additionally, 11,12-EET enhanced PI3K activity in immortalized human umbilical vein endothelial cells, assayed by Akt phosphorylation (data not shown). No such increase was seen in human umbilical cord blood CD34+ HSPCs, although EET-induced gene expression changes could be partially blocked in these cells by co-treatment with PI3K inhibitors. This indicates PI3K functions either directly downstream of 11,12-EET or as a parallel pathway, depending on the cellular context. In either case, PI3K activity is required for inducing the <italic>AP-1/runx1</italic> transcription cascade in the AGM.</p><p id="P8">To understand how 11,12-EET treatment leads to increased engraftment in already specified HSPCs, we performed RNA-sequencing in human umbilical cord blood CD34+ HSPCs and a human myeloid cell line (U937), and utilized Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to decipher the biological pathways regulated by 11,12-EET in both cell types (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). Cell-to-cell signaling and cellular movement networks topped the list of activated biological pathways, including the AP-1 members, which have been shown to modulate cell migration in many cell types<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. AP-1 thus appears to be a common target of EET signaling, which leads to the induction of <italic>runx1</italic> in the haemogenic endothelium (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), and likely supports cell migration and cell-cell signaling of already-specified haematopoietic cells. In contrast, <italic>RUNX1</italic> is not upregulated in already-specified HSPCs, which is consistent with previous studies showing that <italic>Runx1</italic> is dispensable for HSPCs to engraft later haematopoeitic sites<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Several cytokines, such as <italic>CXCL8</italic>, <italic>OSM</italic> and <italic>CCL2</italic>, were also upregulated and involved in the cell migration network. These data show that besides promoting HSPC specification from the haemogenic endothelium, 11,12-EET can also directly induce gene expression programs beneficial for engraftment in already-specified HSPCs. Similarly, 11,12-EET treatment of zebrafish embryos after 48 hpf, when AGM HSPC production has already completed, leads to increased HSPCs in the CHT in a PI3K&#x003b3;-dependent manner, without affecting cell apoptosis or proliferation (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>). Our data strongly suggest that 11,12-EET modulates cell migration and cell-cell interaction during HSPC engraftment.</p><p id="P9">To test the evolutionary conservation of EET-induced haematopoietic phenotypes, we examined the effect of 11,12-EET on HSPC engraftment in mammalian bone marrow competitive transplantation. Consistently, 11,12-EET promoted greater short-term chimerism by 4 weeks post transplant (wpt) compared to control-treated cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a&#x02013;b</xref>). Even up to 24 weeks, EET-treated marrow maintained greater multi-lineage contribution (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Enhanced short- and long-term engraftment suggests that 11,12-EET may impact both stem and progenitor cells, perhaps by establishing a competitive advantage at the early stage of engraftment. In a WBM homing assay, we found 11,12-EET promoted the initial seeding of progenitor cells in the bone marrow (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d&#x02013;e</xref>). The early effect could be due to an enhanced cell migration and cell-cell signaling program, since assaying cell proliferation or apoptosis in whole marrow immediately after 11,12-EET treatment did not show significant changes (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>). However, this does not exclude the possibility of a later onset of anti-apoptotic effects upon transplantation. Finally we found transient inhibition of PI3K partially blocked EET-induced enhancement of long-term, multi-lineage engraftment following mouse bone marrow transplant (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). Thus, the EET effect on enhancing HSPC engraftment is evolutionarily conserved in fish and mammals.</p><p id="P10">Our unbiased chemical genetic studies elucidate a new eicosanoid pathway for haematopoiesis, which increases HSPC specification in the AGM by inducing AP-1/<italic>runx1</italic>, and also enhances HSPC engraftment by modulating several biological pathways, such as migration and cell-cell signaling. Previous work in our lab discovered a different eicosanoid, PGE2, could also enhance marrow engraftment<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Both PGE2 and EETs are arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids that are locally produced near wounds, and may facilitate progenitor recruitment, engraftment, and proliferation. Despite their common origin, the underlying molecular signaling mechanisms and activities of PGE2 and EETs are different (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S5</xref>). Although the direct receptor for EETs is unknown, several studies have provided biochemical evidence that EETs bind to a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. GPCRs signal through various G&#x003b1; subunits<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Previously we showed that PGE2 signals through the cAMP-dependent G&#x003b1;s-coupled PGE2 receptor for its pro-haematopoietic effects<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Using chemical inhibition and genetic loss-of-function approaches, we screened all families of zebrafish G&#x003b1; subunits. Interestingly, we found that <italic>gna12/13</italic> are specifically required for EET-induced AP-1 and <italic>runx1</italic> expression (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10</xref>). Inhibiting G&#x003b1;s did not suppress the EET phenotypes, indicating EETs and PGE2 have different signaling mechanisms.</p><p id="P11">During marrow transplantation, the achieved chimerism over time is critical, and the time to adequate neutrophil engraftment is an important milestone for treatment success. In addition to improving long-term repopulation, EETs seem to have a prominent effect on progenitor engraftment, as shown by increased chimerism early after transplantation. Our studies highlight the importance of lipid mediators in regulating HSPC engraftment, and the manipulation of these pathways could have clinical impact for patients undergoing transplantation.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S1" specific-use="web-only"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="S2"><title>Zebrafish strains</title><p id="P12">Zebrafish were maintained in accordance with Animal Research Guidelines at Boston Children&#x02019;s Hospital (BCH).
