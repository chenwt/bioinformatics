Signals that drive long-term reshaping of cell phenotypes are difficult to resolve because of complex feedback networks that operate over extended times. PIP<sub>3</sub>-dependent modulation of mRNA accumulation is clearly important in this process but is poorly understood. We have quantified the genome-wide mRNA-landscape of non-transformed, breast epithelium-derived MCF10a cells and its response to acute regulation by EGF, in the presence or absence of a PI3K&#x003b1; inhibitor, compare it to chronic activation of PI3K signalling by cancer-relevant mutations (isogenic cells expressing an oncomutant PI3K&#x003b1; allele or lacking the PIP<sub>3</sub>-phosphatase/tumour-suppressor, PTEN). Our results show that whilst many mRNAs are changed by long-term genetic perturbation of PIP3 signalling (&#x02018;butterfly effect&#x02019;), a much smaller number do so in a coherent fashion with the different PIP3 perturbations. This suggests a subset of more directly regulated mRNAs. We show that mRNAs respond differently to given aspects of PIP3 regulation. Some PIP3-sensitive mRNAs encode PI3K pathway components, thus suggesting a transcriptional feedback loop. We identify the transcription factor binding motifs SRF and PRDM1 as important regulators of PIP3-sensitive mRNAs involved in cell movement.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>16 November 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Class I phosphoinositide-3-kinases (PI3Ks) are lipid kinases that play key roles in the signal transduction events that allow cell surface receptors to control complex cellular responses, such as growth, movement, proliferation, differentiation and survival (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Class IA PI3Ks are heterodimers composed of one catalytic subunit (p110&#x003b1;, &#x003b2; or &#x003b4;) and one of five potential regulatory subunits (p85&#x003b1;/p55&#x003b1;/p50&#x003b1;, p85&#x003b2; or p55&#x003b3;) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Class IB PI3Ks are heterodimers of one catalytic subunit (p110&#x003b3;) and one of two potential regulatory subunits (p84 or p101) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Class IA PI3Ks are adapted to regulation by receptor tyrosine kinases, such as EGF-Rs, PDGF-Rs and insulin/IGF-receptors (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Class IB PI3Ks are adapted to regulation by GPCRs (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). There is also good evidence that p110&#x003b2; can be be regulated by both GPCRs and RTKs (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Upon activation of appropriate cell surface receptors, Class I PI3Ks catalyze the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) to produce phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) in the plasma membrane (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). PIP3 levels are also controlled through its degradation by specific lipid phosphatases; PTEN removes the 3-phosphate to convert PIP3 back into PI(4,5)P2 (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>); SHIP1/2 and INPP4A/B sequentially remove the 5-phosphate and 4-phosphate to form PI(3,4)P2 and PI3P, respectively (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>The generation of PIP3 initiates a complex signalling web through the recruitment and regulation of several PH-domain containing proteins at the plasma membrane (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). These direct effectors include serine/threonine protein kinases (e.g., AKT/PKB), tyrosine kinases (e.g., BTK) and several GEFs and GAPs for small GTPases of the Ras superfamily (e.g., GRP1, ARAP3). These initial effectors are then involved, usually in coordination with other signalling networks, in the regulation of several important cellular responses, such as growth and migration (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). One of the best studies pathways is the PKB-dependent regulation of the central regulator of cell growth, mTORC1 (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Initial effects of PI3K pathway activation are propagated by allosteric and post-translational effects (e.g., phosphorylation) but there is strong evidence that the pathway exerts important longer term effects through the regulation of translation, mRNA stability and direct regulation of transcription factors, processes in which PKB-mediated phosphorylation is thought to play a critical initiating role (e.g., through PKB-mediated phosphorylation of TSC2, BRF1 or FOXOs) (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Several important homeostatic feedback loops have also been identified (e.g., mTORC1-mediated downregulation of upstream signalling) (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and there is emerging evidence that expression of critical components of the pathway are regulated by microRNA networks (e.g., mirRNA-mediated regulation of PTEN) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), all of which act to control the &#x02018;poise&#x02019; of the pathway. Some of the proteins involved in PIP3 signalling can also act independently of their effects on the lipid. Indeed it has been described that PTEN localized in the nucleus can also regulate transcription independently of its lipid phosphatase activity via a direct interaction either with the nuclear proteins p53 (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and MSP58 (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) or with histone H1 keeping the chromatin in a condensed conformation (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). All of these effects make it extremely difficult to track the effects of PI3K pathway activation beyond the first few minutes of receptor stimulation.</p><p>The central importance of the PI3K/PIP3 signalling pathway in cell growth is illustrated by the prevalence of driver mutations in this pathway in many different types of human cancer. In breast cancers, oncogenic mutations in the gene encoding the p110&#x003b1; catalytic subunit (PIK3CA) and deletion or truncation of the gene encoding PTEN are present in up to 45 and 40% of human breast tumours respectively, generally in a mutually exclusive manner (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The most frequent mutations of p110&#x003b1; are found in the kinase domain of the protein (H1047R in exon 20, 47% of the cases) or in the helical domain (E545K or E542K in exon 9, 33% of the cases) and generate an activated kinase (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In all cases, PIK3CA and PTEN oncogenic modifications are consistent with the logic that more PIP3 supports more cell growth.</p><p>We have attempted to unravel some of the longer term effects of PI3K/PIP3/PTEN signalling on cell function by investigating the effects of both chronic and short term manipulation of this pathway on genome-wide mRNA accumulation in human breast epithelial MCF10a cells. We investigated isogenic cell lines expressing a single allele of H1047R-PIK3CA or loss of both alleles of PTEN to model long term activation of the pathway. We also investigated stimulation with EGF, in the presence or absence of the selective p110&#x003b1; inhibitor A66 (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), to model short term inhibition in the context of either basal or growth factor conditions. Chronic activation of the pathway produced remarkably wide and diverse effects on the mRNA landscape, with much smaller effects of short-term pharmacological inhibition. Analogous large scale-remodelling of the transcriptome and proteome of H1047R-PIK3CA cells has been reported recently (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). A small proportion of changes in mRNA accumulation aligned with the directional logic of the genetic and pharmacological manipulation employed, allowing predictions of mRNAs that may be more directly regulated by the pathway. Further, an analysis of transcription factor binding sites enriched within differentially regulated gene sets allowed the prediction of transcription factors that may play a significant role downstream of PI3K activation and also the components of a novel feedback loop.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Cell lines and tissue culture</title><p>MCF10a are non-transformed human breast epithelial cells.

DESeq2 Bioconductor package (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) was used to perform differential gene expression analysis. Three types of comparisons were used: (i) Pairwise comparison between two time points from two different conditions (the design formula in the generalized linear model (GLM) contains only one condition/time factor); (ii) comparison over multiple time points (time course) of gene expression in a single condition (the design formula in the GLM contains a time factor; then the likelihood ratio test is used with the reduced model where the time factor is removed from the design formula); (iii) comparison of two time courses from two different conditions (the design formula in the GLM contains a condition factor, a time factor and an interaction of the two; then the likelihood ratio test is used to test the significance of both condition differences and condition-time interaction with a reduced model which does not contain both the condition and the interaction terms). 0.05 significance level of adjusted <italic>p</italic>-values was used in all pairwise comparisons. 0.01 significance level of adjusted <italic>p</italic>-values was used in time course comparisons. For plotting time courses of RNA-Seq data, samples were normalized by Size Factors obtained by &#x02018;estimateSizeFactors&#x02019; function from DESeq2. When the expression of different genes needed to be compared (e.g. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>), it was normalized as reads per kilobase per million reads (RPKM).

Genome-wide mRNA profiling was performed by RNA-Seq on WT MCF10a cells starved overnight then stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF for 15, 40, 90, 180 and 300 min (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Those libraries and resulting data are called &#x02018;WT&#x02019; in the rest of the article.

Thus WT cells were pre-treated with the p110&#x003b1;-selective inhibitor A66 (2 &#x003bc;M) or DMSO for 20 min after the starvation period and before EGF stimulation, as well as during EGF stimulation (same time points as described above; referred to as &#x02018;A66&#x02019;). In addition WT cells were left with A66 without EGF for a further 300 min (referred to as &#x02018;A66 no EGF&#x02019;) to inhibit PI3K&#x003b1; basal activity.</p><p>PI3K pathway is frequently disrupted in breast cancer; in particular the p110&#x003b1; subunit is often mutated at specific hot spots whereas PTEN expression is often abolished, all leading to a constitutive activation of the PI3K pathway. In order to analyse the effect of these individual perturbations in both the presence and absence of EGF we used isogenic MCF10a cell lines either expressing a constitutively active version of p110&#x003b1; (referred to as &#x02018;PIK3CA H1047R&#x02019;, these cells have one WT and one mutated allele) or deleted for both PTEN alleles (referred to as &#x02018;PTEN KO&#x02019;). The presence of the H1047R mutation in the PIK3CA H1047R cells was confirmed by sequencing and the absence of PTEN in the PTEN KO cells by western-blot (data not shown). Both cell lines were submitted to the same starvation/EGF stimulation protocol as the WT MCF10a cells.</p><p>All libraries were sequenced in triplicates using the HiSeq 2500 (100 bp single-end reads, the average number of reads in a library is 31 million).

The lowest correlation coefficients were around 0.8, reflecting the fact that most genes are not affected by the perturbations. In addition, PCA also shows that the main source of variance in the data (represented by principal component 1 &#x02014; PC1) corresponds to changes due to the duration of EGF stimulation (sizes of the symbols in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). PC2 and PC3 represent the variance in the data introduced by PTEN KO and PIK3CA H1047R, respectively. In agreement with the correlation analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) and the experimental design, WT and A66 samples are the closest in the principal component space and indicate that over these time scales A66 treatment does not significantly alter the WT cell line. Conversely, PTEN KO and PIK3CA H1047R are largely separated from WT/A66 and from each other which reflects the basal effects of mutations on the cell lines. Taken together, this showed that the treatment with the p110&#x003b1;-selective inhibitor A66 had a significant but limited effect on the changes of mRNA levels induced by EGF in WT MCF10a cells, suggesting that the EGF response is largely mediated, as expected, by PI3K independent pathways (e.g., MAP kinase pathways). This also indicates that the presence of the point mutation PIK3CA H1047R or the deletion of PTEN in MCF10a induced long term changes in the transcriptional landscape, generating cell types different from the WT cell line and from each other.

Genes encoding the mRNAs that were increased by EGF treatment are mainly linked to sterol metabolism, although apoptosis appeared as well.</p></sec></sec><sec id="SEC3-3"><title>General overview of transcriptional regulation based on ISMARA analysis</title><p>To identify how PIP3 signals might control mRNA levels we performed an analysis of the RNA-Seq data using ISMARA (see Materials and Methods). The main output from such an analysis is the activity of transcription factor binding motifs (TFBMs) in every sample. A summarized heat map of activities of the most significant (<italic>z</italic>-value &#x0003e; 2) TFBMs is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. These activities resolve into four clusters: (i) where motifs&#x02019; activities are increased in PIK3CA H1047R cells and decreased by EGF (green cluster); (ii) where motifs&#x02019; activities are increased by EGF but not modified by PIP3 perturbations (black cluster); (iii) where motifs&#x02019; activities are increased in PTEN, decreased in PIK3CA H1047R and increased by EGF (red cluster); (iv) where motifs&#x02019; activities are decreased in PIK3CA H1047R and by EGF treatments (blue cluster). Interestingly, all the most significant motifs (<italic>z</italic>-value &#x0003e; 4) belong to the red cluster 3, suggesting that PTEN KO has the strongest effect on the cells. Since motif activities in ISMARA are calculated using RNA-Seq data we found similar trends of behaviour in actual gene expression profiles (see Discussion about mutant cell lines). However, it is important to note that some TFBMs bind repressors, therefore an increase in their activity would tend to decrease gene expression.</p><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>A heatmap of averaged (scaled and centered) activities of TFBMs from the ISMARA analysis.

To better understand how mRNAs in sets 1&#x02013;4 were transcriptionally regulated we looked at the most strongly regulated genes (S<sub><italic>m</italic></sub> &#x0003e; 20) in these gene sets (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). The most highly regulated genes belong to set 1. The six main regulating motifs (ISMARA nomenclature) are PRDM1, SRF, RREB1, GTF2I, EHF and HBP1_HMGB_SSRP1_UBTF. The SRF motif (representing the Serum Response Element (SRE), binding the transcription factor SRF) strongly affected EGRs, NR4A1, DUSP2, DUSP5, FOSL1 and FOSB, genes that are all known to be regulated by the ERK pathway. This result confirms the cross-talk between PI3K and other EGF-dependent signalling pathways. PRDM1 (representing the PRDM1 element, that binds the transcription factor BLIMP1) was another interesting motif that strongly regulated ATF3 and some other genes. Other transcription factors known to be regulated through the PI3K pathway (e.g. FOXO) were also retrieved from the ISMARA analysis but with lower scores.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-5"><title>PI3K-dependent regulation of mRNA levels in PTEN KO and PIK3CA H1047R cells</title><p>To analyse the mutant cell lines (PTEN KO and PIK3CA H1047R), we compared their mRNA landscapes (see Materials and Methods):

Averaged profiles of mRNA clusters in both sets (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) reveal that this effect is much weaker than the constitutive effect of isogenic mutations (sets A&#x02013;F, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), i.e. time courses of mRNA levels in PTEN KO and PIK3CA H1047R conditions are closer to WT.

Despite the functional similarities between the mRNAs regulated in the WT and in the mutant cell lines, one cluster in the set 2 (WT) is not present in set H.

To identify potential differences in their transcriptional regulation we considered the distributions of S<sub><italic>m</italic></sub> scores for each TFBM and tested them for equality using two different statistical tests (see Materials and Methods). The tests were in good agreement with each other and identified two main binding motifs, SRF and PRDM1 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Both motifs regulate genes in set A more strongly than in set B, suggesting that they are more active upon EGF stimulation. In agreement with previous results, increased activity of SRF is related to activation of the ERK pathway &#x02014; one of the main pathways responding to EGF (all highly regulated SRF target genes from Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> encode mRNAs found in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). In contrast, the increase in PRDM1 activity in the presence of EGF and dependent on PIP3 signalling was not expected. Thus, we looked further at PRDM1 target genes that respond to EGF stimulation (red bars in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref> shows all 20 of these targets. Their functions were checked in the literature and Uniprot.

Subsequent GO enrichment analysis was performed on each mRNA cluster. In agreement with previously reported analysis of gene expression time courses (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) we observed that genes from the same cluster tended to regulate similar biological processes, whereas GO analysis of unclustered genes did not highlight any significant biological functions. In order to extract information on transcription factor activities possibly responsible for the differential effects of perturbations, we used the ISMARA tool (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). ISMARA has provided important insights into the structure of transcriptional networks in different systems and helped to predict novel regulatory circuits. ISMARA has been applied to both time-independent data, consisting of samples representing different experimental conditions (e.g. (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>)), and time-dependent data, consisting of time-course samples (e.g. (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>)). In addition, statistical methods were developed and applied to standard ISMARA output. Recently, a singular value decomposition (SVD) method was used to analyse TFBM activities provided by an ISMARA analysis of time-dependent data (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). It helped to successfully decompose several types of biological behaviour that corresponded to different experimental treatments. However, when we applied the same SVD method to TFBM activities obtained from ISMARA analysis of our data, we were unable to clearly interpret the biological meanings of the right singular vectors (data not shown). As a consequence, we used a more classical clustering approach (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) which provided us with clearer biological insights. In turn, we also introduced a new approach for comparisons of the distributions of TFBM target scores (S<sub><italic>m</italic></sub>) using a non-parametric statistical test. It helped us to reveal a possible transcriptional feedback loop in PIP3 signalling.</p><sec id="SEC4-1"><title>Mutations of PI3K and PTEN remodel the mRNA landscape</title><p>One of our main observations is that the effects of of PIK3CA-H1047R and PTEN deletion are dramatic, influencing the levels of thousands of mRNAs even in very closely related &#x02018;isogenic&#x02019;, unstimulated cells. This is entirely consistent with recent work that demonstrated major reshaping of the mRNA landscape by PIK3CA-H1047R in &#x02018;isogenic&#x02019; cells related to those used in this study, an effect which the authors termed the &#x02018;butterfly effect&#x02019; (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). However, we do not have parallel data from independent clones of these cell lines and therefore cannot define the extent to which these differences are a result of the specific genetic modifications versus chance events accumulated in the independent history of the cells. We compared our data with published data from two other labs for MCF10a cells (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) (GEO Accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE63452">GSE63452</ext-link>) and (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) (Array Express accession number E-MTAB-2706), and with similar data for prostate epithelium (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) (Array Express accession number E-GEOD-47047). Interestingly, this revealed that although our data was globally highly similar to one study of MCF10a cells, it was more different from another study of MCF10a cells than it was from similar data from prostate epithelium cells. The pattern of differences may have been related to the conditions under which the cells were cultured. Indeed, the growing media contained cholera toxin ((<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and this study) or not (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), Charcoal dextran-treated FBS (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) or not ((<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and this study) and twice more EGF in (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) than in this study. The starvation medium of (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) still contained EGF (therefore desensitizing cells), and (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) used a different base medium (MCDB-170 instead of DMEM/F12). Finally (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) isolated the RNA at very different time after starvation (0&#x02013;24 h instead of 0&#x02013;3 h in this study). However, the importance of each of these factors is unclear. Further experiments should analyse independent, but &#x02018;theoretically identical&#x02019; clones of &#x02018;isogenic&#x02019; cell lines, treated according to the same protocol, to resolve this important issue.</p></sec><sec id="SEC4-2"><title>Most EGF effects on mRNA levels are PI3K-independent</title><p>The analysis of WT cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) also suggests that most of the EGF-induced changes in mRNA were due to PI3K-independent pathways (orange area of Venn diagram on Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This result was expected because EGF is known to activate several other important signalling pathways (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). The number of mRNAs changed by EGF and the scale of those changes were far greater than that induced by the so-called &#x02018;butterfly effects&#x02019; (expression of H1047R-p110&#x003b1; or loss of PTEN). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> also revealed that the actual number of mRNAs whose expression is regulated by EGF via PI3K, i.e. when A66 counteracts the EGF effect in the WT, is more limited (groups 3 and 4). Further, the application of A66 to cells not stimulated with EGF revealed a number of mRNAs that were changed and that we classified as &#x02018;sensitive to basal activity of PI3K&#x02019;. The relatively limited effects of A66 either in the presence or absence of EGF are manifest in the very high similarity in the global mRNA landscapes of A66 treated and untreated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, WT versus A66). The acute nature of the perturbation on the wild-type cells compared to the chronic effects of H1047-p110&#x003b1; expression and PTEN deletion, with their associated &#x02018;butterfly effects&#x02019;, might yield a distinct cell phenotype. It will be important to extend this work by examining more prolonged periods of treatment with class IA PI3K inhibitors and the impact of such inhibitors in H1047R-p110&#x003b1;-expressing and PTEN deficient cells.</p></sec><sec id="SEC4-3"><title>Different mutations trigger different &#x02018;Butterfly effects&#x02019;</title><p>We attempted to predict the possible phenotypic consequences of the changes in mRNA levels. When our analyses started with the entire family of mRNAs changed by perturbation of PIP3 signalling there was little clear evidence of GO term enrichment. This is probably to be expected when a central signalling pathway, that controls and integrates many aspects of cell behaviour, is modulated. Therefore, we split the data into various groups.</p><p>The largest effect of PTEN deletion was an upregulation of gene expression. These genes are generally involved in cell respiration and energy derivation (&#x0223c;600 genes in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, group F and &#x0223c;900 genes in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> group H).

Another interesting effect of PTEN deletion was a unique fraction of mRNAs whose levels dropped dramatically in PTEN deleted cells compared to WT in the absence of EGF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, asymmetric distribution of blue points around the black line). Further GO enrichment analysis revealed that mRNAs that are &#x02018;shut down&#x02019; are mainly involved in cell proliferation, cell&#x02013;cell adhesion and signalling (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, groups E and F).</p><p>Changes in mRNA levels in PIK3CA-H1047R-expressing cells in the absence of EGF are more symmetrical than those of PTEN KO cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> &#x02014; symmetric distribution of green points around black line). About 200 mRNAs whose levels are increased in H1047R-p110&#x003b1;-expressing cells but do not respond to EGF (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, group D) mainly encode for proteins involved in mitosis.

Interestingly, a large number (&#x0223c;900, Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, group H) of mRNAs which do not respond to EGF stimulation but are more weakly increased by expression of H1047R-p110&#x003b1; were also involved in RNA processing and splicing.</p><p>Overall, the proteins encoded by the mRNAs that responded to EGF have essentially &#x02018;dynamic&#x02019; cell functions (development, locomotion, migration, wound healing, morphogenesis, see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, groups A and E), while the mRNAs that did not respond to EGF have more &#x02018;static&#x02019; functions (extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">B</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">F</xref>).

This approach had the potential to identify transcription factors like FOXO-family members regulated by PIP3. We used ISMARA to identify those transcription factor binding motifs whose activity changed most with perturbation of PIP3 signalling. This process identified a number of TFBMs including those for PRDM1 and SRF (see below). Motifs binding proteins of the FOXO-family were identified but with much lower strength. In particular, we looked at the activity of transcription binding sites responsible for the differential effect of EGF present in both mutations. Differential analysis of the two sets A and B using ISMARA identified two TFBMs &#x02014; PRDM1 (binding site for the transcriptional repressor PRDM1, also known as BLIMP1) and SRE (binding site for SRF) &#x02014; that were mainly responsible for the effect of mutations on mRNAs from set A (responding to EGF in WT, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) but not the mRNAs from set B (not responding to EGF in WT). When we looked at the mRNAs from set A that are potentially regulated by PRDM1 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>), we noticed that several target genes of the PRDM1 motif could affect PIP3 pathways (CYLD, PIK3IP1, NEDD4L, LPXN, GAB2). This suggests that a PRDM1-PIP3 transcriptional feedback loop is present in the system. However, no direct regulation of PRDM1 has been documented as far as we know. There are two possibilities: (i) a direct feedback loop through activation of PRDM1 by PI3K; (ii) an indirect activation of PRDM1 by other pathways responding to EGF and whose function is affected by PI3K pathways. PRDM1 is barely expressed in the absence of EGF. EGF treatments increased its expression five-fold in the WT and both mutant cell lines (Supplementary Figure S3). This increase peaked at 40 min and disappeared at 100 min. Conversely, the default &#x02018;activity&#x02019; of the PRDM1 binding motif is high until 180 min, after which it sharply drops. Since PRDM1 is a transcriptional repressor, this is consistent with a fast effect of EGF increasing its (PRDM1) transcription followed by a repression of its targets. Studying the other target genes might also reveal new regulation of PI3K pathways. For instance VWA5A encodes the von Willebrand factor A domain containing 5A, a known breast tumour suppressor (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC4-5"><title>Overlapping effects of several perturbations correlate with PIP3 signalling logic</title><p>In this study we attempted to combine a number of temporally and mechanistically distinct PIP3 perturbations to reveal mRNA changes more likely to be directly controlled by PIP3 signals amongst the very large number of changes resulting from indirect homeostatic effects. The number of mRNAs that were influenced by all the PIP3 perturbations employed was far smaller (136). Importantly, the very large majority of these mRNAs were regulated in-keeping with the logic of PIP3 signalling i.e. mRNA levels increased by loss of PTEN and expression of H1047R-p110&#x003b1; in both basal and EGF-stimulated conditions, but were reduced by A66; or <italic>vice versa</italic>. This pattern contrasted with that seen in the lists of mRNAs regulated by fewer of the PIP3 perturbations, where other perturbations induced changes in a given mRNA that appeared inconsistent with the logic of PIP3 signalling. This observation suggests the 136 mRNAs regulated by all PIP3 perturbations are likely to be more direct targets of PIP3 signalling. Clustering the group of 136 mRNAs via the kinetics of their responses resolved two stable groups (Supplementary Table S3 and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>), the average profiles of which showed either; (i) an increase in mRNA levels in alignment with the logic of increased PI3K/PIP3 signalling (<italic>n</italic> = 64), or, (ii) a decrease in mRNA levels in alignment with the logic of decreased PI3K/PIP3 signalling (<italic>n</italic> = 72).</p><fig id="F10" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p>mRNAs regulated in-keeping with the logic of PIP3 signalling (see text for description).

Unfortunately, in all those studies experimental conditions differed from our experiment. For instance in (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) the same medium was used to grow the cells, however the cells were not starved in serum before the protein extraction. We also looked at the PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE) database and found three studies on MCF10a cells. Similarly, in the most relevant study (accession number PXD000599) the cells were not starved and the focus of the study was on the expression of phosphorylated proteins only. Additionally, in all these studies, only a few (usually one) or different (from ours) data points of EGF stimulation were considered. Based on our observation that slight differences in experimental conditions can have even more dramatic effects on gene expression than genetic mutations (see Results, Mutations of PI3K and PTEN remodel the mRNA landscape), it is difficult to directly meaningfully compare those datasets to our results.</p><p>By using several bioinformatics approaches this study provides a valuable insight into understanding chronic and acute effects of the PI3K signalling pathway on the genome wide transcriptome. Our findings confirm the concept of the &#x02018;butterfly effect&#x02019;, in which thousands of mRNAs are changed as a result of single oncogenic mutations of the PI3K/PIP3 pathway being introduced into cells. We were able to identify a relatively small number of mRNAs (&#x0223c;130) that appear to be the primary targets of PIP3-signalling within this huge wave of changes. Some of these PIP3-sensitive changes in mRNA appear to be driven by PIP3-regulation of the PRDM1 transcription factor binding motif. A potential transcriptional feedback loop by which PIP3 signalling may control the class I PI3K signalling network has also been identified.</p></sec></sec>
