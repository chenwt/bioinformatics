Although we have made great progress in mapping resistance genes, little is known about the mechanism of resistance.</p><p>By de novo transcriptome assembling, we gained sufficient transcript data to analyze changes in gene expression of early interaction in response to SBPH and RSV infection in rice. Respectively 648 and 937 DEGs were detected from the disease-resistant (Liaonong 979) and the susceptible (Fengjin) varieties, most of which were up-regulated. We found 37 genes related to insect resistance, which mainly included genes for jasmonate-induced protein, TIFY protein, lipoxygenase, as well as trypsin inhibitor genes and transcription factor genes. In the interaction process between RSV and rice, 87 genes were thought to be related to RSV resistance; these primarily included 12 peroxidase biosynthesis genes, 12 LRR receptor-like protein kinase genes, 6 genes coding pathogenesis-related proteins, 4 glycine-rich cell wall structural protein genes, 2 xyloglucan hydrolase genes and a cellulose synthase. The results indicate that the rice-pathogen interaction happened both in disease-resistant and susceptible varieties, and some genes related to JA biosynthesis played key roles in the interaction between SBPHs and rice. When rice was infected by RSV a hypersensitive reaction (HR) in the disease-resistant variety was suppressed, which resulted from an increase in peroxidase expression and down-regulation of LRR receptor-like protein kinase and pathogenesis-related proteins, while, the changes of peroxidase biosynthesis, glycine-rich cell wall structural protein, cellulose synthase and xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase could lead to the strengthening of physical barriers of rice, which may be an important resistance mechanism to RSV in rice.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Liaoning provincial natural science fund (201202105), Liaoning important technology developing program in China(2011208001), the special scientific research fund of agriculture public welfare profession of China(201003031)and the National Natural Science Fund in China(C140104).

When infected with RSV at the seeding stage, rice grows poorly and often develops folded and twisted leaves, with the central leaves yellowing and withering; growth may terminate and ultimately the plant will die. When infection occurs after tillering, upper leaves become discolored or yellow-green and the number of grains per ear is reduced significantly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082126-Kiso1">[3]</xref>. In China, rice stripe is increasing in severity, particularly in Jiangsu province, where approximately 0.6 M ha per year of rice were infected by RSV in the period 2000 to 2003, rising to 1 M ha in 2004. Rice yield is reduced by 30&#x02013;50% in heavily infected fields, and in some of the most severely infected fields, no harvest is possible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082126-Sun1">[4]</xref>. Rice stripe is still one of the most damaging virus threats to Japonica production in China. It is difficult to control this disease because the virus is transmitted in a circulative, transovarial propagative manner by viruliferous female planthoppers to their offspring. The most economical and effective way for controlling the disease is to plant resistant varieties.</p><p>The resistance gene to RSV that has been frequently utilized in breeding is Stvb<sup>i</sup>, which originated in the indica cultivar &#x02018;Modan&#x02019;. Hayanoo et al constructed a physical map spanning 1.8-cM distance between flanking markers, consisting of 18 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones, around the Stvb-i locus on rice chromosome 11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082126-HayanoSaito1">[5]</xref>. Despite considerable progress in mapping RSV resistance genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082126-Zhang1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082126-Wang1">[7]</xref>, there have been only a few studies of the resistance mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082126-Satoh1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082126-Hao1">[9]</xref></p><p>Understanding the responses of rice to RSV infection is important for developing strategies for disease control. Since rice responses to viral infection are complex and relate to many kinds of physiological processes, system-level transcriptomic studies are required to fully understand the responses. Recently, next-generation deep-sequencing techniques such as Illumina RNA-Seq and digital gene expression have provided new approaches for studying the transcriptome. RNA-Seq is a whole transcriptome sequencing method, and many transcriptome studies have greatly extended our knowledge of mechanisms of resistance to plant pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082126-Ishihara1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082126-Savory1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082126-Lu1">[12]</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we analyzed the early response of two rice cultivars to infection by RSV and its carrier at the transcriptome level using next-generation deep-sequencing techniques. We investigated the alteration in gene expression between a disease-resistant cultivar and a susceptible cultivar before and after inoculation with RSV by co-culturing with <italic>Laodelphax striatellus</italic> for 48 h. Our study provides insight at the molecular level into the mechanism of development of rice stripe disease, which contributes to our understanding of the rice-RSV interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Illumina sequencing and aligning to the reference genome</title><p>Our transcriptome sequence data included gene expression profiling following different treatments of two rice varieties. The RNA-Seq method generates absolute information rather than relative gene expression measurements; thus, it avoids many of the inherent limitations of microarray analysis. This method was used to analyze differences in gene expression between the disease-resistant and the sensitive hosts. We sequenced four cDNA libraries, R1 (Liaonong 979 CK), R2 (Fengjin CK), R3 (Liaonong 979 inoculated treatment), R4 (Fengjin inoculated treatment), and generated 45,763,250 sequence reads, each of which was 50&#x02013;101 bp in length, encompassing 7.91 Gb of sequence data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0082126-t001">Table 1</xref>). GC% of sequence data from the four libraries were all approximately 50%, and CycleQ20% were all 100%, which showed that the accuracy and quality of the sequencing data were sufficient for analysis. Each treatment was represented by approximately 10 million reads, the tag density sufficient for the quantitative analysis of gene expression. Of the total reads, 70&#x02013;80% matched to genomic locations. Sequence data from the four libraries were combined, and 33420 unigenes were finally obtained with an average depth of &#x0003e;70x and 55&#x02013;60% coverage. The length distribution of total unigenes had similar patterns among the four samples, suggesting there was no bias in the construction of the cDNA libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082126-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0082126-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0082126.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Length distribution of unigenes in the assembled transcriptomes.</title><p>The x axis shows the lengths of unigenes calculated in our library and the y axis shows the number of unigenes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0082126.g001"/></fig><table-wrap id="pone-0082126-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0082126.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Summary statistics for rice genes based on the RNA-Seq data.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0082126-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0082126.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">R1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">R2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">R3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">R4</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total reads</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10597887</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10006748</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12342123</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12816492</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">sequence data</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.94Gb</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.83Gb</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.1Gb</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.04Gb</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GC(%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">49.88</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.64</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.74</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">51.08</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CycleQ20%</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mapped reads</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8727756</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8895279</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10285064</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10131598</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">UniqReads</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7189441</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7466182</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8643772</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8581369</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MultiPosiReads</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1538315</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1429097</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1641292</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1550229</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total genes</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30233</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30639</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30801</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29928</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean Depth</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">73.17</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">76.18</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">88.37</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">88.25</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean Coverage</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.59</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.55</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Difference of sequencing data between the reference genome (Nipponbare) and two rice cultivars</title><p>As is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0082126-t002">Table 2</xref>, many new genes, new exons,UTRs,rtIntroes, skippedexons and alternativesplices were detected from the four cDNA libraries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082126.s001">Table S1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082126.s006">6</xref>).

To combat the pathogens, plants have evolved sophisticated and effective defense mechanisms. The hypersensitive response (HR) is a common initial response to attack by pathogens. This type of resistance often occurs in the incompatible interactions between plants and pathogens, and is characterized by rapid necrosis of infected and neighboring host cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082126-Bowles1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082126-Shirasu1">[24]</xref>.

Peroxidases, glycine-rich cell wall structure protein and cellulose synthase have a role in defense by strengthening cell physical barriers and lignification, which indicates that strengthening physical barriers may be one of the factors for RSV resistance in rice. Previous studies have used different methods to characterize changes in expression of some genes in response to RSV infection. By microarray, Satoh et al studied changes in gene expression at 5 stages, respectively 0 d, 3 d, 6 d, 9d and 12d after inoculation with SBPHs carrying RSV.

The results indicated that expression of many genes associated with JA signaling, pathogen-related molecular patterns and cell wall structure would be activated or suppressed before and after being inoculated with SBPH carried RSV. Further analysis shows that HR may not be the mechanism for resistance to RSV in a disease resistant variety, and lignification and cell wall strengthening may play a critical part in resistance to RSV. But the molecular function of some genes remains largely unknown and requires further study. Even so, the identification of DEGs involved in rice stripe disease resistance will extend our understanding of the complex molecular and cellular events in this process and provide a foundation for future studies on breeding for resistance to rice stripe disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s5"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Plant materials</title><p>Liaonong979 is a highly resistant rice variety to RSV, and Fengjin is a highly susceptible cultivar to rice stripe disease, both of these varieties are moderately resistant to SBPH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082126-Li2">[32]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>Obtaining samples for transcriptomic analysis</title><p>Two rice cultivars, Fengjin and Liaonong979, were grown in 1000 ml beakers, 20 seeds per beaker, in a green house (25&#x000b1;1&#x000b0;C, natural sunlight).
