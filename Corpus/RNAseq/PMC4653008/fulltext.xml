We previously showed that a tumor/cancer stem cell (CSC) marker, doublecortin-like kinase (DCLK1) positively regulates hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication, and promotes tumor growth in colon and pancreas. Here, we employed transcriptome analysis, RNA interference, tumor xenografts, patient's liver tissues and hepatospheroids to investigate DCLK1-regulated inflammation and tumorigenesis in the liver. Our studies unveiled novel DCLK1-controlled feed-forward signaling cascades involving calprotectin subunit S100A9 and NF&#x003ba;B activation as a driver of inflammation. Validation of transcriptome data suggests that DCLK1 co-expression with HCV induces BRM/SMARCA2 of SW1/SNF1 chromatin remodeling complexes. Frequently observed lymphoid aggregates including hepatic epithelial and stromal cells of internodular septa extensively express DCLK1 and S100A9. The DCLK1 overexpression also correlates with increased levels of S100A9, c-Myc, and BRM levels in HCV/HBV-positive patients with cirrhosis and HCC. DCLK1 silencing inhibits S100A9 expression and hepatoma cell migration. Normal human hepatocytes (NHH)-derived spheroids exhibit CSC properties. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of the hepatitis B/C-virus induced liver inflammation and tumorigenesis via DCLK1-controlled networks. Thus, DCLK1 appears to be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and HCC.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DCLK1</kwd><kwd>HCV</kwd><kwd>cancer stem cell</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>hepatocellular carcinoma</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been recognized as the third most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide with an annual death toll of approximately 700,000 [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. According to World Health Organization, the global burden of HCC is expected to rise and will likely account for the second highest increase in cancer-related death rates by 2030 [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. HCC often occurs in the setting of underlying chronic viral hepatitis, inflammation, steatosis, and cirrhosis. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is considered a major risk factor for the development of HCC. HCV causes chronic hepatitis in most patients (&#x0003e;80%), accounts for 50&#x02013;76% of all primary liver cancer cases [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and reduces overall life expectancy by 8-12 years [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The risk for HCC increases in HCV carriers with obesity or diabetes, two prevalent diseases in the United States associated with chronic inflammation [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. New direct-acting anti-HCV drugs against three key nonstructural proteins NS3, NS5A and NS5B have improved the treatment efficacy and cure rate of chronic HCV infection [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the high costs of treatment [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], late stage detection of HCC, and co-existing cirrhosis pose major challenges for treating advanced disease. Epigenetic abnormalities and signaling dysregulation have also been shown to contribute to HCC [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although chronic HCV infection is a major risk factor for HCC, how this virus directly contributes to hepatocellular transformation remains poorly understood.</p><p>CSCs display several characteristics of normal stem cells such as self-renewal, and unlimited proliferative and differentiation capacities [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These rare cells (1%&#x02013;2% of total tumor mass) recapitulate the original tumor heterogeneity after metastasis and also contribute to cancer progression, metastasis and therapeutic resistance. Thus, CSCs represent translationally relevant targets for cancer treatment especially in malignancies that are refractory to conventional antitumor agents [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Histopathological study of tissues from chronic liver diseases, <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments and murine models support the existence of CSCs in HCC [reviewed in [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]].</p><p>The doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1, domains organization shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>) is a microtubule-associated CSC protein that catalyzes tubulin polymerization into microtubules. We previously demonstrated that DCLK1 is overexpressed in a number of solid tumors (colon, intestine, pancreas) including HCC [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Subsequently, our studies defined a role for DCLK1 in tumorigenesis and the activation of quiescent intestinal stem cells following radiation injury [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We also demonstrated that HCV replication positively correlates with several CSC-related proteins such as DCLK1, CD133, Lgr5, Lin28, AFP, CK19 and c-Myc [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. siRNA knockdown of DCLK1 leads to diminished HCV replication [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and downregulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-promoting factors [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Other investigators used lineage tracing in <italic>Apc</italic><sup>Min/+</sup> mice to demonstrate that DCLK1, in fact, marks CSCs in intestinal adenomas and its ablation results in regression of polyps [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These observations supported a potential association between DCLK1 and HCV-induced HCC.</p><p>Chronic inflammation associated with HCV infection is considered a major contributor to cirrhosis and the development of HCC. For example, inflammation shifts hepatocytic TGF-&#x003b2; signaling from tumor-suppression to fibrogenesis and an increased risk for HCC [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. HCV infection also promotes production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;) through a caspase-1/NLRP3 inflammasome [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The pro-inflammatory nuclear factor NF&#x003ba;B and calprotectin (S100A8/A9 heterodimer) are activated by HCV leading to induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhanced cell survival [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The S100A8 (myeloid related protein 8, MRP8) and S100A9 (MRP14) proteins belong to the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins. These molecules preferentially form an S100A8/A9 heterodimer in the presence of Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> that promotes phagocyte migration through tubulin polymerization and stabilization [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These proteins are constitutively expressed in myeloid cells in a calcium-dependent manner as multimers. S100A9 is an endogenous ligand for TLR4, RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation) and heparan sulfate. Increased expression of S100A8/A9 is reported in inflammatory diseases, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and autoimmunity [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Interestingly, DCLK1 binds and polymerizes tubulins into microtubules filaments [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These observations indicate a putative functional relationship between DCLK1 and S100A8/9 via microtubule organization.</p><p>The DCLK1 gene functions in liver homeostasis or hepatic diseases are unclear. Here, we report the DCLK1's inflammatory and tumorigenic role in hepatitis B/C-induced cirrhosis and HCC. Our results further revealed plasticity of DCLK1-positive human hepatocytes and potential dedifferentiate into cancer-stem-like phenotypes. These cellular alterations are likely to drive progression of liver diseases into pre-neoplastic conditions such as fibrosis and cirrhosis and/or HCC.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Transcriptome analysis revealed a unique gene signature in DCLK1-overexpressing hepatoma cells that harbor HCV subgenomic replicons</title><p>The FCA4 cell line is derived from Huh7 hepatoma cells that persistently express G418-resistant subgenomic HCV-1b replicons [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Staining for viral proteins suggest that the majority of cells express the replicon. The FCA4-derived FCA4-RD cells constitutively express human DCLK1 tagged at the N-terminus with red florescence protein (RFP-DCLK1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). FCA4 cells expressing untagged RFP (FCA4-RFP) were used as controls for FCA4-RD cells. These cells were enriched for RFP-DCLK1 or RFP expression by FACS and used in the subsequent studies. Thus, most FCA4-RD cells represent HCV<sup>+</sup>DCLK1<sup>+</sup> phenotypes. Total RNAs isolated from these cells were subjected to transcriptome analysis. As expected, the FCA4-RD cell line displayed overexpressed DCLK1 mRNAs (&#x0003e;300 fold) as compared to the parent (Huh7, FCA4) and control (FCA4-RFP) cell lines (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). The heat maps of differentially regulated genes suggest that FCA4-RD expresses unique gene signatures characterized by enhanced expression of S100A9, GLP2R, FBN2, HRH1, IL1RN and SMARCA2 (human BRM) (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). These genes are each involved in key inflammatory and carcinogenic pathways (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Nearly 30 genes, including PSAPL1 and CDX2, were downregulated in FCA4-RD cells compared to controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). As expected, OAS1 and OAS3 that induce the degradation of viral RNAs in an interferon&#x02013;dependent manner were downregulated in all three HCV replicon-expressing cell lines compared to HCV-negative Huh7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, bottom arrows). During these analyses, we also addressed whether DCLK1 alone causes distinct regulation of gene expression by comparing transcriptomes of Huh7-RD cells, which express N-terminus RFP-tagged DCLK1 with that of parent Huh7 cells. In addition to an array of differentially expressed genes, Huh7-RD cells showed significant increases in S100A9 mRNA level (18.29&#x000b1;0.0002, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). However, RFP expression alone in Huh7 cells failed to alter the S100A9 levels (not shown).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Differential gene expression profile in response to DCLK1 overexpression in the presence or absence of HCV</title><p>The total RNAs isolated from Huh7 hepatoma cells expressing HCV subgenomic replicon (FCA4, HCV<sup>+</sup>) and FCA4 cells overexpressing recombinant RFP-DCLK1 (FCA4-RD, HCV<sup>+</sup>DCLK1<sup>+</sup>) were subjected to transcriptome analysis by RNASeq method. The data were analyzed using GeneSifter software at 10-fold change in the expression level and at least 10 reads (Quality).

Comparative analyses of all cell lines clearly suggest that the highest number of altered gene expression was observed when the HCV replicon and recombinant DCLK1 were co-expressed (HCV<sup>+</sup>DCLK1<sup>+</sup> cells). This result was obtained by analysis of mRNA levels in all the cell lines using Venn diagram (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). In total, 142 to 178 genes showed unique changes in FCA4-RD cells. We validated some of these changes by Western blot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). Of note, the SMARCA2 (BRM) protein, an ATPase subunit of chromatin remodeling complex SW1/SNF1, was detected only in FCA4-RD cells (lane 4), and HRH1 was highest in these cells as compared to the controls.</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title>DCLK1 overexpression correlates with enhanced levels of S100A9, c-Myc, and SMARCA2 in patients</title><p>Immunohistochemical staining was performed on normal liver (6 samples) and liver tissues from HCV-positive patients with cirrhosis (16 samples) or HCC (10 samples). The composite scores that account for the staining intensities and the number of positive cells in the liver are shown in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> for normal and patients with cirrhosis. In normal liver all the cell subtypes were negative for DCLK1. Only Kupffer cells (resident macrophages) were S100A9-positive. In contrast, epithelial and stromal cells, Kupffer cells, lymphocytes, and bile ducts showed expression of DCLK1 and S100A9 in cirrhosis. Interestingly, increased DCLK1 expression correlated with S100A9 for the most cell-types in HCV-positive cirrhosis.</p><p>Lymphoid aggregates/follicles and internodular septa are considered hallmarks of HCV-induced chronic liver disease. Similar aggregates were primarily composed of B and T cells as revealed by their respective markers. The aggregates extensively stained for both DCLK1 and S100A9 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental S3</xref>) whereas normal liver lacked such staining (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In addition to cytoplasmic staining of hepatocytes and stromal cells in a different patient liver tissues, we also noticed S100A9 staining in hepatocyte membranes in areas adjacent to inflammatory/septal regions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, red arrows). Co-staining with CD20 and DCLK1 suggested that certain B lymphocytes expressed DCLK1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). It is known that lymphocytes are susceptible to HCV infection and support HCV RNA replication [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It is possible that DCLK1 expression in these cells may be induced by HCV.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>DCLK1 overexpression correlates with increased levels of S100A9, c-Myc and BRM/SMARCA2 in patients with chronic liver diseases and HCC</title><p><bold>A.</bold> Immunohistochemical staining was carried out to evaluate DCLK1 and S100A9 expression in different cell populations of liver tissues derived from HCV-positive patients.

Most cases with cirrhosis and HCC showed higher expression of all of these proteins compared to normal liver (lane 1). Liver biopsies showing steatosis but no evidence of cirrhosis or HCC also showed elevated DCLK1. However, there was no increase in S100A9, c-Myc, or SMARCA2. The C1 and C2 samples (lanes 6 and 7) had nearly normal levels of S100A9 although all other protein levels were elevated. This may have been due to their known history of immunosuppressive drug use (i.e., prednisone).</p></sec><sec id="s2_3"><title>DCLK1 levels correlate with activation of inflammatory cascade</title><p>We transplanted one million Huh7 cells into the flanks of immunodeficient mice at each site and 7 of 8 transplanted sites developed into tumors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, only 3 tumors shown here). All collected tumors showed expression of human albumin by immunohistochemical staining, suggesting that these tumors had originated from transplanted cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Both sporadic clustered cells in certain areas as well as scattered individual cells showed intense staining for DCLK1, &#x003b1;-fetoprotein (AFP) and S100A9.

Western blot analysis suggests that the majority of tumors had higher DCLK1 levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, lanes 3-8) than transplanted Huh7 cells (lane 1).

Huh7 and FCA4 cell lines expressing RFP or RFP-DCLK1 isolated by FACS and cultured in regular media were subjected to Western blot analysis. Total lysates of RFP-DCLK1-expressing Huh7 cells (Huh7-RD) showed higher S100A9 protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, lane 3) compared to corresponding controls (lanes 1, 2).

In FCA4 cells, HCV replicons alone caused a modest increase in S100A9 but not S100A8 (lane 4). Relatively higher expression of S100A9 was also seen in the FCA4-RD line (lane 6). To confirm if S100A9 expression was regulated by DCLK1, we prepared FCA4-RD cells expressing scrambled shRNA (shSCR305) or two shRNAs designed to target DCLK1 (shDCLK1) mRNAs. In a preliminary experiment, we found that only shDCLK1-292 but not shDCLK1291 was effective in knocking down DCLK1 expression within 48-72 hours of induction (not shown). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, ShDCLK1-292 but not scrambled shRNA, reduced RFP-DCLK1 expression in live cells.

Thus, targeting DCLK1 alone should diminish migratory abilities of FCA4-RD cells. To examine this possibility, FCA4-RD cells expressing scrambled shRNA (shSCR305) or anti-DCLK1 shRNA (shRNA-292) were subjected to the wound-healing assay and compared to the extent of wound closure with the parent FCA4-RD cells (control). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, the rate of wound closure was much slower (4 times less at 24 hr) in the cells expressing shRNA-292 than the controls (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Both shSCR305 and untreated control exhibited similar wound healing patterns. It is known that the wound healing process begins when the cells polarize toward the wound, initiate protrusion, migrate and close the wound area. These and other results (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) provide proof-of-concept data that the DCLK1 knockdown is possible in the DCLK1-overexpressing hepatoma cells and such treatment will eventually halt migratory abilities of the tumor cells. The migratory ability of FCA4-RD cells were compared with that of the parent Huh7 and FCA4 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). The results clearly show that migration of FCA4 (~75%) is higher than parental Huh7 cell line (~55%) but less than FCA4-RD (HCV<sup>+</sup>DCLK1<sup>+</sup>) cells (~100%) within 48 hr (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>DCLK1 knockdown results in inhibition of FCA4-RD cell migration</title><p><bold>A.</bold> Representative images of wound healing assay at 0, 24 and 48 hr after the induction of scrambled shSCR305 or anti-DCLK1 shDCLK1-292.

However, it is expressed above the baseline in non-HCV cases such as NASH and in chronic hepatitis B (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) suggesting that DCLK1 can also be induced by other factors. Because DCLK1 is considered as a CSC marker, we cultured DCLK1-negative normal human hepatocytes (NHHs) preparations [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] in Matrigel that is known to contain a number of growth factors and supports growths of stem-like cells. The resulting spheroids were analyzed after 4 weeks for expression of DCLK1 and hepatic markers.

A number of cells in the spheroids were negative for these markers but a few cells were positive for human albumin (not shown).

Because the onset of cirrhosis and HCC occurs during chronic HCV infection, an increase in DCLK1 is not observed in an acute infection model. For this reason, we used a well-characterized FCA4 cell line that represents heterogeneous hepatoma cell populations and supports persistent replication of the HCV RNAs. This cell line and cells derived from it partially mimic intracellular changes that might occur during chronic infection. Thus the observed effects in these cells are primarily attributable to intracellular changes in response to chronic viral replication. The findings from these cell lines were corroborated using biopsies from livers of patients with HCV and HBV infections, normal human hepatocytes-derived spheroids, and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies in murine xenografts. During transcriptome analysis, we observed that DCLK1 overexpression results in significant increase in S100A9 mRNA level (18.29&#x000b1;0.0002, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), which was validated by Western blot. Because chronic inflammation associated with HCV infection is considered a major contributor to cirrhosis and the development of HCC, the transcriptome data provided legitimate basis to investigate the relationship between DCLK1 and S100A9 in the context of HCV infection.</p><p>Our studies show control of DCLK1 over S100A9 expression. The S100A9 protein forms physiologically relevant S100A8/A9 heterodimer (MRP8/14 or calprotectin) and multimer complexes [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], activates NF&#x003ba;B, and increases phosphorylation of MAP kinases [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Elevated levels of S100A8/A9 heterodimers have been reported in inflammatory diseases, cancers, and autoimmunity [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It is also a secretory protein and interacts with the cell surface toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). During validation of the transcriptome data (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>), we noticed that S100A9 in FCA4-RD lysates was only modestly higher (lane 4) than its corresponding control (lane 3). It will be prudent to study in future if this is due to S100A9 secretion by FCA4-RD cells into the media. The S100A9-TLR4 interaction can facilitate multiple downstream signaling processes including NF&#x003ba;B activation. We noticed that a large number of stromal cells and hepatocyte-like cells within the regenerative nodules exhibit extensive expression of DCLK1 and membrane bound S100A9. Such responses likely stimulate additional transcription of S100A9, S100A8/A9 multimerization, and polymerization of microtubules that induce cellular migration [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In addition, clinical trials with the S100A9 inhibitor, tasquinimod (TasQ), that disrupts S100A9-TLR4 interactions has shown limited efficacy against castrate-resistant prostate cancer [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. During Western blot assays, we observed both monomers (14 kDa) and multimers (~49 kDa) of S100A9 protein bands were significantly reduced following DCLK1 knockdown by siRNAs. Because DCLK1 directly controls S100A9 expression, our studies suggest that a combination of an anti-DCLK1 drug with TasQ would be a more rational treatment approach for these tumors.</p><p>Another consequence of DCLK1 overexpression may relate to the maturation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and reorganization of cytoskeletons DCLK1-S100A9-microtubule modules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). MDSCs are heterogeneous group of activated myeloid progenitor and immature myeloid cells (IMCs). IMCs rapidly differentiate into mature myeloid cells under normal physiological conditions. However, colony stimulating cytokines, VEGF, S100A8/A9, and NF&#x003ba;B promote accumulation and activation of MDSC [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. These cells suppress the adaptive immune response against tumors by blocking the functions of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Thus, DCLK1 may exert influence on immune suppression, tumor microenvironment, and tumor-stromal interactions by modulating S100A9 and NF&#x003ba;B activities.</p><fig id="F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Schematic presentation of DCLK1 signaling and two distinct feed-forward-like regulations during HCV-induced hepatocarcinogenesis</title><p>DCLK1 induced by HCV or other factors (e.g. growth factors, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) is likely to affect downstream multiple pathways such as inflammation, microtubule cytoskeleton reorganization, immunosuppression and oncogenic stimulus via c-Myc. The studies presented here were primarily focused on the inflammatory cascades. Additional studies will be needed to delineate how cellular migration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) occurs via DCLK1-S100A9-induced cytoskeleton reorganization and secretion of S100A9 external microenvironments of the infected hepatocytes.

The potential mechanism(s) by which chronic HCV infection predisposes patients to type II mixed cryoglobulinemia and premalignant/malignant B-cell lymphoproliferations are poorly understood. We demonstrated that portal inflammation with dense lymphoid aggregates in HCV patients are positive for DCLK1 and enriched in CD20<sup>+</sup> B cells. CD20 is expressed on the cell surface of all B cells except early pro-B lymphocytes and plasma cells. Analysis of HCV lymphotropism suggests that CD20<sup>+</sup> cells are the major lymphocyte repertoire that supports HCV replication [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The activation of proinflammatory-tumorigenic stimuli via a DCLK1 pathway may collectively explain the association of chronic HCV infection with mixed cryoglobulinemia and B cell malignancies (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><p>The HCC also occurs in patients who are not infected with HCV or HBV. DCLK1 expression is extremely low in normal human liver parenchyma (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>), and in normal cultured hepatocytes on collagen I-coated culture plates [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In contrast, hepatocytes that are cultured as spheroids in Matrigel exhibit perinuclear DCLK1 expression in most cells. Matrigel provides at least many growth factors (e.g. TGF-&#x003b2;, EGF, IGF, and FGF) and abundant extracellular matrix (ECM). Under these conditions, we observed hyperplasticity and transforming potential of normal adult hepatocytes, which explains liver diseases in metabolic disorders that are independent of viral infection. (e.g. NASH). Secondly, our results highlight functional heterogeneity of the spheroids. Upon stimulation with human serum, spheroids differentiated into multiple cell-lineages, including neuron-like cells, with a few growing into larger undifferentiated spheroids. Lineage-tracing experiments should help confirm whether CK19<sup>+</sup>, DCLK1<sup>+</sup>, AFP<sup>+</sup>, AFP<sup>+</sup>CK19<sup>+</sup> cells in these spheroids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>) are directly derived from DCLK1<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes.</p><p>Among differentially expressed genes, BRM (SMARCA2) showed a direct correlation with enhanced expression of DCLK1, c-Myc and S100A9 in FCA4-RD cells as well as in the liver of HBV- and HCV-positive patients. BRM and BRG1 (SMARCA4) are paralogs and only one of these proteins is incorporated into the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex as ATPase subunit [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In cancer cells, BRG1 is downregulated or inactivated due to mutations [<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. As a result, the nonessential BRM is incorporated into the SWI/SNF complexes causing altered SWI/SNF functions that promote tumor development. It has been shown that BRM null/BRG1-positive mice lack the CSC marker CD44 expression [<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. These observations indicate a possible role of DCLK1 in the regulation of CD44 via BRM.</p><p>We observed during our studies that Huh7 cells-derived tumor growth can be inhibited in a murine model by administering Poly Lactic-co-Glycolic Acid (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated anti-DCLK1 siRNAs inhibited (communicated elsewhere). In addition, we have also presented evidence that DCLK1 overexpression alters expression of an array of genes, which are involved in inflammation and tumor growth (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).

The protein expression levels for selected genes were validated using Western blot.</p></sec><sec id="s4_8"><title>Generation of lentiviruses and inducible-shRNA expression system</title><p>The DCLK1-targeting shRNAs were generated as described previously [<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Sense and anti-sense oligos (IDT) were annealed and ligated into Bspm1 cut pEN_TTRmiRc2 (Addgene; Cambridge, MA) to generate pEN_TTR miRshDCLK1. Then pEN_TTR miRshDCLK1 and pSLIK Hygro (Addgene; Cambridge, MA) were <italic>in vitro</italic> recombined using Gateway LR Clonase II (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) to create pSLIK TTR miRshDCLK1-hygro. Lentiviruses were prepared by the PEI transfection of HEK293T cells plated on poly-L-lysine (Sigma; St. Louis, MO) coated plates with 10 &#x003bc;g transfer vector, 2.5 &#x003bc;g pMD2.G, 2.5 &#x003bc;g pMDL/RRE g/p, 2.5 &#x003bc;g pRSV-REV per 10cm plate. Cell supernatant was collected 48 h and 72 h post-transfection, filtered with a 0.45 micron MES filter, and precipitated using polyethylene glycol. Virus was resuspended in DMEM and added to cells in the presence of 8 &#x003bc;g/ml of polybrene (Sigma; St. Louis, MO) overnight. The shRNAs were induced for expression by adding doxycycline (1 &#x003bc;g/ml media). For wound-healing assay, the FCA4-RD cells (10,000) were seeded in the wells of 12-well plates to ~90% confluency and wounds were scratched using a sterile pipette tip 3&#x02013;6 h post seeding. The same spots were photographed under phase contrast microscopy at various time points to monitor cell migration/proliferation. The experiment was repeated three times and quantitative analysis was carried out for the extent of wound healing at various time points.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURES AND TABLES</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="oncotarget-06-20327-s001.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1076" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are thankful to the Liver Tissue Cell Distribution System, (Minneapolis, Minnesota) which is funded by NIH Contract # HSN276201200017C for providing liver tissues.
