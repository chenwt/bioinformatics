This is partly due to the realization that traditional approaches focusing only on a few molecules at a time cannot describe the impact of aberrant or modulated molecular environments across a whole system. Furthermore, a hypothesis-driven study aims to prove or disprove its postulations, whereas a hypothesis-free systems approach can yield an unbiased and novel testable hypothesis as an end-result. This latter approach foregoes assumptions which predict how a biological system should react to an altered microenvironment within a cellular context, across a tissue or impacting on distant organs. Additionally, re-use of existing data by systematic data mining and re-stratification, one of the cornerstones of integrative systems biology, is also gaining attention. While tremendous efforts using a systems methodology have already yielded excellent results, it is apparent that a lack of suitable analytic tools and purpose-built databases poses a major bottleneck in applying a systematic workflow. This review addresses the current approaches used in systems analysis and obstacles often encountered in large-scale data analysis and integration which tend to go unnoticed, but have a direct impact on the final outcome of a systems approach. Its wide applicability, ranging from basic research, disease descriptors, pharmacological studies, to personalized medicine, makes this emerging approach well suited to address biological and medical questions where conventional methods are not ideal.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Systems biology</kwd><kwd>Data integration</kwd><kwd>Pathway mapping</kwd><kwd>Computational biology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>In 1958 Francis Crick first discussed the central dogma of molecular biology: that information is transferred sequentially in one direction from nucleic acid to protein and cannot move in the opposite direction, which is often summarized by the phrase &#x0201c;DNA makes RNA makes protein&#x0201d; <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. While the central dogma is still a core part of our understanding of the molecular machinery that facilitates life, the picture is of course now much more complex (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>), as has been previously discussed <xref rid="bb0010 bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[2,3]</xref>.</p><p>We now know that in addition to the genetic information stored as the code in the form of the four bases guanine, thymine, adenine and cytosine, there is also information carried in by the modification of these bases, e.g. methylation or hydroxymethylation of cytosine. Another type of epigenetic (above genetic) modification is to the histones, the proteins which bind to DNA to form chromatin. These epigenetic changes can act in concert <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and they contribute to changes in levels of gene expression <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and can direct which parts of the genetic code form a resulting mature transcript via alternative promoter selection and alternative splicing <xref rid="bb0030 bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[6,7]</xref>. While epigenetic changes are mostly erased during gametogenesis, they have been shown in some cases to persist through generations <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Similarly RNA transcripts may undergo base modifications although these are much less extensively studied <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. While most transcripts are protein-coding as suggested by the summarization of the central dogma quoted above, many are non-coding. One class of transcripts called microRNAs serve to downregulate gene expression by cleaving their specific target mRNA sequences. Some of these miRNAs seem to target thousands of specific RNAs and are extremely highly conserved across eukaryotes <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. As transcripts can undergo alternative splicing one gene may encode a large number of proteins by the removal of exons from pre-mRNA <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The protein products of these transcripts also undergo post-translational modifications before forming a mature protein product <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, so that along with splice variants and alternative start sites, one multi-exon gene has the potential to form of a vast array of proteins. Proteins of course interact with each other and with metabolites, but also assist in various nucleic acid related processes such as transcription <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and miRNA-directed downregulation <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Molecular biology has undoubtedly been transformed by large-scale sequencing initiatives such as the human genome project (HGP), as evidenced by the techniques and tools which have arisen from it. &#x02018;Completed&#x02019; genome sequences allowed the development of genome-wide DNA microarrays which soon showed how different tissues in a complex organism may have very diverse patterns of gene expression&#x000a0;<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The &#x02018;next generation&#x02019; and &#x02018;third generation&#x02019; sequencing machines, whose production was no doubt encouraged by the HGP have allowed for the categorization of the microbiome &#x02014; the collective genomes of the community of microorganisms of a particular environment. In humans this microbiotic community (or microbiota) is vast, diverse between individuals, can provide metabolic function and is implicated in various disease states &#x02014; it is sometimes discussed as an organ itself <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Pleiotropy is the term used to describe how one gene (or rather its products) can affect several traits. This often occurs through one molecular cause having a physiological consequence with related physiological consequences or due to the gene being involved in multiple pathways with different physiological outcomes. In some cases the product of the gene may have multiple molecular functions <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and it has been suggested that alternative splicing may contribute to pleiotropy in some cases&#x000a0;<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Genes may even act as an activator and a repressor of the same process due to alternative splicing <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>An insight from one gene expression study which investigated several individual tissues of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> showed that many genes which had known functions in one tissue were also highly expressed in unexpected tissues <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. This suggests that many genes whose function is thought to be well understood may have alternative functions in different environments and/or are helping contribute to completely distinct physiological states.</p><p>The biophysical microenvironment in the form of changes of the micro-topographic cell characteristics can induce modifications at an epigenetic level, promoting changes on the patterns of histone acetylation and methylation therefore modifying cell reprogramming efficiency <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Other biophysical constraints such as cell-to-cell contact, stiffness, surface tension, and magnetic field are also involved in the interaction with molecular networks with the last being governed by non-linear dynamics <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>The field of bioinformatics is broad, but is perhaps best described by the large biological datasets which must be manipulated via computation and tested with robust statistics. The key challenges of bioinformatics are those of data storage and algorithm development and the goal is usually a description of that individual dataset, possibly by statistics alone or by also integrating annotations in an automatic manner and interpreting the enrichment of these.</p><p>Systems biology is sometimes misunderstood as a new word for bioinformatics. While it is true that there is a certain amount of intersection between the fields, a systems biologist seeks to use bioinformatics tools, data, and databases in conjunction with clinical data and information from the literature, in order to describe as much of a system as possible or as is appropriate to the task. The addition of clinical and laboratory measurements means that systems biology need not be entirely reductionist, or at least that some additional higher scale measurements may act as a surrogate for missing low-level data. A systems approach may also make use of complex mathematical models to simulate the system or determine putative associations.</p><p>Due to the diverse range of data types and analysis methods, a systems biologist should work in collaboration with clinical scientists, lab scientists and possibly (bio)informaticians and (bio)statisticians depending on the requirements of the task and the skill set of the individual. A systems biologist may work in a team including a bioinformatician, in which case it is not necessary to do the omics data pre-processing, but should at least have a conceptual understanding of where the data has come from, including the power, limitations and possible biases involved.</p><p>Another source of confusion may be that systems biology is necessarily about kinetic mathematical models, irrespective of size. While this may be a useful methodology to a systems biologist, this is only one possible aspect and such a modeling effort should relate to a large system or should be used to validate a crucial part of that system; systems biology should aim to describe the complexity of biological systems rather than extremely small abstract sets of reactions.</p><p>The approach is commonly applied to studying normal functions, diseases, prediction of drug effects (on-target and off-target) and comparison of different species. The desired outcome of many of these applications is to establish a mode of action informed from diverse methods describing events on different biological scales, and often to use this model to make informative and useful predictions such as the identification of biomarkers or possible off-target drug effects. There is no one exact procedure to follow to reach this conclusion, as each result could suggest a different approach required, or the iteration of that analysis with a higher or lower stringency. It is, in this sense, directed partly by experience; knowing which analysis is most appropriate for data with particular features. Each step should however be well-founded in evidence and potential sources of bias sought out and accounted for where possible.</p><p>This review seeks to provide an overview of systems biology, introducing important concepts from molecular biology, statistics and bioinformatics. A good grounding in key components of these subjects is important as these fields provide the majority of the data, analysis methods and the biological framework under which systems biology is practiced. Examples of the various applications of systems biology will be described and some of the challenges for future work will be identified.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Data</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Platforms &#x00026; preprocessing</title><p>Systems biology requires large datasets, preferably with a wide genomic scope and unbiased toward particular pathways or processes. Most often the information required to form the basis of an analysis is the transcriptome, proteome or metabolome, as the data itself or fold changes derived from it may be mapped to biological pathways and used to infer systemic differences between groups.</p><p>Microarrays emerged relatively early with respect to other genome-wide technologies and may be used to gather information on a range of molecules and molecular events, but most notably they are used to measure gene expression. They are relatively cheap compared to some other omics methods, and the procedures for processing the data are now mostly well-devised. Manufacturing differs from company to company but the general concept remains the same: a probe or a set of genomically proximate probes is designed to hybridize to a transcript and fluoresce upon hybridization, and the level of fluorescence will inform on the abundance of the target molecule. The probes have genome-wide coverage and are bound to the microarray (or &#x02018;chip&#x02019;) in a 2D array of &#x02018;spots&#x02019; or first bound to microscopic beads which are deposited in a 2D array of wells. Comparisons are only robust between samples within the same probe or probe set, not between probes or probe sets as different binding affinities, genetic variation etc. may exist between the sequences compared and act to obscure true biological variation.</p><p>When using this type of data one should study both the manufacturer's annotation materials and the literature to identify any improvements that might be made to the analysis. For example the Illumina Human Methylation 450 Beadchip has many probes which may truly report SNP differences rather than differential methylation and like many microarrays suffers from cross-hybridization <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. It is also advantageous to either check for the latest version of annotation or create novel annotation using public resources <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. For creating new microarray annotation, protein databases etc. one may require a large scale sequence alignment and clustering software which can handle large amounts of data and run on relatively low-powered machines such as LSCluster <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>Just as some probes can annotate several genes, some genes are detected by several probes; it is a many-to-many (m&#x02013;n) relationship that exists between probe sets and genes. Often it is the case that different probe sets for the same genes are highly correlated and where they are not, it suggests that either an un-annotated cross-hybridization or alternative splicing is occurring.</p><p>RNA-seq is an emerging alternative method for estimating gene expression by sequencing cDNA and aligning it to a reference genome. RNA-seq is a more powerful technology in that it can detect genetic variation and levels of different splice variants. Microarrays are however cheaper and simpler to analyze and it has been suggested that the two technologies should be used together to gather the broadest transcriptome coverage <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>While any large dataset may be useful, those of most interest are the final functional products, i.e. proteins and metabolites. Mass spectrometry (MS) is most often the tool to collect this data on a large scale. It is used in combination with a method to separate the components of a sample prior to MS such as liquid chromatography, gas chromatography or capillary electrophoresis. MS itself involves ionizing these molecules, fragmenting them and measuring their mass/charge ratios. These peaks then allow the identification of the molecule relating to each profile of mass/charge peaks. Different types of separation and different MS equipment have different strengths and limitations. For example different separation techniques will be more/less suitable for differently sized or charged molecules and offer a different degree of chromatographic resolution <xref rid="bb0135 bb0140" ref-type="bibr">[27,28]</xref>.</p><p>Deviations in quantified MS peak intensities may arise from technical variations and result in unreliable run-to-run reproducibility. The normalization of peak intensity across all samples of a proteomics or metabolomics dataset is therefore an important step in preprocessing <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. As the normalization affects downstream analysis it is crucial to select an appropriate method and crucial that normalization factors are independent from biological factors <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Out of the many possible normalization methods proposed for MS data Total Ion Count (TIC) is emerging as a gold standard. Total Ion Count simply acts to scale each spectrum such that the total area under the curve is equal <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. After preprocessing the peaks must then be associated to proteins/metabolites.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Databases and identifiers</title><p>One of the initial challenges of working with large datasets &#x02013; especially proteomics and metabolomics datasets &#x02013; is the association between useful identifiers and the data itself. Many different sets of IDs exist for both, and some have become defunct over time as support for a database is dropped. While some issues such as this may be unavoidable, both database curators and users should adhere to good general practices to minimize other problems. For example, when an ID is assigned to a molecule, it should be permanently associated to it. If the molecule is deemed to be a contamination, unusual fusion protein or spurious reading then, rather than the entry being removed entirely, it should remain in the database, but marked as spurious and possibly set as being unsearchable. This way a molecule may not be removed then later returned to a database under a different ID. Conversely one ID will never be attributed to two different molecules.</p><p>Using gene symbols as IDs is not recommended as they can be duplicated and are prone to change. One recent example is CDH1, which is the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO)-designated gene name for Cadherin-1, however CDH1 is also used throughout the literature as a gene name for CDC20-like protein 1 or Fizzy-related protein homolog FZR1. Any semi- or fully-automated data extraction from the published literature may therefore inadvertently attribute molecular properties to the wrong entry. Furthermore, in some species gene symbols may contain Greek characters which are often not correctly read by various tools (e.g. &#x0201c;&#x003b1;Try&#x0201d; in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>). Despite this many tools only accept these IDs (sometimes with Greek letters converted to roman words, i.e. &#x0201c;alphaTry&#x0201d;), and therefore it is often necessary to convert between types of IDs. While some conversion tools are available these issues cannot properly be addressed without a concerted effort between researchers, organizations and publishers.</p><p>If possible IDs should be constrained to the 36 (English) alphanumerical possibilities, which even with a modest ID length would allow for an adequate number of possibilities. Even with only 4 characters of this set there would be 1,679,616 resulting IDs. Whatever length of ID selected length should be retained, e.g. &#x02018;0001&#x02019; rather than &#x02018;1&#x02019;, to avoid errors of truncation. Finally if other characters (e.g. Greek) are used in order to represent common IDs in one part of a database, the rest of the database and its associated interfaces and the user workflow proceeding from it should be made fully unicode-compatible. Care should also be taken not to use IDs from restricted-access commercial databases in publications.</p><p>The main resource for sequence data including RNAseq is the Sequence Read Archive &#x02014; a public database of NGS data <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The International Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) is a collaboration between the European Bioinformatics Institute, National Center for Biotechnology Information and the DNA Data Bank of Japan who provide access to SRA, both through their own graphical user interfaces and via programmatic routes.</p><p>The Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) is a comprehensive database of protein structures and annotations. It is divided into four main components: UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB), UniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef), UniProt Archive (UniParc), and UniProt Metagenomic and Environmental Sequences (UniMES) <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. UniProtKB is divided into two sections. UniProt/TrEMBL stores translations of the sequences found in EMBL-Bank/GenBank/DDBJ, many of which are derived from SRA. While the sharing of information between large bioinformatics databases adds to the power of these databases, it can also lead to the reproduction of errors if sufficient curation is not implemented. Many UniProt/TrEMBL entries share identical sequences, and naming errors (e.g. &#x0201c;HLQ-DQB1&#x0201d; as opposed to &#x0201c;HLA-DQB1&#x0201d;) may occur throughout several resources. UniProt/Swiss-Prot is intended to contain one entry per gene and is the gold standard in protein sequence referencing and the assembly of pertinent molecular functions.</p><p>The Human Metabolome Database describes small molecule metabolites in humans. It contains over 40,000 metabolites and links three types of data: chemical, clinical, and molecular biology/biochemistry <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Several similar databases exist for other species. KEGG Pathway is a large, well-curated database with zoomable maps which show large sections of the metabolisms of various species <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. MetaCyc is a similar database containing fewer compounds but a greater number of pathways and reactions, and with more extensive pathway descriptions <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Pathway Commons uses data from open-access databases to link out to a software called Cytoscape <xref rid="bb0185 bb0190" ref-type="bibr">[37,38]</xref>.</p><p>While the large datasets used for systems biology are often generated from samples gathered specifically for the study, public datasets may also be used either in conjunction with a new dataset or as the main dataset(s) for the analyses themselves. NCBI's GEO <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and EBI's ArrayExpress <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> are the main databases for array-based data, however other data types are also now included in GEO such as mass spectrometry data. Array-based and sequencing-based data in GEO and ArrayExpress must adhere to "minimum information about a microarray experiment" (MIAME) or &#x0201c;minimum information about sequencing experiments&#x0201d; (MINSEQE) respectively <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><label>2.3</label><title>Public datasets</title><p>There is currently much less support for sharing of proteomics and metabolomics datasets despite the growing need, and relatively few public datasets available. The Proteomics Identification Database (PRIDE) contains over 25,000 proteomics experiments <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Metabolights is a repository hosted by EBI and launched in 2012, which currently houses 39 experiments <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Standards for reporting proteomics and metabolomics experiments are coordinated by Human Proteome Organisation's Proteomics Standards Initiative (HUPO-PSI), and Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI) respectively.</p><p>While standards such as MIAME exist to ensure a certain amount of information is uploaded along with the data in public databases, some useful sample info e.g. on biological confounders or potential batch effects may be missing, or only initially gathered for some datasets. Additionally if one makes use of several different datasets the batch effects of using different cohorts should be taken into account, even if all potential biological confounders are accounted for and the same technology was used to gather the information.</p><p>Another issue with public databases of this type which are storing human data is that there is no consensus on whether consent for the uploading of the data is implicit, or whether additional consent should be sought. A survey showed that patients felt that it was very (69%) or somewhat (21%) important to be asked for additional consent <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. This is clearly a cause for some ethical concern and in future foresight should be applied in writing ethical consent statements regarding omics data open access.</p><p>In some cases rather than searching for experimental data relating to a specific disease one may simply wish to know about the normal expression across different tissues of an organism. This can help identify possible sources of cross-talk, or help to study normal function or to compare systems in multiple species. BioGPS and EBI's Gene Expression Atlas offer similar services in this area, including graphical output for each gene, and useful related links <xref rid="bb0220 bb0225" ref-type="bibr">[44,45]</xref>.</p><p>Meta-analysis of multiple public datasets can be extremely powerful. For example public gene expression data from GEO was used to determine the minimum number of genes required to impute the remainder of the human genome. Genometry found that only 1000 &#x02018;landmark&#x02019; genes were required to estimate the remaining genome expression, expanding on previous work in this area <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, and have generated a microarray to assay only these genes so that costs are reduced and an increased number of samples may be studied. The source of the data must be scrutinized however, as it can cause a bias in downstream analysis &#x02014; i.e. if 50% of the data in GEO were to correspond to cancer experiments then a bias would exist in the selection of the 1000 genes.</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>2.4</label><title>Pathways and annotation</title><p>In addition to databases containing experimental data, annotation databases may also be extremely useful. Broadly speaking this data comes from two original sources &#x02014; experimental data itself held in a public repository or reported in scientific literature, and predictions based on sequence alignments, structural similarities or expression profiles. One of the most common annotations in molecular biology is gene ontology (GO) <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. There are three broad categories of these: biological process, cellular component, and molecular function &#x02014; each term is part of a greater hierarchy with these divisions at the top.</p><p>Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) is a database of human genes and genetic phenotypes. The NCBI Taxonomy Database was developed in consultation with the INSDC <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Almost 280,000 species have been described by Taxonomy representing an estimated 10% of the described species of life on the planet. GeneCards is a very useful source of summary information collecting data from many different popular resources <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>.</p><p>Reactome supports pathway enrichment analyses on that basis. WikiPathways is a pathway database with an open and collaborative ethos <xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. PathVisio is a tool which is used to view and edit pathways from WikiPathways and its website provides helpful user tutorials <xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.

The following is far from a comprehensive list of methods or the tools that implement them but serves as an overview (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref> shows these methods ordered into a workflow). &#x02018;R&#x02019; is a scripting language and environment primarily developed for statistical computing. It is particularly useful in bioinformatics and systems biology because of the number of relevant packages available, largely through the open source Bioconductor project, which contains hundreds of packages alone <xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>.</p><p>R has a diverse range of uses, from preprocessing, to statistical testing and on to downstream analysis, and in particular it has great utility in microarray processing, although many of the packages initially developed for microarray analysis have since been applied to proteomics and metabolomics. Many graphical user interface (GUI) alternatives exist, however often what is gained in speed and simplicity is lost in flexibility and power, and many of these GUI applications such as Partek, SPSS and IPA are commercial.</p><p>Affymetrix microarray probe sets are dispersed randomly across their chips so that if a spatial effect does occur it is unlikely to greatly affect the final probe set value. Illumina seeks to further reduce spatial effects by randomly assigning the well used for each probe on each individual chip. While this could be of utility, if the file describing the coordinates of the probes is not extracted at the time of scanning then the locations of the beads are lost and spatial examination cannot later be investigated.

The order of the naming of the components is determined by ranking the list based on the amount of variance described by each, i.e. PC2 captures the second most variance.

Bonferroni correction is direct and intuitive and simply involves multiplying each p-value by the number of tests done.

Large datasets may also be used to infer novel relationships by Bayesian inference models. These are used to calculate the probability that a relationship exists between two molecules based upon the observation, or generally-speaking they test a hypothesis based on priors. The key challenges to this approach are having enough power (data) to infer the number of possible interactions and another is the lack of standards for accepting or rejecting relationships, however the ability to recreate a well-accepted interaction can at least be used to benchmark different methods <xref rid="bb0375" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s0055"><label>3.4</label><title>Mathematical modeling</title><p>Kinetic models are useful for mathematically modeling/simulating the dynamics of a system in silico, and may be constructed using the SimBiology package for MatLab. Broadly-speaking there are two classes of these types of models: deterministic and stochastic. Deterministic models predict an average outcome; they do not take stochastic fluctuations into account. Deterministic approaches are therefore more appropriate for systems with large numbers of molecules, where small fluctuations have negligible impact. Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) involve functions of one independent variable and derivatives of the functions with respect to it. These are used to model dynamics over time only. Partial differential equations (PDEs) can be used instead to model dynamics over several independent variables i.e. multiple spatial axes as well as time.</p><p>Exact stochastic approaches such as the Gillespie algorithm can be useful, especially for modeling reactions with a small amount of molecules where small fluctuations can have a large impact on the system <xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. With this approach distributions are used rather than averages, and each reaction is explicitly modeled instead of the average approach used in deterministic modeling. In order to create accurate models of large networks it may be best to utilize both approaches &#x02014; deterministic for large populations and stochastic for lowly-populated important reactions. One of the biggest challenges for all kinetic modeling is to accurately obtain or estimate the reaction constants and other parameters as required. Another stochastic modeling approach outside of kinetic modeling is agent-based modeling (ABM). ABM was initially developed for social sciences but has since been applied to several fields of biology. The &#x02018;agents&#x02019; of ABM are autonomous decision-makers which can be used to represent biomolecules such as proteins or metabolites or, on a larger scale, cells. The rules governing the system are found on the agent level &#x02014; each class of agent has certain rules which all instances of the agent follow (e.g. all instances of ATP follow the same set of rules). ABMs can account for time and three-dimensional space and although the rules are assigned on the agent-level, those actions can describe emergent properties on a larger scale. Few examples of applying ABM to molecular modeling exist in the literature to date &#x02014; one example is the ABM of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway <xref rid="bb0385" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>.</p><p>Constraint-based models are able to address the issues of long computational time with respect to large networks and lack of genome-wide reaction rates normally found with kinetic models. Rather than seeking one immediate solution they start by restraining all possibilities down to a biologically relevant solution space, by the addition of various types of constraints. For example enzymatic capacity and thermodynamic restraints place an upper bound on the flux for a reaction. The greater challenges of this approach are generating the constraints to apply, and developing methods to probe the solution space for interesting phenotypes. Omics data may be used alongside these models <xref rid="bb0390" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref> or can be integrated into them as constraints to introduce the context of that state <xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>.

Ranging from the description of simple to more complex processes, from isolated enzymatic reactions or temporal processes within metabolic networks to patterns of gene expression and regulation. Nonetheless, it is not conceivable to predict the behavior of complex or even simple systems with enough precision and accuracy based only on empirical data. Thus, the major advantage of modeling relies on the use of computational power within a set of predefined axioms to simulate a particular environment, as e.g. knockout of one or a group of system components and then predict the network outcome. Another benefit is that the algorithms of computer programs can be reused on several systems.

While other small molecules comprising dimebon, piracetam, and simvastatin target A&#x003b2;, mitochondrial membranes, and anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2) respectively, they have been identified to be effective in the symptomatic treatment of AD <xref rid="bb0565 bb0570" ref-type="bibr">[112,113]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s0115"><label>4.10</label><title>Systems biology approach toward AD biomarker and drug discovery</title><p>Several studies aiming for the identification of disease biomarkers have failed to prove their specificity and sensitivity, because in majority, they were unable to distinguish between the true biological signals from all the noise. Then the use of a systems approach could provide a set of tools from statistical, computational and biological areas that could amplify the signal and therefore allow and ameliorate mapping of the involved biological networks.</p><p>We above presented the state of art of AD with several independent studies ranging from genetic determinants to disease traits. Next, we will present studies that merged and integrated data through systems biology approaches in order to yield biological meaning of all de novo generated information.</p><p>The integration of genomic data through a network approach has been used to highlight cellular pathways underlying clinical traits and ultimately to pinpoint genes that are probable key regulators in biological processes <xref rid="bb0575" ref-type="bibr">[114]</xref>. An example of this type of approach was the identification of molecular interactions that are disrupted in patients with late AD onset, where the authors <xref rid="bb0580" ref-type="bibr">[115]</xref> built co-expression networks based on gene expression and genotyping data from postmortem brain tissues of hundreds of patients and healthy individuals. They identified several modules of distinct functional categories and cellular specificity. After, they applied an integrative network analysis to first reorganize by rank the most relevant modules of late-onset AD and then identify by Bayesian inference the main causal gene regulators of these altered networks. As a result, they acknowledged the TYROBP as a key driver of the immune/microglia module that was found reconfigured in the disease state, highlighting the benefit of the use of network analysis to better identify and prioritize pathways and gene targets involved in complex diseases. Similarly, Miller et al. <xref rid="bb0585" ref-type="bibr">[116]</xref> reported that microglial activation occurs early in AD progression, where they also identified the TYROBP as the main hub of the microglia module via weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Furthermore, they assessed two brain areas CA1 and CA3 in the disease context, through microarray gene expression and found that the hippocampal region CA3 has genes associated with disease protection: ABCA1, MT1H, PDK4 and RHOBTB3, and the genes FAM13A1, LINGO2 and UNC13C with disease vulnerability <xref rid="bb0585" ref-type="bibr">[116]</xref>, thus, reinforcing the in silico finding of microglia activation occurring early during AD progression and also their association with NFT formation in addition to amyloid deposition <xref rid="bb0585" ref-type="bibr">[116]</xref>.</p><p>Epidemiological screen studies of human populations have identified novel associations between specific metabolites and disease traits <xref rid="bb0460 bb0590" ref-type="bibr">[92,117]</xref>. Sertbas et al. <xref rid="bb0590" ref-type="bibr">[117]</xref> developed a stoichiometric model of brain metabolism, covering several cellular pathways and molecular interactions in astrocytes and neurons. Then, they applied the developed framework to analyze transcriptional modifications associated with six neurodegenerative diseases, including AD and identified the fatty acid synthesis, and phosphatidylcholine and inositol metabolism that have been associated with AD and CDP-diacylglycerol biosynthesis as a pathway that could allow the distinction of AD from other neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p>In order to fulfill the need of curated data of AD to build enhanced AD pathway maps, the &#x0201c;AlzPathway&#x0201d; was developed <xref rid="bb0595" ref-type="bibr">[118]</xref>. It handles a comprehensive map of signaling pathways linked with AD <xref rid="bb0600" ref-type="bibr">[119]</xref> and could therefore be a major contribution toward the implementation of novel pipelines for AD drug discovery <xref rid="bb0605" ref-type="bibr">[120]</xref>.</p><p>A proper phenotype-based diagnostic within ND diseases is challenging, because of the overlap of several clinical conditions among the different types of ND diseases. Thus, obtaining well-characterized cohort samples either for biomarker discovery or for performing clinical trials for drug development and implementation is a task that needs to be overcome. However, with the advent of new high-throughput technologies, we can be closer to the discovery of numerous novel biomarker candidates for each ND disease subtype <xref rid="bb0460" ref-type="bibr">[92]</xref>. Moreover, all de novo generated data should be integrated, in order to provide the whole picture of the disease, than single research studies are able to provide <xref rid="bb0610" ref-type="bibr">[121]</xref>. Therefore, for a proper evaluation of progression in complex diseases we should apply systems biology approaches that will enable us to look into the biology inside of the &#x0201c;black box&#x0201d; <xref rid="bb0615" ref-type="bibr">[122]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0120"><label>5</label><title>Summary and outlook</title><p>Preprocessing methods for omics data are for the most part well defined, however the identifiers to which the data are assigned are often erroneous or missing which can negatively affect downstream analysis. Greater efforts into database curation must be taken and tools must select appropriate identifiers for their inputs to mitigate these problems.</p><p>With the ever-reducing cost of omics technologies there is great potential in multi-omics studies. One of the greatest challenges currently is to further study and develop methods of downstream data analysis. Ideally these methods should be flexible to any number of omics sets, and should be trained and tested against well understood systems where possible. One challenge which may be insurmountable for some time is to have one analysis platform which has all the various algorithms available which might be useful to multi-omics analysis rather than coercing and exporting data between disparate analysis platforms.</p><p>To facilitate these multi-omics methods and assist systems biology in general it would be extremely useful to have a database linking all biological molecules through various processes such as transcription, translation, protein&#x02013;protein interactions and so forth, and containing a variety of ID types to map between them. Such a database should contain biomolecules in clusters so that the user could select the level of complexity required. For example two proteins may come from the same gene and may either be splice variants or different protein modifications. These differences may cause great or little difference in function and in downstream analysis output. Therefore the user may wish to summarize (i.e. average) to one value, retain the different sets of information or calculate both the summarization and a ratio of the most common variants.</p><p>In order to better model complex organisms, samples from multiple tissues of the same set of individuals should be studied simultaneously using omics data, which will require the development of novel analysis methods. Acquiring the relevant tissues from humans can of course be difficult however depending on the tissues involved. Comparative systems biology may help identify which organisms may be similar enough in each particular aspect for use as models &#x02014; of course the positive identification of a useful model cannot be totally assured prior to deriving the system itself; however negative identifications can help rule out those organisms which seem extremely unlikely to be helpful.</p><p>It is sometimes suggested that omics technologies and systems biology have failed to deliver many breakthrough enhancements to the treatment of complex disease <xref rid="bb0620" ref-type="bibr">[123]</xref>. In some cases it may be that in fact such diseases are not truly one disease from a systems or reductionist point-of-view, but several with the same or similar phenotypic end-points &#x02014; i.e. with the current terminology they are unknown subtypes of disease. If this is the case then the overlap between the systems is poor and statistical methods which the approach relies on require very large cohorts for identification of these subtypes and subsequent description of each system. Other possibilities are that longitudinal data or samples from different tissues are required.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Crick</surname><given-names>F.H.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>On protein synthesis</article-title><source>Symp Soc Exp Biol</source><volume>12</volume><year>1958</year><fpage>138</fpage><lpage>163</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">13580867</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0010"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Baluska</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Witzany</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>At the dawn of a new revolution in life sciences</article-title><source>World J Biol Chem</source><volume>4</volume><year>2013</year><fpage>13</fpage><lpage>15</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23710294</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0015"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0015"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brenner</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>History of science.
