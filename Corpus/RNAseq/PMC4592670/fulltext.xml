Instead, several gradually acquired mutations or SRs occurring in a&#x000a0;stepwise process are required, mediating incremental tumor development (Knudson, <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">1971</xref>; Stratton <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). However, cancer genomes can evolve in rapid bursts. Recent cancer genomic surveys presented compelling evidence for a process involving massive <italic>de&#x000a0;novo</italic> SR formation in a one-step catastrophic genomic event denoted chromothripsis (<italic>chromo</italic> for chromosome; <italic>thripsis</italic> for shattering into pieces) (Stephens <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Korbel &#x00026; Campbell, <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Chromothripsis can massively rearrange chromosomal arms or even entire chromosomes, leading to reshuffled genomic regions that frequently harbor clusters of deleted segments (Stephens <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Korbel &#x00026; Campbell, <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and occasionally clustered amplifications, in case chromothripsis is followed by double minute chromosome formation (Rausch <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">2012a</xref>). This catastrophic SR process is observed in 2&#x02013;3% of cancers (Stephens <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), linked with poor disease outcome (Kloosterman <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and has been reported to exhibit increased rates in particular cancer types, including bone cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma, and Sonic-hedgehog-subtype medulloblastoma (Stephens <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Rausch <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">2012a</xref>; Kloosterman <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Nones <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Chromothripsis is also observed in the context of congenital disorders (Kloosterman <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Liu <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and can exhibit a curative effect on genetic disease (McDermott <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>Following chromosome shattering mediated by chromothripsis, the resulting fragments are lost or become rejoined into derivative chromosomes, presumably through unfaithful DNA repair (Kloosterman <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Stephens <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Rausch <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">2012a</xref>). Although cellular catastrophes arising during key stages of the cell cycle are suggested as a potential trigger (Stephens <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Korbel &#x00026; Campbell, <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), few studies focused on the mechanistic origins and consequences of chromothripsis, presumably due to the lack of suitable experimental model systems. While genomic analysis of primary tumors or cancer cell lines can provide valuable snapshots long after chromothripsis has taken place (Kloosterman <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Stephens <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Rausch <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">2012a</xref>), their utility for studying the initiating molecular process(es) is more limited.</p><p>In this study, we describe the approach CAST (complex alterations after selection and transformation) for studying chromothripsis and other complex SR formation processes <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic>, a methodology enabling reproducible generation of chromothripsis in a genetically stable cell line.

Flowchart depicting the complex alterations after selection and transformation (CAST) approach. After generating p53-deficient RPE-1 cell lines, these cells are challenged by perturbation. Following single cell sorting and clonal expansion on microtiter plates, surviving clones are subjected to soft agar assay to test for anchorage-independent growth (i.e., transformation) as a strong selective barrier. Transformed, single cell-derived colonies are then expanded and systematically analyzed by WGS to identify copy number alterations and SRs. The flexibility of CAST additionally allows ascertainment of functional consequences, for example, by RNA-Seq or live cell imaging.

Model cell line: We chose the human hTERT RPE-1 (retinal pigment epithelial) cell line as a model system for characterizing <italic>de novo</italic> SR formation. This telomerase immortalized cell line exhibits a genomically stable diploid karyotype. Though not tumor derived, RPE-1 cells can be transformed with elevated levels of &#x003b3;-irradiation leading to gross SR formation detectable by karyotyping. We subjected hTERT RPE-1 (herein termed &#x0201c;RPE-1 wild type&#x0201d;) and previously generated (Riches <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) RPE-1-transformed cell lines to mate-pair sequencing, which revealed the occurrence of several SRs only in the transformed lines (Appendix Fig S1A&#x02013;C). We recently described a link between <italic>TP53</italic> mutations and chromothripsis, implying that abnormal p53 function may be necessary for the induction, or tolerance, of catastrophic SRs (Rausch <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">2012a</xref>). To establish a model amenable to study chromothripsis, we thus used zinc finger nucleases to generate an RPE-1 derivative deficient in p53. We confirmed p53 loss of function in two independent cell lines, C111 and C29 (Figs<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06ev">EV1A</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06ev">C</xref>). Interestingly, C29, but not C111, showed an increase in ploidy measured by both DNA content and chromosome counts from metaphase spreads (Figs<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06ev">EV1D</xref>), which may be&#x000a0;explained with the previously noted tendency toward tetraploidization upon p53 inactivation (Bunz <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>).

Cellular perturbations: For a proof of concept of CAST, we employed sublethal doses of the chemical doxorubicin as a source of DNA double-strand breaks mediated through topoisomerase II inhibition in S phase (Fornari <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b100" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>).

Selection barrier: Complex genomic rearrangements resulting from chromothripsis can lead to the simultaneous acquisition of multiple tumor-promoting lesions (Stephens <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) (<italic>e.g.,</italic> loss of several tumor suppressors). Such lesions promote anchorage-independent cell growth <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic>, a hallmark of transformation and an established <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> indicator of tumorigenicity (Hahn <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). We thus reasoned that such a strong selection barrier could be used to selectively enrich for cells harboring catastrophic SRs.
</p></list-item><list-item><p>
Screening for extensive copy number switches: To design low-pass whole-genome sequencing experiments, we performed simulations to investigate what level of coverage is required to reliably detect large SRs; and we chose to use pooled, barcoded samples (up to 40 in one sequencing lane) to achieve around 0.05&#x02013;0.1&#x000d7; genomic sequencing coverage. When assessing low-pass sequenced genomes, we used the circular binary segmentation algorithm on genomic read-depth data to infer copy number switches. We considered copy number switches of &#x02265;&#x000a0;500&#x000a0;kb when assessing low-pass whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data.

Characterization of chromothripsis events: Whenever appropriate, cell lines were analyzed in-depth by mate-pair sequencing to high physical coverage (i.e., spanning coverage) in order to&#x000a0;enable verification and characterization of chromo-thripsis events.

The cells were released into medium containing 100&#x000a0;ng/ml nocodazole. Since p53 is a mediator of the DNA damage response in G2/M transition, cells with functional p53 are expected to be arrested in G2 due to massively damaged DNA (Bunz <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). When the DNA damage response is lost due to lack of p53 function, cells can enter mitosis where they are trapped with nocodazole. After 24, 48, and 72&#x000a0;h of incubation, cells were collected and stained with phosphohistone H3 antibody, a marker for mitotic cells. Cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry for their DNA and mitotic content. The gating for mitotic cells positive for P-H3 is exemplified in red after 72&#x000a0;h post-doxorubicin.

The cells were released into fresh medium. Since p53 also functions during G1/S transition, cells with functional p53 are expected to be arrest in G1 while the cells lacking p53 function continue cycling. After 24, 48, and 72&#x000a0;h of incubation, cells were pulsed for 1&#x000a0;h with BrdU in order to detect ongoing DNA replication. Cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry for their DNA and S phase content. The gating for mitotic cells positive for BrdU-FITC is exemplified in red after 24&#x000a0;h post-DXR.

Upon DNA damage induction, we sorted between 192 and 480 single cells into microtiter plates after 3&#x000a0;days to ensure that the cells go through at least one division following perturbations. We also ensured isolation of&#x000a0;single cell-derived clones&#x02014;by growing single colonies after cell sorting, and by isolating clones following transformation. Following DNA damage, sorting, and transformation, typically 3&#x02013;16 clones were recovered per experiment, which were then subjected to low-pass WGS. Consistent with prior reports connecting tetraploidy to genomic instability (Fujiwara <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), we identified significantly more copy number switches in low-pass WGS data generated for 36 C29 hyperploid transformants compared to 40 C111 diploid transformants (C29 copy number switches, mean and standard deviation: 41.61&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;17.31; C111 mean and standard deviation: 18.1&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;10.55; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup>; Welch two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test). To exclude the possibility that intrinsic differences between C29 and C111 other than the difference in ploidy were responsible for the increase in copy number alterations, we generated another tetraploid cell line directly from the C111 cell line by preventing cytokinesis (dihydrocytochalasin B).

Subsequently, we employed recently published criteria (Li <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and deductive approaches (Korbel &#x00026; Campbell, <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) for evaluating the occurrence and temporal ordering of clustered SRs and to test for chromothripsis events (details on the underlying reasoning (Korbel &#x00026; Campbell, <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Li <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) are summarized in the Appendix). Applying stringent criteria, we verified the occurrence of chromothripsis in seven hyperploid transformants and additionally confirmed that there is no evidence for chromothripsis events in the diploid transformants. Hence, our analysis indicates an increased rate of chromothripsis events in hyperploids compared to diploids (<italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>&#x0003c;<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>0.05; two-sided Fisher&#x02019;s exact test; Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref> and Appendix Figs S4&#x02013;S9). The tendency of chromothripsis events to occur in hyperploids was further supported by CAST experiments using Zeocin (rather than doxorubicin) as a DNA double-strand break inducing chemical, which revealed 2/12 chromothripsis in C29 hyperploid versus 0/12 chromothripsis in C111 diploid cell line (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07ev">EV2</xref>). For example, chromosome 12 of the RPE-1 cell line BM178, which we derived from doxorubicin treatment of the hyperploid RPE-1 line C29, exhibited the prototypical chromothripsis pattern of oscillating copy numbers (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2A</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">E</xref>, Appendix Fig S4) that numerous studies previously reported in cancer genome surveys (e.g., Kloosterman <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Stephens <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Rausch <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">2012a</xref>; Korbel &#x00026; Campbell, <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Li <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; and references therein).

Evidence for chromothripsis occurring on one single parental haplotype. Based on the haplotype frequencies, and the copy number estimates, we inferred that the majority of the chromosome 8 is present in 2 copies, but possibly due to an early subclonal event, two subclones exhibiting separate haplotype ratios (AA and AAB) exist. The shift in the haplotype ratio and the increase in copy number suggest that the B haplotype underwent several (up to 5) cycles of BFB as well as a chromothripsis event, resulting in amplified segments of as high as 8 copy numbers. The sharp drop close to the chromosome end is associated with a shift to a haplotype ratio of 0, <italic>that is</italic>, complete loss of the B haplotype (in line with the BFB and chromothripsis events occurring on the same haplotype).

Chromosome 8 in this cell line exhibited an amplified region adjacent to a sharp drop in copy number toward the chromosome end. Notably, the boundaries of the amplified region were further demarcated by a fold-back inversion. These genomic patterns indicate the emergence of breakage&#x02013;fusion&#x02013;bridge cycles (BFBs) (Campbell <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), which are thought to underlie a genomic instability process initiated by a double-strand break exposing the end of the affected chromosome (Bunting &#x00026; Nussenzweig, <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). During replication, the unstable chromosome ends can fuse by non-homologous end joining, creating a dicentric chromosome that can break during cell division. This characteristically leads to a stepwise increase in copy number toward the chromosome end, followed by a sharp drop (Campbell <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), as detected in BM175 (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>F&#x02013;K). In the case of BM175, however, copy number oscillations resulting from chromothripsis overlaid the characteristic genomic patterns of BFBs (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>F&#x02013;K). On the basis of our analysis, the architectural characteristics of rearrangements on BM175 chromosome 8 indicate that chromothripsis occurred subsequent to initiating BFBs, as when chromothripsis occurs on a previously rearranged chromosome, the resulting segment joins will connect genomic pieces exhibiting different copy number states (see Appendix, inference of chromothripsis events (Li <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Rausch <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">2012a</xref>; Stephens <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>)). The extensive translocations to chromosomes 15 and 2 suggest that these chromosomes were most likely co-shattered by chromothripsis, which resulted in highly rearranged derivative chromosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd6">Dataset EV1</xref>). In addition to BM175, our analysis uncovered other examples of chromothripsis events arising subsequently to BFB cycles (Appendix Figs S5, S7, and&#x000a0;S12). Together with earlier observations on the occasional co-occurrence of BFBs and chromothripsis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and esophageal adenocarcinoma (Li <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Nones <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), these data suggest that the temporal pattern of BFBs followed by chromothripsis is a more common feature of massively rearranged genomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Evidence for a link between telomere attrition and chromothripsis</title><p>BFB cycles can be triggered through losses of telomeric ends of chromosomes (Bunting &#x00026; Nussenzweig, <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In order to test whether telomeric end loss can give rise to chromothripsis using our CAST system, we depleted cells of the shelterin complex protein TRF2 (de Lange, <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) and further challenged the siRNA-treated cells with chemicals used to help overcome mitotic checkpoint barriers in TRF2-depleted cells (i.e., reversine and hesperadine (Santaguida <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>)). Notably, we identified two chromothripsis events (Figs<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08ev">EV3</xref>) one of which additionally exhibited the&#x000a0;genomic alteration patterns of a BFB cycle (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>). To our knowledge, these data provide, for the first time, experimental evidence that telomere attrition can mediate chromothripsis. Hence, our data add to and significantly extend prior observations based on cancer genome analysis that BFBs, which are thought to frequently arise as a consequence of telomere shortage, occasionally occur in conjunction with chromothripsis events (see Li <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Nones <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; as well as our genomic data in Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>F&#x02013;K and Appendix Figs S5, S7, and S12).

To exemplify this, we performed transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-Seq) of BM175 and BM178 as well as of their parental cell lines and compared gene expression levels in pre- and post-chromothripsis stages. We observed appreciable expression changes in genomic regions affected by chromothripsis at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 10%. For instance, in BM178, a number of significantly downregulated genes were observed on the chromosome arm rearranged by chromothripsis, including two tumor suppressors (the <italic>RASSF3</italic> and <italic>RASSF9</italic> members of the RAS-associated family of tumor suppressors (Volodko <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>); Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5A</xref>). Additional members of this tumor suppressor family (RASSF4/5) residing on different chromosomes were likewise downregulated (Fig&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10ev">EV5A</xref>), potentially due to coordinated regulation of these interacting partners (Behrends <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) subsequent to the rearrangement. For BM175, we observed pronounced downregulation of <italic>BUBR1</italic> and <italic>CASC5</italic> residing on chromosome 15, which was the most significantly affected chromosome in terms of expression deregulation, with 14% of the expressed genes showing significant deregulation (chi-squared outlier test, <italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>0.0048). As a result of chromothripsis, both genes were brought into a new genomic context (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10ev">EV5B</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10ev">D</xref>).

CAST utilizes initially untransformed cell lines together with a strong selection barrier that can be overcome following genetic and chemical perturbations. Our experimental data based on CAST do not only demonstrate the reproducible generation of chromothripsis events, but also implicate hyperploidy and telomere attrition as predisposing factors for chromothripsis. Along with the link between <italic>TP53</italic> germ line mutations and chromothripsis that we previously reported for medulloblastoma (Rausch <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">2012a</xref>), and links between constitutional Robertsonian translocations and chromothripsis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Li <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), our <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> findings reinforce the notion that rather than occurring in isolation chromothripsis is prone to arise in cellular contexts which facilitate genomic instability&#x02014;such as in the context of hyperploidy, which may mediate instability by &#x0201c;buffering&#x0201d; against haploinsufficiency or by causing an increased rate of mitotic failures promoting SR formation. Indeed, hyperploidy is frequently observed in human cancers (Davoli &#x00026; de Lange, <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), can increase resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Castedo <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), and has previously been suggested as a source of genetic instability (Storchova &#x00026; Kuffer, <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Davoli &#x00026; de&#x000a0;Lange, <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), albeit not in the context of chromothripsis. Interestingly, an important feature of external granular layer (EGL) cells, the cells of origin of SHH-MB, is their capacity to actively proliferate in a tissue where most other cell types do not divide (Schuller <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Westra <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Potentially relevant to the observations reported here, a previous study using cultured EGL progenitors identified aneuploidy in 15% of cells, with hyperploidy being the most commonly observed form (Westra <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>In addition to identifying hyperploidy as a risk factor for chromothripsis, our experiments implicate telomere attrition (mediated by siRNA-based <italic>TRF2</italic> depletion) in chromothripsis. Of note, telomere deprotection has previously been hypothesized to be associated with chromothripsis (Stephens <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Li <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) as this can result in dicentric chromosomes that may be prone to breakage during cell division (van Steensel <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>), and given the occasional co-occurrence of BFBs and chromothripsis in cancer genomes. Although TRF2 depletion appears to be less efficient for generating DNA rearrangements than doxorubicin, perhaps due to additionally required genetic components, our <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> data demonstrate how CAST may be used for future research to uncover natural cellular, or extrinsic, triggers of chromothripsis.</p><p>CAST, which utilizes initially genetically stable cells as <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> &#x0201c;model system,&#x0201d; can be employed using diverse chemical or genetic perturbations. While this paper was under review elsewhere, a different experimental approach, by Zhang and colleagues, was described using live cell imaging and single cell sequencing, based on which the authors elegantly showed that the physical isolation of chromosomes through micronuclei formation can mediate chromothripsis events (Zhang <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Although we failed to detect micronuclei in our cell lines after chromothripsis occurred (Appendix Fig S12), this does not formally exclude a potential initiating role of micronuclei in chromothripsis in our RPE-1 cell system. Micronuclei can form as a consequence of chromosomes lagging at anaphase (Crasta <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), dicentric chromosomes are prone to be lagging at anaphase (Pampalona <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), and telomere attrition can mediate the formation of dicentric chromosomes (van Steensel <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Hence, it is conceivable that micronuclei arose in our cells treated with TFR2 siRNA, presumably when double-strand breaks occurred following telomere attrition.</p><p>By comparison, and complementary to the approach by Zhang <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, CAST can be used to investigate the potential lethality of massive SRs resulting from chromothripsis, the ability of cells to benefit from these, and additional consequences of chromothripsis. By enabling research on these aspects for the first time, CAST provides a powerful tool for investigating natural triggers and consequences of chromothripsis, a catastrophic SR process that is likely to be initiated by more than one cellular pathway. In this context, the flexibility of our approach along with its capacity to reproducibly generate chromothripsis events will facilitate further studies on chromothripsis, by enabling the testing of specific hypotheses on pathways and mechanisms that may give rise to catastrophic SRs, including involvement of errors in mitosis, transcription, and DNA replication (Jones &#x00026; Jallepalli, <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and treatments</title><p>RPE-1 cells were purchased from ATCC and checked for mycoplasma contamination.

Heterozygous sites were statistically phased using SHAPEIT2 (Delaneau <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) (v2; parameters: -window 10&#x000a0;Mb, -states 5008, -no-mcmc, overlap between chunks: 1&#x000a0;Mb) with a haplotype reference panel based on the 1000GP October 2014 release. Phased heterozygous SNPs were genotyped in tumor genomes (or clones with SRs) using freebayes (default parameters, -l&#x000a0;-@). We excluded rare variants (MAF&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;1%, Ensembl 75) and variants that were covered by less than four reads from further analysis to minimize errors in phase estimation and quantification of allelic imbalance. We segmented phased allelic ratios with the CBS algorithm (<italic>R</italic> package DNACopy; parameters: data.type=&#x0201c;logratio,&#x0201d; undo.splits=&#x0201c;sdundo,&#x0201d; undo.SD=1) in order to infer haplotype-specific allelic imbalances. We only kept segments that were defined by at least five markers. Haplotype-specific coverage was calculated at phased SNPs, and diagnostic haplotypes with allelic ratios of 2:0 and 2:1 were used to estimate total haplotype-specific copy numbers.</p></sec><sec><title>PCR validations</title><p>Primers were constructed with our in-house primer design pipeline, based on primer3 software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biotools.umassmed.edu/bioapps/primer3_www.cgi">http://biotools.umassmed.edu/bioapps/primer3_www.cgi</ext-link>), and purchased from Sigma. PCR experiments were performed as follows: 10&#x000a0;ng of genomic DNA was used with the SequalPrep Long PCR Kit (Invitrogen) in 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l volumes applying the following PCR conditions in a MJ Mini thermocycler (BioRad): 94&#x000b0;C for 3&#x000a0;min, followed by 10 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 10&#x000a0;s, 62&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;s and 68&#x000b0;C for 6&#x000a0;min and 25 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 10&#x000a0;s, 60&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;s, and 68&#x000b0;C for 7&#x000a0;min, followed by a final cycle of 72&#x000b0;C for 10&#x000a0;min. PCR products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel stained with SYBR Safe Dye (Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec><title>RNA libraries and sequencing</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). RNA quality control was performed using the 2100 Bioanalyzer platform (Agilent). A total of 500&#x000a0;ng total RNA was used as a starting material for the RNA sequencing libraries, which were prepared using the TruSeq strand-unspecific protocol with Ribo-Zero Gold (Illumina) and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform with 2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;51 cycles according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. In order to minimize batch effects, samples were processed on a Beckman Biomek FX robot following the manufacturers&#x02019; instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA sequencing analyses</title><p>RNAseq reads were aligned to the reference built by bowtie based on Ensembl v. 62 exons, build GRCh37.p3. Gene-specific read counts were obtained with the Genomic Alignments package in R, using a strand-unspecific model together with the Ensembl transcript database. Differential expression was assessed with the R package DESeq.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical testing</title><p>For the analysis of non-random distributed samples, permutation testing was applied. The labels of the two groups switched, and the mean difference was computed 10,000 times and then compared to the observed difference. For the analysis of breakpoint clustering, a KS test was applied testing for statistically significant deviation from the null hypothesis of no breakpoint clustering. For the analysis of random distribution of SR types, multinomial testing against the null hypothesis &#x0201c;equal distribution of joins&#x0201d; was applied using the R package &#x0201c;EMT.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec><title>Fluorescence <italic>in&#x000a0;situ</italic> hybridization</title><p>Cells were cultured in 225-cm flasks (Sigma Aldrich, CLS431082) up to a confluence of 95% and then treated with 100&#x000a0;ng/ml of colcemid (Sigma Aldrich, D1925) for 6&#x000a0;h. Cells were collected by mitotic shake-off and transferred to a freshly prepared hypotonic solution (KCl 0.55% (Merck-Milipore) and Na-citrate (Merck-Milipore) 1% mixed 1:1) following centrifugation. Cells were swollen in hypotonic solution and subsequently fixed by methanol&#x02013;acetic acid mixture (3:1, Merck-Milipore). Fixed cells were dropped on glass slides prewarmed with steam, which were previously treated with methanol (Merck-Milipore). The slides were then dried, and the confluence and the quality of the spreads were checked under a microscope. For chromosome counts, cells were probed with PNA centromere probe coupled to Cy3 dye (Panagene) according to manufacturers&#x02019; instructions. DNA was stained with 0.2&#x000a0;g/ml Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies).</p></sec><sec><title>Microscopy</title><p>Imaging on most indirect immunofluorescence samples was performed at 25&#x000b0;C on a DeltaVision RT system (Applied Precision) with an Olympus IX71 microscope. This system was equipped with FITC, TRITC, and Cy5 filters (Chroma Technology), a plan-Apo 100&#x000d7; NA 1.4 and 60&#x000d7; NA 1.4 oil immersion objective (Olympus), a CoolSNAP HQ camera (Photometrics), a temperature controller (Precision Control), and Softworx software (Applied Precision).</p></sec><sec><title>Live cell imaging</title><p>Cells were seeded into chambered cover glasses (LabTEK: Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the lids of the chambers were sealed with baysilone paste (Neolab). Approximately 30&#x000a0;min before imaging, culture medium was exchanged to prewarmed CO<sub>2</sub>-independent medium without phenol red, containing 20% FCS, 2&#x000a0;mM glutamine, and 100&#x000a0;mg/ml penicillin&#x02013;streptomycin. Live cell microscopy was performed in 37&#x000b0;C microscope incubators (EMBL GP106) on a Zeiss 780 confocal microscope with a 63&#x000d7; PlanApochromat oil objective (NA 1.4, Carl Zeiss) and in-house temperature controller, controlled by the Zen 2010 Software. Six z stacks with 2.00-&#x003bc;m intervals were used for each position. Images were acquired with 5-min time resolution. When applicable, automated quantitative analysis of cells was pursued to monitor for mitotic progression in single cells. To this end, nuclei were detected in the H2B-mCherry channel and classified as previously described (Held <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Walter <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) with an overall accuracy of &#x0003e;&#x000a0;90.0%. Cells were tracked with a constrained nearest-neighbor tracking procedure, and mitotic onset was detected as interphase&#x02013;prophase or interphase&#x02013;prometaphase transition. To reduce the effect of classification errors on phase length measurements, classification results were corrected using hidden Markov models (Held <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Data deposition</title><p>Cell-line-based sequencing data (DNA and RNA based) are deposited at ENA, accession PRJEB8037, and patient sequencing data at EGA, accession EGAS00001000215.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Principal funding for this study came from an ERC starting grant to JOK (336045).
