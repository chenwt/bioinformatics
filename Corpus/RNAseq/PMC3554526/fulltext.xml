However, how these factors signal through the blood&#x02013;brain barrier (bbb) to interact with the sex-specific brain circuits that control courtship is unknown. Here we show that male identity of the blood&#x02013;brain barrier is necessary and that male-specific factors in the bbb are physiologically required for normal male courtship behavior. Feminization of the bbb of adult males significantly reduces male courtship.

Ensembles of brain cells work in networks to ensure proper behavior at the right time. While the state of these cells plays an important role in whether and how the behavior is displayed, information from outside the brain is also required. Often, this information is provided by hormones that are present in the circulating fluid (such as the blood). However, the brain is protected by a layer of very tight cells, the so-called blood&#x02013;brain barrier, that keeps unwanted molecules out. So how then do hormones and other regulatory factors &#x0201c;talk&#x0201d; to the brain? We are studying this question by examining the mating behavior of males of a model organism, the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. We have found that the blood&#x02013;brain barrier cells themselves contain male-specific molecules that play an important role. When they are absent, courtship behavior is compromised. We have also identified how outside factors talk to the brain: by using a cellular signaling protein and a particular signaling pathway. Together they are well suited to pass on outside information to the brain network that regulates mating behavior.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grant IOS-0919697 to BD from the National Science Foundation.

The behavior is controlled by the master regulatory genes of the general somatic sex determination pathway <italic>Sxl</italic>, <italic>tra</italic>, <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003217-Belote1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1003217-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. A cascade of sex-specific alternative splicing results in males that express the transcription factors DSXM and FRUM, and females expressing DSXF (the FRU protein is not made in females). Both FRU and DSX are expressed in defined subsets of neurons in the brain and abdominal ganglia, with expression overlapping in some of these neurons. A number of experiments have demonstrated that both <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic> are required for normal male courtship behavior (<xref rid="pgen.1003217-Demir1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1003217-Stockinger1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>; reviewed in <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Dauwalder1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1003217-Yamamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>) and several recent studies have identified <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic> neuronal projections that form putative circuits that confer the competence for male courtship behavior <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Rideout1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Cachero1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1003217-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. While <italic>fru</italic> and <italic>dsx</italic> neurons are indispensible for male courtship, another, non-neuronal tissue has emerged as an important regulator: the fat body. The fat body (which is often compared to the mammalian liver) is a secretory tissue that surrounds the brain, the abdominal ganglia and the abdominal organs. Among other important aspects it functions in metabolism, energy storage, immune function and yolk protein synthesis in females. It also produces sex-specific factors that are required for full male courtship behavior <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Dauwalder2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Fujii1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. When, by genetic means, the fat body is made female in an otherwise normal adult male, courtship behavior is strongly reduced, indicating that it produces sex- specific factors <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Lazareva1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. These experiments are feasible because sex determination in flies is mostly cell-autonomous. In agreement with this finding, several other screens for sex-specifically expressed genes in fly heads, and for genes that are controlled by <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic>, resulted in the identification of genes that are expressed in the fat body <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Arbeitman1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1003217-Goldman1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The fat body secretes proteins into the hemolymph, the open circulatory system of the fly. Takeout, one of the male-enriched fat body proteins with a role in male courtship, has been shown to be secreted into the hemolymph and act as a secreted protein <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Lazareva1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. This is likely also the case for other sex specific fat body proteins. How such hemolymph proteins interact with the brain circuits that control courtship is unknown. Since flies possess a blood&#x02013;brain barrier (bbb), hemolymph proteins do not have unrestricted access to brain neurons. Nothing is known about the mechanisms by which these proteins negotiate the blood&#x02013;brain barrier. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> bbb consists of two glial cell layers that ensheathe the entire brain, ventral ganglion and peripheral nerves. The inner or subperineurial glia (SPG) cell layer is situated next to the neuronal cell bodies and forms the tight barrier that is characteristic of vertebrate and invertebrate blood&#x02013;brain barriers <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Awasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1003217-Stork1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The vertebrate bbb is formed by tight junctions between blood endothelial cells <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Abbott1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In contrast, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, septate junctions form the basis of the barrier, similar to mammalian myelinating glia at the paranodal junctions. Several studies have identified important proteins that are required for the development of a tight and functional barrier, several of which are evolutionarily conserved <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Schwabe1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Stork1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Banerjee1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1003217-FaivreSarrailh1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. While insight into the development of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> bbb has been gained, very little is still known about the adult bbb and the mechanisms that underlie its function (for a review see <xref rid="pgen.1003217-DeSalvo1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>). Interaction of hemolymph components with the brain will likely involve specific receptors, transporters and signaling events. A <italic>Drosophila</italic> ABC transporter Mdr65 that functions similarly to the mammalian human MDR1/Pgp has been described <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Mayer1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Furthermore, the putative GPCR <italic>moody</italic> that is specifically expressed in the SPG barrier cells has been shown to mediate the behavioral response to ethanol and cocaine independent of its developmental function in barrier set up <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Bainton1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>In order to approach the question how sex-specific circulating factors communicate/pass through the bbb in order to exert their function, we examined whether the sexual identity of the bbb itself might be required, and whether <italic>moody</italic> signaling in the bbb is a component in the regulation of courtship behavior. We report here that the bbb contains sex specific factors that are important for male courtship, and that <italic>moody</italic> and Go protein signaling in the bbb are important regulators of this behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Feminization of the blood&#x02013;brain barrier reduces male courtship behavior</title><p>To examine whether the bbb has a sex-specific role in male courtship behavior, we used the sub-perineurial glia specific Gal4 driver <italic>SPG-Gal4</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003217-Stork1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> to express a <italic>UAS- TraF</italic> transgene. TraF is a female-specific regulator of the sex determination cascade and expression of TraF has been shown to specifically feminize the cells in which it is expressed <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Baker1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1003217-McKeown1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. We used two different SPG-Gal4 lines with insertions on the second or third chromosome, respectively, to express TraF (gifts from R. Bainton). Males whose bbb layer was feminized court females significantly less than the wild-type control males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003217-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). Their overall courtship index (CI) was significantly reduced. The CI is the fraction of time a male spends performing any of the steps of the courtship ritual within the observation period. When we quantified individual courtship steps, we found that latency (the time to first orientation towards the female) was the same in control and experimental animals. This indicates that the mutants are not deficient in their perception of the female and her pheromones. In contrast, the fraction of time spent extending a wing to perform the courtship song and the number of copulations were significantly reduced, in agreement with the overall reduction in courtship (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003217-t001">Table 1</xref>). These data show that males with feminized blood&#x02013;brain barrier are capable of all steps of courtship, but perform them with reduced probability. This is not due to locomotion defects, since males with feminized bbb perform indistinguishably from control flies in a short term activity assay <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Anand1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003217-g001">Figure 1g</xref>). In this assay, individual males are placed in a courtship chamber and the number of time they cross a drawn line is counted. To corroborate that the observed courtship reduction is caused by the feminization of glial cells, we used <italic>repo-Gal4</italic>, a driver that is expressed not just in the bbb but generally in glial cells <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Sepp1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. We observed a similar reduction, confirming that the male identity of glial cells is important for male courtship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003217-g001">Figure 1b, 1h</xref>). This would predict that a similar effect should be observed if these cells were made &#x0201c;less male&#x0201d;. Since TraF acts through its downstream targets <italic>fru</italic> and <italic>dsx</italic> we next examined the effect of expressing RNAis that target these transcripts in bbb cells. Indeed, <italic>SPG-Gal4/UAS-fruRNAi</italic> and <italic>SPG-Gal4/UAS-dsxRNA</italic>i males showed similar reductions as <italic>SPG-Gal4/UAS-TraF</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003217-g001">Figure 1c, 1i</xref>). This suggests that FRU and DSXM both have a role in regulating sex-specific molecules in the bbb. It also argues that the effect of TraF is not due to merely overexpressing female-specific DSXF.</p><fig id="pgen-1003217-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1003217.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The sexual identity of bbb cells is important for courtship.</title><p>Graphs show the courtship index CI (fraction of time males spend courting during the observation period) &#x000b1; Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) of the indicated genotypes (a&#x02013;c), or the performance of males in a control activity assay (# of line crossings &#x000b1; SEM) (g&#x02013;i).

An intact bbb will exclude a 10 kDa Texas-red-coupled dextran (TR-dextran) molecule from the brain, whereas in mutants with a defective bbb, the dye will penetrate through the bbb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003217-g001">Figure 1e</xref>).

These results suggest that feminization of the sub-perineurial layer of the bbb does not affect blood&#x02013;brain barrier permeability in an obvious way, but rather affects sex-specific physiological processes that are required for male courtship behavior.</p><p>Because the sub-perineurial layer is formed during blood&#x02013;brain barrier development <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Schwabe1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, but also has a physiological role in adults <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Bainton1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, the observed reduction in male courtship behavior could be a result of developmental effects, an effect on the adult physiological function of the bbb, or both. To distinguish between these possibilities, we added a temperature sensitive <italic>tubP-Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic> transgene <xref rid="pgen.1003217-McGuire1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> to induce feminization of the sub-perineurial layer exclusively in the adult. Males were raised at 18&#x000b0;C and after eclosion kept at 18&#x000b0;C. At that temperature, the Gal80<sup>ts</sup> inhibitor is active and inhibits Gal4 from activating UAS-TraF. Mature adult males were then transferred to 32&#x000b0;C or 30&#x000b0;C before testing in the courtship assay. At 30&#x000b0;C and 32&#x000b0;C, Gal80<sup>ts</sup> becomes inactive, Gal4 is active and TraF is induced <xref rid="pgen.1003217-McGuire1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Control animals were continuously kept at 18&#x000b0;C (uninduced controls). The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003217-g002">Figure 2</xref>. Control genotypes at the uninduced (18&#x000b0;C) and induced temperatures courted normally. Uninduced <italic>Gal80<sup>ts20</sup>/Gal80<sup>ts10</sup></italic>; <italic>SPG-Gal4/UAS-TraF</italic> males courted females normally. In contrast, induced <italic>Gal80<sup>ts20</sup>/Gal80<sup>ts10</sup></italic>; <italic>SPG-Gal4/UAS-TraF</italic> males showed a reduction in courtship behavior. This effect was dependent on the length of induction. Induction at 32&#x000b0;C for 16 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003217-g002">Figure 2a</xref>) reduced courtship to a lesser extent than induction for 48 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003217-g002">Figure 2c</xref>). Extended induction at 30&#x000b0;C for four days did not reduce courtship further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003217-g002">Figure 2c</xref>) (30&#x000b0;C was chosen to reduce the impact of the extended heat-shock period). As observed in the feminization experiments not using Gal80, all experimental males were capable of performing all courtship steps, but they performed them less frequently. The reduction in the extended time-induced males was close to the reduction observed in the absence of Gal80, indicating that most of the observed effect was due to the effect of feminization during the mature adult stage. To explore this further, we examined <italic>Gal80<sup>ts20</sup>/Gal80<sup>ts10</sup></italic>; <italic>SPG-Gal4/UAS-TraF</italic> males that spent most of their development at 30&#x000b0;C. Due to lethality of the higher temperature during earlier stages, we moved the flies from 25&#x000b0;C to 30&#x000b0;C on day 5, when third instar wandering larvae began climbing up the wall of the vial. The critical time period for behavioral sex-determination has been shown to lie in pupal stages <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Belote1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003217-g002">Figure 2d</xref>, extended heat conditions lowered overall courtship somewhat in the controls. In the <italic>Gal80<sup>ts20</sup>/Gal80<sup>ts10</sup></italic>; <italic>SPG-Gal4/UAS-TraF</italic> males the courtship index was reduced similarly to the reduction in the <italic>SPG-Gal4/UAS-traF</italic> males shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003217-g001">Figure 1a</xref>, relative to control flies. However, these males rarely showed courtship behaviors beyond their initial orientation to the female. These results may indicate a developmental component when feminization occurs throughout extended stages. We next tested whether males that had spent most of their development at 30&#x000b0;C could be rescued by shifting them back to 18&#x000b0;C after eclosion. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003217-g002">Figure 2e</xref>, a fraction of these flies was rescued and showed wild-type courtship scores (8 out of 20). The rest, rather than being partially rescued, did not improve. This &#x0201c;all or none&#x0201d; rescue may indicate a threshold effect. However, the males that did show rescue demonstrate the importance of correct male identity of the bbb cells in the adult. Taken together, our experiments demonstrate a significant sex-specific role of the bbb in the control of male courtship and suggest that sex-specific molecules in the bbb play a crucial physiological role in the regulation of courtship.</p><fig id="pgen-1003217-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1003217.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Conditional adult expression of <italic>UAS-TraF</italic> by <italic>SPG-Gal4(3)</italic> reduces male courtship.</title><p>Graphs show the courtship index CI (fraction of time males spend courting during the observation period) &#x000b1; SEM of the indicated genotypes, or the performance of males in a control activity assay (# of line crossings &#x000b1; SEM).

We show here that the bbb also plays a crucial role in the regulation of male courtship behavior in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. When the bbb is feminized in an otherwise normal male animal, the courtship index drops significantly, indicating the presence of male-specific factors and processes in these cells. Importantly, while some of these sex-specific factors may affect sex-specific development of the bbb, our results demonstrate that feminization of the bbb exclusively in the adult is sufficient to reduce male courtship. Thus, male-specific factors are physiologically required in courting males. It is worth noting that the integrity of the bbb was not affected by feminization or by any other of our manipulations using a standard approach to examine bbb barrier function, although we can not rule out small defects. Therefore, the observed effects support the interpretation that feminization affects physiological sex- specific processes within the bbb. We show here that <italic>moody</italic> GPCR signaling is one of these processes. Normal courtship requires both <italic>moody</italic> isoforms, &#x003b1; and &#x003b2;, similar to the previously reported response to alcohol and cocaine. As has been described, <italic>moody</italic> appears to have two distinct roles: While either one of the <italic>moody</italic> isoforms is sufficient for a functional and intact barrier, both isoforms are required for adult signaling processes. Our RNA sequencing data suggest that the two isoforms are not present in equal abundance and that the ratio of the two isoforms is sex-specifically regulated. It is not clear at present why two forms of the <italic>moody</italic> protein are required in behavior. It is unlikely that a strict stoichiometric ratio of the two isoforms is required, since we have observed normal courtship in wild-type flies that express additional Moody-&#x003b2; (+/moody&#x02212;&#x003b2; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003217-g003">Figure 3a</xref>). The two isoforms differ in their intracellular domain, which could indicate that they interact with different effector molecules that are both contributing to the behavioral response. We have observed courtship defects when either isoform is missing, indicating that both forms have a role in regulating courtship. Interestingly, we have observed that the ratio of the two isoforms is under the control of the sex-specific splicing factor TraF <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, raising the possibility that the <italic>moody</italic> pre-mRNA is a target for splicing regulation by TraF or one of its downstream effectors. It will be of interest to identify other sex-specific factors in the bbb and examine their contribution to the regulation of male courtship.</p><p>We did not observe a courtship phenotype when we expressed dominant mutants for Gs and Gq that have been shown to act as dominant negative mutations in developmental processes <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Schaefer1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Likewise, expression of Gi-RNAi or <italic>concertina-RNAi</italic> did not result in reduced courtship either. This suggests that these G proteins do not play a significant role in courtship in this layer. In contrast, we have observed courtship defects when Go signaling was compromised. We have employed two approaches to show that the heterotrimeric protein Go is required for male courtship behavior: inhibition by PTX and mRNA reduction by RNAi. The S1 subunit of PTX from <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> catalyzes the transfer of an ADP-ribose onto the G&#x003b1; subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein. In contrast to mammals, where PTX inhibits both Go and Gi, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> PTX is a specific inhibitor for Go, since the only Gi present (G(i)65A) does not contain the PTX recognition site. PTX will only ribosylate heterotrimers (not individual alpha subunits), and the consequence of this ribosylation is inhibition of the heterotrimer activation <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Katada1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Moss1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. The inhibition of Go signaling by PTX is therefore very specific; since the ADP-ribosylated Go heterotrimers cannot be activated, they do not generate ectopic G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; subunits, nor do they sequester free G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; subunits away from other G&#x003b1; subunits. Conditional induction of PTX only in adult mature flies, as well as conditional adult reduction of G&#x003b1;o by RNAi reduced male courtship. This demonstrates that physiological signaling through Go is an important signaling pathway that regulates courtship in the bbb. Given these findings it is likely that <italic>moody</italic> signals through Go to exert its function in courtship. In embryos, Go, Gi, <italic>moody</italic> and <italic>loco</italic> mutations each disrupt the formation of the bbb <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Schwabe1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and lead to bbb leakiness, as shown by dye penetration. In contrast, we did not observe dye penetration in the PTX and Go-RNAi mutants that we generated, further evidence that the developmental and physiological roles of <italic>moody</italic> and Go signaling differ in their mechanisms.</p><p>We do not know what the downstream pathways are that are mediating the Go action. Few Go effectors have been demonstrated and its &#x003b1; or &#x003b2;&#x003b3; subunits could be mediating the signal. In many cases in vertebrates it is the &#x003b2;&#x003b3; subunits that are responsible for actuating signaling. In neurons, presynaptic voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels have been shown to represent an effector for Go <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Strock1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Studies of the role of Go in learning and memory in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have suggested that Go signaling does not occur through the <italic>rut</italic> adenylyl cyclase <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Ferris1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Signaling through Go is not generally thought to occur through PKA, consistent with our finding that disruption of PKA signaling in the bbb did not affect courtship. It is unknown whether potential downstream signaling molecules like <italic>loco</italic>, G&#x003b3;13F or PKC are sex-specifically expressed in the blood&#x02013;brain barrier and might have a courtship role in this layer. In whole heads, PKC98E is male-preferentially expressed <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. It is unknown what the ligand is for Moody and it remains to be seen what the exact role is for <italic>moody</italic> bbb signaling in courtship. Hemolymph factors that influence courtship could conceivably do so by initiating signaling pathways at the bbb, or by passage and transport through the bbb. Moody could be playing a role in signaling, as well as through a possible effect on transport, perhaps in processes similar to its previously demonstrated effects on the actin cytoskeleton during development <xref rid="pgen.1003217-Schwabe1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>Here we have demonstrated that sex-specific molecules in the bbb are important regulators of male courtship behavior in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The Moody GPCR and Go signaling in this layer are an important part of this regulation. It will be of importance to identify the ligand(s) and downstream signaling events that ultimately interact with the brain circuits that control male courtship behavior.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fly strains</title><p>All flies strains were reared on standard corn meal/sugar-based medium at room temperature under non-controlled light conditions, except for <italic>Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic> flies that were grown at 18&#x000b0;C and induced as adults at 32&#x000b0;C or 30&#x000b0;C as indicated. <italic>TraF</italic> is <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>; <italic>P{UAS-tra.F}20J7 </italic>
