There is the potential for pure epigenetic variation that occurs in the absence of any genetic change or for more complex situations that involve both genetic and epigenetic differences. Methylation of cytosine residues provides one mechanism for the inheritance of epigenetic information. A genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation in two different genotypes of <italic>Zea mays (ssp. mays)</italic>, an organism with a complex genome of interspersed genes and repetitive elements, allowed the identification and characterization of examples of natural epigenetic variation. The distribution of DNA methylation was profiled using immunoprecipitation of methylated DNA followed by hybridization to a high-density tiling microarray. The comparison of the DNA methylation levels in the two genotypes, B73 and Mo17, allowed for the identification of approximately 700 differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Several of these DMRs occur in genomic regions that are apparently identical by descent in B73 and Mo17 suggesting that they may be examples of pure epigenetic variation. The methylation levels of the DMRs were further studied in a panel of near-isogenic lines to evaluate the stable inheritance of the methylation levels and to assess the contribution of <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>- acting information to natural epigenetic variation. The majority of DMRs that occur in genomic regions without genetic variation are controlled by <italic>cis</italic>-acting differences and exhibit relatively stable inheritance. This study provides evidence for naturally occurring epigenetic variation in maize, including examples of pure epigenetic variation that is not conditioned by genetic differences. The epigenetic differences are variable within maize populations and exhibit relatively stable trans-generational inheritance. The detected examples of epigenetic variation, including some without tightly linked genetic variation, may contribute to complex trait variation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Heritable variation within a species provides the basis for natural and artificial selection. A substantial portion of heritable variation is based on alterations in DNA sequence among individuals and is termed genetic variation. There is also evidence for epigenetic variation, which refers to heritable differences that are not caused by DNA sequence changes. Methylation of cytosine residues provides one molecular mechanism for epigenetic variation in many eukaryotic species. The genome-wide distribution of DNA methylation was assessed in two different inbred genotypes of maize to identify differentially methylated regions that may contribute to epigenetic variation. There are hundreds of genomic regions that have differences in DNA methylation levels in these two different genotypes, including methylation differences in regions without genetic variation. By studying the inheritance of the differential methylation in near-isogenic progeny of the two inbred lines, it is possible to demonstrate relatively stable inheritance of epigenetic variation, even in the absence of DNA sequence changes. The epigenetic variation among individuals of the same species may provide important contributions to phenotypic variation within a species even in the absence of genetic differences.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Much of the heritable variation within a species is a consequence of differences in the primary DNA sequence of different individuals. However, there is growing evidence for heritable variation in the absence of DNA sequence polymorphisms, termed epigenetic variation <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Bird1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Cytosine methylation is one of the molecular mechanisms that can contribute to epigenetic variation and often acts to suppress the activity of transposable elements, repetitive sequences, pseudogenes, and in some cases otherwise active genes <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Slotkin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.

However, the abundance and role of epigenetic, relative to genetic, variation has not been well characterized. Maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) provides a useful model to study the role of epigenetic variation. Genetically, maize is a highly diverse species <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Buckler1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Messing1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> with a large, complex genome with many interspersed genic and repetitive regions <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Rabinowicz1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Schnable1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. While in the past this complex genomic structure has complicated the ability to perform genome-wide analyses it also is likely to contribute to higher levels of epigenetic variation relative to less complex genomes such as Arabidopsis <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Slotkin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Weil1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In addition, there are outstanding resources for the analysis of quantitative trait variation in maize <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002372-McMullen1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> that may allow for a better understanding of the relative roles of genetic and epigenetic variation in controlling quantitative trait variation.</p><p>In plants, the majority of genome-wide methylation studies have been conducted in Arabidopsis <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Lippman1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1002372-Zilberman1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Vaughn1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In these studies DNA methylation was frequently associated with heterochromatic regions, transposable elements, and repetitive DNA <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Lippman1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In general, lower levels of methylation occur within gene promoter sequences; however when present, promoter methylation shows a negative correlation with gene expression <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Within gene bodies, regions of DNA methylation have been observed uniquely in the CG context, but no major impact on gene expression is associated with this modification <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Zilberman1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The exact role of gene body methylation is unclear, but it may preferentially affect moderately-transcribed genes <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, and be under different regulatory control than that of transposable element methylation <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Miura1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Similar genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation have also been observed in rice and poplar <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Feng1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. A recent analysis of DNA methylation in maize used a 0.3&#x000d7; coverage sequencing of McrBC digested DNA to show evidence for mutually exclusive patterns of DNA methylation and H3K27me3 near genes with low, or no expression <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>DNA methylation has been proposed to play a role in generating variation that could provide adaptation to environmental stresses <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Richards1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Finnegan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1002372-Richards3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Two groups have recently developed epiRIL populations in which epigenetic states were altered by passage through DNA methylation mutants <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Reinders1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1002372-Johannes3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>]. The existence of quantitative trait variation in these populations suggests that alteration of DNA methylation patterns can induce phenotypic change although it is difficult to rule out the potential for primary sequence changes due to activated transposition. These studies have been very useful for documenting an important role for DNA methylation in regulating complex traits but do not provide information on natural variation for epigenetics states. There is evidence that DNA methylation patterns at specific loci can vary within Arabidopsis ecotypes <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Vaughn1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Riddle1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1002372-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and there are several specific examples of epigenetic variation that result in phenotypic variation in a variety of species <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Bender1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1002372-Manning1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. However, there are limited analyses of genome-wide methylation variation conducted in plant species. A detailed contrast of chromosome 4 methylation patterns in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> ecotypes shows very similar targeting of transposable elements and repetitive sequences, yet genic partial methylation states were highly polymorphic across ecotypes <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Vaughn1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. A study in maize found evidence for variable effects of CHG methylation on transcription patterns in different inbreds of maize <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Makarevitch1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.</p><p>Despite the evidence for variation in DNA methylation patterns among individuals of the same species relatively little is known about the nature of the inheritance of these methylation differences. One study in Arabidopsis found that gene body methylation was only partially heritable and was lost at a relatively high frequency <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Vaughn1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Richards <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Richards1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> provided a description of how methylation variation may be dependent upon, conditioned by, or independent of DNA sequence change and termed these as examples of obligatory, facilitated or pure epialleles, respectively. Obligatory epialleles exhibit different levels of DNA methylation but are entirely dependent upon DNA sequence changes at linked or unlinked sites. In contrast, facilitated and pure epialleles exhibit stochastic variation that can be conditioned with or without genetic differences, respectively. In addition, there is evidence that genetic variation at unlinked genomic regions can direct epigenetic changes elsewhere in the genome, presumably through an RNA-direct DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Bender1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Slotkin2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002372-ArteagaVazquez1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.</p><p>We sought to characterize the variation in DNA methylation patterns in two maize inbred genotypes, B73 and Mo17. Genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation patterns was used to assess the relationship of methylation to chromosomal and gene structures. Although the majority of the genome shows highly similar methylation patterns in both inbreds there are several hundred differentially methylation regions (DMRs) found throughout the maize genome. The analyses of several identical-by-descent regions of the B73 and Mo17 genomes provides evidence that epigenetic variation can occur in the absence of nearby genetic polymorphisms. A population of near-isogenic lines was used to further characterize the heritable behavior of the DMRs and to assess the genomic regions that controlled the differential methylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>An array platform containing 2.1 million long oligonucleotide probes was designed to profile genomic DNA methylation patterns in low-copy sequences throughout the maize genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002372.s009">Table S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (meDIP) was performed on fragmented genomic DNA using a 5-methylcytosine antibody.

This method can detect substantial differences in the proportion of methylated cytosines in genomic regions but cannot accurately assess individual bases or differentiate the different types of DNA methylation such as CG, CHG, CHH. The enrichment of methylated DNA was confirmed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002372.s001">Figure S1A</xref>) by assessing the enrichment for a region known to be methylated and lack of enrichment for a region known to lack significant DNA methylation <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Haun1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. meDIP was performed on three biological replicates of leaf blade tissue isolated from the third expanded leaf of greenhouse-grown B73 and Mo17 seedlings; the resulting enriched fractions were labeled and hybridized to the array along with un-enriched control input DNA.

We investigated the methylation levels at sequences that exhibit structural genomic variation such as copy number variation (CNV) and presence-absence variation (PAV). Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) data were obtained from the hybridization of input B73 and Mo17 genomic DNA. DNAcopy <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Venkatraman1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> was performed, followed by expectation maximization <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Dempster1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> model analysis to identify segments that exhibit significantly more copies in Mo17 than in B73 (M&#x0003e;B CNV) and to identify segments that exhibit significant fewer or no copies in Mo17 relative to B73 (M&#x0003c;B CNV and PAV) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002372.s010">Table S2</xref>).

Even so, for subsequent analyses, we focused on regions that do not have any evidence for CNV/PAV based on the CGH data. The values from the remaining probes were adjusted using the B73-input vs. Mo17-input hybridization coefficient to control for differential hybridization efficiency while still estimating methylation differences.</p><p>Microarray probes were selected to target low-copy regions of the maize genome by using repeat-masked sequences (provided by J.

Slightly over half (58&#x00025;) of the probes present on the array have only a single perfect match in the B73 reference genome and no other close matches. As the numbers of perfect or close matches for probes increase there is a significant increase in the levels of methylation they detect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002372.s003">Figure S3D</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002372.s003">S3E</xref>).

Application of expectation maximization allows classification of the methylation status of each probe (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002372-t001">Table 1</xref>). The genomic distribution of DNA methylation patterns was visualized across each of the maize chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002372-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002372.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Similar to other species, methylation levels are higher in the pericentromic regions of maize chromosomes than at the ends of chromosomal arms. There are several regions of higher methylation throughout the chromosome that do not correlate with the centromeric position and do not correlate well with cytologically visible features such as knobs or rDNA sites. In general, the relative levels of DNA methylation are inversely correlated with gene density. The relative levels of DNA methylation in parental lines also show a negative correlation with recombination rates measured in a set of intermated B73&#x000d7;Mo17 RILs <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. However, the exact parents for this population may have slight differences relative to the B73 and Mo17 profiled in this study and we have not measured actual DNA methylation profiles in any specific RIL genotype.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Comparative genomic analysis of DNA methylation dynamics for maize genes</title><p>The location of each probe was determined relative to the gene models of annotation 5a.59 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.maizesequence.org">www.maizesequence.org</ext-link>). Version 5a.59 of the maize working gene set contains 104,369 annotated genes which include 39,384 genes models that are part of the high-confidence filtered gene set (FGS) and another 64,985 genes that were rejected from the FGS. In both B73 and Mo17 the FGS genes show substantially lower methylation levels within and surrounding the genes relative to the rejected genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002372-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The reasons for rejecting genes from the FGS include low confidence FGENESH models, probable transposons and probable pseudogenes. Rejected genes that fall into these classes exhibit significantly higher methylation than the genes in the FGS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002372.s005">Figure S5</xref>). The methylation pattern for FGS genes has reduced methylation in the 300 bp upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) then has a short &#x0201c;peak&#x0201d; of methylation in the very beginning of the gene which drops off quickly in the 3&#x02032; direction. There is a region of low methylation at the 3&#x02032; ends of FGS genes, but methylation returns to genome-wide average levels within 500 bp of the transcription termination site. This distribution of methylation levels, particularly the increased methylation at the 5&#x02032; ends of genes, is distinct from patterns observed in other species <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Lister1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Feng1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> but is consistent with a previous report from maize <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The methylation pattern observed across the gene body is related to the distribution of CpG dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002372.s006">Figure S6A</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002372.s006">S6B</xref>). However, the analysis of the region immediately upstream of the transcription site reveals that this region with increased CpG content does not show increased DNA methylation levels which confirms hypomethylation of these promoter regions and provides evidence that observed methylation levels are not strictly driven by CpG content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002372.s006">Figure S6C</xref>). In addition to the dynamics of methylation along the length of the genes, there are also significant differences in the methylation levels of exons, introns and UTRs relative to intergenic probes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002372.s006">Figure S6D</xref>). Introns show relatively low methylation levels throughout the gene body while exon sequences exhibit relatively high methylation in the 5&#x02032; end and low methylation in the 3&#x02032; end of the gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002372.s006">Figure S6E</xref>). Many of these differences reflect the relatively high CpG content of the first exons of maize genes.</p><fig id="pgen-1002372-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1002372.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Gene body methylation and expression levels in maize genes.</title><p>(A) The relative methylation levels (log2(IP/input)) were assessed for probes within 1000 bp of the transcription start and termination site. The relative position for probes within the gene was normalized to a scale of 1000. The genes in the filtered gene set (FGS) exhibit a lower methylation and a more dynamic pattern across the length of the gene than the rejected genes. The vertical dashed lines indicated the beginning and end of transcription for each gene. (B) The relative expression level for all FGS genes was assessed using published RNAseq data from B73 leaf tissue <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref> and genes were assigned as not expressed or quartile 1&#x02013;4 based on their expression level. In general, the genes show similar patterns of methylation but the higher expressed genes exhibit lower levels of methylation within and around the gene. (C) Each of the FGS genes was also classified according to whether it was located in a syntenic position relative to sorghum and/or rice or in a non-syntenic position. The syntenic genes exhibit much lower levels of methylation than the non-syntenic genes. This difference between syntenic and non-syntenic genes can also be seen in the regions immediately surrounding the gene.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1002372.g002"/></fig><p>To determine the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression, the relative expression levels of FGS genes in B73 leaf tissue were used to divide genes into five categories: non-expressed; and four quartiles based on RNAseq data from Li et al. <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. As expected, highly expressed genes show the lowest levels of methylation. There are significant differences in DNA methylation values among all quartiles of genes except between the two quartiles containing highly expressed genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002372.s007">Figure S7A</xref>). Genes that are not expressed have higher levels of methylation in nearby regions as well as within the gene body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002372-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We proceeded to assess methylation levels of FGS genes in a comparative genomics context. Schnable et al. <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Schnable2" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref> used comparative genomic approaches to identify homoeologous regions of the maize genome derived from a whole genome duplication event and to then assign them to sub-genome 1 and sub-genome 2 based on the level of fractionation observed. Sub-genome 1 has retained a larger proportion of the ancestral genes and generally exhibits higher mRNA expression levels as compared to sub-genome 2. Despite the trend for lower expression levels for genes in sub-genome 2 <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Schnable2" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, there was no evidence for differences in methylation levels in genes present in sub-genome 1 relative to sub-genome 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002372.s007">Figure S7B</xref>). However, there was evidence for substantial differences in the methylation levels of genes in the FGS that are in syntenic positions relative to sorghum and/or rice relative to FGS genes that are located in non-syntenic positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002372-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The non-syntenic genes are enriched (chi-square p value&#x0003c;0.001) for genes that are not expressed or are in the lowest quartile of expressed genes based on the data of Li and coworkers <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Variability for B73-Mo17 methylation</title><p>A visual analysis of the B73 and Mo17 methylation patterns revealed that while the majority of loci exhibit very similar patterns, there are examples of altered methylation levels between the two genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002372-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Two different approaches were used to discover differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in B73 and Mo17. One approach identified individual probes that exhibit significant (q&#x0003c;0.001) differences in the contrast of B73 and Mo17 methylation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002372-t002">Table 2</xref>). A second approach implemented the DNAcopy segmentation algorithm on the relative methylation values followed by expectation maximization to identify segments of at least three probes that exhibit altered methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002372-g003">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002372-t003">Table 3</xref>).

We focused on genomic regions of low diversity to identify potential examples of epigenetic differences that are not directly attributable to local sequence changes. As previously reported <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Springer1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> there are several large seemingly non-polymorphic regions in B73 relative to Mo17. These are likely identical-by-descent (IBD) regions that represent shared inheritance of the same haplotype block in these two different inbred genotypes from a common parent <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Springer1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. We analyzed 10 putative IBD regions in the B73-Mo17 genome that are at least 2 Mb in length, have no evidence for structural variation, and have extremely low SNP densities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002372-t004">Table 4</xref>). The SNP rates in these regions (1 every 44.2 kb) are below the levels of sequence error rates reported for the B73 reference genome <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Schnable1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Despite the near-absence of genetic variation within these regions there are 52 differentially methylated probes and 9 DMRs within these regions. The large low diversity region on chromosome 8 provides several examples of altered methylation levels within a large region that lacks sequence differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002372-g003">Figure 3B and 3C</xref>). We used the Mo17 whole-genome shotgun sequences and targeted PCR to confirm that absence of any InDels within 2 kb of each of the nine DMRs located within the IBD regions. The majority (8/9) DMRs in IBD regions did not have any InDels. Only one of these DMRs in an IBD region exhibit sequence polymorphism. At this DMR there is evidence for a recent insertion of a repetitive element in the B73 allele and B73 is more highly methylated than Mo17.</p><table-wrap id="pgen-1002372-t004"

of 14 regions of B73 hypermethylation and 19 regions of Mo17 hypermethylation was selected for further characterization (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002372-t005">Table 5</xref>). These included eight DMRs that were present in the IBD regions. Quantitative PCR-based assays were developed to assess relative methylation levels following digestion with the methylation dependent enzymes MspJI and FspEI. The methylation differences observed in the full-genome profiling were confirmed for 28/33 of these regions in independent biological samples of B73 and Mo17 DNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002372-t005">Table 5</xref>). The differential methylation was also assessed using the methylation-sensitive enzymes HpaII and/or PstI for ten of these same DMRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002372.s013">Table S5</xref>) including the three that had not been supported by methylation-dependent digests. All DMRs (4/4) that include a PstI (CHG sensitive) site were validated and 8 of the 10 DMRs that had a HpaII site were validated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002372.s013">Table S5</xref>). Two of the three regions that were not conclusively validated by the methylation-dependent enzyme digests did exhibit differential methylation when tested with HpaII. The other DMR was not supported by assays with either methylation-dependent or &#x02013;sensitive enzymes. The classification of differential methylation was also supported by an analysis of read counts from methyl-sensitive and insensitive sequencing libraries from Gore et al <xref rid="pgen.1002372-ArteagaVazquez1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="pgen-1002372-t005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1002372.t005</object-id><label>Table 5</label><caption><title>Characterization of variable methylation segments.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pgen-1002372-t005-5" xlink:href="pgen.1002372.t005"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">segID</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chr</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Start</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stop</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Assay</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mspj1 relative methylation<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt105">a</xref>

The levels of methylation in NILs can be used to evaluate the relative contribution of linked and unlinked genomic regions and to test for paramutation-like transfer of information between alleles. The expected results for each of these potential scenarios are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002372-g004">Figure 4A</xref>. The genotype for the chromosomal region containing the DMR is expected to predict the methylation state in the NIL if the methylation change is purely epigenetic or if linked sequence polymorphisms regulate methylation levels. Alternatively, if unlinked genomic regions are directing the methylation levels at DMRs introgressed into a NIL then the DMR is expected to exhibit methylation levels similar to the recurrent parent. For each of the DMRs we selected several genotypes that provided an introgression of the locus into either a B73 or Mo17 genomic background. In addition, as a control we monitored DNA methylation levels in several NIL genotypes that did not have an introgression at the locus of the DMR. In general, the control assays show a high stability of DNA methylation levels at these DMRs. The analysis of the NILs with introgressions at the DMR loci reveal that 10/13 have methylation levels that can be predicted by the haplotype of the region surrounding the DMR. This could reflect stable inheritance of epigenetic variation or <italic>cis</italic>-linked genetic changes that are directing the methylation difference. The other three DMRs that were mapped have DNA methylation patterns that are influenced by genomic regions that are unlinked to the DMR locus, suggesting that the methylation levels of these loci are controlled by <italic>trans</italic>-acting loci. Four (of the 13) DMRs that were mapped are located within the IBD regions and each of these exhibited methylation patterns that were controlled by <italic>cis</italic>-linked regions despite the absence of closely linked genetic variation within these regions.</p><fig id="pgen-1002372-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1002372.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Variable DNA methylation patterns in near-isogenic lines and diverse inbreds.</title><p>(A) The relative DNA methylation levels in selected near-isogenic lines was tested by digestion with the methylation dependent restriction enzyme MspjI followed by qPCR.

The first examples of imprinting and paramutation were discovered in maize <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Chandler2" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Springer2" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref> and there have been a number of pioneering studies on the epigenetic regulation of transposable element in maize <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Fedoroff1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Lisch1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. While these discoveries have been enabled by the ease of genetic studies in maize it is also likely that the complex organization of the maize genome with many interspersed transposons and genes has led to numerous examples of epigenetic regulation. In this study we have performed a genome-wide characterization of DNA methylation levels in two inbred lines of maize and found hundreds of loci with differences in DNA methylation levels. This study of natural epigenetic variation also demonstrates the utility of near-isogenic lines for characterizing epialleles.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Methylation dynamics along maize chromosomes and genes</title><p>Our data provide evidence for higher levels of DNA methylation in the pericentromeric regions of maize chromosomes. This is quite similar to observations in Arabidopsis <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Lippman1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1002372-Zilberman1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Although there is a general negative correlation between methylation density and recombination, methylation density does not exactly mirror recombination rates. Recombination happens much more frequently near the ends of the chromosomes and quickly drops to a lower level internally <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. The DNA methylation patterns exhibit a much more gradual change along the length of the chromosomes, potentially suggesting that the differences in recombination rate along the length of a chromosome are not directly related to DNA methylation levels. In general, the methylation patterns within maize gene bodies are similar to the density of CG sites. However, it is clear that the methylation levels in regions immediately upstream and downstream of gene bodies are not reflective of CG density. Interestingly, while short maize genes have elevated CG content throughout the gene body the longer maize genes have elevated CG content only in the first 500&#x02013;1000 bp.</p><p>We also noted very distinct patterns of DNA methylation in maize genes. In general, methylation is lower in high-confidence genes (i.e., members of the FGS), highly expressed genes and genes in syntenic positions relative to other grass species. Putative genes that were rejected during stringent genome annotation (often partial length sequences or putative transposons) are more highly methylated. The lack of detectable methylation differences between genes located in the maize1 and maize2 sub-genomes was surprising because there is evidence that maize1 genes are generally more highly expressed than maize2 genes <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Schnable2" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Therefore, DNA methylation is unlikely to provide the mechanism for controlling the expression differences between the two sub-genomes of maize. The significant difference in average methylation levels for syntenic and non-syntenic genes is correlated with lower expression levels for non-syntenic genes. The non-syntenic genes that are conserved among the grasses but exhibit different genomic positions are the result of gene movement, perhaps mediated by transposons. Approximately 1/3 of the maize FGS genes are not in syntenic positions relative to other grasses, yet nearly all genes investigated by classical genetics to date belong to the fraction of the genome located in syntenic positions <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Schnable3" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Their higher levels of methylation may reflect the presence of transposon sequences near these genes or may result from the insertion of a gene into new chromosomal environments that are lacking some of their ancestral regulatory sequences.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Many stable DMRs are found in B73 and Mo17</title><p>Several groups have demonstrated that perturbation of epigenetic information can affect quantitative traits <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Reinders1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1002372-Johannes3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In addition, the existence of natural epigenetic variation has been demonstrated for individual loci <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Riddle1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1002372-Manning1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> or chromosomes <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Vaughn1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. A primary objective of this study was to document the prevalence and distribution of variable methylation levels in different maize genotypes. There are hundreds of examples of differential methylation in B73 and Mo17. In general, many of these DMRs are located in intergenic regions and may reflect differences in transposon silencing among the genotypes. However, at least 71 of the 690 variable methylation regions are found within 500 bp of a high-confidence gene (FGS). Following the discovery of these regions we were able to pursue further characterization using a population of NILs. The NILs provide a useful tool for assessing the stability of DNA methylation patterns and for testing whether the epigenetic variation is caused by genetic differences elsewhere in the genome.</p><p>The analysis of DNA methylation levels at several DMRs within the NILs addressed the stability of the DNA methylation patterns. The near-isogenic lines were developed by three back-crosses followed by at least four rounds of self-pollination <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Chandler2" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. In an analysis of the control lines (lines without an introgression at the DMR locus for eleven <italic>cis</italic>-controlled DMRs) there is evidence for stable inheritance as 85&#x00025; of the assays reveal the expected methylation level. There are a small number of assays (5/150) that exhibit a completely changed methylation state and another 17/150 exhibit a partial gain or loss of DNA methylation. These examples may reflect inaccuracies in our measurements of DNA methylation or actual instability of DNA methylation patterns. In general, we observe relatively stable inheritance with rare examples of both gains and losses of DNA methylation. We did not observe evidence for paramutation-like effects where methylation levels were affected by heterozygosity for the DMRs.</p><p>Stable differences in DNA methylation levels between two genotypes can be the result of differences in epigenetic state that are faithfully propagated to offspring. Alternatively, they may be the result of genetic changes elsewhere in the genome that direct epigenetic modifications at an unlinked site. For example, structural rearrangements of the PAI1-PAI4 locus on chromosome 1 of Arabidopsis control the methylation state of the two other PAI loci on chromosomes 1 and 5 <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Bender1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The conditioning of DNA methylation state by either linked or unlinked genomic regions would be examples of obligatory epialleles where a genetic change at one locus programs variable methylation at another locus. We studied the contribution of linked and unlinked genomic regions to the methylation differences between B73 and Mo17 for 13 of the DMRs using a series of near-isogenic lines <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Eichten1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. Three of the regions exhibit evidence for <italic>trans</italic>-acting control of DNA methylation patterns. The remaining ten loci have methylation patterns that are either stably inherited or are continuously directly by local sequence changes.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Evidence for pure epialleles in maize</title><p>A major unresolved question about epigenetic variation is whether the majority of epigenetic variation exhibits strong linkage disequilibrium with nearby genetic differences <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Richards2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. If genetic markers, such as SNPs, are in strong linkage disequilibrium with epigenetic changes then the functional consequences of epigenetic differences would likely be revealed by assays of linked genetic differences. In particular, &#x0201c;obligatory&#x0201d; epialleles are entirely conditioned by nearby genetic changes <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Richards1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Alternatively, &#x0201c;facilitated&#x0201d; epialleles exhibit stochastic variation in epigenetic state with a conditioning genetic change, and &#x0201c;pure&#x0201d; epialleles exhibit stochastic variation in epigenetic state independent of any genetic changes <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Richards1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Both facilitated and pure epialleles will show differences in epigenetic state that are not completely linked to, or predicted, by nearby genetic polymorphisms.</p><p>We were interested in whether some of the epigenetic changes between B73 and Mo17 might be due to epigenetic changes that are not directly caused by nearby genetic differences such as transposon insertions or by unlinked rearrangements that might direct methylation in <italic>trans</italic> via RNA-directed DNA methylation. This led us to focus on the 10 extended B73-Mo17 identical-by-descent regions. These regions are most likely the result of shared inheritance of a chromosomal region from a genotype that was used in the pedigree of both B73 and Mo17. At least one genotype, CI187-2, is present in the pedigree of both B73 and Mo17 <xref rid="pgen.1002372-Hansey1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. It is therefore possible that these regions could exhibit identity by descent (IBD). It is worth noting that other maize genotypes have alternative haplotypes in these regions so they are not the result of large selective sweeps among all maize genotypes <xref rid="pgen.1002372-SwansonWagner1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. The absence of detected structural variation and few SNPs within these regions suggest that any observed epigenetic differences between B73 and Mo17 are not the result of nearby genetic polymorphisms. We found 9 DMR (of 690 genome-wide) within these IBD regions and only one of these has evidence for a nearby genetic change. The number of DMRs within the IBD regions (9) is very close to the number we would have expected (13) based on the frequency per Mb within the whole genome. The finding that all four of these regions that were assessed in NILs show stable inheritance provides evidence for heritable epigenetic information in the absence of genetic differences. Our initial focus on IBD regions allowed the discovery of epigenetic variation without nearby genetic changes given the extended regions of identity. However, it is likely that many of the DMRs that are located in non-identical by descent genomic regions may also be the result of purely epigenetic changes. We noted that one-third of the 690 DMRs do not contain any SNPs in B73 relative to Mo17 within 1 kb of the DMR and may represent epigenetic differences that are not conditioned by genetic differences.</p><p>This study provides a detailed view of the distribution of cytosine methylation in two maize inbreds. The evidence for faithfully inherited methylation differences, even in the absence of nearby genetic polymorphisms, provide evidence for at least partially stable epigenetic variation in maize that would not be revealed by high-resolution analyses of genetic differences. There are likely functional consequences of the altered methylation levels in B73 and Mo17. There are several examples in which a DMR within an identical by descent region is near the promoter for a FGS gene and several of these genes exhibit differential expression in other tissues of B73 and Mo17 (data not shown). Further characterization of the relationship between expression variation and methylation variation may identify examples of epigenetic variation that affect phenotypic differences among inbred lines.

Future research is required to uncover evidence for the contribution of the variable methylation we have described in this study to phenotypic differences among maize genotypes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant materials and DNA isolation</title><p>Three replications of B73 and Mo17 seedlings were grown in a randomized block design.

(A) The distribution of B73 methylation values is shown for all probes as well as for probes in B&#x0003e;M segments and a subset of B&#x0003e;M segments that likely represent PAV sequences as the Mo17 signal is substantially lower than the B73 signal. There are no significant differences in the average methylation levels of these probes. In (B) and (C) the methylation of M&#x0003e;B probes is shown for B73 and Mo17, respectively. These likely represent sequences with copy number gains in Mo17 relative to B73 but there is not a substantial differences in the methylation of these sequences relative to other genomic sequences. (D) A boxplot is used to show the distribution of B73 methylation values for all probes with 1, 2, 3, or 4&#x0002b; copies in the B73 genome. The methylation level significantly increases as the number of perfect matches increases. (E) A similar plot is used to show how the number of close (&#x0003e;90&#x00025; identity and coverage) matches is similarly related to increased methylation values.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1002372.s003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1002372.s004"><label>Figure S4</label><caption><p>Percent methylation across maize chromosomes.

Methylation and CpG proportion diverge when not within genic sequence. (D) Methylation levels are higher in intergenic sequences than in exons and introns. The lowest levels of methylation are observed in introns and at exon/intron boundaries.
