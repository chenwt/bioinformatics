Biofuel and green chemistry efforts utilizing renewable lignocellulosic plant biomass feedstocks contribute substantially towards these goals. However, to maximize economic viability, these processes must implement the complete conversion of all major constituent feedstock sugars. Pectin represents a main plant cell-wall polysaccharide that, unlike cellulose and hemicellulose, is not commonly utilized, especially in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>), for biofuel and platform chemical production. Since pectin is most abundant in the primary cell walls of soft and growing tissues, agricultural waste streams from fruits and vegetables are particularly pectin-rich. Crops with a high pectin content of 20 to &#x0003e;40% include sugar beet pulp, citrus peels, and apple pomace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and the use of their respective waste streams for the production of biofuels has been attempted in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These residues are naturally largely devoid of lignin, already collected at the processing plant, and partly pretreated during the sugar and juice extraction procedure, warranting their high potential as biofuel feedstocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The pectic cell wall fraction can be inexpensively and efficiently hydrolyzed into its component monosaccharides by enzymatic processes, as it is considerably less recalcitrant than other plant polysaccharides, such as cellulose. Despite these advantages, pectin-rich sugar beet pulp and citrus peels are currently disposed of in landfills or dried for use as a low-value cattle feed, an expensive procedure that significantly reduces profit margins. Utilizing these waste streams would augment current biofuel production efforts without creating direct or indirect land-use changes.</p><p>Pectin comprises a heterogeneous polysaccharide family with four main structural classes: homogalacturonan (HG), rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I), and the substituted HGs rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) and xylogalacturonan (XG) (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]). All pectic structures have &#x003b1;-D-galacturonic acid (D-GalA) as a major backbone component linked at the <italic>O</italic>-1 and the <italic>O</italic>-4 positions. This monosaccharide alone can comprise up to 70% of pectin; the remaining sugars include L-arabinose (L-Ara), D-galactose (D-Gal), L-rhamnose (L-Rha), and D-xylose (D-Xyl).</p><p>Engineering an organism to utilize D-GalA promises an attractive route for converting a currently underutilized, relatively abundant sugar into a biofuel or platform chemical. The yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is currently the most attractive production host and remains the most popular microorganism for industrial fermentation strategies to produce bioethanol. Its advantages include a high tolerance to growth inhibitors from lignocellulose hydrolysates as well as ethanol, the ability to withstand low pH conditions that eradicate many bacterial contaminants, fast fermentation kinetics, and the suitability for many rounds of recycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Ample engineering efforts have already been undertaken to utilize glucose, xylose, and arabinose. Unfortunately, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cannot metabolize D-GalA, because it lacks the genes encoding a catabolic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. When fermenting hydrolysates from pectin-rich feedstocks, this could, therefore, lead to the accumulation of D-GalA in the broth, which was shown to be inhibitory to the fermentation of D-Gal, L-Ara, and D-Xyl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. A possible approach to overcome this problem is metabolic engineering. In this case, the genes encoding the necessary enzymes for D-GalA metabolism derived from organisms capable of utilizing this sugar could be heterologously expressed in yeast. Such pathways have been described in bacteria, such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Erwinia</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], as well as more recently in filamentous fungi, such as <italic>Aspergillus niger, Trichoderma reesei</italic> (anamorph of <italic>Hypocrea jecorina</italic>) and <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] (also see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] for further review).</p><p>A recent attempt to engineer <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains carrying a bacterial D-GalA catabolic pathway met with considerable challenges in expressing functional enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Moreover, even though D-GalA was demonstrated to be able to enter <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells under certain conditions (through an as-yet unidentified, low-affinity and channel-like pore at acidic pH close to its pK<sub>a</sub> of about 3.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]), it was reasoned that the optimization of D-GalA transport will be essential for the successful engineering of D-GalA utilization in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Although prokaryotic D-GalA transport systems are well known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], these are notoriously difficult to express functionally in a eukaryotic host. However, so far no such transport protein has been described in a Eukaryote. Here we report such a eukaryotic D-GalA transporter. The corresponding gene was identified through a transcriptomics analysis of pectin degradation by the model filamentous fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> (<italic>N. crassa</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], followed by a genetic analysis and the biochemical characterization of the encoded protein. Moreover, we show the transporter to be functional when heterologously expressed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and useful for the conversion of D-GalA to downstream products. Our findings are therefore an important step towards the effective utilization of pectin-rich feedstocks for the production of platform chemicals or biofuels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of NCU00988 from <italic>N. crassa</italic> as a candidate D-galacturonic acid transporter</title><p>To identify candidate D-GalA transporters, we took advantage of a recently generated polysaccharide-biased co-expression matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In that study, the whole-genome expression pattern of <italic>N. crassa</italic> cultures 4&#x000a0;h after transfer to cellulose, xylan, pectin, orange peel powder, sucrose, or no carbon were hierarchically clustered. Analysis of these transcriptomic data revealed groups of genes that specifically responded to the presence of the three main plant cell-wall polysaccharides - cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin. Of approximately 160 genes encoding major facilitator superfamily (MFS)-type transporters in the <italic>N. crassa</italic> genome, only nine were found in the most pectin-specific cluster (10.1). Two of these, the allantoate permease (NCU02653) and the pantothenate transporter gene <italic>liz1</italic>, were considered to be less likely candidates due to their homology to non-sugar transporters and were omitted from further analyses. The induction by pectin versus sucrose (as a broadly repressing control condition) for the other seven candidates is depicted in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A. The three transporter genes with the strongest induction by pectin (&#x0003e;1,000-fold; log<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e;10) were NCU01132, NCU00988, and NCU01231. For these we tested whether they are specifically induced by D-GalA alone. To this end, cultures of <italic>N. crassa</italic> wild-type (WT) pre-grown in sucrose for 16&#x000a0;h were transferred to either no carbon (de-repression but no induction) or very low concentrations of D-GalA (2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) and incubated for another 4&#x000a0;h. Under these conditions we expected a highly specific response. As shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B, only the NCU00988 gene displayed a significant induction &#x0003e;2-fold over the starvation condition without added sugar, whereas NCU01132 and NCU01231 did not respond at all. Moreover, when grown on Vogel&#x02019;s medium with 1% citrus peel pectin as the sole carbon source, only the deletion strain for NCU00988 (&#x00394;0988) exhibited a marked delay in pectin consumption over time (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that NCU00988 is of major importance for pectin utilization in <italic>N. crassa</italic>, potentially through the transport of the backbone monosaccharide D-GalA. We therefore decided to rename NCU00988 as the most promising candidate gene <italic>gat-1</italic>, for <italic>g</italic>alacturonic <italic>a</italic>cid <italic>t</italic>ransporter-1.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Identification of NCU00988 as a candidate D-galacturonic acid (D-GalA) transporter.

The residual concentrations of the monosaccharides in the reaction supernatant were measured by high pH-anion exchange-chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) and plotted over time in Figures&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B and C. Whereas the transport speed for D-Gal was found to be WT-like in the &#x00394;<italic>gat-1</italic> strain (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C), the transport of both D-GalA and D-GlcA was almost completely abolished (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). These findings provide evidence that the physiological function of GAT-1 is indeed the transport of D-GalA (and the minor component D-GlcA) during fungal growth on pectin.</p></sec><sec><title>GAT-1 is required for D-GalA-mediated signaling processes in <italic>N. crassa</italic></title><p>The near-complete loss of all D-GalA transport activity in the &#x00394;<italic>gat-1</italic> deletion strain suggests that GAT-1 likely represents the only access route for D-GalA in <italic>N. crassa</italic>, at least under pectin-induced conditions. However, RNAseq data obtained after transfer of mycelia to either sucrose, no carbon, or pectin (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1) show that <italic>gat-1</italic> is not only strongly induced by pectin but also considerably de-repressed under starvation conditions, and therefore probably part of the carbon scouting machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. To assess whether the absence of GAT-1 would also have an impact on pectin or, more specifically, D-GalA-mediated signaling events, we analyzed the induction of one of the major polygalacturonase genes (<italic>gh28-2</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] in &#x00394;<italic>gat-1</italic> cultures versus the WT. For this purpose, sucrose pre-grown mycelia were transferred to either 0.5% pectin or 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M D-GalA for 4&#x000a0;h before harvesting of RNA and measuring the transcript abundance of <italic>gh28-2</italic> by quantitative qPCR (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

Genetic and biochemical analyses show that the <italic>N. crassa</italic> &#x00394;<italic>gat-1</italic> deletion strain is substantially affected in growth on pectic substrates and is unable to take up D-GalA from the medium. Moreover, expression of a <italic>gat-1</italic> construct in yeast conferred the ability for robust intracellular D-GalA accumulation rates, providing evidence for GAT-1 being a <italic>bona fide</italic> D-GalA transport protein. In view of the fact that the &#x00394;<italic>gat-1</italic> deletion strain is also impaired in D-GalA-mediated signaling events, this furthermore corroborates the notion of an activation system for pectinolytic genes responding to D-GalA ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and references therein) and strongly suggests that GAT-1 is an integral part of the D-GalA signaling system in <italic>N. crassa</italic> - either by taking up D-GalA as the signaling molecule (or a precurser thereof) or by acting as a receptor itself.</p><p>Several bacterial D-GalA transport systems have already been described, such as ExuT, TogT, TogMNAB and KdgM from <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Erwinia</italic>, a bacterial soft-rot causing plant pathogen. KdgM (a porin of the outer membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]), TogMNAB (an ABC superfamily member in the inner membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]) and TogT (an MFS-type transporter of the glycoside-pentoside-hexuronide (GPH) sub-family also located in the inner membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]) are responsible for D-GalA oligosaccharide transport, whereas ExuT was shown to exclusively transport monomeric D-GalA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Functionally, therefore, GAT-1 seems most similar to ExuT. Indeed, both are high-affinity transporters (K<sub>M</sub> of 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M for ExuT versus 1.2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M for GAT-1), display uptake rates in a very similar range (V<sub>max</sub> of 38&#x000a0;nmol&#x000a0;min<sup>-1</sup>&#x000a0;mg protein<sup>-1</sup> for ExuT versus 12.8&#x000a0;nmol&#x000a0;min<sup>-1</sup>&#x000a0;mg protein<sup>-1</sup> for GAT-1), transport D-GlcA in addition to D-GalA and are sensitive to the presence of uncouplers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. However, it is noteworthy to mention that the kinetic parameters of GAT-1 were recorded as super-folder (sf)GFP fusion protein heterologously expressed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and that therefore the behavior of the native protein in <italic>N. crassa</italic> might differ from these values. Despite belonging to the same MFS-type superfamily, ExuT (345 aa in <italic>E. chrysanthemi</italic>) and GAT-1 (537 aa in <italic>N. crassa</italic>) do not share any recognizable protein or sequence similarity and, therefore, have to be considered functional analogs.</p><p>Orthologs of GAT-1 (as well as the quinate permease) are found throughout species of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure S2), with the notable exception of <italic>Tuber melanosporum</italic>, which only seems to have a quinate permease and no additional homolog of GAT-1, and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, which does not have a clear ortholog of either. Our phylogenetic analysis shows that GAT-1 homologs can be clustered into three clades, each with representatives from both Ascomycota and Basidiomycota (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure S2). It furthermore suggests that the GAT-1-containing clade 1 and the quinate permease clade both share a common ancestor and are equally derived from clade 2 and the more distantly related clade 3. While this manuscript was in proof, Enquist-Newman <italic>et al</italic>. (2014) discovered another uronic acid transporter (DHT1 from <italic>Asteromyces cruciatus</italic>) for the uptake of the alginate monomer 4-deoxy-L-erythro-5-hexoseulose uronate (DEHU), which represents a homolog to GAT-1 and the quinic acid permeases and is another good example of the fact that these two transporter families are evolutionarily well related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>Considering the number of GAT-1 homologs per genome, <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> seems most diverse, having GAT-1 homologs in all three clades, whereas others, such as <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> and <italic>Trichoderma reesei</italic>, have one GAT-1 ortholog (in clade 1) and one or two paralogs in clade 2, respectively. Interestingly, <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> only has a clade-2 homolog to GAT-1. However, since the corresponding gene (An14g04280) has been previously shown to be co-regulated with genes involved in pectin degradation and D-GalA catabolism and failed to express in absence of <italic>gaaB</italic>, the hypothesis of it being a D-GalA transporter has been brought forward [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Additionally, Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. (2013) recently reported the An14g04280 homolog in <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> (<italic>BcHxt15</italic>) to be specifically induced by D-GalA and the corresponding mutant to be impaired in growth on D-GalA, which led them to suggest that BcHXT15 contributes to D-GalA uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Even though no representative has been properly biochemically characterized yet, considering these lines of evidence, it seems possible that the clade-2 homologs are also <italic>bona fide</italic> D-GalA transport proteins.</p><p>Regarding biotechnological applicability, we demonstrated a transporter-dependent conversion of D-GalA into two different molecules, L-GalOA and GalAA, by recombinantly expressing D-galacturonate reductase (GAAA) and uronate dehydrogenase (UDH) in yeast, respectively. GalAA is an isomer of glucaric acid, which was identified as a &#x0201c;top value-added chemical&#x0201d; in a report by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for its potential use as a building block for hydroxylated nylons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Consequently, GalAA is also likely to be capable of producing desirable hydroxylated nylons. L-GalOA on the other hand is reported to have similar properties to the commodity compound D-gluconic acid and correspondingly holds potential as a chelator in a variety of industries (for example cosmetic, pharmaceutical, food) and can also be used as a chemical precursor to L-ascorbic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Production of both of these chemicals was completely GAT-1-dependent at the low D-GalA concentrations typical for high-affinity transport (90&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M). Even at high D-GalA concentrations (100&#x000a0;mM/2%), at which non-specific uronic sugar uptake has been shown to be substantial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], expression of the transporter increased product accumulation roughly 2-fold over that observed in control strains at pH&#x000a0;6.0. Thus, D-GalA utilization can be improved over a broad concentration range in engineered yeast strains expressing a heterologous transporter. Interestingly, whereas production of GalAA was dependent on both GAT-1 and UDH, production of L-GalOA did not require heterologous expression of GAAA. Therefore, a basal level of native D-GalA reductase activity is present in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, though its origin remains unknown.</p><p>Utilization of D-GalA for the biosynthesis of biofuels, specifically ethanol, from pectin-rich feedstocks has been a focus of increasing attention in recent years.

After an additional 4&#x000a0;h, the mycelia were washed again as above and transferred into the uptake buffer (1 &#x000d7; Vogel&#x02019;s salts plus 90&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M monosaccharides or quinic acid, as indicated) for pre-equilibration and to reduce the dilution of the final uptake reaction. Two mycelia of the same genotype were combined into one well to increase the biomass at this stage. In the case of the addition of uncoupler, CCCP (in ethanol at the indicated concentrations; controls with ethanol only) was added at this stage and kept throughout the assay. After 5 minutes, the mycelia were transferred into fresh uptake buffer to start the reaction. Time points of the supernatants were usually taken at 0, 5, and up to 40 minutes. The samples were cleared by centrifugation (1&#x000a0;minute at 20,000 &#x000d7; g) and 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of the supernatant diluted into 450&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of DI water. The monosaccharide concentrations were then quantified by HPAEC-PAD (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Bannockburn, IL, USA): for neutral sugars, a sample size of 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L was injected onto a Dionex CarboPac PA20 column (3 &#x000d7; 30&#x000a0;mm guard and 3 &#x000d7; 150&#x000a0;mm analytical) and eluted at 30&#x000b0;C using an isocratic mobile phase of 18&#x000a0;mM KOH at 0.4&#x000a0;mL/minute over 11 minutes. For uronic acids, 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L was injected onto a Dionex CarboPac PA200 column (3 &#x000d7; 30&#x000a0;mm guard and 3 &#x000d7; 250&#x000a0;mm analytical) and eluted at 30&#x000b0;C using a 50&#x000a0;mM to 170&#x000a0;mM sodium acetate gradient (in 0.1&#x000a0;M NaOH) over 8 minutes at 0.4&#x000a0;mL/minutes.</p><p>For mass spectrometry (MS) detection of quinic acid, samples were injected onto a Rezex RFQ Fast Fruit H<sup>+</sup> (8%) (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) column (100 &#x000d7; 7.8&#x000a0;mm) and eluted at 55&#x000b0;C using an isocratic mobile phase of 0.5% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.3&#x000a0;mL/minute. An LTQ XL linear ion trap (Thermo Scientific) was used for MS and MS/MS detection in negative ion mode. The quinic acid precursor ion of m/z 191.2 was followed (isolation width m/z 2; CID setting 35; product scan range m/z 50 to 200), and for chromatogram processing the mass transition (MS/MS) of m/z 191.2 to m/z 127.2 was selected.</p></sec><sec><title>Yeast bioconversion assays</title><p>Yeast strains were grown as described above and harvested at mid-log phase. Cells were washed twice in &#x000bd; &#x000d7; Vogel&#x02019;s salts (pH&#x000a0;5.8) with 50&#x000a0;mM ethanol added as a non-fermentable carbon source and resuspended in a final volume to yield an optical density (OD)<sub>600</sub> of 20. To each experimental condition, 0.5&#x000a0;mL of concentrated cells were added to 24-well deep-well blocks and 0.5&#x000a0;mL of 2 &#x000d7; solution was added to yield a final concentration of &#x000bd; &#x000d7; Vogel&#x02019;s salts, 90&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M D-GalA (Fluka/Sigma-Aldrich 48280-F) and 50&#x000a0;mM ethanol at an OD<sub>600</sub> of 10. Blocks were incubated at 30&#x000b0;C with 750&#x000a0;rpm of shaking until the appropriate time point. Samples were cleared by centrifugation and the supernatant was prepared and analyzed as described above. Cell pellets were washed 2 &#x000d7; in cold DI water and freeze-dried in pre-weighed tubes to calculate dry cell weight. For assaying intracellular metabolites, desiccated yeast pellets were subjected to bead-beating (1&#x000a0;minute) in a Mini-Beadbeater-96 (Biospec) with an added 2:2:1 (v/v/v) ratio of chloroform, methanol and water. The aqueous phase was collected after centrifugation at 14,000&#x000a0;rpm for 10 minutes and was subsequently concentrated into 60&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of DI water after vacuum centrifugation. The resulting sample was used for MS and MS/MS detection as described above. The respective precursor ions and mass transitions followed were: D-GalA: m/z 193.1 to m/z 131.1, L-GalOA: m/z 195.1 to m/z 159.1; and GalAA: m/z 209.1 to m/z 85.1. For the calculation of intracellular metabolite concentrations, dry cell weight was converted to cell volume using the factor 2.2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L/mg dry weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>].</p><p>High-D-GalA concentration yeast bioconversions were performed in a similar manner as low-concentration uptake assays, but with some modifications. Cells were grown and harvested at mid-log and washed twice in 1 &#x000d7; PBS, pH&#x000a0;6.0, with an added 50&#x000a0;mM EtOH. The final cell suspensions in this buffer were adjusted to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 20 and 0.5&#x000a0;mL of cells were added to each condition in a 24 deep-well block in triplicate. To this, 0.5&#x000a0;mL of solution was added to yield 100&#x000a0;mM D-GalA in 1 &#x000d7; PBS (pH&#x000a0;6.0) with an OD<sub>600</sub> of 10. Blocks were incubated at 30&#x000b0;C with 750&#x000a0;rpm of shaking for 1&#x000a0;h. To assay for bioconversion products, a portion of the cell suspension was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and added as a 2:2:1 (v/v/v) ratio of chloroform, methanol and cell suspension. Washing the cell pellets was avoided to minimize product loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. A duplicate portion of cell suspension of each condition was lyophilized to calculate dry cell weight. Aqueous phase extraction and product detection proceeded as described above.</p></sec><sec><title>(<sup>3</sup>H)-Galacturonic acid transport assays in yeast</title><p>Transport assays were performed using a modified oil-stop method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. In short, yeast strains expressing <italic>gat-1</italic> fused to GFP were grown to an OD (600&#x000a0;nm) of 4.0 to 5.0 in selective media, washed 3 &#x000d7; with ice cold assay buffer (30&#x000a0;mM MES-NaOH (pH&#x000a0;5.6) and 50&#x000a0;mM ethanol), and resuspended to an OD of 40.0. To start transport reactions, 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of cells were added to 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of (<sup>3</sup>H)-D-GalA layered over 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of silicone oil (Sigma 85419). Reactions were stopped by spinning cells through oil for 1 minute at 17,000&#x000a0;g, tubes were frozen in ethanol/dry ice, and tube-bottoms containing the cell pellets were clipped off into 1&#x000a0;mL of 0.5&#x000a0;M NaOH. The pellets were solubilized overnight, 5&#x000a0;mL of Ultima Gold scintillation fluid added, and counts per minute (CPM) determined in a Tri-Carb 2900TR scintillation counter. (<sup>3</sup>H)-D-GalA was purchased from ViTrax, Inc. (Placentia, CA, USA), and had a specific activity of 25&#x000a0;Ci/mmol and a purity of &#x0003e;99%. Kinetic parameters were determined by measuring the linear rate of (<sup>3</sup>H)-D-GalA uptake over 3 minutes for D-GalA concentrations between 0.1 and 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M. V<sub>max</sub> and K<sub>M</sub> values were determined by fitting a &#x0201c;Ligand binding&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;one site saturation&#x0201d; function to a plot of rates versus D-GalA concentrations by non-linear regression in SigmaPlot&#x000ae;. V<sub>max</sub> values were normalized by total protein content using a Bradford assay. Kinetic parameters reported in the text are the mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD from three separate experiments.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CCCP: carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; D-Gal: D-galactose; D-GalA: D-galacturonic acid; GalAA: <italic>meso</italic>-galactaric acid (mucic acid); D-GlcA: D-glucuronic acid; DI: de-ionized; D-Xyl: D-xylose; GAAA: D-galacturonate reductase; GFP: green fluorescent protein; HG: homogalacturonan; HPAEC-PAD: high pH anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection; L-Ara: L-arabinose; LC-MS/MS: liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass-spectrometry; L-GalOA: L-galactonate; L-Rha: L-rhamnose; MFS: major facilitator superfamily; MS: mass spectrometry; NAD+: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NADPH: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced); OD: optical density; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PGA: poly-galacturonic acid; PGK1: phosphoglycerate kinase 1; qa: quinic acid; qPCR: quantitative PCR; RG-I: rhamnogalacturonan I; RG-II: rhamnogalacturonan II; RQ: relative transcript quantities; RT-PCR: reverse transcriptase PCR; sfGFP: super-folder green fluorescent protein; suc: sucrose; UDH: uronate dehydrogenase; WT: wild-type; XG: xylogalacturonan; YPD: yeast extract peptone dextrose.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>JPB initiated and coordinated the study, performed or was involved in all experiments and drafted the manuscript.
