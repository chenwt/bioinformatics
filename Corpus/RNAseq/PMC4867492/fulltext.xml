Patients with CRC expressing the highest Myb are more likely to relapse. We previously showed that mono-allelic loss of Myb in an <italic>Adenomatous polyposis coli</italic> (APC)-driven CRC mouse model (<italic>Apc</italic><sup><italic>Min/&#x0002b;</italic></sup>) significantly improves survival. Here we directly investigated the association of Myb with poor prognosis and how Myb co-operates with tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) (<italic>Apc</italic>) and cell cycle regulator, <italic>p27</italic>. Here we generated the first intestinal-specific, inducible transgenic model; a <italic>MybER</italic> transgene encoding a tamoxifen-inducible fusion protein between Myb and the estrogen receptor-&#x003b1; ligand-binding domain driven by the intestinal-specific promoter, <italic>Gpa33</italic>. This was to mimic human CRC with constitutive Myb activity in a highly tractable mouse model. We confirmed that the transgene was faithfully expressed and inducible in intestinal stem cells (ISCs) before embarking on carcinogenesis studies. Activation of the MybER did not change colon homeostasis unless one <italic>p27</italic> allele was lost. We then established that MybER activation during CRC initiation using a pro-carcinogen treatment, azoxymethane (AOM), augmented most measured aspects of ISC gene expression and function and accelerated tumorigenesis in mice. CRC-associated symptoms of patients including intestinal bleeding and anaemia were faithfully mimicked in AOM-treated <italic>MybER</italic> transgenic mice and implicated hypoxia and vessel leakage identifying an additional pathogenic role for Myb. Collectively, the results suggest that Myb expands the ISC pool within which CRC is initiated while co-operating with TSG loss. Myb further exacerbates CRC pathology partly explaining why high MYB is a predictor of worse patient outcome.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Aberrant activation of the WNT pathway (<italic>Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC</italic>) or &#x003b2;-catenin mutation) is the pre-eminent early event in colorectal cancers (CRC). Nevertheless, parallel activation of other oncogenes including <italic>MYB</italic> occurs commonly and is reasonably thought to participate in CRC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Furthermore, Myb and &#x003b2;-catenin cooperate to regulate the CRC genes <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>PTGS2 (COX2)</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> along with the intestinal stem cell (ISC) gene, <italic>LGR5</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> Elevated <italic>MYB</italic> transcripts are a common feature of CRC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> and high Myb protein is a poor-prognosis indicator.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> Others have identified <italic>MYB</italic> and WNT-target gene, <italic>AXIN2</italic> as among nine essential and differentially expressed genes in colon cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> However, although <italic>MYB</italic> is on occasion amplified in CRC it is rarely (if ever) found to have mutations in coding regions but rather in transcriptional regulatory regions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Thus, it remains unclear how <italic>MYB</italic> specifically participates in colorectal carcinogenesis.</p><p>The intestine is a rapidly self-renewing tissue maintained by ISCs. The colonic epithelium is composed of the absorptive and the secretory lineages continuously renewed by rapidly cycling intestinal progenitor cells (IPC) generated from ISC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> ISC are targets for transformation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> Two kinds of ISCs have been proposed; crypt basal cells (CBC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> and another, radiosensitive &#x0002b;4 ISCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> These share the expression of <italic>Musashi-1</italic>, <italic>Pten</italic> and <italic>Sox-9</italic> but can be discriminated by specific markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> such as <italic>Lgr5</italic> and <italic>Olfm4</italic> for CBCs or <italic>Hopx</italic>, <italic>Bmi1</italic> and <italic>mTert</italic> for &#x0002b;4 ISCs. These two populations of ISCs are phylogenetically related and can give rise to each other.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> IPCs also exhibit a high degree of phenotypic plasticity in emergency situations and can revert to a state of 'stem-ness'.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup></p><p>Deregulation of ISC signaling pathways are evident in intestinal cancer exemplified in the Wnt-driven <italic>Apc</italic><sup><italic>Min/&#x0002b;</italic></sup> mouse model,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> which recapitulates both genetic (<italic>Apc</italic> mutations) and environmental aspects (inflammation) of human CRC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> Importantly, activation of the Wnt pathway in either Lgr5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or Bmi1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ISCs but mostly not IPCs has been shown to initiate intestinal cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> Here we sought to understand why patients with high MYB have worse outcomes and we demonstrate the direct involvement of Myb in activating ISC gene expression, CRC initiation and progression. Accordingly, we generated a transgenic mouse with latent Myb function that can be activated to confer constitutive Myb activity throughout the intestinal epithelium including in the context of a Wnt-driven tumorigenesis model and loss of the cell cycle regulator p27. Importantly, this work revealed the effect of Myb in the ISC compartment, co-operation with tumor suppressor gene (TSG) loss and a new role for Myb in influencing hypoxia and <italic>Vegfa</italic> expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>MybER transgenic mice recapitulate constitutive Myb expression in CRC</title><p>We have shown that Myb is frequently elevated in CRC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> and that those patients with tumors that have the higher level of Myb had a commensurate poorer prognosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> This remains the case for even early stage CRC (pT3 or pT4N0M0) tumors (Millen <italic>et al.</italic>, submitted). Loss of Myb function leads to reduced IPC proliferation in the colon of adult mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> To test whether sustained Myb expression is pathogenic we enforced Myb activity, rather than its level of expression, in the gastrointestinal tract by taking advantage of the gastrointestinal tract-epithelial-specific expression pattern conferred by the <italic>Gpa33</italic> promoter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> A <italic>Gpa33</italic>-driven expression construct that fuses mouse Myb to a mutant ER&#x003b1; ligand-binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1a and b</xref>) was engineered to generate transgenic mice. Transgene DNA sequence integrity was confirmed as well as its tight negative control and sensitive induction by 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4OHT) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1b and c</xref>). Of six founders, two lines were used in experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Insertion of the several transgene copies was demonstrated by Southern blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), whereas MybER fusion protein expression was confirmed by western blotting with anti-ER&#x003b1; antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) as well as anti-Myb antibodies in colonic crypts to levels comparable to endogenous Myb found in colon cancer cell line, CT26<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> but is, as expected absent in WT crypts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> activation of MybER increases IPC function</title><p>To understand the cell intrinsic effect of MybER-activation in primary colon cells, IPC were studied <italic>in vitro</italic> using the organoid assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). MybER-activation led to an increase in organoids formed per plated crypt nest and greater growth as measured by MTT assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). Then to test whether activated Myb is important for organoid maintenance of superior colon organoid propagation MybER organoids were treated with 4OHT for the entire period of the primary culture before dissociation into single cells. Dissociated organoids were then challenged to grow in the presence or absence of 4OHT to test whether 4OHT-withdrawal affects secondary organoid formation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref> shows that organoids require sustained MybER-activation to achieve superior growth and that the effect of MybER-induction is reversible.</p><p>We then tested the promoter occupancy of a well-characterized Myb target gene <italic>Lgr5</italic> by MybER fusion protein in colonic crypts isolated from MybER mice exposed to tamoxifen or in untreated mice. Single-cell suspensions were cross-linked and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were then performed using anti-ER&#x003b1; antibody whereby the binding of MybER to <italic>Lgr5</italic> promoter was confirmed and this was further found to be tamoxifen-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>).</p><p>To dissect the effect of MybER-activation on different crypt cell compartments we conducted gene expression analysis in various cell population based on the activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase. Colonic stem cells have been shown to be characterized by high-aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. We analyzed the expression of cell cycle gene (<italic>CyclinE1</italic>; <italic>Ccne1</italic>) and ISC gene <italic>Lgr5</italic>, the TSG <italic>Pten</italic> and the pro-angiogenic gene <italic>Vegfa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) in populations with high (AldeHi), low (AldeLo) and no (AldeNEG) aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. Predicted Myb target genes, <italic>Lgr5</italic>, <italic>Ccne1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> and <italic>Pten</italic> (unpublished data) were elevated in various populations of cells. Notably <italic>Lgr5</italic> was elevated in both AldeHi and AldeLo population in contrast to <italic>Vegfa</italic> and <italic>Ccne1</italic>, which were elevated in AldeHi population and <italic>Pten,</italic> which was significantly induced only in the AldeLo population.</p><p>To evaluate the role of Myb-activation during tumor initiation and progression we established organoid cultures from early stage adenomas in non-symptomatic <italic>MybER:Apc</italic><sup><italic>min/&#x0002b;</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Our results demonstrate that activated MybER is required at least during the first 48&#x02009;h of initiation of culture to significantly increase organoid numbers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 2a&#x02013;c</xref>). Sustained MybER-activation was also required to achieve optimal growth, whereas 4OHT-withdrawal abrogated the enhanced growth of MybER adenoma organoids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 2a and c</xref>). These data suggest that Myb is required to support both maximum adenoma initiation and progression and that the effects of MybER-activation are reversible.</p><p>By using adenomas from <italic>MybER:Apc</italic><sup><italic>min/&#x0002b;</italic></sup> mice we were also able to establish cultures of relatively uniform cells that typically express the Wnt and Myb target gene, <italic>Lgr5</italic> and ask whether modulating MybER activity with 4-OHT affects <italic>Lgr5</italic> expression. Data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> confirm that this strategy shows <italic>Lgr5</italic> expression is subject to the ON/OFF control by MybER activity even in the context of activated Wnt signaling.</p></sec><sec><title>Activated Myb <italic>in vivo</italic> does not change IPC homeostasis unless p27 is lost</title><p><italic>In vivo</italic> effects of sustained Myb activity on crypt morphology was investigated along with proliferation. We found that the crypt morphology was largely unaltered following MybER-activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 3a</xref>). Furthermore, IPC proliferation was similar to that prior to tamoxifen-treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 3b</xref>). Two weeks of Tamoxifen produced modest but not significant effects on proliferation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 3a, d and e</xref>) when PCNA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were scored according to crypt location or total number.</p><p>In view of such modest effects of activated MybER alone we postulated that homeostatic mechanisms might be restricting the <italic>in vivo</italic> effect of elevated Myb activity particularly in view of the increased <italic>Ccne1</italic> expression in the colons of all <italic>MybER</italic> transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 3c</xref>). As <italic>Pten</italic> mRNA expression was elevated in the AldeLo progenitor/precursor population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) we decided to explore Pten expression at the protein level <italic>in vivo</italic> within crypts finding significantly higher expression in MybER mice treated with tamoxifen compared with similarly treated controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). These observations are consistent with reduced <italic>Pten</italic> expression observation in <italic>Myb</italic>-hypomorphic mutant colons (unpublished observations). As Pten is a negative regulator of the cell cycle and is molecularly considered upstream of p27<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> and that p27 in turn is a negative-regulator of Cdk/CyclinE1 activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> we hypothesized that WT levels of p27 might mask effects of <italic>MybER in vivo.</italic> Accordingly, we established compound <italic>MybER:p27</italic><italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. As expected we found p27 was reduced in both <italic>p27</italic><italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>p27</italic><italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic><italic>:MybER</italic> colons. We also found that its expression was strongly induced in discrete population of cells located at the bottom of the crypts in <italic>MybER</italic> colon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 5a</xref>).</p><p>Although crypts of <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice show increased proliferation, this was not observed in <italic>p27</italic><italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> where IPC proliferation was comparable to WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 6b, d and e</xref>); however, analysis of proliferation in <italic>p27</italic><italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic><italic>:MybER</italic> colons using immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed a significant increase in the total number of PCNA-positive cells, more remained in cycle up to crypt positions 14 compared with tamoxifen-treated WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 6b, d and e</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that p27 loss may increase the number of CyclinE1-positive cells. To confirm reduced p27 expression in <italic>p27</italic><italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic><italic>:MybER</italic> mouse we performed p27 IHC. We found that p27 is prominently expressed in the IPC zone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 5a</xref>). Quantitation of CyclinE1 IHC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 5b</xref>) showed that the number of CyclinE1-positive cells was not increased by MybER-activation alone. By contrast, when MybER was activated in <italic>p27</italic><italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice their number was significantly increased.</p></sec><sec><title>Activated Myb accelerates AOM-driven tumorigenesis</title><p>In view of this association between elevated Myb and CRC patient outcome patients we treated <italic>MybER</italic> mice with tamoxifen for an extended period of time (7 months) and at this point started to detect sick mice that once examined revealed elevated aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and a modest increase in colon tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3a and b</xref>). The cooperation we had previously found between Myb and activated &#x003b2;-catenin in driving <italic>Myc</italic>, <italic>Cox-2</italic> and <italic>Lgr5</italic> expression in the GI prompted us to generate compound <italic>MybER:Apc</italic><sup><italic>min/&#x0002b;</italic></sup> mice. Cohorts of these mice were exposed to tamoxifen but their disease-free survival was not different to <italic>Apc</italic><sup><italic>min/&#x0002b;</italic></sup> mice alone on tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>).</p><p>As we have found that inflammation appears to be responsible for an increase Myb expression during early events of CRC, for example, ACF and adenoma formation (Pereira <italic>et al.</italic>, in press) prior to detectable mutated <italic>Myb</italic> regulatory sequences we decided to activate Myb in the initiation phase of CRC. MybER mice were treated with tamoxifen over a period of 8 weeks, six of which also employed weekly colon carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM) injections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Hence, MybER was activated for 2 weeks prior to AOM-treatment to allow the expansion of the ISC pool. To demonstrate this we have employed the Aldefluor assay following tamoxifen-treatment for 2 weeks, to identify colonic ISC. Such cells have been shown to act as tumor-initiating precursor cells in the colon and to be responsible for the transition from colitis to cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> As predicted, we found that this population was expanded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>).</p><p>Subsequent exposure of tamoxifen-treated mice to AOM markedly accelerated colon tumorigenesis in MybER mice on either WT or <italic>Apc</italic><sup><italic>min/&#x0002b;</italic></sup> backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>) and led to more frequent, as well as larger tumors, on an <italic>Apc</italic><sup><italic>min/&#x0002b;</italic></sup> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). As Myb overexpression or <italic>Apc</italic> mutation both drive proliferation and block cyto-differentiation in colon cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> we evaluated PCNA staining and indirectly explored the state of goblet cell differentiation by measuring the extent of mucin staining in tumors with Period Acid Schiffs (PAS). Mucin production was significantly reduced in <italic>MybER</italic> tumors compared with AOM-induced tumors from WT mice, whereas only a trend toward increased proliferation was evident in the presence of MybER activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3h&#x02013;j</xref>).</p><p>To characterize the molecular profile of the tumors arising in the context of the <italic>MybER in vivo</italic> following AOM-treatment, we performed quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR analyses.

Our transgenic mice use a fusion construct that essentially truncates the Myb protein. This was necessary to allow the ER ligand-binding domain to be tightly modulated by Tamoxifen. With specific reference to CRC recent insights into how this oncogenic potential might be driven, and in what cells, come from studies such as those that show that loss of Myb function decreased ISC activity and proliferation plus improved survival of <italic>Apc</italic><sup><italic>Min/&#x0002b;</italic></sup> mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> Although loss of Myb function was effective in instilling a loss of ISC activity by itself this is the first occasion where the effect of Myb hyperactivation has been evaluated. First, the full effects of hyperactivated-Myb on ISC function under homeostasis was only achieved, when at the same time, one allele of CyclinE1-Cdk inhibiting <italic>p27</italic> gene was lost.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> This was consistent with our previous work suggesting that <italic>p27</italic> complete loss resulted in increased proliferation in colonic crypt IPCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> We also suggest that the effect of p27 haploinsufficiency on intestinal homeostasis is achieved by allowing CyclinE1 to exert its pro-proliferative action on IPCs. Although MybER-induced tumorigenicity in mice by itself required extended periods of time (~6&#x02013;7 months), it is markedly increased with AOM-treatment <italic>and on a Apc</italic><sup><italic>min</italic></sup><italic><sup>&#x000b1;</sup></italic> background. These collective observations clearly demonstrate that Myb needs to act in concert with other factors in keeping with the generally accepted view that CRC requires multiple oncogenic 'hits'.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup></p><p><italic>Apc</italic><sup><italic>min/&#x0002b;</italic></sup><italic>:MybER</italic> compound mice were not without complexities as the <italic>Min</italic> mutation does progressively compromise the hematological and immunological competency, which is very likely to accelerate the progressive decline of mice carrying tumors evident in 80-day-old mice and to modulate the aetiology of clinical symptoms such as blood loss and anaemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> Accordingly, the use of the intestinal-specific activation of Myb alone in the tumor induction phase (first ~60 days) in the presence of AOM-treatment and with the knowledge that induced-MybER expands the ISC compartment may explain the shortened time to cull of <italic>MybER</italic> mice compared with WT littermates (160 vs 273 days, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). By contrast in mice on an <italic>Apc</italic><sup><italic>min/&#x0002b;</italic></sup> background, mice when treated with AOM require culling on average at 95 days and only slightly (but significantly) earlier, when MybER is activated (average at 90 days).</p><p>Interestingly, some mice required euthanizing much earlier in the <italic>Apc</italic><sup><italic>min/&#x0002b;</italic></sup><italic>:MybER</italic> cohort than the <italic>Apc</italic><sup><italic>min/&#x0002b;</italic></sup>alone cohort. The co-morbidities that arise because of systemic effects of the <italic>Min</italic> mutation highlight the need to investigate ACF and tumor burden at specific times following AOM-treatment particularly when the presence of SI adenomas inherent to this mouse genotype compromise the health of <italic>Apc</italic><sup><italic>min/&#x0002b;</italic></sup> mice.</p><p>Using combinations of mice with TSG defects we observed that the Pten/p27 axis might be responsible for keeping Myb activity in-check presumably via CyclinE1/Cdk2 inhibition. However, although <italic>p27</italic> monoallelic-loss increases IPC proliferation as seen in extended PCNA staining in colonic crypts, this did not influence MybER oncogenic potential. Thus, it is rather unlikely that Pten/p27 influences the ability of Myb to promote ISC properties in adenomas. On the other hand, Myb clearly acts in concert with <italic>Apc</italic><sup><italic>Min</italic></sup> to enhance ISC activity and gene expression in normal and tumor tissue, a property ultimately responsible for adenoma formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup></p><p>In this study, we found that Myb-activation co-operates with mutational events induced by AOM to faithfully reproduce human clinical symptoms of CRC better than found in <italic>Apc</italic><sup><italic>Min</italic></sup> mice.
