We have sequenced the 63 Mb genome of the fresh water fish pathogen, <italic>Saprolegnia parasitica.</italic> Approximately 1/3 of the assembled genome exhibits loss of heterozygosity, indicating an efficient mechanism for revealing new variation. Comparison of <italic>S. parasitica</italic> with plant pathogenic oomycetes suggests that during evolution the host cellular environment has driven distinct patterns of gene expansion and loss in the genomes of plant and animal pathogens. <italic>S. parasitica</italic> possesses one of the largest repertoires of proteases (270) among eukaryotes that are deployed in waves at different points during infection as determined from RNA-Seq data. In contrast, despite being capable of living saprotrophically, parasitism has led to loss of inorganic nitrogen and sulfur assimilation pathways, strikingly similar to losses in obligate plant pathogenic oomycetes and fungi. The large gene families that are hallmarks of plant pathogenic oomycetes such as <italic>Phytophthora</italic> appear to be lacking in <italic>S. parasitica</italic>, including those encoding RXLR effectors, Crinkler's, and Necrosis Inducing-Like Proteins (NLP). <italic>S. parasitica</italic> also has a very large kinome of 543 kinases, 10% of which is induced upon infection. Moreover, <italic>S. parasitica</italic> encodes several genes typical of animals or animal-pathogens and lacking from other oomycetes, including disintegrins and galactose-binding lectins, whose expression and evolutionary origins implicate horizontal gene transfer in the evolution of animal pathogenesis in <italic>S. parasitica</italic>.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Fish are an increasingly important source of animal protein globally, with aquaculture production rising dramatically over the past decade. <italic>Saprolegnia</italic> is a fungal-like oomycete and one of the most destructive fish pathogens, causing millions of dollars in losses to the aquaculture industry annually. <italic>Saprolegnia</italic> has also been linked to a worldwide decline in wild fish and amphibian populations. Here we describe the genome sequence of the first animal pathogenic oomycete and compare the genome content with the available plant pathogenic oomycetes.

<italic>Saprolegnia</italic> species are watermolds or oomycetes that are endemic to probably all fresh water ecosystems. These understudied pathogens can cause destructive diseases of amphibians, crustaceans, fish and insects in aquaculture and in natural environments worldwide <xref rid="pgen.1003272-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003272-VanWest1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. With the rise of fish as a principal source of animal protein, and the decline of wild fish stocks, aquaculture production has increased on average by 11% per year worldwide over the past ten years (FAO Fishery Information). Intensive aquatic farming practices have resulted in explosive growth in pathogen populations, which has been exacerbated by the ban of malachite green as a pesticide. Losses due to microbial, parasitic and viral infections are the largest problem in fish farms nowadays, and have a significant effect on animal welfare and sustainability of the industry. The salmon farming industry is particularly affected by <italic>Saprolegnia parasitica</italic>. This pathogen causes Saprolegniosis (also known as Saprolegniasis), a disease characterized by visible grey or white patches of mycelium on skin and fins, and subsequent penetration of mycelium into muscles and blood vessels <xref rid="pgen.1003272-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003272-Bruno1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. It is estimated that 10% of all hatched salmon succumb to <italic>Saprolegnia</italic> infections and losses are estimated at tens of millions of dollars annually <xref rid="pgen.1003272-VanWest1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In addition to the damage to the aquaculture industry, the declines of natural salmonid populations have also been attributed to <italic>Saprolegnia</italic> infections <xref rid="pgen.1003272-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. More in-depth knowledge of the epidemiology, biology and pathology of the pathogen is urgently needed. A draft genome sequence of <italic>S. parasitica</italic> provides an excellent starting point to investigate the disease process at the molecular and cellular level and may lead to novel avenues for sustainable control of Saprolegniosis.</p><p>Animal pathogens have evolved independently multiple times in lineages such as Stramenopila, Alveolata, Amebozoa, Euglenozoa and Mycota, as well as in numerous bacterial lineages. Oomycetes such as <italic>Saprolegnia</italic> belong to the kingdom Stramenopila (Patterson, 1989), syn. Straminipila (Dick, 2001), that includes photosynthetic algae such as kelp and diatoms, ubiquitous saprotrophic flagellates such as <italic>Cafeteria roenbergensis</italic>, and obligate mammalian parasites such as <italic>Blastocystis</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003272-Denoeud1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003272-Patterson1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Although many <italic>Saprolegnia</italic> and related species are capable of causing diseases on a wide range of animal hosts including humans, relatively little is known about their mechanisms of pathogenicity. Among the oomycetes, most animal pathogens including <italic>S. parasitica</italic> belong to the class Saprolegniomycetidae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003272-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The oomycetes also include many plant pathogens and these are mainly concentrated within the class Peronosporomycetidae. There are a small number of interesting exceptions to this otherwise sharp dichotomy, including the mammalian pathogen <italic>Pythium insidiosum</italic> (Peronosporomycetidae) and the plant pathogens <italic>Aphanomyces euteiches</italic> and <italic>Aphanomyces cochlioides</italic> (Saprolegniomycetidae) <xref rid="pgen.1003272-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003272-DieguezUribeondo1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003272-Tyler1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><fig id="pgen-1003272-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1003272.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Taxonomy and ancestral genomic features in <italic>S. parasitica</italic>.</title><p>

A combination of 454 (fragment and 3 kb jumping libraries) and Sanger (Fosmid library) sequencing data (&#x0223c;50-fold average read coverage) were used to assemble the genome, yielding an initial assembly length of 53 Mb and a scaffold N50 length of 281 kb (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003272.s013">Table S1</xref> for additional assembly statistics).

Pectin is a major constituent of plant cell walls and a target for extracellular enzymes produced by pathogenic and saprophytic microorganisms. Plant pathogenic fungi and oomycetes produce a large array of enzymes to degrade pectin, including polygalacturonase (PG), pectin and pectate lyases (PL), and pectin methylesterases (PME). Animal cells lack a cell wall, and as might be expected, the pathogen <italic>S. parasitica</italic> encodes very few cell wall degrading enzymes in its genome. Genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes such as cutinase and pectin methyl esterases appear to be absent, and PL and PG genes are greatly reduced in numbers as compared to plant pathogenic oomycetes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003272-t002">Table 2</xref>).

The largest groups are proteins carrying ankyrin domains or lectin domains, which suggests the importance of protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interactions in the initial stages of host colonization. Another group of proteins belonging to this category are transporters such as ion transporters and sodium symporters, suggesting that metabolic exchange processes are active during the establishment of early infection.</p><p>The RNA-Seq data also suggest that the very large <italic>S. parasitica</italic> kinome plays an important role during the infection process.

One group of peptidases (6%) was expressed in germinating cysts. These include subtilase proteins (SPRG_15005) that carry ricin lectin domains and are highly expressed in germinating cysts. A large group of peptidases (19%) were induced during the interaction with fish cells. There are 7 protease-inhibitors encoded in the genome; and they also showed patterns of differential expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003272-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).

Several of these proteins seem to be unique to <italic>S. parasitica</italic> and may have evolved to interact specifically with fish cells. They are predicted to be targeted to the extracellular environment or incorporated into the exterior surface of the pathogen. Several of the proteins contain CBM domains (fungal cellulose binding domain), ricin-like domains, Notch-like domains and/or various peptidase domains. Most putative early interaction proteins have potential roles in pathogenesis, such as animal-cell-surface-like proteins (disintegrin, gal_lectin) and haemolysin E toxin-like proteins. Lectins could help cysts to bind to host skin. Since the lectins are highly expressed during the initial and later infection stages, we hypothesize that they play an important role in cell-cell contact throughout the interaction. This would also suggest that an intimate contact with the host cell is required for pathogenesis, suppression of host defence processes, and/or nutrient uptake. Following attachment, the pathogen engages a large arsenal of potential virulence factors in the form of proteases to attack the host tissue. Interestingly, <italic>S. parasitica</italic> has one of the largest numbers of proteases found in any organism. At least one protease (SPRG_14567) was found to be able to degrade IgM, suggesting an active role in suppressing initial immune responses, as fish IgM's are able to bind to infection related antigens, even in the absence of prior immunization.</p><p>In comparison to plant pathogenic oomycetes, <italic>S. parasitica</italic> has no canonical RXLR or Crinkler effector genes, nor NLP toxin genes in its genome. Nevertheless, one small protein family has been found for which one member was shown to translocate inside trout cells <xref rid="pgen.1003272-VanWest1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003272-Wawra1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, which suggests that the interaction of <italic>S. parasitica</italic> with its hosts is more subtle than a simple necrotrophic interaction based on secretion of toxins and protein degradation. In fact, we speculate that the initial stages of the interaction may involve a more &#x02018;biotrophic&#x02019; approach by the pathogen, whereby the immune response of the host is avoided or even suppressed during initial colonization via, for example, proteases or effector proteins. Following this biotrophic stage, the host tissue is bombarded with proteases, lipases, and lysing enzymes. If <italic>S. parasitica</italic> was a plant pathogen, it would thus have been classified as a &#x02018;hemi-biotroph&#x02019; and not a saprotroph as its name would suggest. Further experiments are required to demonstrate that this is indeed the case.</p><p>Pathogenicity towards animals has evolved independently in both the fungi and oomycetes. It has also evolved at least three additional times within the kingdom Stramenopila: within the Pythiales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003272-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), within the genus <italic>Aphanomyces</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003272-DieguezUribeondo1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and in the non-oomycete <italic>Blastocystis</italic>. Analyses of the genomes or sequenced ESTs of these other pathogens reveals some interesting parallels. For example, based on only a small set of ESTs of the oomycete human pathogen <italic>Py. insidiosum</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003272-Krajaejun1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, an identified expressed lectin CBM-encoded transcript has been implicated in the process of pathogenesis. <italic>Blastocystis hominis</italic> is a Stramenopile human pathogen with a very small genome of 19 Mb encoding only 6020 genes, and is phylogenetically very divergent from oomycetes <xref rid="pgen.1003272-Denoeud1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Despite the large evolutionary distance, the genome of <italic>Blastocystis</italic> shows reduction of nitrogen and sulfite metabolic pathways, similar to what is seen in obligate plant pathogens. In addition, similar to the acquired lectins in <italic>S. parasitica</italic>, <italic>Blastocystis</italic> has also horizontally transferred genes with animal like features, such as genes encoding Ig domains <xref rid="pgen.1003272-Denoeud1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The fungal pathogen <italic>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</italic> that causes global amphibian decline, inhabits an aquatic environment like <italic>S. parasitica</italic>, and also causes diseases on animal skin and tissues. Analysis of its genome revealed patterns of expansion of protease families <xref rid="pgen.1003272-Rosenblum1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. Although the particular families are different, <italic>B. dendrobatidis</italic> possesses several families of lineage expanded proteases such as metallopeptidase (M36).</p><p>The extensive LOH observed in <italic>S. parasitica</italic>, covering approximately one-third of the genome and also the high rate of polymorphism (2.6%) in the remainder of the genome are similar to recent observations in the genome of the oomycete plant pathogen <italic>Phytophthora capsici</italic>, where LOH was found to be associated with changes in mating type and pathogenicity <xref rid="pgen.1003272-Lamour1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. We speculate that, as in <italic>P. capsici</italic>, LOH may provide a mechanism in <italic>S. parasitica</italic> for rapidly expressing diversity within a population, fixing alleles, and enabling rapid adaptation to its environment.</p><p>The evolution of plant and animal pathogenesis in oomycetes has been associated with several major molecular events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003272-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Since both <italic>Phytophthora</italic> and <italic>Saprolegnia</italic> have large kinomes, the expansion of kinases is likely a relatively early event in oomycete evolution. The comparison of the animal pathogen <italic>S. parasitica</italic> with plant pathogens with different lifestyles has shown that surviving on ammonium rich tissue has led to a reduction of metabolic pathways independently in <italic>S. parasitica</italic> and obligate oomycete plant pathogens. Similar reductions have also occurred in obligate fungal pathogens <xref rid="pgen.1003272-McDowell1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref> and in the distantly related stramenopile human pathogen <italic>Blastocystis</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003272-Denoeud1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The evolution of plant pathogenicity has been associated with a series of reduction events such as intron loss, chitin loss and sterol loss. Some of these losses may be due to evasion of plant immunity; for example chitin can act as a PAMP to trigger plant defense responses. The evolution of plant pathogens has been accompanied by expansions of large repertoires of effectors, which have been shown to modulate plant host physiology. In contrast, the development of animal pathogenesis has been facilitated by expansion of proteases and horizontally acquired lectins and toxins.</p><fig id="pgen-1003272-g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1003272.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Molecular genetic events associated with the evolution of animal and plant pathogenesis in oomycetes.</title><p>The lineages of animal pathogens are colored red and the lineages of plant pathogens are colored green.

For chitin metabolism analysis, genes were annotated based on Pfam homology (E value&#x0003c;1e-5) with the exception of chitin synthase genes, which were identified after Blastp analysis against a set of oomycete and fungal CHS. A total of twelve GH18 genes were identified, of which six are arranged in small clusters of two paralogous genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4k"><title>Horizontal gene transfer analysis</title><p>Two different approaches were used to screen <italic>S. parasitica</italic> genes for candidate HGT origins. In the first approach, the genome sequence was screened with the program Alien_hunter <xref rid="pgen.1003272-Vernikos1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. The program utilizes an interpolated variable order motif method to determine horizontally transferred events, purely based on compositional difference between a region and the whole genome framework. Because the methodology is independent of any existing datasets, we used it to examine the <italic>S. parasitica</italic> genome. Genomic regions were identified as alien when the Alien_hunter score was above 50. Out of 1442 <italic>S. parasitica</italic> supercontigs, 206 supercontigs had distinct regions marked as alien after running Alien_hunter. Subsequently, the 1616 gene models that lay within the candidate alien regions were extracted and compared with other oomycete genomes (<italic>P. sojae</italic>, <italic>P. ramorum</italic>, <italic>P. infestans</italic>, <italic>H. arabidopsidis</italic> and <italic>Py. ultimum</italic>). In the second approach, the entire proteome of each oomycete was scanned for homology to Pfam-A protein families using the hmmscan algorithm from Hmmer 3.0 applied to the Hidden Markov Model dataset (Pfam-A.hmm v.24). A cut-off e-value threshold of 1e-3 was applied. From the Pfam domain analysis we obtained 307 sequences that had distinct domains not found in any of the <italic>Phytophthora</italic> species, and 31 of the candidates derived from the Pfam analysis overlapped with the results from Alien_hunter. We then blast-searched all 1616 genes from Alien_hunter and the 307 genes from the domain analysis against the NCBI non-redundant database (nr) to obtain the primary functions. Phylogenetic analysis using neighbor joining was then performed on the final set of genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4l"><title>Analysis of secreted proteases</title><p>

The culture supernatants were harvested, centrifuged at 5000&#x000d7; g for 10 min (4&#x000b0;C) and the soluble fraction used as a source of secreted proteases. The ammonium sulfate precipitated fraction from rainbow trout serum <xref rid="pgen.1003272-Hudson1" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref> was used as source of fish IgM (10 mg/mL of total protein concentration). For protease activity experiments, 50 &#x000b5;L of the culture supernatants were incubated overnight at 10&#x000b0;C with 5 &#x000b5;L of the IgM enriched fraction. Pea broth was used as a negative control. Heat-inactivated supernatant was obtained by incubating the culture supernatants for 15 min at 95&#x000b0;C.
