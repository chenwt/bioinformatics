Optical clearing agents can decrease the amount of scattered light and therefore increases the depth of penetration. Most optical clearing agents work by replacing the low refractive index, aqueous components of the tissue with agents of a higher refractive index to match that of the tissue such as collagen and cell components. Because each tissue has unique properties, such as density of cells and extracellular matrix, the optimum tissue clearing method must be determined empirically.

For the Zeiss LSM780 we found the best available objective was a Zeiss LD LCI Plan-Apo 25x/0.8 multi-immersion objective lens, which has a 570 &#x003bc;m working distance. We used Immersol 518F immersion oil for Zeiss LSM780 imaging. For the Leica SP8, we used an HCX APO L20x/0.95 BABB immersion objective with a 1.95 mm working distance. High resolution imaging of large volumes of thick tissue by acquisition of tiled Z-stacks is very time consuming, thus it was important to optimize the acquisition settings for each microscope to minimize acquisition time while preserving adequate resolution and signal to noise ratio. On the Zeiss LSM780 images were taken at 512X512 pixel resolution with 2 &#x003bc;m Z-steps, pinhole for the internal detector at 47.7 &#x003bc;m. Bone was imaged by second-harmonic generation (SHG) with 850 nm pulsed NIR excitation using the nondescanned detector. On the Leica SP8, images were taken using the resonance scanner using 8X line averaging with the minimum zoom of 1.25X at 812X812 pixel resolution, pinhole at 44.7 &#x003bc;m, and 2&#x003bc;m Z-steps.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Image annotation and analysis</title><p id="P43">Confocal tiled Z-stack images were rendered in 3 dimensions and analyzed using Bitplane Imaris v7.7.1 software installed on a Dell Precision T7610 64-bit workstation with Dual Intel Xeon Processor E5-2687W v2 (Eight Core HT, 3.4GHz Turbo, 25 MB),128GB RAM, and 16 GB AMD FirePro W9100 graphics card. Individual <italic>&#x003b1;-catulin</italic>-GFP<sup>+</sup>c-kit<sup>+</sup> HSCs were identified using the Ortho slicer function in Imaris software to visualize digital serial sections of the large 3D image. We identified HSCs as having a round morphology, with GFP throughout the cell, and c-kit expression surrounding the cell surface. These criteria prevented false positive identification of cellular debris or <italic>&#x003b1;-catulin</italic>-GFP<sup>+</sup>c-kit<sup>&#x02212;</sup> endothelial cells with elongated cell body morphology. HSC coordinates and size were interactively annotated using the Imaris spots function in manual mode. Bone and non-myelinating Schwann cells were segmented based on thresholding of the second harmonic generation (SHG, which detects collagen fibers in bone) or GFAP channels, respectively, using the Imaris surface function. Cortical and trabecular bone were then divided into separate surfaces interactively based on SHG signal and morphology. We used anti-laminin antibodies to immunofluorescently label all of the vasculature within the bone marrow. Arteries, arterioles, and capillaries have continuous basement membranes, which are observable as uniform laminin staining. In contrast, bone marrow sinusoids have a discontinuous fenestrated basement membrane<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. Laminin staining of sinusoids clearly demonstrates discontinuous basement membranes, thereby allowing unambiguous identification of sinusoidal vessels in the absence of other markers<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. Because we were able to image the entire marrow cavity we were able to trace and digitally label each artery and all of its subsequent branching into smaller arteries and arterioles as they approached the endosteal surface. This is a great advantage of the deep imaging approach that allowed us to unambiguously identify vessels in a way that is not possible in thin sections where the connectivity of vessels cannot be traced.</p><p id="P44">Near the endosteum, arterioles connect to the smallest diameter vessels of the capillary network that line the endosteum. These capillaries then connect to larger diameter sinusoidal vessels. By carefully following the blood vessel paths in six samples, we determined that in the diaphysis the outer 20% of the marrow by volume contained all of the vessels involved in the transition from arteriole to sinusoid, i.e. the most distal portion of the arterioles, the connecting capillaries, and the initial portion of sinusoids. We identified this region as the transition zone in keeping with published criteria<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Therefore, we used the published morphological characteristics of orientation, location, and basement membrane continuity to subdivide blood vessels within the bone marrow. The Imaris surface function was used to create three distinct digital surfaces corresponding to each type of blood vessel. SHG signal was used to create bone surfaces. Three dimensional distances between HSCs and digital vessel or bone surfaces were calculated using the Imaris Distance Transform Matlab XTension and volumetric decile calculations were performed using a Matlab-based Imaris XTension.

In a 16 bit Imaris file of the original bone marrow image, 3 dimensional voxels were represented by signal intensity values that ranged between 0 and 65,535. Those signal intensity values were imported into MATLAB using the imreadBF package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/32920-imread-for-multiple-life-science-image-file-formats">http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/32920-imread-for-multiple-life-science-image-file-formats</ext-link>) and the Bio-Formats software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/products/bio-formats">http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/products/bio-formats</ext-link>). The images were filtered to exclude low-intensity regions that included blood vessel lumens and fat bodies where HSCs were not found and random spots were not generated. The intensity-filtered images, of which the excluded portions were given zero intensity values, were processed with MATLAB&#x02019;s median filter to remove salt-and-pepper noise. Then the intensity images were converted to binary signals by turning any non-zero intensity value into &#x0201c;one&#x0201d;. Those &#x0201c;one&#x0201d; signals were used to determine the voxel locations that were used to generate random spots. The locations were randomly permuted, and enough random spot coordinates were designated to approximate the random spot distribution (more than 50,000 per bone). The random spot coordinates were transferred to Imaris to generate the random spots, and distances from random spots to cell types or landmarks in the bone marrow were calculated based on the distance transformation files generated using landmark surfaces such as arterioles, sinusoids, transition zone vessels, and bone. We confirmed the randomness of the distribution of the random spots by measuring the frequency of random spots in each percentile of bone marrow volume. Random spots were given a diameter of 6 microns, similar to the observed average HSC diameter.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Statistical methods</title><p id="P46">To assess whether the distribution of HSCs significantly differed from random spots with respect to particular bone marrow landmarks, we used a normalized 2-sample Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test.
