Seedling establishment is dependent upon high seed vigour, which is required to cope with the variable seedbed conditions experienced in agriculture (Finch&#x02010;Savage, <xref rid="nph14102-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>). However, the causes of variation in seed vigour are not fully understood and in particular its genetic basis is unclear (Finch&#x02010;Savage &#x00026; Bassel, <xref rid="nph14102-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). To have an impact on this problem it was essential to study vigour traits that have reproducible effects in agricultural practice. These traits were examined previously in extensive field and laboratory studies to develop an approach to identifying genes that regulate seed vigour in <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> (Finch&#x02010;Savage <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="nph14102-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>) This work suggested that a strategy of stress avoidance, through rapid germination and subsequent rapid pre&#x02010;emergence seedling growth, has an advantage in agriculture over stress tolerance alone. Speed of germination is therefore a key phenotype of vigorous seeds and is known to differ with genetic background.</p><p>Mutations in many genes have been identified that show phenotypes with altered seed germination performance, and these have been instrumental in developing our current understanding of the control of germination (Finch&#x02010;Savage &#x00026; Leubner&#x02010;Metzger, <xref rid="nph14102-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Weitbrecht <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="nph14102-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Graeber <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="nph14102-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) and of seed vigour (Hilhorst &#x00026; Toorop, <xref rid="nph14102-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>; Rajjou <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="nph14102-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Finch&#x02010;Savage &#x00026; Bassel, <xref rid="nph14102-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). However, the relative impact of these genes on wild&#x02010;type or crop seed performance is poorly understood and no clear candidates have been revealed that will form the basis of a discriminating test for seed vigour. Natural populations and contrasting crop genotypes offer an alternative source of genetic variation to laboratory&#x02010;induced mutations. Using this variation to identify QTL associated with seed vigour and the underlying genes influencing these traits provides a route to identify practically important genes.</p><p>In previous work we identified the principle QTL influencing Speed Of Germination (<italic>SOG1</italic>) located at the bottom telomeric end of chromosome 1 in the crop <italic>B.&#x000a0;oleracea</italic> (Bettey <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="nph14102-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). In the work presented here we use natural allelic variation in <italic>B.&#x000a0;oleracea</italic> and exploit the resources available in this crop and the closely related model <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> to identify two genes within this QTL that negatively regulate speed of germination. We show that allelic variation in these <italic>B.&#x000a0;oleracea</italic> genes alters germination speed and sensitivity of the phenotype to abscisic acid (ABA). We then further investigate the involvement of ABA and identify a second QTL (Reduced ABA 1 (<italic>RABA1</italic>)) responsible for differences in seed ABA content. We provide evidence that the responsible gene at this locus is a homologue of the ABA catabolic gene <italic>AtCYP707A2</italic>. We propose that collectively these three genes determine germination speed in <italic>B.&#x000a0;oleracea</italic> by altering ABA content and sensitivity to it, and demonstrate that natural allelic variation in these genes could be harnessed to improve seed vigour.</p></sec><sec id="nph14102-sec-0002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Molecular biological experiments and protocols, such as RNA extraction, PCR, Quantitative RT&#x02010;PCR, plant transformation, transgenic constructs, marker analysis, Illumina sequencing and data analysis were performed according to standard procedures detailed in Supporting Information Methods S1.

<italic>SOG1</italic> was identified using a doubled haploid mapping population derived from a cross between Chinese kale (var. <italic>alboglabra</italic>, A12DHd) and a Calabrese (var. <italic>italica</italic>, GDDH33) (Bohuon <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="nph14102-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>; Sebastian <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="nph14102-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). Seed samples were obtained from Birmingham University, UK, for a number of chromosome substitution lines derived from the same parent lines (Rae <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="nph14102-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>). These lines (AGSL101, AGSL111, AGSL118 and AGSL119) each had introgressions of different sizes in the <italic>SOG1</italic> region from the GDDH33 parent in the background A12DHd parent. Bulk seeds were then produced from individual lines. Plants were laid out in a randomized block design in a glasshouse at 16&#x02013;18&#x000b0;C during the 16&#x000a0;h day and at 10&#x02013;15&#x000b0;C at night as described by Bettey <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. (<xref rid="nph14102-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). Supplementary lighting (400&#x000a0;W high pressure sodium lamps; Osram Ltd, St Helens, UK) was supplied when light intensity fell below 300 wm<sup>2</sup> during the 16&#x000a0;h day. Plants were self&#x02010;pollinated by enclosing the inflorescences in perforated polyethylene bags containing blowflies before the flowers opened. The siliques were allowed to dry completely on the plant within the enclosing bags before harvest. The seeds were cleaned, equilibrated at 15% RH and 15&#x000b0;C, and then stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C before germination experiments were carried out.</p><p>In further experiments, BC<sub>1</sub> seed from reciprocal backcrosses were produced in the same manner as described above. Bud pollination was performed to make the cross resulting in the BC<sub>1</sub>. The BC<sub>1</sub> from backcrosses of AGSL101 onto A12DHd were then selfed and seeds produced. BC<sub>1</sub>S<sub>2&#x02010;4</sub> plants were screened for presence of recombination using the markers described below. Lines identified with recombination in the AGSL101 introgressed region on chromosome 1 were selfed to BC<sub>1</sub>S<sub>6</sub> under the production conditions described above. On all occasions seeds from the parent lines were produced at the same time for comparison to minimize the influence of environmental differences during seed production. Thus, comparisons between lines were always made on seed produced on the same occasion. Percentage germination was high (&#x0003e;&#x000a0;95%) in all seed lots.</p><p>Genomic DNA was extracted from young leaves of all plant material using a DNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen).</p><p>
<italic>A.&#x000a0;thaliana</italic>
<bold>:</bold> homozygous lines for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> insertion mutants were selected by genomic PCR and sequence verification. Genomic DNA was extracted using CTAB extraction. Homozygous lines were selected for SALK lines using the LBb1.3 primer (ATTTTGCCGATTTCGGAAC) with the reverse primer (RP) as given at the SALK T&#x02010;DNA express website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/tdnaexpress">http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/tdnaexpress</ext-link>). Homozygous lines for the GABI KAT T&#x02010;DNA insertion line 579E09 inserted in At3g01090 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gabi-kat.de/">http://www.gabi-kat.de/</ext-link>) were determined using the T&#x02010;DNA primer (ATATTGACCATCATACTCATTGC) and a gene&#x02010;specific primer (TTGACCCATCAAATAATACACGAA). For the initial germination screen of all insertion mutant lines and wild&#x02010;type (WT) <italic>COL&#x02010;0</italic>, plants (six or greater) were grown under controlled environment conditions of 22&#x000b0;C during a 16&#x000a0;h day and at 18&#x000b0;C at night. Seeds were sown in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mix compost (6&#x000a0;:&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;:&#x000a0;1 Levingtons F1 compost&#x000a0;:&#x000a0;sand&#x000a0;:&#x000a0;vermiculite), in 5&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;cm P24 cells and individual plants were retained within aracons to prevent cross pollination. All lines including <italic>COL&#x02010;0</italic> bolted at the same time and set seed at the same rate. All seeds were harvested on the same day when siliques were air dry 3&#x000a0;wk after flowering. The speed of germination of freshly harvested seeds at 15&#x000b0;C was measured. The results from this screen indicated that four lines were faster germinating than the WT <italic>COL&#x02010;0</italic>. These lines were two independent T&#x02010;DNA insertions, verified by PCR, in each of the genes <italic>At3g01060</italic> (SALK_100860 and SALK_009486) and <italic>At3g01150</italic> (SALK_107494 and SALK_013673). To compare these four selected insertion mutant lines and <italic>COL&#x02010;0</italic>, 15 plants from each line were sown and raised as above, but in a randomized block design under glasshouse conditions as described above for <italic>B.&#x000a0;oleracea</italic>. Seeds from individual plants were considered as biological replicates in the analysis.</p><p>In further experiments, seeds from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> lines transformed with <italic>B.&#x000a0;oleracea</italic> alleles were produced as described for insertion mutant lines. Mature air dry seeds from each plant were harvested 3&#x000a0;wk after the plant flowered to minimize differences in the period of after&#x02010;ripening on the plants. Speed of germination was compared in 24 independent WT plants, and 14 and 15 independent transgenic lines, containing A12DHd and GDDH33 alleles of <italic>BoLCVIG1</italic> (<italic>At3g01060</italic> homologue), respectively, which were considered as biological replicates in the analysis. In a separate experiment, speed of germination was also compared in 13 independent WT plants and 13 independent transgenic lines for A12DHd and for GDDH33 alleles of <italic>BoLCVIG2</italic> (<italic>At3g01150</italic> homologue), respectively, again considered as biological replicates in the analysis. In an experiment to investigate the impact of ABA, germination was compared between WT and five independent transgenic lines containing one or other of the two <italic>B.&#x000a0;oleracea</italic> alleles of each gene. Seeds of the transgenic lines of each gene were produced at different times and so were tested separately; however, on each occasion seeds from WT control plants were produced for comparison.</p><p>Following harvest, all seeds were held at 55% RH for 2&#x000a0;d (termed freshly harvested) and then used immediately, stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C to minimize physiological change before germination experiments, or sealed and placed at 20&#x000b0;C to after&#x02010;ripen.</p></sec><sec id="nph14102-sec-0004"><title>Seed germination</title><p>In all germination experiments, seeds were placed on two layers of filter paper (Whatman International Ltd, Maidstone, UK) kept moist throughout with water (unless otherwise stated) in clear polystyrene boxes laid out in randomized blocks and kept either in the dark or light as described in the text. No evidence of fungal infection was observed and so seeds were not sterilized to avoid influencing their germination. Germination (radical emerged through the endosperm and seed coat) was recorded at frequent intervals to construct cumulative germination curves to allow an accurate calculation of the time to 50% germination (germination speed) from these measurements.</p><p>
<italic>B.&#x000a0;oleracea</italic>
<bold>:</bold> Germination was recorded on three replicates of 50 seeds from all lines and treatments. Seeds from substitution and parent lines were placed to germinate on filter paper kept moist throughout treatment with water or solutions containing ABA (10, 33, 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M; Sigma&#x02010;Aldrich Co. Ltd, Dorset, UK), GA<sub>4/7</sub> (10, 33 and 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M; Zeneca, Macclesfield, UK), a carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitor (1, 10, 38&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M Fluridone, Dow Chemical Co., Hitchin, UK) or GA synthesis inhibitors (100 and 500&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M; Prohexadione&#x02010;Ca, BASF Germany; 10 and 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M Paclobutrazole; Zeneca) at temperatures (&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.5&#x000b0;C) described in the text. All methods and concentrations were studied in a series of preliminary experiments to determine effective treatments. All solutions were adjusted to a pH of 7. Fluridone, and GA synthesis inhibitors GA<sub>4/7</sub> and GA<sub>3</sub>, were dissolved in ethanol initially and then diluted. The final concentration of ethanol was &#x0003c; 0.03%, which was found to have no significant influence on germination in preliminary studies. Controls were exposed to the same concentration of ethanol. In further experiments, seeds were placed to germinate at different water potentials on filter paper moistened with polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000; BDH Ltd, Poole, UK) solutions. Water potentials were set by the concentration of PEG (Bradford, <xref rid="nph14102-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>; Finch&#x02010;Savage, <xref rid="nph14102-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). The same solution volume&#x000a0;:&#x000a0;filter paper ratio was used for germination as that in the vapour pressure osmometer (model 5100C; Wescor Inc., South Logan, UT, USA) used to measure water potential, thus avoiding the potential error resulting from filter paper exclusion of PEG. Hydrothermal time analysis was performed according to Finch&#x02010;Savage (<xref rid="nph14102-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>).</p><p>As part of a larger unpublished comparison of seedling emergence from <italic>B.&#x000a0;oleracea</italic> genotypes, 100 seeds of GDDH33, A12DHd and AGSL101 were sown on 31 May 2003, in four replicate 1&#x02010;m rows arranged in a randomized block design. Seeds were sown by hand in a 15&#x02010;mm&#x02010;deep furrow, covered with sieved soil (sieve hole size &#x0003c;&#x000a0;4&#x000a0;mm) and the surface rolled once with a Stanhay seed drill press wheel. The soil was a sandy loam and irrigation was applied to maintain soil moisture throughout seed germination and seedling emergence.

Re&#x02010;genotyping the BILs with these same markers confirmed recombination in chromosome 1, but also found recombination in introgressions on chromosomes 4 and 8. Comparison of markers with the ABA phenotype data revealed an exact correlation with high ABA content assigned to the A12DHd genotype and low ABA content assigned to the GDDH33 genotype at four markers in the recombined region on chromosome 4 (Fig.&#x000a0;S5b).

By contrast, those BILs with GDDH33 alleles at <italic>BoLCVIG1</italic> are only influenced at the very high contents present in lines with A12DHd alleles at <italic>RABA1</italic>. Such differences in sensitivity may help to explain why there are different relationships between ABA content and dormancy or seed vigour characteristics reported in the literature. This result is also in line with literature showing that ABA is essential, but does not determine the depth of seed dormancy (Footitt <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="nph14102-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Nakabayashi <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="nph14102-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>).</p><p>In crops, the seed should ideally be sensitive to ABA during development to prevent pre&#x02010;harvest sprouting, but unlike wild plants, be insensitive to ABA during imbibition to facilitate rapid germination (high vigour). This situation is not generally present in nature because it does not bestow an evolutionary advantage and seeds are more normally dormant at shedding (Finch&#x02010;Savage &#x00026; Basal, <xref rid="nph14102-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>).

In RNAseq data we found no evidence for a difference in <italic>BoDOG1</italic> or <italic>BoCYP707A2</italic> isoforms between the genotypes studied. However, for both copies of <italic>BoPIF6</italic> present within the <italic>B.&#x000a0;oleracea</italic> genome the same two isoforms were found (Fig.&#x000a0;S4B), but these isoforms differed from those identified in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Penfield <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="nph14102-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). One isoform with an intron retention (Fig.&#x000a0;S4B) was significantly (<italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>&#x0003c;<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>0.01) downregulated in AGSL101 compared to that in A12DHd during seed development.</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> the second gene <italic>At3g01060</italic> currently is classed as a protein of unknown function. However, in a study demonstrating that PIF4 has a central role in the positive control of genes mediating hypocotyl cell extension, <italic>At3g01060</italic> was identified as one of several genes that were significantly repressed (De Lucas <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="nph14102-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). The insertion mutants of <italic>At3g01060</italic> and <italic>AtPTB1</italic>, and also transformations expressing <italic>B.&#x000a0;oleracea</italic> alleles for both genes had WT ABA contents; our results in both <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>B.&#x000a0;oleracea</italic> are therefore consistent with a role for <italic>At3g01060</italic> (<italic>BoLCVIG1</italic>) as an ABA effector altering sensitivity to ABA. Interestingly, transformation with the GDDH33 allele of <italic>BoLCVIG1</italic> increased sensitivity to ABA compared to transformation with A12DHd alleles. Nevertheless, ABA content influences speed of germination and we show that this is determined by <italic>RABA1</italic>. Furthermore we provide evidence that a homologue of Arabidopsis <italic>CYP707A2</italic>, a key ABA catabolic gene (Kushiro <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="nph14102-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>), present at this locus is the most likely candidate gene that determines ABA content.</p></sec><sec id="nph14102-sec-0023"><title>Proposed model for the regulation of seed vigour by <italic>SOG1</italic> and <italic>RABA1</italic>
</title><p>A model for the potential regulation of germination by genes in <italic>SOG1</italic> and <italic>RABA1</italic> is outlined in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="nph14102-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>. In the model we propose that the progressive decline in endogenous ABA content towards the end of seed development is determined by the catabolic action of <italic>BoCYP707A2</italic> in <italic>RABA1</italic>, which is greater in AGSL101 (GDDH33 alleles) than A12DHd. We suggest that sensitivity to the ABA remaining during imbibition determines the speed of germination and that this sensitivity is determined by allelic variation in <italic>BoLCVIG1</italic> consistent with its role as a negative regulator of germination. Although further work is required to determine a causal link, <italic>BoLCVIG2</italic> (<italic>BoPTB1</italic>) has the potential to regulate alternative splicing (AS) in <italic>BoLCVIG1</italic>,<italic> BoPIF6</italic> and <italic>BoCYP707A2</italic> during seed development. We found no evidence of AS in <italic>BoCYP707A2</italic>, but demonstrate that <italic>BoLCVIG1</italic> exists in different splice forms and that their expression differs between seed development and imbibition and also between genotypes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="nph14102-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="nph14102-fig-0007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Schematic model for the regulation of <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> germination by genes at <italic><styled-content style="fixed-case">SOG</styled-content>1</italic> (<italic>Bo<styled-content style="fixed-case">LCVIG</styled-content>1</italic> and <italic>Bo<styled-content style="fixed-case">LCVIG</styled-content>2</italic>) and <italic><styled-content style="fixed-case">RABA</styled-content>1</italic> (<italic>Bo<styled-content style="fixed-case">CYP</styled-content>707A2</italic>).</p></caption><graphic id="nlm-graphic-13" xlink:href="NPH-212-964-g007"/></fig><p>Seed vigour and performance are complex traits that have remained difficult to define and influence at a genetic level.
