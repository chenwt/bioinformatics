It is exhibited in a variety of physical characteristics, such as body size, brain size, hair color and skeletal structure, as well as the central nervous system (CNS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. For CNS, the most obvious sexual dimorphism is the size of the brain. Among numerous primates, males have larger brains than females; in humans for example, on average the total brain volume of males is about 11&#x000a0;% larger than in females. Similar differences also exist for regional brain volumes: total grey matter volume (9&#x000a0;% larger), and cerebellum volume (9&#x000a0;% larger) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Brain size dimorphism is curiously prominent in apes and humans as well as in some Old World monkey species such as macaques, but no brain size dimorphism is present in New World monkeys (such as common marmoset) or prosimians (such as lorises) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This disparity suggests that the origin of brain size dimorphism in primates is a relatively recent event, one that occurred after the split between Old and New World monkeys about 45 million years ago. Brain size dimorphism also exists in many non-primate mammalian species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], suggesting multiple origins of this phenomenon during evolution.</p><p>One of the hallmarks of primate evolution, and particularly the origin of humans, is an ever-increasing brain size. To date, most studies on brain evolution have focused on understanding the genetic basis of the between-species divergence of brain size among primates, especially between humans and non-human primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These studies have found a series of genes regulating brain size. In humans, truncated mutations of these genes would cause a rare human genetic disorder, primary microcephaly (MCPH, OMIM#251200), which is characterized by a severe reduction of brain size as well as mild to severe cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The genes purportedly related to MCPH include BRIT1/MCPH1 (BRCT-repeat inhibitor of hTERT expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], which encodes microcephalin; locus MCPH1), WDR62 (WD repeat domain 62; MCPH2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], CDK5RAP2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory associated protein 2; MCPH3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], CEP152(centrosomal protein 152&#x000a0;kDa; MCPH4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], ASPM(abnormal spindle-like microcephaly-associated protein; MCPH5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], CENPJ(centromeric protein J; MCPH6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and STIL(SCL/TAL1 interrupting locus; MCPH7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Interestingly, all seven MCPH genes encode centrosome or spindle pole proteins taking part in proper centrosome or mitotic microtubule organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], indicating their important roles during neurogenesis. Likewise, gene knockout mouse models of three MCPH genes (ASPM, CDK5RAP2 and MCPH1) all resulted in marked reduction in brain size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Of the seven identified MCPH genes, four were previously shown to have undergone rapid evolution at the protein sequence level due to Darwinian positive selection during primate evolution, suggesting that these genes contributed to the evolution of the primate brains, and by extension human brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Among humans, previous studies showed that sequence variations in three of these MCPH genes (ASPM, CDK5RAP2 and MCPH1) are associated with brain size and structure, but in a sex dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], implying that MCPH genes may be in some way regulated by sex hormones. If accurate, it stands to reason that the sex-dependent differences in the expression of these genes may contribute to the sexual dimorphism in the brain sizes observed among humans and certain nonhuman primates. Although no reliable data is available to indicate the assumed difference of sex hormone levels in the brain between males and females, it was reported in humans that puberty time (when sex hormones take into effect) plays an important role in shaping up the difference in brain development between males and females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Unfortunately, the underlying mechanisms that would explain this effect are still unknown.</p><p>Estrogen is known to be a key regulator of development of female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics, but it also plays a role in neural functions by engaging in signaling on synaptic proteins, connectivity and synaptic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. It has three forms, including estradiol, estriol and estrone, among which estradiol is the predominant estrogen during reproductive years both in terms of absolute serum levels as well as in terms of estrogenic activity. The estrogen receptor (ER) is a member of the steroid/nuclear receptor super-family of transcription factors that is required for mediating estrogen-induced responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. While a large number of genes can be regulated by estrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], it has never been tested whether MCPH genes are direct targets of estrogen. In this study, we investigated the regulation of estradiol on the seven MCPH genes, and found that four of them (ASPM, CDK5RAP2, MCPH1 and WDR62) can be regulated by estradiol. We then examined the effects of estradiol on the promoter activity of these four MCPH genes and found that estradiol is capable of suppressing the promoter activities of these MCPH genes in both humans and nonhuman primates, and moreover that this suppression mechanism may contribute to the differential development and sexual dimorphic size differences observed between the male and female primate brains.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Identification of estrogen responsive elements in four microcephaly genes</title><p>To determine whether estradiol could regulate the seven currently known microcephaly genes (ASPM, CENPJ, CEP152, CDK5RAP2, MCPH1, STIL and WDR62), we conducted a search of the potential ERE (estrogen response element) sites in gene promoter regions. Four genes (ASPM, CDK5RAP2, MCPH1 and WDR62) contain predicted half ERE sites (TGACC or GGTCA) in their promoters (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In total, there are two predicted half ERE sites in ASPM (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), six in CDK5RAP2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), three in MCPH1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and two in WDR62 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Sequence alignments of the promoter regions of representative primate species and mouse indicated that the predicted half ERE sites are, in general, conserved among human and nonhuman primates (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), implying functional constraints on these half ERE sites. However, for ASPM and MCPH1, 4 out of the 5 half ERE sites are not conserved in marmosets (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Identification of half EREs in the MCPH gene promoter sequences.

The 17-&#x003b2;-estradiol (abbreviated as E2) was used. We found that E2 (20&#x000a0;nm) could regulate the promoter activities of all four microcephaly genes, significantly repressing the promoter activities with the presence of ER&#x003b1; (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). On average, the down-regulation levels of the four MCPH genes were 39&#x000a0;% for MCPH1, 43&#x000a0;% for WDR62, 19&#x000a0;% for ASPM and 23&#x000a0;% for CDK5RAP2.

For ASPM, when either of the two half ERE sites was deleted, the repressive effect disappeared (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), indicating that the two half ERE sites are necessary for ASPM&#x02019;s response to E2&#x02019;s regulation. Similarly, for CDK5RAP2, among the six half ERE sites, three showed loss of the repressive effects but the other three did not (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. For MCPH1, two of the three half ERE sites showed a loss of repression when deleted (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), while one of the two half ERE sites for WDR62 appeared to be necessary for E2&#x02019;s regulation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Taken collectively, the mutant assay demonstrated that the regulation of E2 on the four MCPH genes is mediated by interaction with the half ERE sites. Interestingly, we did not observe a graded phenotype of the loss of repression in the mutant assays, an implication of a possible cooperative effect among the half ERE sites.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>E2 represses endogenous MCPH gene expression</title><p>Given the observed repression of the promoter activities of the four MCPH genes in the reporter gene assays, we tested the effects of E2 on endogenous gene expression.

Previous association analysis in humans indicated that three of the brain size regulating genes (ASPM, CDK5RAP2 and MCPH1) contain sequence variations significantly associated with brain size, but more provocatively that the associations are sex-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], suggesting that sex hormones may be involved in the regulation of MCPH genes, and by extension brain size. Among the seven MCPH genes, four contain half ERE sites in their promoters. Interestingly, these half ERE sites are generally conserved in those primates exhibiting sexual dimorphism, suggesting they play functional roles in these species, including in humans. Both the reporter gene assay and endogenous expression analysis showed that E2 was able to suppress the expression of these four MCPH genes, implying a potentially novel role of estradiol in the observed differences in male and female brain sizes among primates. The mutant assay indicated that the repressive effect of E2 was mediated by its direct interaction with the predicted half ERE sites. Given these results, it is likely that a majority of the currently known brain size regulating genes (4/7) in primates is regulated by estradiol, providing a potential molecular mechanism that explains brain size dimorphism in humans and nonhuman primates.</p><p>The four tested MCPH genes are all expressed in the neuroepithelium during fetal development and encode proteins that influence proliferation of neurons in the ventricular zone of the developing brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Hence, it is likely that the sex difference is established early in development because the size of the neural progenitor pool determines brain size during fetal brain development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. A previous report showed that sex-related differences in brain structure are determined mainly by the hormonal environment present during embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Using published RNAseq data of human fetal brains (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brain-map.org/">http://www.brain-map.org/</ext-link>), we found a large number of differentially expressed genes (2,433 genes) between males and females. In constrast, there are only 412 such genes in the adult brains with little overlap (60 genes) with those in the fetal brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S6), supporting the speculated early establishment of sex difference in brain development. Additionally, puberty time also plays an important role in postnatal brain development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. It was shown that mean volume of the medial temporal lobe increases in adolescent boys but decreases in adolescent girls with the progression of puberty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>Also, it was traditionally argued that females reach puberty earlier than males, therefore, would withdraw earlier from somatic development. Our findings suggest that the female hormone estrogen may serve as one of the key factors causing the between-sex difference of the brain.</p><p>A recent study indicated that the sequence evolution of MCPH1 is associated with the evolution of sex dimorphism of anthropoid brain mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Consistently, in humans, MCPH1 shows a potential between-sex expression divergence at two developmental stages (prenatal and puberty) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S5) when the levels of estradiol are presumably higher in females than in males. A similar pattern was also seen in CDK5RAP2 during adulthood (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S5). However, these potential differences need further tests. No between-sex difference was detected for the other two MCPH genes (ASPM and WDR62) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S5). The difference in effect of estradiol suggests that regulation on the MCPH genes by estradiol is likely dependent on spatial-temporal interactions between estradiol and its targets during brain development, though again, more targeted follow-up studies may prove useful in clarifying this possibility. Given the proposed role of MCPH1 in brain size dimorphism, this may explain why New World monkeys like the common marmoset do not exhibit brain size dimorphism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] because two of the three half ERE sites of MCPH1 are not conserved in the common marmoset (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), and no repression effect by estradiol was detected (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>).</p><p>To date, molecular evolution studies have found that four of the seven known MCPH genes&#x02014;ASPM, CDK5RAP2, CENPJ and MCPH1&#x02014;evolved rapidly in primates due to Darwinian positive selection, which is associated with the enlargement of the brain during primate evolution and human origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. For example, the signal of positive selection on MCPH1 was previously inferred in the common ancestor of great apes and humans as well as in the human lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Surprisingly, the results of our study here found that three of these fast-evolving MCPH genes overlapped with the four MCPH genes under estradiol regulation, suggesting that natural selection may favor parallel changes of both brain size change and brain size dimorphism. This fits quite well with what we already know, that estradiol is essential for brain development and it can promote neurite growth and regulate synaptic patterning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Ultimately then, when natural selection pushes the enlargement of the brain, it may be that it tends to act on genes already under estradiol regulation, and our results suggest that it does so potentially by suppressing the expression of brain size related genes in females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>It should be noted that besides the MCPH genes tested in this study, there might be other MCPH genes or unknown regulatory factors contributing to brain sexual dimorphism in primates. For example, the male sex hormone (testosterone) may play a role in brain sexual dimorphism. Also, why natural selection would favor a relatively smaller brain size in females is not clear. One possible explanation is the differential social roles of males and females that would lead to differential selective pressures during evolution. More evidence needs to be collected to test this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We demonstrated that estrogen could down-regulate four of the known brain size regulating genes.
