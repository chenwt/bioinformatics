However, the impact of AS on the functional diversity of proteins is difficult to assess using genome-wide approaches. The availability of detailed sequence annotations for specific genes and gene families allows for a more detailed assessment of the potential effect of AS on their function. One example is the plant MADS-domain transcription factor family, members of which interact to form protein complexes that function in transcription regulation. Here, we perform an <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of the potential impact of AS on the protein-protein interaction capabilities of MIKC-type MADS-domain proteins. We first confirmed the expression of transcript isoforms resulting from predicted AS events. Expressed transcript isoforms were considered functional if they were likely to be translated and if their corresponding AS events either had an effect on predicted dimerisation motifs or occurred in regions known to be involved in multimeric complex formation, or otherwise, if their effect was conserved in different species. Nine out of twelve MIKC MADS-box genes predicted to produce multiple protein isoforms harbored putative functional AS events according to those criteria. AS events with conserved effects were only found at the borders of or within the K-box domain. We illustrate how AS can contribute to the evolution of interaction networks through an example of selective inclusion of a recently evolved interaction motif in the MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING1-3 (MAF1&#x02013;3) subclade. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential effect of an AS event in SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP), resulting in the deletion of a short sequence stretch including a predicted interaction motif, by overexpression of the fully spliced and the alternatively spliced <italic>SVP</italic> transcripts. For most of the AS events we were able to formulate hypotheses about the potential impact on the interaction capabilities of the encoded MIKC proteins.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alternative splicing (AS) is a frequent phenomenon in higher eukaryotes that involves the production of multiple distinct transcript isoforms from a single gene. Genome-wide studies have shown that the pre-mRNAs of around 40&#x00025; of plant genes are alternatively spliced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Filichkin1">[1]</xref>. One of the roles that is ascribed to AS is that of a mechanism for controlling gene expression at the post transcriptional level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Lewis1">[2]</xref>. The second role is that of a mechanism for increasing protein diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Nilsen1">[3]</xref>. However, the extent to which this increased protein diversity is functional is not well known.</p><p>Several genome-wide studies have addressed this issue by determining the prevalence of AS events that are likely to be functional according to predefined criteria such as conservation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Severing1">[4]</xref> or the predicted effect on protein structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Melamud1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Taneri1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Tress1">[7]</xref>. Other genome-wide studies focused on the identification of more general patterns that relate AS to gene or domain functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Irimia1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Liu1">[9]</xref>, and although a number of interesting patterns has been unveiled, by their design, these studies only identify aspects that are general enough to be present in large numbers of proteins. However, each gene and gene family has its own evolutionary history and can be affected by AS in specific ways that cannot be described by globally observed patterns. The way in which a gene is affected by AS depends for instance on the specific genomic rearrangements, such as tandem exon duplications that have occurred in the gene's evolutionary history <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Kondrashov1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Letunic1">[11]</xref>. Hence, in order to fully value the functional impact of AS, it is important to also study the process at the level of individual genes or gene families.</p><p>One of the best studied gene families in plants is the MADS-box transcription factor family. Members of this family are involved in a number of developmental processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Becker1">[12]</xref> but they are probably best known for their role in regulating the onset and patterning of flowering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Causier1">[13]</xref>. MADS-box genes can be divided into two main groups: the type I and type II or MIKC classes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-AlvarezBuylla1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Parenicova1">[15]</xref>. While little is known about the former group, a wealth of information is available for the latter. MIKC proteins mainly exert their function in the form of di- or multimeric protein complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Immink1">[16]</xref>. The availability of a comprehensive yeast two-hybrid interaction map for <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> MADS-domain proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-deFolter1">[17]</xref> as well as the results of an extensive yeast three-hybrid screen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Immink2">[18]</xref> illustrate the large diversity of complexes that are potentially formed between members of this family.</p><p>The sequence of MIKC proteins can be divided into four regions with specific functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Kaufmann1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Riechmann1">[20]</xref>. The MADS (M) domain has a DNA-binding function and, together with the intervening (I) domain, is involved in determining the specificity of protein dimerization. The dimeric protein-protein interaction is promoted by the Keratin-like (K) domain. This region of the protein is supposed to fold into three consecutive amphipathic &#x003b1;-helices, referred to as K1, K2 and K3, from which the first two helices are important for dimerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Immink1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Yang1">[21]</xref>. For K3 a role in higher-order complex formation has been demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Yang2">[22]</xref>. The C-terminal (C) domain is involved in transcriptional activation or repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Hill1">[23]</xref> and furthermore, in the formation of higher-order complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Immink1">[16]</xref>. Recently, we developed computational methods that aid in the identification and understanding of sequence features that are important determinants of the interaction specificity of individual MIKC proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-vanDijk1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-vanDijk2">[25]</xref>.</p><p>One of the ways through which AS can influence the formation of di- or multimeric complexes is by regulating the availability of individual proteins. This can be achieved by regulating the production of transcripts that are targets for the Nonsense Mediated Decay (NMD) pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Lewis1">[2]</xref>. Alternatively, AS can influence the interaction specificity of the encoded proteins by disrupting or introducing individual interaction sites. This has for instance previously been shown for the two AS variants of the <italic>Arabidopsis B-sister (ABS, AGL32)</italic> gene (a member of the MIKC family) that encode proteins with different higher-order interaction specificities and functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Immink2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Folter1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Kaufmann2">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Nesi1">[28]</xref>. Another example involves the members of the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) MADS subfamily in humans which can form over 100 different dimers through AS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Amoutzias1">[29]</xref>. On the functional level, AS mediated changes to binding properties can result in functional antagonists as demonstrated for other classes of proteins, such as e.g. the TR&#x003b1;-1/c-erbA&#x003b1;-2 system in rats (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Yen1">[30]</xref>). Whether this type of antagonistic functional diversification through AS occurs within the plant MADS domain transcription factor family as well, is still unknown.</p><p>Several individual cases of AS events have previously been reported for members of the MADS-box gene family (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Folter1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Nesi1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Balasubramanian1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Caicedo1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Hartmann1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Kim1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Kitahara1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Kyozuka1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Lightfoot1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Montag1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Ratcliffe1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Scortecci1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Simpson1">[41]</xref>). However, a systematic analysis of the functional impact of AS within this family is still lacking. In this study we investigate the potential impact of identified AS events on the formation of protein complexes between MIKC proteins. We analyzed the impact of AS on both the MIKC-type protein group as a whole and on a selection of individual members. Three independent criteria were used to postulate a functional implication of an AS event. The first criterion required AS to overlap with predicted dimerisation interaction motifs that can be considered to correspond to those regions that form the contact surface, using our recently developed interaction motif prediction method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-vanDijk1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-vanDijk2">[25]</xref>. The second criterion required overlap with the region known to be important for higher-order complex formation. In contrast to these criteria, which focus on the nature of the function, the third criterion considered conservation of an AS-induced polymorphism (AIP) at the protein level among different species and only indicates a potential function. In addition to providing interesting candidates for further experiments, our results illustrate the potential of computational analysis of AS within the functional context of individual genes or gene families.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>General data description and alternative splicing analysis</title><p>In total, 80 of the 111 annotated MADS-box genes (including MADS-box like) in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> had at least one annotated protein for which the corresponding open reading frame was fully supported by transcript evidence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0030524.s009">Table S1</xref>) and were considered further. Of the 38 loci for which at least one encoded protein had a clear MIKC structure, 31 had at least one annotated protein product with experimentally identified protein-protein interactions, and 17 had evidence for AS.</p><p>We first investigated the prevalence of AS within the DNA regions encoding for the individual domains of these MIKC proteins. To this end we clustered introns based on their genomic coordinates. Clusters containing multiple introns always corresponded to AS events. Singleton clusters on the other hand only corresponded to an AS event if the intron was found to be retained in one or more transcripts. The fractions of intron clusters that were involved in AS events were 24&#x00025; (11/46), 11&#x00025; (16/147) and 9.1&#x00025; (2/22) for the I-, K-box- and C-terminal domain encoding DNA sequences, respectively. Fisher's exact tests indicated that AS was not significantly favored in any of the analyzed domains (best P-value: 0.03 for the I-domain). Nevertheless, intron clusters in the I-domain were twice as frequently involved in AS events than those located in the K-box or C-terminus domains. Given that the K-box domain is a PFAM domain and the I-domain is not, the lower fraction of AS within the K-box domain encoding DNA sequences is consistent with our previous observation that intron clusters within predicted PFAM-protein domain encoding DNA regions are less frequently involved in AS events than intron clusters located outside such predicted domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Severing1">[4]</xref>. We did not find any AS event that affected the MADS domain. This is not surprising because there is only one <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> MADS box gene (<italic>At1g33070</italic>) that has introns in its MADS domain encoding sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Kofuji1">[42]</xref> and we did not find transcript (EST) support for this gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0030524.s009">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>AS can introduce premature termination codons (PTC) in transcripts, which may result in the production of truncated protein. However, many of these PTC containing transcripts are recognized by the cell and degraded via the NMD pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Lewis1">[2]</xref>. Because in this study we are only interested in the function of AS events that are manifested at the protein level, all AS events resulting in putative NMD targets were discarded. Transcripts were regarded to be potential NMD targets if they contained a PTC that was located more than 55 nt upstream of the last exon/intron junction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Hori1">[43]</xref>. In a number of cases it was difficult to determine whether the transcript was likely to be degraded or translated from a downstream ATG codon due to the position of the PTC. After removal of these ambiguous cases, a total of twelve loci, accounting for 13 AS events, remained and were predicted to produce multiple protein isoforms (<xref ref-type="table"

Our study was focused on the functional impact of AS on different aspects of the formation of protein complexes. We restricted our analysis to transcripts which are likely to be translated, excluding those AS transcripts that are candidate to be degraded by the NMD-pathway. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude potential functions of these transcripts, which would only further add to the importance of AS in the MADS domain family.</p><p>Although AS events were not significantly overrepresented in any of the DNA regions encoding conserved protein domains, intron clusters within the K-box and C-terminal domain encoding sequences were twice less frequently involved in AS events than intron clusters located in the I-domain encoding DNA sequences. Although the I-domain is not a predicted PFAM domain, it has a known function in determining dimerization specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Immink1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-vanDijk1">[24]</xref>.</p><p>AS events that overlapped with interaction motifs within the I-domain encoding DNA sequences were shown to potentially affect dimer interaction specificities. Indeed, of these three loci, the <italic>SVP</italic> locus was predicted to have isoforms with different interactions specificities and this was also confirmed by yeast two-hybrid analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-vanDijk1">[24]</xref>. Ectopic expression demonstrated clear differences in function between the two <italic>SVP</italic> AS isoforms; overexpression of <italic>SVP1</italic> resulted in a late flowering phenotype and floral abnormalities, whereas overexpression of <italic>SVP3</italic> did not. The observed differences in effects on flowering-time are in line with the expectations based on protein-protein interactions: only SVP1 is able to interact with the strong repressor of flowering FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-vanDijk1">[24]</xref> and previously it was shown that the SVP and FLC function in floral repression is mutually dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Li1">[53]</xref>. The same holds for the differences in observed floral defects, which probably are at least partially caused by direct interactions between SVP1 and the ABC-class MADS domain proteins, a capacity that SVP3 is lacking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-vanDijk1">[24]</xref>. Altogether, these observations show that a small change in the sequence of a MADS-box gene transcript due to an AS event can have strong consequences for the interaction capacity and functioning of the encoded protein. Nevertheless, the <italic>SVP3</italic> transcript is lowly expressed in comparison to the fully spliced <italic>SVP1</italic> transcript and the elucidation of its true biological function requires further experimental investigations.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that AS can be associated with fast evolving regions of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Xing1">[54]</xref>. The elevated rate of evolution of the less well conserved I-domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-DeBodt1">[55]</xref> is not only evident from the amino acid substitutions in this region but also from the repeated changes that have occurred to its intron structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Kaufmann1">[19]</xref>. The increased rates of AS in this region represent a further mechanism to diversification and the overall high variability of the I-domain may reflect its role as a determinant of dimer interaction specificity.</p><p>The potential effect of an AS event in the K-box depends on the location of the event within this domain. In accordance with previously published data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Yang1">[21]</xref> we hypothesize that the interaction motif that is introduced through an intron retention event located in the sequence encoding for the N-terminal region of the MAF1 K-box domain has a potential effect on dimer formation. AS events that affected the C-terminal region of the K-box were considered to influence multimer formation, because this region was shown to be important for higher-order complex formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Immink2">[18]</xref>. Based on the rather similar positions of their AS events, we hypothesize that the variants encoded by the <italic>STK-</italic> and <italic>SHP2-</italic>loci form different higher-order complexes, similar to what has been shown experimentally for the ABS isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Immink2">[18]</xref>.</p><p>All AIPs that showed conservation across species were located at the boundary of, or within the DNA sequence encoding the K-box region and can roughly be divided into two groups. The first group consists of the AIPs from the <italic>Arabidopsis SEP3</italic>-, <italic>MAF2</italic> and <italic>MAF3</italic>-loci that were located near the sequence encoding the N-terminal boundary of the K-box domain. Although none of these AIPs involved residues corresponding to interaction motifs, the positions of these AIPs suggest that they might influence dimer formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Immink1">[16]</xref>. The second group contains conserved AIPs that overlapped with DNA sequences encoding predicted interaction motifs located near the C-terminal region of the K-box domain. The motifs involved in these AIPs were all encoded in orthologous exons. The motifs spanning 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-introns of the skipped exon of the <italic>STK</italic> gene are homologous to the motifs that overlap with the AIPs of <italic>ABS</italic> and both <italic>SHP2</italic> and <italic>AG</italic> (in the non<italic>-Arabidopsis</italic> species), respectively.</p><p>Previous comparative analyses in plants have shown that AS events are generally not well conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Baek1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Wang1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Wang2">[48]</xref>. Conservation is even less pronounced when not only the location but also the effect of the event on the protein sequence is taken into account <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Severing1">[4]</xref>. It is therefore remarkable that conserved AIPs were here found for six members of the same gene family. In contrast to these previous large-scale studies, our present conservation analysis was not limited to a few species with large fractions of their genome sequenced. Instead, we searched for conserved AIPs in a large collection of EST/cDNA sequences from a wide variety of species. Most of the conserved AIPs in this study were found between closely related species and are congruent with the phylogenetic relationships of the surrounding sequences. While this is not unexpected, it is less clear whether those AIPs that span entire exons in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, as found for the STK and ABS homologs, are true cases of conservation. These AIP types might be easier to detect at larger distances because exons are in general much better conserved than intronic sequences. As these AIPs clearly contain sequences that resemble the interaction motifs detected in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the effect of the AIP might also resemble the potential effect in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p><p>The importance of considering the effect of AS on conserved interaction motifs is highlighted by a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Airoldi1">[50]</xref>. It was shown that observed phenotypic differences could be explained by the inclusion or exclusion of a single amino acid into a conserved sequence region from the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AG and the <italic>Antirrhinum</italic> FAR proteins. This phenotypic difference is caused at the molecular level by altered interaction specificities resulting from the presence or absence of the single amino-acid. Interestingly, the single amino acid insertion into FAR that is the crucial difference responsible for functional diversification between this protein and its paralog <italic>PLENA</italic> (PLE) is identical to our observed differences between AS variants of AG homologs. From an evolutionary perspective, FAR and PLE could represent two ancient AS isoforms that have been partitioned over separate genes. Although a number of cases of such externalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Irimia2">[56]</xref> events have been described in literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Irimia2">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Rosti1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Yu1">[58]</xref>, the extent to which this process has contributed to the protein diversity in plants is not known.</p><p><italic>MAF1</italic> is a member of the <italic>FLC</italic>-like clade in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> which consists of genes that are subject to extensive alternative splicing and genomic rearrangements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Balasubramanian1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Ratcliffe1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Scortecci1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Caicedo2">[59]</xref>. An interesting aspect of the <italic>MAF1</italic> locus is the complexity of the rearrangement of motif content that results from a mutually exclusive exon event. While the 5-exon of the mutually exclusive exon pair could be detected in transcripts of other <italic>FLC</italic>-like genes, remnants of the 3&#x02032;-cryptic exon were only detected in the closely related <italic>MAF2-</italic> and <italic>MAF3</italic> loci. As the <italic>MAF1&#x02013;3</italic> loci form a monophyletic group within the <italic>FLC</italic>-like clade (e.g. Figure 6 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Parenicova1">[15]</xref>) it is likely that the cryptic exon originated recently within the ancestor of this group. Alternative splicing has previously been associated with the emergence of new exons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Keren1">[60]</xref>. In accordance with the view that AS provides genes with &#x0201c;internal paralogs&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Modrek1">[61]</xref>, the recent exon provides the material for these <italic>MAF</italic> proteins to &#x0201c;experiment&#x0201d; with new dimer interactions without the irreversible loss of existing interactions. The <italic>MAF2-</italic> and <italic>MAF3</italic> loci are not likely to express the region corresponding to the cryptic exon at the protein level. Such rapid divergence of AS patterns between recent paralogs has previously been demonstrated to be a common phenomenon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Su1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Zhang1">[63]</xref>.</p><p>Naturally occurring mutations in splice sites that affect splicing patterns have been identified in <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC)</italic> related genes in different species. An <italic>FLC</italic> gene has been identified in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Bur-0 accession that produces a transcript encoding a protein with a modified C-domain (both insertion and truncation) due to a mutation affecting the acceptor site of the sixth intron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Werner1">[64]</xref>. In that same study it was reported that the <italic>FLC</italic> gene of the Van-0 accession has a nonsense mutation in the sixth exon. The gene produces two transcripts that differ by the presence of the sixth exon. Inclusion and exclusion of the sixth exon lead to a protein with a truncated C-domain or large deletion in the C-domain, respectively. Although the mutation in the Van-0 accession does not directly affect a splice site, it can affect a potential <italic>cis</italic>-element such as a splicing enhancer element that might be needed for correct recognition of this exon which is very short compared to the average <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> exon (42 nt. versus 217 nt on average <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Barbazuk1">[65]</xref>). Natural variation affecting the donor site of the sixth intron of the <italic>FLC</italic> gene in <italic>B. rapa</italic> has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Yuan1">[66]</xref>. Individuals carrying this mutation produce two transcripts in which either an alternative donor site within intron 6 is used or similarly as in the Van-0 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accession, the sixth exon is skipped entirely. It is however not known whether the early flowering phenotypes associated with these reported <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>B. rapa FLC</italic> genes are the result of reduced multimer formation capabilities of FLC or reduced transcription activation capabilities.</p><p>Another naturally occurring splice site mutation in <italic>Capsella bursa-pastoris</italic> results in the skipping of the fifth <italic>FLC A</italic> exon and is associated with early flowering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Slotte1">[67]</xref>. This exon corresponds to the fourth exon of the <italic>Arabidopsis ABS</italic> gene which encodes the earlier mentioned motif involved in higher order interaction specificities. We therefore hypothesize that the early flowering phenotype associated with this exon skipping event is the result of altered multimer formation of <italic>FLC A</italic>.</p><p>In addition to these cases in which <italic>cis</italic> splice signals were genetically altered, cases have been found in which the relative abundance of the splice variants from <italic>FLC</italic> related genes is regulated in a manner dependent on temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Balasubramanian1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Balasubramanian2">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Reeves1">[69]</xref> or developmental stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Zhang2">[70]</xref>. These findings suggest a &#x0201c;conserved&#x0201d; usage of the alternative splicing process as mechanism for regulating flowering-time. However, the details of flowering-time regulation can differ between species even if the AS events in homologous genes appear to be conserved. For instance, the temperature-dependent skipping of the fifth exon in the <italic>Beta vulgaris FLC like</italic> 1 gene results in transcripts encoding proteins with stronger repressor capabilities than those encoded by transcripts that include the exon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Reeves1">[69]</xref>. The fifth exon that is skipped in <italic>C. bursa-pastoris FLC A</italic> transcripts is homologous to the skipped exon in <italic>B. vulgaris</italic> (data not shown). However, <italic>C. bursa-pastoris</italic> transcripts that contain the exon are stronger repressors and those transcripts that lack the exon are associated with early flowering phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Slotte1">[67]</xref>. Although the proposed effects of the AS products are opposite, these findings provide strong evidence that AS in the <italic>FLC</italic>-clade genes plays an important role in flowering-time regulation. Based on our results and predictions and observations done previously (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Terzi1">[71]</xref>) it is tempting to speculate that AS in general, and in particular for MADS-box transcription factors, is an important molecular mechanism underlying flowering-time regulation.</p><p>Considered at the level of the gene family, the impact of AS on the MIKC subgroup does not appear to dramatically differ from previously established genome-wide patterns. For instance, the dynamic nature of the process is emphasized by the association between AS and fast evolving protein regions and the rapid divergence of AS in recent paralogs, which we find here but is also known on a genome-wide scale. However, usage of available detailed annotation of specific functions to various sequence regions enables the identification of AS events that have an impact on function but that remain hidden behind the globally observed patterns. Such sequence annotations are more specific than for example PFAM domains, and although such knowledge is often not found in databases but somewhat hidden in the literature, for many protein families experimental and predicted sequence regions are known that impact aspects of protein functions. Hence, the results of our study are encouraging for future analysis of AS within other gene families following a similar approach.</p><p>To conclude, a large fraction of the AS events in genes encoding MADS domain proteins that are likely to be manifested at the proteome level are predicted to be functional according to our criteria. For many of these cases, hypotheses could be formulated about aspects of protein complex formation that are affected by the AS events. Using additional experimental data (qRT-PCR, overexpression studies) as well as additional bioinformatics analysis (translatome data) we present supporting evidence for the potential biological relevance of the predicted functional AS events. In addition to demonstrating the functional impact of AS on extant MIKC proteins, we also illustrated how the process can potentially introduce new interactions into the network. The analysis we present here provides a starting point for further experimental determination of the precise physiological roles of AS events in plant MADS-box genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Initial data</title><p>The identifiers corresponding to the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> MADS-box genes were extracted from the &#x0201c;gene_families_sep_29_09_update.txt&#x0201d; file, which was downloaded from the TAIR website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.Arabidopsis.org">www.Arabidopsis.org</ext-link>).

No direct quantitative comparison of expression levels of the individual isoforms can be made based on the qRT-PCR results, because of the usage of the different isoform specific primer-sets. Though, quality of the designed primers was analyzed by performing a primer efficiency test. Furthermore, specificity of oligonucleotides was determined by sequencing (DETT sequencing, Amersham) of the amplified fragments.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Analysis of translatome data</title><p>As additional validation for the relevance of the selected AS events, the short sequence reads from the study of Jiao and Meyerowitz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Jiao1">[44]</xref> were mapped against the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome using the program TopHat version 1.3.0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030524-Trapnell1">[85]</xref>.
