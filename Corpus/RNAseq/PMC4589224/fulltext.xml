By lineage tracing using the Wnt-responsive gene Axin2, we identify a population of proliferating and self-renewing cells adjacent to the central vein in the liver lobule. These pericentral cells express the early liver progenitor marker Tbx3, are diploid, and thus differ from mature hepatocytes, which are mostly polyploid. The descendants of pericentral cells differentiate into Tbx3-negative, polyploid hepatocytes and can replace all hepatocytes along the liver lobule during homeostatic renewal. Adjacent central vein endothelial cells provide Wnt signals that maintain the pericentral cells, thereby constituting the niche. Thus, we identify a cell population in the liver that subserves homeostatic hepatocyte renewal, characterize its anatomical niche, and identify molecular signals that regulate its activity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">The cellular source of new hepatocytes in the adult liver and the molecular regulation of hepatocyte renewal are fundamental unanswered questions in liver biology. Recent studies in mice using genetic lineage tracing techniques have concluded that during homeostatic renewal, new hepatocytes arise by replication of pre-existing hepatocytes[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This is in line with the generally accepted view that in the uninjured state, hepatocyte homeostasis does not involve a stem cell population[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, hepatocytes are heterogeneous with striking differences in age and function across the liver lobule[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition, mature hepatocytes are generally polyploid (4N to 32N), a genomic state that compromises replicative capacity[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], posing limitations on possible contributions of these cells to long-term liver homeostasis. It has been unknown whether a specific subpopulation of cells serves homeostatic renewal in the liver, as happens in many other tissues[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p id="P3">Wnt proteins are secreted short-range signals that maintain stem cells in many adult mammalian tissues, and are produced by the specialized microenvironment referred to as the stem cell niche[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Wnts signal primarily through the intracellular protein &#x003b2;-catenin to activate transcription. A universal transcriptional target of &#x003b2;-catenin dependent Wnt signaling is Axin2, and its expression provides a reliable readout of cells responding to Wnt[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Genetic lineage tracing of Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells has identified stem cells in several adult mammalian tissues[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We have used this lineage tracing approach to identify a unique population of Wnt-responsive cells that surround the central vein. These diploid cells self-renew over the lifespan and progressively give rise to mature polyploid hepatocytes that can populate the entire liver lobule. We also show that these pericentral cells are maintained by Wnt-producing central vein endothelial cells that constitute the niche.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Axin2<sup>+</sup> pericentral cells generate expanding clones of hepatocytes</title><p id="P4">In the adult liver, Axin2 is expressed in cells located around the central vein[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which we confirmed by in situ hybridization (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1m</xref>). In order to mark and follow the fates of these Wnt-responsive cells, we used the tamoxifen-inducible Axin2-CreERT2;Rosa26-mTmG<sup>flox</sup> mouse to pulse label Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells. In these experiments, a subset of Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells is labeled stochastically with membrane GFP after tamoxifen administration. The GFP label is permanent, allowing for fate mapping of initially labeled cells and their descendants[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A single low-dose of tamoxifen led to GFP labeling exclusively of pericentral hepatocytes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). Control animals receiving corn oil did not show any GFP labeling (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended figure 1</xref>). The GFP<sup>+</sup> cells expressed glutamine synthetase (GS), another known Wnt target gene[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and a marker for pericentral hepatocytes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). They were negative for carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 1 (CPS), which marks midlobular and periportal hepatocytes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). Over time, the population of labeled cells expanded as large contiguous patches spreading directionally from the central vein towards the portal vein (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d, g, j</xref>). One year after the marking, nearly all hepatocytes in some individual lobules were descendants of the initially labeled Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1j</xref>), including hepatocytes that abut the portal vein (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1j</xref> inset).</p><p id="P5">Pericentral cells that remained labeled throughout the course of the lineage trace maintained their distinct gene expression profile, expressing Axin2 (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended figure 2</xref>) and GS (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b, e, h, k</xref>) but not CPS (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c, f, i, l</xref>). On the other hand the descendants of the labeled cells acquired different gene expression patterns as they moved away from the central vein. They lost Axin2 and GS expression and gained CPS expression suggesting that as they move away from the pericentral region they no longer receive Wnt signals (see below) and subsequently differentiate. Finally, throughout the lineage traces, all labeled cells expressed the hepatocyte marker HNF4&#x003b1; (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1n</xref>), but not markers of other liver cells types including biliary epithelial cells (data not shown), indicating that Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells contribute only to the hepatocyte lineage.</p><p id="P6">While Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells can generate all hepatocytes in a lobule over time, quantification of the labeling after one year showed that on average, descendants of Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells replaced 30% of the area of the entire liver (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1o</xref>, <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended figure 3</xref>) accounting for approximately 40% of the hepatocytes.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells self-renew</title><p id="P7">A defining property of stem cells is the ability to self-renew. To test whether Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells self-renew, we labeled a maximum number of Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells by administering five consecutive daily doses of tamoxifen (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). Over time, the labeled cells expanded concentrically from the central vein and importantly, all pericentral cells remained labeled (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b, c</xref>). This indicates that new pericentral cells arise exclusively from preexisting labeled Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells. Thus, while Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells can give rise to all the hepatocytes along the lobule (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>), they are not replaced by unlabeled Axin2<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells. That is, pericentral Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells are a self-renewing cell population.</p><p id="P8">To further characterize the Axin2<sup>+</sup> cell population, we used RNAseq to compare the gene expression profile of FACS isolated Axin2<sup>+</sup> and Axin2<sup>&#x02212;</sup> hepatocytes (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended figure 4</xref>). As expected, most of the differentially expressed genes between the two populations were known markers of liver zonation (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Extended table 1</xref>)[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, we also identified Tbx3, a transcription factor important in maintaining pluripotency[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], as a gene upregulated in the Axin2<sup>+</sup> population. Interestingly, Tbx3 marks early hepatoblasts that arise around day 10 of embryogenesis, and is required for the earliest anlage of the liver[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. By in situ hybridization, we confirmed that Tbx3 expression is uniquely expressed in the single layer of pericentral cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>).</p><p id="P9">In Axin2-CreERT2 mice, one copy of the endogenous Axin2 gene is inactivated. Since Axin2 is a negative feedback regulator of Wnt signaling[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], we considered the possibility that inactivation of one allele could confer a proliferative advantage after Wnt stimulation. To address this concern, we compared the DNA synthesis rate of Axin2<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes in wildtype versus Axin2-CreERT2<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> mice by 5-ethynyl-2&#x02032;-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation. We used GS as the surrogate marker for Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells in wildtype animals because a suitable antibody for murine liver Axin2 staining does not exist. We found no difference in the DNA synthesis rate in the two strains of mice (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended figure 5</xref>). We also controlled for the possibility of liver injury from tamoxifen administration, which could serve as a proliferative stimulus[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We examined DNA synthesis by GS<sup>+</sup> pericentral hepatocytes in mice treated with corn oil or tamoxifen, comparing wildtype and Axin2-CreERT2<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> animals. We found no difference as measured by EdU incorporation (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended figure 5</xref>). We conclude that neither Axin2 gene dosage nor tamoxifen affects proliferation of Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells in our mouse model.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells proliferate faster than other hepatocytes</title><p id="P10">The fact that Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells repopulate most of the liver lobule over time implies a rate of proliferation that is greater than that of Axin2<sup>&#x02212;</sup> hepatocytes. We quantified the DNA synthesis rates of the two cell populations as already described. Axin2-CreERT2;R26-mTmG<sup>flox</sup> mice were labeled with tamoxifen and then given 7 daily doses of EdU. We found that Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells undergo DNA replication twice as frequently as Axin2<sup>&#x02212;</sup> hepatocytes (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To verify this result, we also examined the replicative activity of Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells by label dilution in which cells are tagged initially with a fixed amount of a stable product, which undergoes dilution with each cell division. We utilized the Axin2-rtTA;TetO-H2B-GFP transgenic mouse[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which expresses a stable histone 2B-GFP fusion protein in Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells when given doxycycline. Additionally, the reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator in Axin2-rtTA mice is under the control of a mouse Axin2 expression cassette[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], thus leaving the endogenous Axin2 gene locus unaffected. Once activated by doxycycline, the H2B-GFP protein remains stably expressed until the labeled cell undergoes cell division, when the H2B-GFP protein is divided between the daughter cells resulting in diminished GFP signal intensity[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p id="P12">Doxycycline was administered continuously for seven days, at which time cells lining the central vein were labeled with nuclear GFP (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). Following a 14 day chase period after cessation of doxycycline, we observed that the number of GFP labeled cells had expanded, while the peak GFP signal intensity had decreased (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c, f</xref>). The expansion of GFP labeled cells around the central vein is concentric, consistent with the Axin2-CreERT2 lineage tracing results and is seen up to 28 days after cessation of doxycycline (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>). By 56 days after cessation of doxycycline very few GFP labeled cells are seen, and no labeled cells after 84 days (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended figure 6</xref>). We quantified the number of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells at each time point and found that the cell cycling rate is approximately every 14 days (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>). We further confirmed this by FACS analysis, which showed step-wise dilution of the peak GFP signal intensity every 14 days (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref>). Thus pericentral Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells actively proliferate during adult homeostasis, at an estimated cell cycling rate of 14 days.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells are mostly diploid</title><p id="P13">Mature hepatocytes are mostly polyploid[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which is associated with decreased proliferative potential and increased senescence[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Stem cells are typically diploid, a property that may be necessary for unlimited duplication[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We used FACS sorting to isolate Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells and evaluated their ploidy status with Hoechst 33342 staining (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended figure 7</xref>). As expected, the majority of unsorted hepatocytes are polyploid (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a, 4c</xref> left bar). In contrast, the majority of Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells are diploid (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b, 4c</xref> middle bar). To confirm that Axin2<sup>+</sup> diploid cells give rise to polyploid cells, we labeled Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells with tamoxifen, traced for one year and isolated GFP<sup>+</sup> cells for ploidy analysis. We found that the ploidy distribution of the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells at the end of the trace was identical to that of unsorted hepatocytes (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>, right bar), suggesting that the descendants of Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells mature normally into polyploid cells after leaving the pericentral zone.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Central vein endothelium acts as a Wnt-producing niche</title><p id="P14">The strict localization of Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells to the central vein suggested a local source of Wnt. We screened the normal liver for all nineteen mammalian Wnts by in situ hybridization[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Two of these, Wnt2 and Wnt9b, were expressed exclusively in endothelial cells around the central vein (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a, 5b</xref>), colocalizing with the endothelial cell marker PECAM1 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c, d</xref>). We also isolated liver endothelial cells by FACS[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and confirmed that both Wnt2 and Wnt9b are highly expressed in endothelial cells by qRT-PCR (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5e</xref>, <xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended figure 8</xref>). Thus endothelial cells at the central vein produce Wnt2 and Wnt9b as short range signals for pericentral Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells and may constitute their niche.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Wnt signals are required for pericentral cell proliferation</title><p id="P15">The simultaneous and overlapping expression of two Wnt family members suggests functional redundancy of Wnt signaling at the central vein. To directly test whether endothelial cell derived Wnt proteins function to maintain the precursor state of pericentral cells, we conditionally deleted Wntless (Wls), a Wnt-specific transporter molecule required for proper Wnt protein secretion[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], specifically in endothelial cells. We crossed VE-cadherin-CreERT2 mouse which has a tamoxifen inducible Cre-recombinase under the control of an endothelial cell specific promoter with Wls<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice. Adult VE-cadherin-CreERT2;Wls<sup>flox/flox</sup> animals (Wls f/f)[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] were given multiple doses of tamoxifen to induce conditional deletion of Wls in endothelial cells. These mice appeared healthy without obvious systemic defects and their livers appeared grossly and histologically normal (<xref rid="F15" ref-type="fig">Extended figure 9</xref>). Compared to VE-cadherin-CreERT2;Wls<sup>flox/+</sup> (Wls f/+) control animals, Axin2 expression was decreased in pericentral hepatocytes of Wls f/f mice (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a&#x02013;c</xref>), consistent with loss of Wnt signaling around the central vein. Concurrently, there was loss of pericentral hepatocyte function as shown by significantly decreased levels of glutamine synthetase expression (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6d&#x02013;f</xref>). Importantly, pericentral cells, labeled by GS, exhibited significantly decreased proliferation rates in Wls f/f mice compared to Wls f/+ controls (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6g</xref>). The decreased rate approached the proliferation rate of GS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> hepatocytes, though it remained significantly higher. This is likely due to the mosaic nature of tamoxifen-induced Wls inactivation. We conclude that endothelial-cell derived Wnt signals are necessary for maintaining the high proliferative state of pericentral cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S7"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">In this paper we present a new view of hepatocyte homeostasis in the uninjured liver (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6h</xref>). We have identified a Wnt-responsive cell population that resides within a confined niche around the central vein. These cells self-renew and contribute to hepatocyte maintenance by differentiating into and replacing other hepatocytes along the hepatic lobule in the normal liver. The existence of this pericentral cell population suggests that the fundamental mechanisms regulating liver renewal are similar to other organs in which homeostatic renewal involves small populations of stem cells that maintain the tissue. In the liver however, our model is novel because it was previously thought that all hepatocytes are equivalent in their renewal potential. In contrast, we show that hepatocytes are made up of more than one cell type and are not equivalent in replicative ability during homeostasis. Given the properties of the cell population under study, we postulate that the Wnt-responsive pericentral cells act as hepatocyte stem cells.</p><p id="P17">Several features make pericentral cells unique compared to other hepatocytes. Although pericentral cells express markers common to other hepatocytes, they also specifically express Axin2, Tbx3, and GS while lacking CPS. Pericentral cells proliferate at a higher rate compared to other hepatocytes, an observation that is consistent with Magami et al[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Furthermore, pericentral cells possess a diploid genome, in contrast to most other hepatocytes, which are polyploid. Finally, and most importantly, while pericentral Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells can differentiate into all hepatocytes along the lobule, including those that line the portal vein, Axin2<sup>&#x02212;</sup> hepatocytes do not replace pericentral cells during homeostasis. As pericentral cells can self-renew over the long-term and differentiate into other hepatocytes, we suggest that they fit the functional definition of a stem cell.</p><p id="P18">The diploid nature of pericentral cells is important and surprising, although nuclear size measurements in rat livers have suggested the presence of smaller nuclei near the central vein[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This sheds light on a long-standing question in liver biology. Mature polyploid hepatocytes display chromosomal abnormalities[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and display impaired replication[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. By maintaining a diploid genome, the pericentral cells would, like stem cells do[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], retain unlimited replicative potential. It is interesting to note that during the cell cycle, levels of Wnt signaling peak at the G2/M phase[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. If Wnts regulate expression of mitotic control genes such as the phosphatase CDC25[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], they could direct cells to mitosis and continued diploidy rather than to non-mitotic DNA replication and polyploidy.</p><p id="P19">A defining feature of pericentral cells is their localization to a Wnt-rich anatomical niche. While Wnt-regulated genes such as &#x003b2;-catenin and APC are known to function in liver development[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and zonation[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the types and sources of Wnt have not been identified. We found that Wnt9b is specifically expressed in endothelial cells at the central vein, adjacent to the pericentral cells, while Wnt2 is expressed in both the sinusoidal and central vein endothelial cells. Interestingly, Wnt2 produced by sinusoidal endothelial cells is known to be important for hepatocyte regeneration after injury[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Siimilarly, in other stem cell niches, lipid-modified Wnt signals act as short-range cues, maintaining stem cells in the immediate vicinity of the niche but not outside[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p id="P20">It has been suggested that there may be a periportal source of new hepatocytes under normal conditions[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our lineage tracing studies do not exclude the possibility that other sources of hepatocytes exist during homeostasis since after one year the descendants of pericentral cells replace on average only 40% of hepatocytes within the liver. However, a portal-based population would be regulated differently, since we find no expression of Wnt9b by the portal vein endothelium.</p><p id="P21">Liver is known to regenerate efficiently after injuries such as partial hepatectomy or chemical insult. It has been reported that during regeneration after chemical damage, a Wnt-responsive population of cells near the portal vein can be labeled by the Lgr5 receptor gene[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These cells, unlike pericentral Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells, do not express hepatocyte genes, but subsequently differentiate into bile duct epithelial cells and hepatocytes and thus could be similar to injury induced oval cells[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Clearly, Lgr5<sup>+</sup>/oval cells are distinct from the cells we identify here, as pericentral cells maintain hepatocyte homeostasis in the uninjured liver while Lgr5<sup>+</sup>/oval cells have only been reported after injury.</p><p id="P22">The stem cell marker Tbx3 is expressed widely in early liver hepatoblasts and is important for hepatoblast proliferation and initiation of hepatocyte differentiation[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Our findings that pericentral cells also express Tbx3 leads to the intriguing hypothesis that pericentral cells may represent the persistence of an embryonic hepatocyte progenitor population into a self-renewing cell population in the mature liver.</p><p id="P23">It is noteworthy that liver cancer is often characterized by loss of function mutations in negative regulators of the Wnt pathway, including Axin and APC[<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In a mouse model of liver cancer caused by Met overexpression, liver tumors were found to arise exclusively from cells located at the central vein[<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], suggesting that pericentral Axin2<sup>+</sup> cells, normally controlled by a paracrine Wnt signal, are precursors to liver cancer.
