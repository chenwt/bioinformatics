Here we show that the cellular polarity machinery in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> undergoes dynamic adaptation to thermal stress resulting in a period of decreased Cdc42 activity and altered, monopolar growth. Cells where the heat stress-associated transcription was genetically upregulated exhibit similar growth patterning in the absence of temperature insults. We identify the Ssa2-Mas5/Hsp70-Hsp40 chaperone complex as repressor of the heat shock transcription factor Hsf1. Cells lacking this chaperone activity constitutively activate the heat-stress-associated transcriptional program. Interestingly, they also exhibit intermittent monopolar growth within a physiological temperature range and are unable to adapt to heat stress. We propose that by negatively regulating the heat stress-associated transcription, the Ssa2-Mas5 chaperone system could optimize cellular growth under different temperature regiments.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Heat stress, caused by fluctuations in ambient temperature, occurs frequently in nature.

Free-living microorganisms, such as yeast, can maintain regular patterns of growth over a relatively wide range of environmental temperatures. Cellular adaptation to increased temperature is one of the most robust and evolutionarily conserved mechanisms (reviewed in <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Richter1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>). This response involves temperature-induced activation of genes encoding so-called heat shock proteins (HSPs) <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Richter1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1003886-Tissieres1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Molecular chaperones constitute a predominant class of HSPs and their up-regulation is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis at elevated temperatures (reviewed in <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Richter1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>).

HSFs are evolutionary conserved winged helix-turn-helix proteins that bind to cis-acting DNA promoter sequences called heat shock elements (HSEs) <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Harrison1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. HSFs are essential for viability in many fungi and control important developmental processes in higher eukaryotes suggesting that they may regulate basal transcription in addition to their function in stress response <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Sorger1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1003886-Xiao1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The ability of HSFs to respond to cellular stresses is under negative regulation by chaperones, modulation of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, post-translational modifications and, in higher eukaryotes, transition from monomeric to trimeric state (reviewed in <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Anckar1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>).

CRIB-GFP levels at the new cell end of <italic>ssa2&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>mas5&#x00394;</italic> cells underwent on-off oscillations that would rarely stabilize to allow for noticeable tip elongation during the course of imaging. These results suggest that the intermittent growth pattern of <italic>ssa2&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>mas5&#x00394;</italic> cells is a consequence of the unstable Cdc42 activity at the cell tips.

The reported diffusion rates of the membrane-bound Cdc42 are relatively low <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Marco1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref> suggesting that mis-localization is likely due to Cdc42 activation occurring throughout the cortex rather than the lateral movement of active GTPase from the cell tips. Overexpression of Gef1 is sufficient to promote Cdc42 activation throughout the entire plasma membrane <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Coll1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref> suggesting that modulation of Gef1 activity and/or membrane recruitment upon heat stress could allow for ectopic activation of Cdc42. Interestingly, inhibition of the evolutionary conserved NDR kinase Orb6 promotes invasion of Cdc42 into the lateral cortical domain possibly through direct phosphorylation of Gef1 <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Das1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Activity of GEFs could be also modulated by interaction with plasma membrane proteins sensing the environment or the structural integrity of the cell wall.

Curiously, transient depolarization of the growth machinery upon mild heat stress is followed by a prolonged period of monopolar growth (<xref rid="pgen.1003886-Mitchison1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003886-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Since the entire cell population becomes predominantly monopolar it means that heat stress could delay both the onset of NETO in newly born cells and re-initiation of persistent bipolar growth in late G<sub>2</sub> phase of the cell cycle. The predominantly monopolar growth pattern in cells adapting to heat stress could be possibly explained by the recently developed model correlating the cell length to the bipolar Cdc42 activation <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Das2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The salient prediction of the model is that reduction of the positive relative to the negative Cdc42 feedback would result in an increased incidence of monopolar cells.

Yet, only the old cell end that was inherited from the mother is capable of maintaining Cdc42 activity levels sufficient for growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003886-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>). Consistent with an idea that low Cdc42 activity does not allow bipolar growth in cells where the heat stress response is on, mild overexpression of the constitutively active Cdc42 mutant rescued the growth patterning defects of <italic>mas5</italic>&#x00394; cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003886-g005">Fig. 5G&#x02013;I</xref>).</p><p>Once wild type cells attain the new steady state growth at elevated temperature, the cortical activity of Cdc42 returns to normal and the bipolar growth is resumed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003886.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). Interestingly, the abundance of Cdc42 regulators is inversely correlated with environmental temperature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003886.s002">Fig. S2H</xref>), which may suggest a degree of temperature compensation in the Cdc42 module. The eukaryotic circadian clock is a typical example of a complex feedback network that buffers the period of oscillations against temperature (reviewed in <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Hogenesch1" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref>). The temperature compensation of the <italic>Neurospora</italic> clock relies on phosphorylation of the key regulator Frq by the casein kinase 2 <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Mehra1" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>, an ortholog of the gene isolated as <italic>orb5</italic> in the fission yeast morphogenesis screen <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Snell1" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>. Furthermore, Hsf1 itself is known to regulate temperature compensation of the mammalian circadian clock <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Buhr1" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>. The decrease in the Cdc42 activity in cells lacking the Ssa2-Mas5 complex could be potentially explained by over-compensation of Cdc42 module in the absence of the actual temperature increase.</p><p>Our work suggests that in fission yeast, the Hsp40 protein Mas5 functions in repressing Hsf1 activity as a specificity co-factor for the Hsp70 chaperone Ssa2. Heat shock transcription factors are extensively regulated <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Akerfelt1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref> and both Hsp90 and Hsp70 chaperones have been proposed to function as their repressors <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Zou1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Leach1" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>. We show that transcriptional depletion of Hsf1 indeed suppresses the heat-stress associated transcription in <italic>mas5</italic>&#x00394; cells and also rescues the polarized growth defects in this chaperone mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003886-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). In line with this, the slow growth of budding yeast lacking Ssa1 and Ssa2 is rescued by a partial loss-of-function mutation in Hsf1 <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Halladay1" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>. An interesting twist to the chaperone-mediated regulation is that mRNA abundance of these chaperones increases upon heat stress (1.9-fold and 3.3-fold increase, respectively), possibly placing Hsf1 activity within a negative feedback loop. The cytosolic Hsp70 chaperones could also act as primary sensors of stress at least in some conditions, <italic>e. g.</italic> Ssa1 in budding yeast has been shown to release Hsf1 from the inhibitory complex upon binding to the thiol-reactive compounds <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>. The human Mas5 and Ssa2 orthologs have been shown to bind Hsf1 <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003886-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>, an interaction that we were unable to detect in fission yeast, possibly due to its transient nature.</p><p>Several reports suggested that subcellular distribution of Hsf1 could affect its activity (surveyed in <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Vujanac1" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>). Interestingly, we found that during the steady state growth in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, Hsf1 exhibited a predominantly nuclear localization but it was fully exported into the cytoplasm following heat stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003886.s007">Fig. S7</xref>). However, in the absence of Mas5 and Ssa2 Hsf1 failed to exit the nuclei of heat-stressed cells, suggesting that the chaperone complex could also regulate Hsf1 through controlling its subcellular distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003886.s007">Fig. S7</xref>). The temporally resolved studies of Hsf1-driven transcription triggered by heat stress suggest that the initial burst of Hsf1 activity is rapidly followed by its repression <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Gasch1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Zobeck1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Rieger1" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>. Removing Hsf1 from the nucleus could be one of the mechanisms to attenuate its activity.</p><p>The Mas5-like Hsp40 chaperones are highly promiscuous in their interactions with client proteins <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Gong1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. This property could potentially allow them to serve as sensors of global folding status linking the machineries handling environmental stress response and the normal cellular growth. Indeed, Ydj1, the budding yeast ortholog of Mas5, has been proposed to function as a growth rate sensor regulating G<sub>1</sub>/S entry <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Ferrezuelo1" ref-type="bibr">[92]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Verges1" ref-type="bibr">[93]</xref>. Curiously, bursts of fairly normal tip extension in individual <italic>mas5</italic>&#x00394; or <italic>ssa2</italic>&#x00394; cells are interspersed with periods of rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003886-g005">Fig. 5</xref>), suggesting that one or more factors could become limiting for growth when availability of these chaperones is decreased. Given that the instantaneous growth rate in yeast has been negatively correlated to upregulation of heat-responsive genes <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[94]</xref>, the Hsf1-chaperone interaction could function in a feedback loop sustaining the normal cellular growth. It is worth noting that while both upregulation of Cdc42 activity and partial downregulation of Hsf1 in the chaperone mutant cells rescued the polarity-related phenotypes, neither genetic manipulation ameliorated the slow doubling time of <italic>mas5</italic>&#x00394; cells.</p><p>Placing the central transcriptional activator of the heat shock response under negative regulation by chaperones with a wide client base may ensure efficient and highly sensitive means of adapting to frequently changing environment. Moreover, this circuitry appears to be coopted in regulating the normal cell cycle progression as a function of growth rate. By regulating Hsf1 activity through the Ssa2-Mas5 chaperone system, fission yeast cells could optimize Cdc42-driven polarized growth under different temperature regiments. Given that the heat stress associated transcription modulates diverse cellular functions <xref rid="pgen.1003886-Richter1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, similar adaptive dynamics are likely to operate in other physiological processes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>
