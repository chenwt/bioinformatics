However, constant and diverse selection pressures on the immune system have driven the expansion and diversification of different immune gene families in a lineage-specific manner. To investigate how the innate immune system has evolved in a subset of sea anemone species (Order: Actiniaria), we performed a comprehensive and comparative study using 10 newly sequenced transcriptomes, as well as three publically available transcriptomes, to identify the origins, expansions and contractions of candidate and novel immune gene families.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We characterised five conserved genes and gene families, as well as multiple novel innate immune genes, including the newly recognised putative pattern recognition receptor CniFL. Single copies of <italic>TLR</italic>, <italic>MyD88</italic> and <italic>NF-&#x003ba;B</italic> were found in most species, and several copies of <italic>IL-1R-</italic>like, <italic>NLR</italic> and <italic>CniFL</italic> were found in almost all species. Multiple novel immune genes were identified with domain architectures including the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) homology domain, which is well documented as functioning in protein-protein interactions and signal transduction in immune pathways. We hypothesise that these genes may interact as novel proteins in immune pathways of cnidarian species. Novelty in the actiniarian immunome is not restricted to only TIR-domain-containing proteins, as we identify a subset of NLRs which have undergone neofunctionalisation and contain 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;N-terminal transmembrane domains, which have so far only been identified in two anthozoan species.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This research has significance in understanding the evolution and origin of the core eumetazoan gene set, including how novel innate immune genes evolve. For example, the evolution of transmembrane domain containing NLRs indicates that these NLRs may be membrane-bound, while all other metazoan and plant NLRs are exclusively cytosolic receptors. This is one example of how species without an adaptive immune system may evolve innovative solutions to detect pathogens or interact with native microbiota. Overall, these results provide an insight into the evolution of the innate immune system, and show that early divergent lineages, such as actiniarians, have a diverse repertoire of conserved and novel innate immune genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12864-016-3204-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Actiniaria</kwd><kwd>Innate immune system</kwd><kwd>Transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>Evolution</kwd><kwd>TIR domain</kwd><kwd>NLR</kwd><kwd>Novel immune genes</kwd><kwd>Complement cascade</kwd><kwd>CniFL</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>The immune system is an ancient and complex system that works to detect and defend against pathogens, as well as to regulate the interaction between microbes and hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Defence against pathogens in vertebrates is a two-fold mechanism. It consists of the innate immune system, which provides non-specific protection to the host, and the adaptive immune system, which mounts a specific attack against foreign bodies (e.g., microbes) and displays immunological memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Invertebrates, such as cnidarians (corals, jellyfish, hydroids and sea anemones), however, only possess the innate immune system as their primary mode of pathogen defence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Innate immune genes tend to be highly conserved in metazoans, even in early divergent lineages, such as Cnidaria and Porifera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, constant and diverse selection pressures on the immune system have driven the expansion and diversification of different immune gene families in a lineage-specific manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. One particular example is the NOD-like receptor family (renamed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] as Nucleotide-binding and Leucine-rich Repeat containing gene family (<italic>NLR</italic>)), of which expansions have occurred independently in multiple early divergent lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The evolution of immune genes can be complex, as not all functionally conserved immune genes are homologous. Protein domains may evolve independently and subsequently converge on a conserved function or architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. For example, the functional Toll-like receptor pathway in <italic>Hydra magnipapillata</italic> (freshwater polyp) is formed using a scaffold assembly of TIR-only proteins (Toll/interleukin-1 receptor homology domain) and LRR-only proteins (Leucine-rich repeat) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Similarly, it appears that the immunoglobulin-TIR domain combination found in the interleukin receptor family has evolved independently in cnidarians and vertebrates, as these genes share limited sequence similarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For these reasons, investigating conserved domain architectures can be highly informative in identification and characterisation of the immune repertoire in cnidarians and other early divergent metazoan taxa. Using this approach, the evolution of novel immune genes can also be investigated, through interrogation of novel architectures with domains that have known immune functions. The TIR domain is a well-characterised example; it functions in protein-protein interactions and signal transduction in immune pathways. Such an approach has previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] been successfully applied to identify novel immune genes by interrogating TIR-domain-containing architectures.</p><p>Like other members of phylum Cnidaria, actiniarians are anatomically simple and develop from only two germ layers (diploblastic). These animals are typically sedentary with no physical protective barriers such as a shell, cuticle or exoskeleton and are therefore directly exposed to the abiotic and biotic conditions surrounding them. Consequently, these organisms have evolved immune defence mechanisms that tend to rely on mucous secretions which consist of antimicrobial peptides, as well as a diverse range of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which work in concert with the glycocalyx, to provide a physicochemical barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. As with other eumetazoans, pathogen recognition in actiniarians is thought to occur primarily via the detection of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), using a diverse array of PRRs. Cnidarian immune genes, in particular PRRs, also have a major role in maintaining homeostasis between the host and the beneficial native microbiota, which primarily reside on the epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], although many cnidarians also undergo endosymbiosis with dinoflagellates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Current genomic resources for cnidarians have been limited to a few key model species, including <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> (starlet sea anemone) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]<italic>, Acropora digitifera</italic> (coral) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], <italic>H. magnipapillata</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and <italic>Aiptasia</italic> sp. (sea anemone) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Interrogation of these genomic resources has revealed that the cnidarian genome is surprisingly complex. In fact, cnidarians have maintained both eumetazoan and early divergent metazoan gene families, some of which have been lost in invertebrate models <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In particular, the genome of the sea anemone <italic>Nematostella</italic>, has been shown to be more similar to vertebrates than other invertebrate model species, with gross genomic structure and exon/intron arrangement similar to vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. While these few cnidarian species have been crucial in elucidating the complexity of the cnidarian genome, in this highly speciose phylum, more resources are needed to facilitate further in-depth comparative evolutionary and phylogenetic analyses.</p><p>Actiniarians are uniquely suited for the study of the origin and evolution of the innate immune system. This is principally attributed to their phylogenetic placement as members of Cnidaria, the sister phylum to Bilateria. Their simple anatomical features and complex, vertebrate-like genomes make Actiniarians an interesting candidate for understanding how novel innate immune genes evolve within eumetazoan species that have limited physical defences. Furthermore, using Actiniarians as a model for understanding anthozoan immunity will help provide insights into other issues facing anthozoan species, such as coral bleaching and disease. To better understand the evolution of the innate immune system, here we performed a comprehensive and comparative investigation of the actiniarian innate immune gene repertoire with the aim to provide preliminary insights into the key processes that have shaped the cnidarian immunome. Specifically, we have examined gene family evolution of candidate immune genes, to better understand the role of gene gain and loss events, the generation of new genes and the acquisition of genes from other species, as key drivers of the innate immune gene repertoire in actiniarians.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sequencing, assembly and annotation</title><p>Whole organism extractions of total RNA were performed from <italic>Actinia tenebrosa</italic> (red, brown, green and blue colourmorphs, designated 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively) <italic>Anthopleura buddemeieri, Aulactinia veratra, Calliactis polypus</italic> (designated 1 and 2)<italic>, Telmatactis</italic> sp. and <italic>Nemanthus annamensis</italic>.

NG1 includes the Pfam domains Leucine-rich repeat (LRR), Miro-like protein (Miro), Ras family (Ras) and Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor homology domain (TIR_2). SMART domain annotation represented the Miro and Ras domains as either Ras family, Ras of complex (Roc) or small GTPase, all of which are GTPase family domains. A low threshold C-terminal of Roc (COR) domain was also found ~300 aa downstream in all genes, which may be essential to the function of the GTPase domain and is always found downstream of Ras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

Swiss-Prot BLASTx searches (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S9) identified this gene as an F-box/LRR (FBXL) protein from multiple vertebrate species. The FBXL protein, however, only has the LRR region in common with NG1, indicating there is no ortholog of NG1 in vertebrates. Further investigation of this gene with known TIR and TIR_2 architectures from the EMBL-EBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] domain database identified 362 unique architectures with the TIR_2 domain (PF13676) and 381 unique architectures with the TIR domain (PF01582), but the TIR domain was not found in combination with any GTPase (Roc, Ras or COR). The TIR_2 domain was identified in combination with one or more of the GTPase domains in multiple bacteria species, including cyanobacteria, filamentous bacteria, purple sulfur bacteria and flavobacteria, and with an additional C2 domain in the pacific oyster, <italic>Crassostrea gigas</italic> (C2 domain &#x02013; targets proteins to cell membranes), and a MBT domain in the placozoan, <italic>Trichoplax adhaerens</italic> (MBT &#x02013; repeat of unknown function).

Only a single <italic>Nematostella</italic> predicted protein was found to match this transcript in the TrEMBL database (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S9).

EMBL-EBI database search returned no TIR domain architectures that were similar to NG3. A few sequences were found in the EMBL-EBI database with TIR_2 domain combinations similar to NG3. The most similar domain combination found was with a &#x02018;neuralized&#x02019; domain in place of the &#x02018;Pkinase&#x02019; and &#x02018;SH3&#x02019; domains in <italic>Strigamia maritima</italic> (centipede) and <italic>Crassostrea gigas</italic> (pacific oyster).

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Discussion</title><p>To better understand the evolution of the innate immune system we have performed a comprehensive and comparative investigation of the actiniarian innate immune gene repertoire, including <italic>TLR, NLR,IL-1R</italic>-like, <italic>MyD88, NF-&#x003ba;B, CniFL, SRCR, MASP,</italic> C-type lectin domains, complement control proteins and multiple novel innate immune genes. By generating multiple high-quality transcriptome assemblies we were able to undertake a detailed study of innate immune genes in actiniarians. Here we note that in some cases specific gene families appear to have undergone lineage-specific expansions and potential neofunctionalisation (e.g. <italic>NLR</italic>), while other genes such as <italic>TLR</italic>s have fewer copies than observed in other eumetazoan phyla. Although these observations need further functional validation, they provide an insight into the core eumetazoan immune gene set and show that the majority of actiniarian innate immune genes show evidence of purifying selection.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Candidate and novel gene counts and architectures</title><p>The identification of candidate and novel genes in this study is mostly consistent with previously reported information on gene copy number in cnidarians. For example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], reported similar counts for some TIR domain containing proteins identified in nine anthozoan species. Their study included three of the species interrogated in our study: <italic>A. pallida, A. elegantissima</italic> and <italic>N. vectensis</italic> and confirmed single copies of <italic>TLR</italic> and <italic>MyD88</italic>. For <italic>IL-1R-</italic>like, of which there are multiple copies, fewer complete genes were identified in our study for the three species, whilst numbers of all TIR domain containing proteins were higher. The study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] also identified an expansion of TIR only proteins restricted to coral species. Here we present evidence for an anthozoan-specific expansion of TIR only proteins, as we identify similar counts of TIR only proteins in all anemone species (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S8).</p><p>In this study, the TIR domain, not TIR_2, was always found in proteins with evolutionarily conserved architectures (i.e., TLR, MyD88, IL-1R-like). Notably, in most instances TIR_2, a common bacterial TIR domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] also found in some marine invertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] was found in novel genes identified here. This highlights that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) may have played a role in the introduction of the TIR_2 domain to the genome of actiniarian species, which then underwent domain shuffling to form the observed novel genes. Whilst the possibility of contamination cannot conclusively be ruled out, in most instances no similar domain architectures to the three novel genes were identified in any other species. This study identifies two previously uncharacterised genes (NG1 and NG2) and extends on the previously reported novel genes for Actiniarians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], including NG3 and other novel genes shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, which have been identified by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Interestingly, NG3 identified here was found with additional domains (SH3, Roc and COR domains) not identified by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These novel domain architectures found in lineage-specific actiniarian species are likely the result of domain shuffling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Expanded repertoire and neofunctionalisation of NLRs</title><p>The diversity in domain architectures observed in the NLR family across metazoans suggests potential evidence for neofunctionalisation in this gene family. The expansion and diversification of actiniarian NLRs, such as those with transmembrane domains, observed in our study is significant as it indicates that some of these duplicated copies have likely undergone independent neofunctionalisation within Anthozoa. This is supported by phylogenetic analysis of NLRs across Metazoa (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) where all 15 TMD containing NLRs clustered into one clade, but other actiniarian NLRs clustered in separate clades. The presence of multiple transmembrane domains in NLRs identified in our study indicates that they may be membrane-bound. This appears to be an anthozoan specific innovation as all other metazoan NLRs are exclusively localised to the cytoplasm and do not have these domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Interestingly, only two other anthozoan species (<italic>N. vectensis</italic> and <italic>A. digitifera)</italic> have so far been reported with TMD containing NLRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], but our results indicate a wide distribution of TMD containing NLRs across multiple actiniarian species. This highlights that novel innovations and neofunctionalisation have occurred in innate immune gene families of Actiniaria. <italic>Amphimedon queenslandica</italic> (sponge) NLRs may also contain TMDs, however, no anthozoan TMD containing NLRs cluster with these sequences and do not currently support this hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis of the metazoan NLRs resulted in a similar tree to the one obtained by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] in their study on sponge NLRs, providing further evidence that the TMD containing NLR clade are correctly clustered into a single clade, indicating this novel structure has likely evolved from a single origin within Anthozoa. Potential functional implications of the neofunctionalisation of NLRs include allowing cooperation between other pattern recognition receptors or a modified or novel response to an immune signal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conservation of innate immune pathways and the interaction of novel genes</title><p>A functioning innate immune system may depend on the conservation of signalling pathways, more so than the conservation of particular immune genes. For example, in <italic>Hydra</italic> the TLR pathway is conserved through a scaffold of TIR-only and LRR-only proteins despite the lack of a full length <italic>TLR</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In our study, however, we found canonical <italic>TLR</italic> genes in most species (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), with the exception of <italic>A. pallida</italic> and <italic>Telmatactis</italic> sp. In fact, no canonical <italic>TLR</italic> gene was identified in the <italic>Aiptasia</italic> genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Whether <italic>A. pallida</italic> and <italic>Telmatactis</italic> sp. also use scaffold TIR-only and LRR-only proteins remains unexamined, however, the expansion of TIR-only and TIR-domain-containing proteins in all species in this study may contribute to the building of scaffold-like immune pathways<italic>.</italic> Interestingly, the presence of 4 full length canonical <italic>TLR</italic> genes in coral (i.e., <italic>A. digitifera</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] suggests that the canonical <italic>TLR</italic> was present in the common ancestor of anthozoans.</p><p>This principle of pathway conservation is demonstrated by the evolution of the interleukin-1 receptor gene family. The Ig-TIR domain combination (found in interleukin receptors such as IL-1R) is hypothesised to have evolved independently in both cnidarians and vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. No IL-1R-like identified here were annotated as bona fide IL-1R protein by Swiss-Prot, rather they were all annotated as either TIR-domain-containing proteins or Ig containing genes. Further domain analysis demonstrated that these genes do indeed possess the canonical IL-1R-like architecture, with a C-terminal TIR, transmembrane domain and multiple Ig domains (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] have reported the independent evolution of the Ig-TIR domain combination and thus concluded that cnidarian <italic>IL-1R</italic> (or rather <italic>IL-1R</italic>-like,) are not orthologs of the vertebrate <italic>IL-1R</italic> family. In particular, one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] argued that either the LRR-TIR (as seen in TLRs) or the Ig-TIR domain combination must have evolved independently in more than one metazoan lineage. Further phylogenetic analyses may clarify whether these gene families or domain combinations have evolved independently in multiple metazoan lineages.</p><p>Expansions in genes encoding TIR-domain-containing proteins, including both novel and &#x02018;conserved&#x02019; (i.e., IL-1R-like) genes, may compensate for the lack of more than one <italic>TLR</italic> (or no <italic>TLR</italic>, in the case of <italic>Aiptasia</italic>, <italic>Hydra</italic> and <italic>Telmatactis</italic> sp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]). The TLR and IL-1R-like pathways both interact with MyD88 via their TIR domain during signal transduction, and therefore, may also interact with novel TIR-domain-containing proteins in a similar way. It is plausible to hypothesise that Novel Gene 3 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>) may interact in these pathways via its C-terminal death and TIR domains, which together form the canonical MyD88 domain architecture. Other novel TIR-domain-containing proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) may also interact in known or new pathways via the interactions of the TIR domain. Functional validation is required to determine the extent to which these novel genes contribute to cellular processes underpinning the innate immune response.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Distribution of CniFL: a putative complement pathway receptor</title><p>The initiation of known immune pathways though novel or lineage-specific immune genes is demonstrated by the discovery of the novel putative immune receptor CniFL. First reported in the recently sequenced <italic>Aiptasia</italic> genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], CniFL is hypothesised to function through the lectin-complement pathway. Here we identify a copy of the <italic>CniFL</italic> gene (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) in all species (except <italic>A. elegantissima,</italic> however, this transcriptome was derived from a single tissue source (acrorhagi)), as well as multiple components of the complement pathway (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). We also identify three species (<italic>N. vectensis, A. tenebrosa</italic> and <italic>C. polypus</italic>) with CniFLs that contain an additional WAP domain and also identify a transmembrane domain CniFL in most species (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Interestingly, the single <italic>CniFL</italic> gene copy in <italic>N. vectensis</italic> was not identified previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] due to an incorrectly annotated ab initio gene model prediction in the <italic>Nematostella</italic> genome (v1.0). In addition, <italic>CniFL</italic> appears to have extensive copy number variation within hexacorallians (1 in <italic>N. vectensis</italic> to 7 in <italic>A. tenebrosa</italic>), but whether this variation in copy number is adaptive remains unexplored. The <italic>CniFL</italic> gene was hypothesised to have a role in symbiont uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], which was partly due to its absence in the non-symbiotic <italic>N. vectensis</italic>. However, we observe that the <italic>CniFL</italic> gene is present in both symbiotic and non-symbiotic (<italic>A. tenebrosa, A. buddemeieri, C. polypus, N. vectensis</italic>) species investigated in our study (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2) with highest copy number reported in a non-symbiotic species (<italic>A. tenebrosa</italic>), therefore we recommend further functional validation to support this hypothesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, actiniarians have a diverse repertoire of innate immune genes. These include novel domain architectures and potentially novel innovations, such as membrane-bound NLRs and novel putative complement pathway PRRs (i.e., CniFL). Further novelties may have been introduced to the actiniarian immune gene set through HGT followed by domain shuffling. Together, the conservation, expansion and diversification of different gene families and genes encoding TIR-domain-containing proteins have shaped the evolution of the actiniarian innate immune system. The conservation of specific protein domain architectures, immune genes and pathways provides an insight into the core gene set required for a functioning eumetazoan innate immune system. Further functional validation of these genes may elucidate conserved and novel biological functions, including how these genes may contribute to lineage-specific processes and morphological novelties.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Methods</title><p>To perform a comparative analysis of the innate immune gene repertoire, across multiple actiniarian taxa, we interrogated a suite of genomic resources, both publically available and newly generated in this study.

Transcripts containing full length ORFs of these candidate genes were identified using Pfam, BLASTp and BLASTx searches. Specifically, the search method for each candidate gene was as follows. <italic>TLR</italic> was identified by searching for all contigs with a TIR (PF01582) (or TIR_2, PF13676) domain, along with at least one leucine-rich repeat (LRR, CL0022). <italic>MyD88</italic> was identified by searching for a TIR (or TIR_2) domain, along with a death domain (DD). <italic>IL-1R-</italic>like was identified by searching for a TIR (or TIR_2) domain, along with least one immunoglobulin (Ig, CL0011) domain. <italic>NF-&#x003ba;B</italic> was identified by searching for a Rel homology domain (RHD, PF00554), along with at least one ankyrin repeat (PF00023). The presence of other domains with a RHD may be indicative of different classes of <italic>NF-&#x003ba;B</italic>, however, in these actiniarian species no other domains were found in the same contig with a RHD. Hence, all identified <italic>NF-&#x003ba;B</italic> belong to Class 1. A Rel homology domain without ankyrin repeats, as seen in <italic>N. vectensis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] were not considered as full length ORFs. <italic>NLR</italic> was identified by searching for a NACHT (domain found in NAIP, C2TA, HET-E and TP1) domain, along with at least one LRR. <italic>NLR</italic> genes may also include a variable N-terminal domain, which can be broadly classified in the &#x02018;death-fold superfamily&#x02019; which includes the domains caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD, PF00619), pyrin domain (PYD, PF02758), death domain (DD, PF00531) and death effector domain (DED, PF01335). Therefore, contigs also containing a domain from this superfamily were considered potential candidate <italic>NLR</italic>s. In addition, the translated ORF for each candidate gene was analysed by TMHMM v.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], to identify transmembrane domains.</p><p>Finally, contigs were only retained as complete candidate genes if they consisted of a full length ORF which contained a start and stop codon, and received a BLASTp hit (from either the TrEMBL or Swiss-Prot databases) against other species using the open reading frame batch extracted by TransDecoder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Presence/absence of other innate immune genes</title><p>Non-conservative counts of other innate immune genes in this study were identified from gene counts provided by Trinotate.

MASP was identified from BLAST hits from TrEMBL with <italic>N. vectensis</italic> MASP and presence of the correct Pfam domains (CUB, EGF-like calcium binding, CUB2, Sushi 1, Sushi 2 and Peptidase S1). SRCR were identified by searching for the number of genes with Pfam annotations for the SRCR domain (PF00530). C-type lectin domains were identified by searching for the number of genes with Pfam annotations for lectin_C domains (PF00059). Complement control proteins (C3, Factor B, C6 and Factor I) were identified by searching for BLAST hits from either the TrEMBL or Swiss-Prot databases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Identification of novel immune genes</title><p>Potential novel genes were identified by searching for novel domain architectures that included the TIR (PF01582) and/or TIR_2 (PF13676) domains. This domain is well documented in having a role in signal transduction and protein-protein interactions in immune pathways, and therefore, provides a robust target for finding putative novel genes that interact in innate immune pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. All species were also interrogated for novel actiniarian genes previously identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Initially, all TIR or TIR_2 domain containing contigs, for each species, were identified in the Trinotate annotation report, and all contigs without a BLASTx or BLASTp annotation were further investigated. In addition, contigs that received BLASTx or BLASTp hits only against <italic>N. vectensis</italic> predicted proteins or genes were also interrogated in detail.

Of particular interest was the question of how the novel TMD containing NLRs have evolved (i.e., from a single origin or multiple independent origins). Initially, the translated ORFs for 35 complete and near-complete NLRs (near-complete only used for species where no complete NLR found) of the candidate NLR transcripts were imported into Geneious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] version R8.1.4 and aligned along with NACHT domains from species across Metazoa (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>) which were obtained from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].
