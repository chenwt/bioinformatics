Merr.] is a primary source of vegetable oil and protein. We report a landscape analysis of genome-wide genetic variation and an association study of major domestication and agronomic traits in soybean. A total of 106 soybean genomes representing wild, landraces, and elite lines were re-sequenced at an average of 17x depth with a 97.5% coverage. Over 10 million high-quality SNPs were discovered, and 35.34% of these have not been previously reported. Additionally, 159 putative domestication sweeps were identified, which includes 54.34 Mbp (4.9%) and 4,414 genes; 146 regions were involved in artificial selection during domestication. A genome-wide association study of major traits including oil and protein content, salinity, and domestication traits resulted in the discovery of novel alleles. Genomic information from this study provides a valuable resource for understanding soybean genome structure and evolution, and can also facilitate trait dissection leading to sequencing-based molecular breeding.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Legumes account for 27% of the world&#x02019;s primary crop production, and the legume seeds are an essential source for food and feed and also provide nitrogen fixation through symbioses with microorganisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic> (L.) Merr.), a leguminous crop of major economic importance, is a main source of oil and protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The domestication history of cultivated soybean traces back to around 5,000 years ago in China<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Soybean was introduced to the United States (US) in the year 1765<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, and at present soybean is the second-most planted field crop in the US. The US is currently the largest producer of soybean (34% of the global production), followed by Brazil and Argentina. The genetic diversity in soybean presumably declined to a low level due to man-made genetic bottlenecks, including selection for high yielding lines in modern plant breeding programs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Additionally, the cleistogamous characteristics of soybean may have a strong influence on genomic homogeneity and reduced genomic variation, and this characteristic might become more sensitive during domestication practices<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p><p>As a commercial cash crop in both the developing and developed world, the genomic information of soybean is essential for discovering traits for crop improvement. This information will help to further investigate the genetic bottle-neck that causes a change in allele frequencies and causes low genetic diversity and high linkage disequilibrium (LD), eliminating rare alleles in the selected populations/lines. In 2010, the first cultivated soybean genome was sequenced<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. That was followed by <italic>Glycine soja</italic>, the undomesticated ancestor of <italic>Glycine max</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. This wild soybean genome represents a 97.65% coverage of the published <italic>G. max</italic> genome, and the comparative genomic analysis shows significant differences between the genomic compositions of the 2 soybean lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p><p>Advances in the next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have made crop genome sequencing easier and more cost effective, and as a result, several crop genomes were sequenced, for example, rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, maize (<italic>Zea maize</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, cucumber (<italic>Cucumis sativus</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, sorghum (<italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, and common bean (<italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Another key application of NGS technologies is in the re-sequencing of crop genomes at a desirable genomic equivalent depth to capture the domestication signature and any rare allelic variations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Only a few re-sequencing reports are available for soybean genomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. At the same time, more pan genomes, mainly from the wild soybean groups, are being sequenced<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. The wild annual species <italic>G. soja</italic>, has been collected from a wide geographical distribution of a multitude of ecological and environmental conditions. Along with the wild species, soybean landraces also have an extensive geographical distribution. Adaptation to a wide variety of environmental condition makes these lines a valuable (untapped) reservoir for adaptive traits and associated genes that can be used in soybean breeding programs for various agronomic traits including stress tolerance and yield improvement.</p><p>Here, we present genomic sequences of 106 soybean accessions representing a wide variety of geographic origins, crop management techniques, and desirable traits used in the soybean research program for crop improvement. Re-sequencing was performed at a deeper level (17&#x000d7; average depth) than any previous reports on soybean. Comparison of genomic sequences has revealed approximately 35.34% new SNPs that have not been previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Our findings indicate that soybean offers unique and potential genomic resources among legume crops. Genomic comparisons of wild, landrace, and elite soybeans shows a higher percentage of putative domestication sweeps that were involved in artificial selection during domestication from landraces to elite cultivars. The soybean sequences and the corresponding data sets will be an unmatched resource for understanding genetic diversity, as well as a community tool for biological discovery and genetic improvement of soybean.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Landscape of genomic diversity and evaluation of variants</title><p>We selected a total of 106 soybean accessions representing different countries of origin and domestication. The collection includes seven wild, 43 landraces, and 56 elite soybean cultivars associated with different traits as well as maturity groups for whole genome re-sequencing using the Illumina platform (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Most of these accessions were used as parents in the development of genetic mapping populations to study major agronomic and quality traits and were also used in breeding programs. Re-sequencing of the 106 soybean accessions yielded a total of 2,133 billion 90-bp length paired-end reads and a high-quality raw data of approximately 2&#x02009;Tb (tera bases). The sequence reads were aligned to the soybean reference genome cultivar Williams 82, which was approximately 0.9 Gb<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> in size using SOAP2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. The mapping rate in different accessions varied from 95% to 99%, averaging a 97.48% coverage and the average final effective mapping depth achieved was approximately 17x depth per accession (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). SNP calling was conducted using SOAPsnp followed by the S filtering step. A total of 10,417,285 SNPs were identified of which 9.107 million SNPs (&#x0003e;87%) have a rate of missing data lower than 10% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), which suggests high data quality.</p><p>We analyzed the SNP position relevant to the gene annotation, and also identified non-synonymous SNPs. The majority of SNPs (82.6%) were located in intergenic regions, with only a small portion (3.83%) being located in the coding sequences (CDS) (6% of the genome); the remainder were present in the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; un-translated regions (UTR) and introns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Lower diversity levels were found in the coding regions when compared to the introns and UTR regions. Among the coding regions, there were 161,432 synonymous SNP and 237, 560 non-synonymous SNPs, with a non-synonymous to synonymous substitution ratio of 1.47. Earlier reports in soybean<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> also show a smaller number of synonymous SNPs compared to non-synonymous SNP substitutions. When compared to other plant species genome re-sequencing studies, the soybean non-synonymous SNP to synonymous SNP substitution ratio in wild, landraces, and elite germplasm is higher than that in other plants such as sorghum<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> (1.0), rice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> (1.2) and Arabidopsis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> (0.83).</p><p>Total indels (equal to or less than 5&#x02009;bp) were detected using the SOAPindel pipeline. A total of 745,814 indels were identified in all germplasm lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Approximately 79% of the indels were located in the intergenic regions, and only 10,312 (1.38%) indels/insertions were located in the coding region. The remaining indels are present in the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; UTRs and introns. Approximately 36% of indels were 1 bp shorter, and approximately 27% of insertions were 1&#x02009;bp longer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Importantly, we found indels causing a frame shift in 3,464 genes, and this genetic variation data will provide a valuable resource for future investigations.</p><p>Large-effect SNPs are mutations that affect gene splicing and polypeptide chain initiation and termination. These large-effect SNPs have a major impact on gene function, and a total of 12,029 large-effect SNPs in 7,632 genes were identified, including 6,236 premature stop SNPs, 1,072 stop to non-stop code SNPs, 1,000 start to non-start code SNPs, and 3,721 splice sites SNPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5a</xref>). This represents approximately 14% of the soybean genes that carry this mutation. This percentage is higher than previously reported in soybean<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> and is also higher than the percentage in other plant species such as sorghum<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and Arabidopsis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Functional classification analysis has identified 1,695 genes with large-effect SNPs belongs to biological process terms (1,061 genes), cellular component terms (69 genes), and molecular function terms (997 genes) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a, 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5b</xref>). We also calculated the proportion of gene numbers from certain gene categories to the gene numbers in the whole genome. Surprisingly, the proportions for large-effect SNPs for these gene categories are nearly the same as the number for all genes in the whole genome, which indicates that the mutation of large-effect SNPs occurred randomly across the entire genome.</p><p>We detected gene content variation by assembling the unmapped sequences and annotating them to identify the presence and absence variations (PAVs) in different soybean lines. In total, 7,902 PAVs gene fragments longer than 1,000&#x02009;bps were identified, and approximately 994 PAVs in the coding sequence have homology to plant proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). We have identified 133 PAVs under the DNA metabolic process category and among them 38 PAVs are with transposable elements related function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). This shows that majority of PAVs under &#x0201c;biological_process&#x0201d; are enriched for DNA metabolic process and that could be related to essential cellular functions. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Additionally, we have identified 146 genes that were absent in both landraces and elite germplasms and were present only in wild species. A majority of these genes are associated with metabolism and protein modification functions, including a small number of transcription factors. PAVs of specific categories of genes in wild, landraces, and elite germplasm clearly suggest the effect of a variety of selective forces on germplasm based on their different growing habitats and domestication events.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Phylogeny and population structure of the 106 soybean lines</title><p>To investigate the phylogenetic relationship and population structure of the selected 106 soybean lines, we generated the population structure using 79,632 4-fold degenerate-site SNPs without missing genotypes using STRUCTURE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> (version 2.3.1), based on allele frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The 4-fold degenerate-site SNPs without amino acid changes should be under less selective pressure, thereby providing more reliability of the population structure and demography. In the STRUCTURE analysis, the different subgroups demonstrated variation in population structure, suggesting the presence of 3 groups within the 106 lines, which exactly followed our wild, landrace, and elite groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 7</xref>).</p><p>The phylogenetic relationships among 106 soybean germplasm lines were analyzed using both 4-fold degenerate-site SNPs, and all 10,417,285 SNPs were obtained from the sequence comparisons. The results of 2 SNP data sets show almost the same structure as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>. All of the wild soybean lines were clustered in the phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), and 3 soybean lines close to this group were also included. The landraces and elite lines formed separate clusters in the tree. This phylogenetic tree supports the hypothesis that the wild, landraces, and elite soybeans originated from a common ancestor. In addition, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) using the 10,417,285 SNPs, and these 3 groups are clearly distinguished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), with a compact individual clustering of a majority of landrace and elite lines separately from wild soybeans. Interestingly, all of the lines in the landrace group have a black/brown/green seed-coat color, with the exception of 3 yellow seed-coat lines [PI 507354 (HN011), PI 567357 (HN079), and PI 567383(HN080)]. A majority of the yellow seed-coat lines (48 lines) were grouped into the elite group, which indicates that the seed coat color is the most dramatically modified element under the domestication and artificial selection process. The allelic variation for the <italic>I</italic> locus was examined to evaluate the difference in seed coat color because the dominant forms (<italic>I</italic> and <italic>i</italic><sup><italic>i</italic></sup>) of the <italic>I</italic> locus inhibit pigmentation of the seed coat in a spatial manner resulting in a completely yellow seed (I allele) or a yellow seed with pigmented hilum (<italic>i</italic><sup><italic>i</italic></sup> allele)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. We examined a 109.7 kb region (Gm08: 8378515&#x02013;8488261) containing a cluster of chalcone synthase (CHS) genes involved in the anthocyanin pathway. We found all 3 alleles (<italic>I, i</italic><sup><italic>i</italic></sup>, and <italic>i</italic>) in the form of haplogroups for seed color. The second haplogroup further divided into 2a (majority with buff hilum) and 2b (majority with black hilum). The allelic variation present in the <italic>CHS</italic> genes <italic>I</italic> locus is a major contributor for seed coat color.</p><p>All of the US cultivars were grouped into the elite group, and most of Chinese cultivars were grouped into the landrace group, which confirms the fact that the cultivated soybean was domesticated in China and then introduced to the United States. Individuals from the same geographical region tended to cluster together, which reflected isolation by distance during evolution and/or parallel selections in similar ecological habitats accompanied by gene flow.</p><p>Earlier reports suggested that there would be a high LD in the soybean genomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. We used Haploview 4.2 to calculate correlation coefficient values (<italic>r</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>) of alleles to measure the LD level in the 3 populations. The wild, landraces and elite germplasms showed a high LD level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 8</xref>) and dropped to half of its maximum values as expected.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Genetic divergence between wild, landrace, and elite cultivated soybeans</title><p>The genetic diversity analysis using the whole-genome SNPs, &#x003b8;<sub>&#x003c0;</sub> and &#x003b8;<sub>w</sub> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>) showed a lower level of genetic diversity in cultivated soybeans compared to wild soybeans, and the genetic diversity decreased from wild to landraces, to elite cultivars (&#x003b8;<sub>&#x003c0;,</sub> Landrace: 1.78&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>; Elite: 1.60&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>; wild soybean: 2.79&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>). The total number of SNPs and the number of non-synonymous SNPs was 15% higher in wild soybeans than in the landrace and elite groups. Also the number of large effect SNPs was nearly the same between landraces and elite groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5a</xref>). In addition, relatively lower diversity (&#x003b8;&#x003c0;) was observed in the CDS region with compared to intron and UTR regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p>Approximately 57% of the total SNPs (4,656,477) and almost 57% of the non-synonymous SNPs (100,821) from wild soybeans were shared with the landrace and elite groups, which indicated that approximately 43% of the SNPs were distinct between the wild and other 2 groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). This observation confirms that the cultivated soybean population had expanded after domestication and the wild soybean habitat was reduced (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Approximately 1,579, 3,139 and 3,184 PAVs were identified in the wild, landrace, and elite groups, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). We observed a lower number of PAVs in the case of wild accessions, and this might be due to the lower number of lines compared to the landrace and cultivated lines. The PAVs in wild, landrace and elite lines represent high-resolution structural diversity, and this can be further dissected to reveal the genetic basis of a major phenotypic transformation that was associated with the domestication of the soybean.</p><p>The number of SNPs, which was different between the landraces and elite cultivars (532, 573), was about one-quarter (27%) of the total number of SNPs that occurred during the domestication process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Similar patterns were also observed in the non-synonymous SNPs (approximately 23%) between these 2 groups. These observations agree with the fact that the impact of intensive selection by modern soybean breeding on the reduction of genetic diversity was less severe than that of selection by the domestication process<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. This finding suggests that the wild soybean gene pool is a very valuable resource, and tapping into this genomic resource will have a significant impact on the development of improved soybean cultivars.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Domestication in the soybean genome</title><p>The divergence index value (<italic>Fst</italic>) between wild, landrace, and elite soybean was calculated. This measurement helped to localize genomic regions with a higher degree of diversification between wild-landrace, wild-elite and landrace-elite soybeans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). These large <italic>Fst</italic> value regions may be harboring domestication-related loci. We analyzed genomic region with extreme pattern of diversity (&#x003c0;) (for example Chr.15, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>) that was associated with domestication related QTL, such as flower number and yield.

All the US PIs from elite backgrounds contain more than 19% oil. In contract, most of the wild relatives contain less than 14% oil, except for 2 lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 13</xref>). Candidate genes involved in acyl lipid metabolism were selected from diverse data sets such as the soybean acyl-lipid dataset<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, the Meta-QTL dataset, and the RNAseq dataset. We focused our subsequent analysis to identify the allelic variation in acyl-lipid genes and found a wide variation in non-syn-SNPs, indels, and CNVs. A total of 1,686 non-syn-SNPs were identified; out of those, 150 were associated with high and low oil lines that were significantly enriched for biological process of wax biosynthesis (WBT), fatty acid synthesis (FAS), and tri acyl glycerol biosynthesis and degradation (TAG_FAD, TAGB). To better define the allelic variation, we further narrowed down the search in 15 PIs lines with high and low oil content. We also found 40 SNPs in the candidate genes leading to premature stop codons (large effect SNPs). Analysis of the copy number variation suggested that approximately 23% of the predicted acyl-lipid genes in soybean had CNVs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 14</xref>). The comparative analysis between high and low oil lines showed an increased copy number of lipid transfer protein (LPT; <italic>Glyma16g31780, Glyma16g31840</italic>, and <italic>Glyma16g31540</italic>) in high oil lines, whereas the negative regulators (ABC transporter, <italic>Glyma03g36310</italic>; Lipase 3, and <italic>Glyma13g04561</italic>) of lipid biosynthesis genes showed more copies in low oil lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11a</xref>). The differential variation in SNP and copy number for lipid biosynthesis and lipid degradation genes between high oil and low oil lines might be associated with the differences in oil content within the PI lines. Recently, Wang <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> compared the sesame (55% oil) acyl-lipid genes with soybean and concluded that in families encoding lipid transfer proteins (LTP), midchain alkane hydroxylase was expanded by tandem duplication in sesame, whereas soybean has fewer numbers of those gene families.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Protein content</title><p>Similar to acyl-lipid, the allelic variation in seed protein related genes was investigated.

The <italic>GmCHX1</italic> gene (<italic>Glyma03g32900</italic>) possesses an approximately 3.3 kb Ty1/copia retrotransposon in the third exon, leading to a sensitive phenotype, and another variant without a retrotransposon leads to a tolerant phenotype. In the present investigation, we studied the CHX1 locus to verify the allelic variation in the 106 soybean genomes. Alignment of 13 kb consensus genomic region in the whole genome sequences of 106 soybean lines resulted in 3 major groups G1, G2, and G3. The groups G2 and G3 were reported by Qi <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, and one new variant, G1, was discovered in the present study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). The presence of the Ty1/copia retrotransposon in the G2 lines confirmed that they carry the same allele as the sensitive lines (C08 and W82); however, the absence of the retrotransposon in G3 confirmed that they carry same allele as the tolerant group (W05). The tolerant group G3 includes previously known salt tolerant lines such as S-100<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, FiskebyIII and the PI 483463<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Interestingly, lines belonging to G1, including cv. Hutcheson (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, PI 518664), do not retain the Ty1/copia retrotransposon; however, those lines carry 12 SNPs in the 1 Kb upstream promoter region, and deletions in exon 3 and part of 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> intron result in their inclusion in the sensitive group. These variants can be confirmed by phenotyping and association with allele specific marker assays. The tolerant line, S-100, is the ancestor of popular cultivars in the US germplasm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, and this suggests that the tolerant gene from S-100 could be the main source of salt tolerance in the US soybean cultivars for late maturity groups (IV&#x02013;VI), and cv. FiskebyIII for the early maturity group.

Natural genetic variation analysis of soybean germplasm using the genome sequence information of individuals will greatly help to identify genes and rare alleles that are associated with major traits and components for soybean improvement. In the present investigation, we provided a significant genomic variation data set for wild, landrace, and elite soybean lines. Deeper sequencing, high-quality data, and millions of SNPs in the representative soybean lines provide an unprecedented opportunity for us to understand the landscape of soybean diversity and domestication. We identified a number of candidate genes and genetic loci that may have been selected as hot spots of domestication in soybean. Our population structural analysis and phylogenetic analysis support the common hypothesis that soybean was domesticated in the China subcontinent and then introduced to the US and other parts of the world.</p><p>Our findings showed that the SNP variation and PAV between the wild and elite lines were 43% and 50%, respectively; and this finding explains the diversification of elite lines after domestication based on climatic zones, plant architecture, and agronomic traits. The genes identified in the domestication sweep regions were also correlated with the previously identified traits. We also studied agronomically important traits, such as oil and protein content, maturity, plant architecture, seed coat color, and salinity, and provide genomic variation information that can be used for developing trait specific genetic markers. Genetic and genomic resources generated in this study will provide a strong foundation for trait discovery, next generation breeding tools, and genomic selection strategies for the development of improved soybean cultivars.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Sequencing and mapping</title><p>We extracted genomic DNA from 106 soybean lines, constructed paired-end (PE) sequencing libraries with insert sizes of approximately 500&#x02009;bp, and generated approximately 2&#x02009;Tb of clean data after filtering low quality reads and duplicate reads.
