However, in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP), TDP-43 is abnormally phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and cleaved, and is mislocalized to the cytoplasm where it forms distinctive aggregates. We previously developed a mouse model expressing human TDP-43 with a mutation in its nuclear localization signal (&#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43) so that the protein preferentially localizes to the cytoplasm. These mice did not exhibit a significant number of cytoplasmic aggregates, but did display dramatic changes in gene expression as measured by microarray, suggesting that cytoplasmic TDP-43 may be associated with a toxic gain-of-function. Here, we analyze new RNA-sequencing data from the &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 mouse model, together with published RNA-sequencing data obtained previously from TDP-43 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) knockdown mice to investigate further the dysregulation of gene expression in the &#x00394;NLS model. This analysis reveals that the transcriptomic effects of the overexpression of the &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 transgene are likely due to a gain of cytoplasmic function. Moreover, cytoplasmic TDP-43 expression alters transcripts that regulate chromatin assembly, the nucleolus, lysosomal function, and histone 3&#x02019; untranslated region (UTR) processing. These transcriptomic alterations correlate with observed histologic abnormalities in heterochromatin structure and nuclear size in transgenic mouse and human brains.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants R01-GM099962 and U24-AG041689 to LSW, K08-AG039510 to EBL, and P01-AG017586 to VML.

It has a range of functions that affect gene expression including regulation of transcription, alternative splicing, microRNA biogenesis, and RNA transport and translation (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]). Under normal physiological conditions, TDP-43 is predominantly localized in the nucleus [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], but is synthesized in the cytoplasm [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and is shuttled between the nucleus and cytoplasm in a transcription dependent manner [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Several neurodegenerative diseases display TDP-43 pathology [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and TDP-43 was identified as the main component of the distinctive cytoplasmic aggregates seen in ALS and FTLD-TDP [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the pathological state, TDP-43 is cleared from the nucleus and mislocalized in the cytoplasm or neurites, in addition to being hyperphosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and cleaved [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Both a cytoplasmic gain of function and a nuclear loss of function of TDP-43 are possible disease mechanisms, as neurons with cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates are also associated with a loss of normal nuclear TDP-43 protein [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We previously [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] developed a tet-off inducible transgenic mouse overexpressing human TDP-43 (hTDP-43) with a mutated (K82A/R83A/K84A) nuclear localization signal (&#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43) so that the protein preferentially localizes to the cytoplasm [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Despite the mainly cytoplasmic mislocalization of the hTDP-43 protein product, these mice did not exhibit a significant number of cytoplasmic aggregates. Interestingly, there was a time-dependent neurodegeneration which coincided with dramatic changes in gene expression as measured by microarray. An intriguing aspect of the observed gene expression effects was a selective and significant upregulation of chromatin assembly and histone genes, hinting at a role for TDP-43 in transcription and histone transcript stability.</p><p>In this study, we performed RNA-sequencing of &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 transgenic mice brains to further study the transcriptomic effects of the gain of cytoplasmic TDP-43 in this model. This revealed significant changes in multiple molecular pathways, including confirmation that cytoplasmic TDP-43 expression alters transcription related pathways and histone transcript levels. Supporting a gain of cytoplasmic function mechanism, biochemical analysis of nuclear and cytosolic fractions of the &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 mice brains showed that total nuclear TDP-43 expression is largely unaltered, suggesting that the exogenous human TDP-43 is able to compensate for autoregulatory reduction of endogenous nuclear mTDP-43. The transcriptomic changes were compared with RNA sequencing data from mice with reduced levels of TDP-43 after injection with an ASO against TDP-43 [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], revealing a complete absence of correlation between the two experiments, showing that the main effects of overexpressing &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 are likely not due to the loss of TDP-43 function. Furthermore, we identify dysregulation of the histone 3&#x02019; end processing machinery upon transgene overexpression, identifying a mechanism by which overexpression of the &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 transgene impairs the transcriptional machinery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Animal care and performed procedures were in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals and approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Permit Number: 803385).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>RNA sequencing of transgenic mice</title><p>Inducible transgenic mice overexpressing mutant &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 were generated as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Briefly, a Camk2&#x003b1; promoter was used to drive expression of the tetracycline transactivator protein (Camk2&#x003b1;-tTa), and a tetracycline responsive promoter was used to drive &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 expression (tetO-&#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43) such that &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 protein expression was inhibited by doxycycline in bigenic mice (Camk2a-tTa x tetO-&#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43). Expression was repressed in bigenic mice (n = 4, 3 male) with a doxycycline diet until 28 days of age at which time expression was induced by removal of the doxycycline diet. RNA was obtained 10 days later because this is when neurodegeneration began in these mice [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Nontransgenic mice (n = 4, 3 male) bred from heterozygous parents for Camk2&#x003b1;-tTa and &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 were used as controls, and followed the same diet timeline to control for doxycycline effects.

Background gene lists were the sets of genes meeting the minimum read count threshold (10 reads per million in at least one sample) in the relevant experiment being analyzed. From DAVID, lists of gene clusters and gene charts were obtained, using GOTERM_BP_FAT, GOTERM_CC_FAT, GOTERM_MF_FAT, and KEGG_PATHWAY categories for analysis. To reduce redundancy, these results were passed to a Ruby script, available from the authors, to group functionally similar pathways together into clusters.

To normalize, we chose 50 random unchanging genes, defined as having an adjusted DESeq2 p-value of greater than 0.5, and mapped them with up to 10 multimappings as well. Then, we took the geometric mean of the unchanging gene coverage for each sample, and converted these means into normalization factors by dividing them all by the mean of the geometric means of the nontransgenic samples. All histone genes with no coverage were converted to 0.1, the lowest possible coverage, and histone values were divided by the normalization factors. Finally, we took the separate geometric mean in each sample for the normalized canonical and variant histone genes. The changes in canonical and variant histones were quantified with 2-sided t-tests between the 4 bigenic and 4 nontransgenic normalized geometric means.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Biochemical Analysis of Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Brain Lysates</title><p>Immediately upon sacrifice, cortices from mouse brains were dissected, weighed and frozen at -80&#x000b0;C. Total vs. nuclear vs. cytosolic fractions were prepared from cortex tissue as follows. Tissue was homogenized using 8 strokes of tight-fitted (B) Dounce homogenizer at 4&#x000b0;C in hypotonic buffer (10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4 with protease inhibitors; 5:1 v/w). After a 10 minute incubation at 4&#x000b0;C, 1.0 M sucrose in hypotonic buffer (0.36:1 v/w) was added, and samples were Dounce homogenized with an additional 15 strokes. Aliquots were removed as the total fraction. Homogenates were then centrifuged at 1,000xg for 10 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. 120 &#x003bc;L of the supernatant was taken and spun at 100,000xg for 30 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C.

Alternatively, TDP-43 has several other RNA functions other than splicing which were not directly assessed here.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Biochemical analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic TDP-43 levels</title><p>Expression of &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 leads to predominantly cytoplasmic transgene expression [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and using species-specific TDP-43 antibodies, we have previously shown that &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 expression is associated with a reduction of endogenous nuclear mTDP-43 protein [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The relative absence of splicing alterations in &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 mice suggests that at least some TDP-43 protein was present within the nucleus, resulting in functional recovery from the loss of mTDP-43 in terms of splicing and supporting the idea that the effects of transgene overexpression are mainly due to cytoplasmic gain of function. To biochemically investigate the levels of TDP-43 protein in &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 expressing mice, we performed nuclear and cytosolic fractionation on neocortex from bigenic (Camk2a-tTa x tetO-&#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43) and non-transgenic or monogenic control mice. Samples were immunoblotted for total (mouse and human) TDP-43 protein. As expected, the bigenic mice showed increased cytosolic levels of total TDP-43 (<xref rid="pone.0141836.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Moreover, total nuclear TDP-43 protein was slightly higher in &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 mice relative to control mice, suggesting that the exogenous hTDP-43 is indeed able to localize to the nucleus despite the mutation in the NLS. This slight nuclear increase may also contribute to toxicity. The lack of histone H3 in the cytosolic fraction and the lack of HSP90 in the nuclear fraction confirmed successful fractionation. These results demonstrate that &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 overexpression leads to a marked increase in cytoplasmic TDP-43 protein with relative preservation of total nuclear TDP-43 protein levels, despite the loss of endogenous mTDP-43. The increased presence of cytoplasmic TDP-43 protein supports a gain of cytoplasmic function as one potential mechanism underlying the observed transcriptomic changes, but additional mechanistic studies to demonstrate this functionally are needed.</p><fig id="pone.0141836.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0141836.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Nuclear and cytosolic fractionation of &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 expressing mice.</title><p>Subcellular fractionation followed by immunoblot protein analysis reveals a similar level of nuclear total (human and mouse, h+m) TDP-43 levels between bigenic (+/+) and control (+/- or -/-) mice, but an increase in cytosolic TDP-43 levels in the bigenic mice.

While the differentially expressed genes in &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 mice seem to be mainly caused by a cytoplasmic gain of exogenous TDP-43 function as shown by Western blot analysis and the lack of splicing changes, the differentially expressed genes upon ASO knockdown are more likely to be directly linked to the loss of normal, endogenous TDP-43 protein. Thus, if the main effects in the &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 model are indeed caused by a cytoplasmic gain of function, comparison of the transcriptomes of these two mouse models should show different effects.</p><p>Raw sequencing reads from the ASO experiment (GEO database accession number GSE27218), were analyzed with the same pipeline used for &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 mice. Technical replicates were combined to analyze biological replicates of control ASO injected mice (n = 4, 4 female) versus TDP-43 ASO injected knockdown mice (n = 4, 4 female). Across these samples, we found a mean of 30,794,457 total reads, with a mean of 29,132,557 uniquely mapping. We were able to map more reads than the original study [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which used an older version of Bowtie (0.12.2) and only uniquely mapped about 50% of total reads, compared to the newer version we used (0.12.7), reflecting advances in the accuracy of Bowtie.

Of the 11,916 genes meeting the minimum read threshold in the ASO dataset, analysis with DESeq2 identified 3,714 as significantly differentially expressed, of which 1,903 were upregulated and 1,811 were downregulated upon TDP-43 ASO knockdown (<xref rid="pone.0141836.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref>). Our analysis discovered many more genes than the 362 upregulated and 239 downregulated found in the original report, likely due to our improved mapping power as well as the statistical improvements of DESeq2 over the original approach, which used a simple Z score statistic based on the assumption of reads following a normal distribution to detect differential expression [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Additionally, in the original analysis, samples were merged together according to experimental group (control vs. TDP-43 ASO) before performing differential expression analysis which appeared to result in a loss of statistical power. However, principal component analysis confirmed the clustering of samples within knockdown and control conditions, reflecting true transcriptomic changes due to TDP-43 knockdown (<xref rid="pone.0141836.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3c</xref>).</p><p>Strikingly, although the two datasets shared 10,345 expressed transcripts meeting the minimum read threshold (corresponding to 97.58% of expressed genes in the &#x00394;NLS experiment and 86.81% of expressed genes in the ASO experiment), the two experiments revealed vastly different effects on the expression levels of these transcripts. In fact, only 495 and 202 were significantly down- or up-regulated in both datasets, respectively (<xref rid="pone.0141836.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3d</xref>). Thus, the effects of overexpressing &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 seem to be distinct from those caused by a direct loss of TDP-43 function, again suggesting that many of the transcriptomic changes observed in &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 mice may be due to a cytoplasmic gain of TDP-43 function.</p><p>We described above that &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 mice exhibit a low number of splicing changes. To demonstrate that this was not due to a lack of power to detect splicing changes in our analysis pipeline, we performed an identical DEXSeq analysis on the RNA sequencing data from the TDP-43 ASO knockdown experiment. Remarkably, 1,029 out of 250,620 exons were significantly differentially spliced upon ASO knockdown, corresponding to 752 unique genes (<xref rid="pone.0141836.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3e</xref>). The previously described splicing analysis of this data found 788 genes containing splicing alterations using a splicing sensitive microarray [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Comparison of our results with these results is not straightforward, as DEXSeq only identifies differential exon usage, while splicing microarrays assay other classes of splicing events including alternative transcription start sites and alternative 3&#x02019; or 5&#x02019; splice sites. In line with this, we found that 115 of the genes we identified as containing changes in exonic splicing events were present in the splicing microarray results. It is important to note that transcriptome wide splicing analysis is still difficult, with different technological platforms and computational methods yielding different results [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Despite the low overlap with the splicing microarray analysis, likely due to these technological differences, this analysis nevertheless supports the lack of alternative splicing events due to &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 overexpression. Given that the &#x00394;NLS and ASO experiments had similar numbers of uniquely mapped reads, the low number of alternative splicing events identified in the &#x00394;NLS mice does not appear to be due to insufficient read depth or inappropriate choice of methodology. Rather, there appears to be a real paucity of alternative splicing events upon &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 overexpression, supporting the hypothesis that the main effects of &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 are due to a cytoplasmic gain of function rather than a nuclear loss of function.</p><p>Next, to compare the enriched pathways in the two experiments, we performed an identical pathway analysis procedure on the ASO data. In contrast to the 8 significant pathways identified in the &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 experiment, we found 64 significantly enriched pathways among the differentially expressed genes (EASE score P-value &#x0003c; 0.001, <xref rid="pone.0141836.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3f</xref>). These pathways appear to reflect an overall wound response with associated neuronal loss: nearly all of the downregulated pathways represent loss of neuronal function (including synaptic transmission, dendrite, synaptosome, neurotransmitter transport, synaptic vesicle, microtubule cytoskeleton, and many more). Additionally, almost all of the upregulated pathways appear to be related to inflammation and the wound response (including positive regulation of cell death, response to wounding, regulation of cytokine production, myeloid cell differentiation, T cell proliferation, and many more). This indicates that the transcriptomic changes seen in ASO mice may reflect not only the effects of knocking down TDP-43, but also changes due to reaction against the invasive injection of the antisense oligonucleotide [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>A Role for TDP-43 in Histone Dysregulation</title><p>As chromatin assembly and transcription-related genes were previously found to be dysregulated by microarray [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and identified again here by RNA sequencing, we sought to further characterize these pathways by investigating whether TDP-43 regulates histone transcripts. It is important to note that the RNA sequencing protocol had a polyadenylation selection step. Histone transcripts can be subdivided into canonical versus variant transcripts: canonical histone transcripts are generally not polyadenylated but rather exhibit a terminal stem-loop structure which is important for their proper trafficking and metabolism. However, misprocessing of canonical histone transcripts can lead to aberrant polyadenylation [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].

Out of 34 canonical histone genes and 15 variant histone genes, we only found 5 and 10, respectively, that met the read count threshold in our DESeq2 analysis. However, because the 3&#x02019; ends of many histone mRNAs are identical and the coding sequence is highly conserved between histone transcripts [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], we reasoned that the DESeq2 analysis, which used only uniquely mapping reads, was limiting our ability to quantify the expression of histone transcripts. With this in mind, we allowed reads to multimap to up to 10 genomic loci within histone genes, weighted by the number of multimappings. Results were normalized against 50 random unchanging genes (see <xref rid="sec002" ref-type="sec">methods</xref>). Indeed, although some histone genes still had very low coverage, this analysis retrieved additional coverage for each of the 34 canonical and 15 variant histone genes (<xref rid="pone.0141836.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>).

To test whether the observed changes in canonical histones were due to aberrant polyadenylation, we used both an oligo-dT primer, which selects for polyadenylated RNA transcripts, and random hexamer primers, which have no such selection bias.

This confirms that &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 expression leads to differential expression of transcripts which regulate histone 3&#x02019; UTR processing, coincident with an upregulation in aberrantly polyadenylated canonical histone genes.

Histological analysis of the &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 expressing mouse brain sections stained with cresyl violet revealed widespread nuclear abnormalities (<xref rid="pone.0141836.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5a</xref>). Normal pyramidal neurons within the hippocampus demonstrate moderately sized nucleoli together with several additional foci of heterochromatin (n = 16 nontransgenic or monogenic mice). In contrast, hippocampal pyramidal neurons from bigenic mice demonstrated markedly enlarged nucleoli. Moreover, the nuclear chromatin was altered such that there was prominent, densely packed perinucleolar chromatin and a loss of non-nucleolar heterochromatin. These changes were accompanied by uniform enlargement of nuclei (i.e. nucleomegaly). These morphologic changes were seen not only in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, but also in many neuronal populations which express the TDP-43 transgene in this transgenic model including neocortical neurons, olfactory bulb granular neurons and others (<xref rid="pone.0141836.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5a</xref>). In contrast, regions devoid of transgene expression such as the cerebellum did not exhibit histologic evidence of chromatin abnormalities or nucleomegaly (<xref rid="pone.0141836.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5a</xref>). These histologic changes were seen in all bigenic mice in which transgene expression was turned on for 3 months or longer (n = 14, ranging from 3 months to 15 months of transgene expression). In contrast, nuclear changes were subtle or absent in mice with shorter lengths of transgene expression (n = 21, ranging from 0 to 2 months of transgene expression). Overall, these results corroborate the results of the transcriptomic analysis, supporting a role of cytoplasmic TDP-43 overexpression in chromatin assembly pathways as well as nucleolar structure and function.</p><fig id="pone.0141836.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0141836.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Altered nuclear morphology associated with cytoplasmic TDP-43 protein.</title><p>(A) Cresyl violet staining of bigenic mice brain sections reveals abnormal nucleolar and chromatin structure and nucleomegaly affecting hippocampal pyramidal (CA1) neurons, olfactory bulb granular neurons, and neocortical neurons.

Hippocampal dentate gyrus granular neurons were studied given their uniform size and shape. Although overt chromatin abnormalities were not obvious, nuclei of neurons with cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates appeared to be slightly larger than nuclei from adjacent uninvolved neurons. To verify this finding, the cross-sectional areas of neuronal nuclei with and without TDP-43 inclusions were measured from three-dimensional confocal microscopy image stacks. 133 nuclei associated with TDP-43 inclusions and 254 adjacent uninvolved nuclei were measured from 13 human cases which revealed that nuclei of neurons with cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates had a 31.4% larger cross-sectional area (75.66 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>) relative to nuclei of adjacent uninvolved neurons (57.56 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>) (<xref rid="pone.0141836.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5b</xref>).

Thus, nucleomegaly is a feature of both experimental models of TDP-43 proteinopathy and human disease neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Discussion</title><p>The integrative analysis of the molecular phenotype of the &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 expressing mouse performed in this study revealed varied effects of the cytoplasmic overexpression of TDP-43. Transcriptomic analysis using RNA sequencing technology revealed broad effects of the transgene overexpression, including upregulation of genes related to transcription, chromatin assembly, the nucleolus and protein metabolism, as well as downregulation of genes related to synaptic activity and posttranslational modification. We identified specific dysregulation in histone 3&#x02019; UTR processing genes due to cytoplasmic TDP-43 overexpression, coincident with the surprising overrepresentation of canonical histone transcripts in the poly(A)<sup>+</sup> selected RNA sequencing data and elucidating a specific role for TDP-43 in the previously reported dysfunction of the chromatin assembly pathway [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Defects in chromatin assembly and the nucleolus were also confirmed histologically where abnormal patterns of chromatin staining and nucleomegaly were observed. Importantly, these abnormal patterns were identified in both the experimental mouse model as well as in human FTD-TDP patients, suggesting that the transcriptomic changes underlying these chromatin assembly defects may also be relevant to the disease in humans. Nucleomegaly has not been well studied in neurodegenerative diseases, but it has been observed in asymptomatic Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease patients [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>In the broader context of TDP-43 biology, this analysis suggests that a gain of cytoplasmic TDP-43 function affects nuclear dynamics. Specifically, the presence of increased cytoplasmic levels of TDP-43 protein leads to aberrations in histone 3&#x02019; UTR processing gene transcription, resulting in defects in histone processing such as irregular polyadenylation that contribute to defects in the chromatin assembly process. Several lines of evidence support this claim, including the presence of aberrantly polyadenylated canonical histone transcripts in the RNA sequencing data, PCR validation of increases in polyadenylated canonical histones, and histological validation of defects in chromatin assembly.</p><p>Although we had previously hypothesized that the toxic effects of the &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 overexpression were caused by dysregulation of endogenous mTDP-43, therefore mainly representing a loss of function [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], our comparison with the ASO TDP-43 knockdown experiment showed that, at least on the transcriptomic level, mice expressing &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 show little evidence of a pure loss of function. It is clear from our previous study that the endogenous nuclear mTDP-43 levels are reduced following &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 expression, but hTDP-43 was also shown to be present at significant levels in the nucleus [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Our fractionation protocol confirmed that the levels of total (mouse and human) TDP-43 protein were similar in nuclei of both bigenic and nontransgenic mice, suggesting that despite the introduction of a mutation within the nuclear localization signal, the transgene is able to generate enough nuclear hTDP-43 protein to compensate for the downregulation in mTDP-43 expression.</p><p>The lack of transcriptomic similarity with the ASO knockdown, the unchanged level of nuclear total TDP-43 protein, and the marked increase in cytoplasmic TDP-43 protein levels altogether suggest that the widespread degeneration and transcriptomic changes observed in the &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 expressing mice may be mainly due to a toxic gain of cytoplasmic TDP-43 function. This is further supported by the paucity of splicing changes upon expression of &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43, implying that the exogenous hTDP-43 seems to be able to mostly compensate for the disruption of endogenous mTDP-43 nuclear splicing regulatory activity. It is important to note that cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions are very rare in these mice, suggesting that the effects observed in this model seem to be due specifically to a gain of cytoplasmic function as opposed to toxic aggregation. Furthermore, comparison of the transcriptomic results with HITS-CLIP data of TDP-43 RNA binding partners showed that six out of the eight significantly changing pathways were significantly enriched for TDP-43 binding targets (data not shown). This suggests that many of the transcriptomic effects in these mice involve the direct interactions of TDP-43 with its RNA targets, as opposed to indirect effects arising from the cytoplasmic mislocalization.</p><p>This analysis also confirmed our previous report of &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43 affecting chromatin assembly genes. Our RNA-seq, HITS-CLIP and RT-PCR analyses showed that TDP-43 interacts with and alters the expression of several transcripts involved in histone 3&#x02019; UTR processing, suggesting that canonical histone dysregulation may be a mechanism by which chromatin assembly pathways and nuclear dynamics are disrupted. These transcriptomic results were supported by our histological findings which showed irregular chromatin structure in neurons expressing &#x00394;NLS-hTDP-43.</p><p>Aberrant histone transcript polyadenylation has been shown to affect translation of histone transcripts. Knockdown of stem loop binding protein, the protein that binds the stem loop of histones and facilitates proper histone transcript processing and trafficking, leads to aberrantly polyadenylated histone transcripts which are retained in the nucleus and therefore not translated [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, another study suggested that polyadenylated histone transcripts can be transported to the cytoplasm, bound to polyribosomes, and translated [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Furthermore, as histone translation is highly dependent on cell cycle stage [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], the regulation of histone transcripts in non-dividing neurons is not well understood. We did not detect a change in the levels of histone protein H3 in bigenic mice compared to nontransgenic controls at steady state (<xref rid="pone.0141836.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Given the strong physical association between histone proteins and chromatin, a reduction in histone protein synthesis may not lead to changes in steady state histone levels but rather could lead to more subtle changes in histone turnover or flux. Another layer of complexity is that independent of any effects on translation, the degradation of these histone transcripts, which is also cell cycle dependent [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], may also be affected by aberrant polyadenylation.</p><p>Together, this study further supports the importance of the role of TDP-43 in transcriptional regulation and identifies a specific effect of the overexpression of cytoplasmic TDP-43 on nuclear dynamics and misprocessing of the 3&#x02019; end of histone transcripts. Although this model artificially induces a gain of cytoplasmic function, the results observed here provide an insight into the consequences of pathological cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43. The question of whether the pathological effects of TDP-43 in ALS and FTLD-TDP are caused by a nuclear loss of function or a cytoplasmic gain of function is still uncertain [<xref rid="pone.0141836.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], but this study provides an improved understanding of the effects of a cytoplasmic gain of function.
