Importantly, although the transcriptional regulators of embryonic HC development have been described, little is known about the postnatal regulators of maturating HCs. Here we apply a cell type-specific functional genomic analysis to the transcriptomes of auditory and vestibular sensory epithelia from early postnatal mice. We identify RFX transcription factors as essential and evolutionarily conserved regulators of the HC-specific transcriptomes, and detect <italic>Rfx1,2,3,5</italic> and <italic>7</italic> in the developing HCs. To understand the role of RFX in hearing, we generate <italic>Rfx1/3</italic> conditional knockout mice. We show that these mice are deaf secondary to rapid loss of initially well-formed outer HCs. These data identify an essential role for RFX in hearing and survival of the terminally differentiating outer HCs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="i1" xlink:href="ncomms9549-i1.jpg"/>Inner ear hair cells are non-regenerative mechanosensory cells essential for hearing.

The sensations of sound and movement are dependent on highly specialized post-mitotic mechanosensory cells called hair cells (HCs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Mammalian auditory HCs do not regenerate and their loss is a final common pathway in most forms of hearing dysfunction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. For this reason, understanding the molecular signalling cascades that lead to HC differentiation is important for hearing restoration. To date, several master regulators of HC fate and differentiation have been characterized. Among these are the transcription factors (TFs) ATOH1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), POU4F3 and GFI1 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Nevertheless, forced expression of these three TFs in stem cells leads only to immature hair-cell-like cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, underscoring the need to identify factors that mediate the differentiation and survival of maturating HCs. Furthermore, while the auditory and vestibular HCs and supporting cells (SCs) are structurally and functionally distinct, very few molecular differences between these cell types have been reported. Detailed knowledge of such markers, as well as regulators of terminal differentiation, is important to identify genes with a role in hearing and balance.</p><p>Gene expression analysis has been applied successfully to study development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, regeneration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, and identification of transcriptional cascades and molecular signalling pathways in the ear<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Given the complex structure of the inner ear sensory epithelia, cell type-specific analyses, either in the form of population analysis of sorted cells or in the form of single-cell analysis, have grown in favour<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p><p>Here by performing a comprehensive cell type-specific comparison of the transcriptomes of HCs to other cell types from the auditory and vestibular systems of early postnatal mice, we identify the Regulatory Factor X (RFX) family of transcription factors as a key regulator of HC transcriptomes. Our results indicate an evolutionarily conserved role for RFX TFs in regulating the expression of genes encoding HC-enriched transcripts and demonstrate that RFXs are necessary for hearing in mice. In addition, we show that contrary to the known role of RFX as major regulators of cilia formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, in RFX1/3 deficient HCs, the primary cilia (kinocilia) develop, and planar cell polarity is not impaired. The newly formed HCs seem structurally normal and functional until the outer HCs (OHCs) die rapidly at the onset of hearing, the time when the kinocilia are normally retracted. These data support a novel role for RFX in hearing, by maintaining the survival of normally formed HCs, probably through the regulation of their transcriptome during terminal differentiation.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Inner ear cell type-specific gene clusters</title><p>To characterize the HC transcriptome in early post-natal auditory and vestibular systems, we used the <italic>Atoh1/nGFP</italic> transgenic mice expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) in all inner ear HCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Auditory and vestibular epithelia from inner ears of postnatal day 1 (P1) mice were separated into HCs, epithelial non-HCs (ENHCs) and non-epithelial cells (NECs) by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Gene expression levels were recorded from the sorted cells using whole genome expression microarrays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Hierarchical clustering, applied to all genes detected as expressed, showed a clear division of the samples based on cell types, namely HC, ENHC and NEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>), demonstrating, as expected, that cell-type identity, rather than tissue of origin, is the major determinant of the cell transcriptome.</p><p>To define patterns of gene expression, we first searched for differentially expressed genes using an analysis of variance. We identified 6,556 probes, representing 4,269 unique genes (false discovery rate&#x0003c;5&#x00025;) as differentially expressed between the cell types and tissues. Cluster analysis applied to this set of differentially expressed genes detected 12 main expression patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The genes with a higher level of expression in HCs were divided into a cochlear-enriched cluster (cluster 1) and a vestibular-enriched cluster (cluster 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the cochlear HC cluster is significantly enriched for genes that regulate sensory perception of mechanical stimuli, whereas the vestibular HC cluster is significantly enriched for cytoskeleton and cilium-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>).</p><p>In parallel, we used RNA-seq to record expression profiles of cochlear and vestibular HCs and ENHCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). There was a strong correlation between expression patterns measured by microarrays and RNA-seq, with RNA-seq measurements showing an improved dynamic range (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref>). Among the genes detected by RNA-seq, the expression of 2,176 was elevated at least threefold in HCs compared with ENHCs in either the auditory or vestibular systems. In accordance with the patterns detected by microarray, the RNA-seq data set revealed two major expression clusters containing genes with increased expression in both auditory and vestibular HCs (clusters 1 and 2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a,b</xref>). Moreover, the RNA-seq analysis detected not only HC-enriched protein-coding transcripts but also a multitude of long, non-coding transcripts whose expression is elevated in HCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether differential expression can be predictive of functional significance, we examined the expression of mouse orthologues of the known human deafness-causing genes detected in the microarray and RNA-seq data sets. Interestingly, out of 70 orthologues of known human deafness-causing genes, 56 and 64 were detected as expressed in at least one cell type, in the microarray and RNA-seq, respectively. Of these, in the microarray data set, 41 genes were differentially expressed (enrichment <italic>P</italic> value=1.6E&#x02212;9; hypergeometric test), and statistically over-represented in the clusters of genes whose expression is elevated in HCs (29 genes, <italic>P</italic> value=5.5E&#x02212;6; hypergeometric test). Similarly, in the RNA-seq, 33 genes showed at least threefold elevated expression in HCs compared with ENHCs in either the auditory or vestibular systems (<italic>P</italic> value=4.2E&#x02212;11; hypergeometric test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 3</xref>; and see examples in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>). With &#x0223c;100 deafness loci remaining to be cloned, these data suggest that differential inner ear expression and specifically elevated expression in HCs, could be used as a valuable criterion in prioritizing genes/variants for validation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification of inner ear cell type-specific markers</title><p>Next, to further define cell type-specific marker genes within each tissue (namely genes whose expression is strictly confined to a particular cell-type in our examined panel), we applied stringent expression criteria to the microarray data set (Methods). This analysis identified 158 annotated genes as markers of inner-ear HCs (out of 276 probes corresponding to annotated and predicted genes; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4</xref>). Most of these genes marked both the cochlear and vestibular HCs, and included many genes that, in the newborn mouse inner ear, are known markers of HCs, such as <italic>Atoh1</italic>, <italic>Pou4f3</italic> and <italic>Gfi1</italic>. <italic>Egfp</italic> was identified as a HC-specific marker validating the specificity of the sorting approach. Of interest, 11 genes were specific for the cochlear HCs while 13 were specific for the vestibular HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>). These included <italic>Slc26a5</italic>, a known cochlear HC-specific marker (uniquely expressed in OHCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), and <italic>Ocm</italic> which in the newborn inner ear is not detected in cochlear HCs but is already expressed in vestibular HCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Similarly, we identified 32 unique genes as markers of inner ear ENHCs of which 7 were specific for the cochlea and 4 were specific for the vestibular system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4</xref>).</p><p>To validate the identified cell type-specific markers, we examined our RNA-seq measurements and found a remarkable confirmation for the specificity of our marker sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Specifically, of the 158 genes defined by the microarray as markers of HCs, 155 showed in the RNA-seq data at least 2-fold enrichment in HCs, with an average of 10-fold enrichment in cochlear HCs and 14-fold enrichment in vestibular HCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4</xref>). As for the set of ENHC markers, for all except 1 gene, the expression levels measured by RNA-seq were at least 2-fold enriched in ENHCs compared with HCs (with an average of 11.3-fold and 7.5-fold for the cochlear and vestibular ENHCs, respectively). The stringent criterion we set for calling genes as HC-markers favours specificity (low rate of false positives) and over sensitivity (low rate of false negatives), and accordingly many genes whose expression is enriched in HCs were not called as marker genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Overall, these data define over 150 validated HC and ENHC cell type-specific and tissue-specific markers in the newborn mouse inner ear.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>RFX are important regulators of the HC transcriptome</title><p>Our next goal was to identify transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes encoding HC-enriched transcripts. We and others have demonstrated that computational analysis of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements in promoters of differentially expressed genes is a powerful tool for the identification of transcriptional regulators<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. This reverse-engineering approach for delineating transcriptional networks is based on the assumption that genes co-expressed in the same cell-type(s) are likely to be regulated by common transcription factors that are specifically active in those cells. Thus, these genes are expected to share specific DNA regulatory elements in their promoter regions. Therefore, we computationally searched for DNA motifs whose prevalence in the promoters of genes encoding HC-enriched transcripts, as detected by our microarray and RNA-seq data, is significantly higher than in the promoters of all other genes in our data set. We defined promoters as the genomic region from 1,000 nucleotides (nt) upstream to 500 nt downstream of the transcription start site (TSS). A single, highly statistically significant DNA motif was identified as over-represented in promoters of the genes encoding HC-enriched transcripts. This motif corresponds to the binding signature of the RFX family of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), and its over-representation was most prominent on promoters of genes encoding HC-enriched transcripts, which showed higher elevated expression in vestibular compared with auditory HCs (cluster 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref> and cluster 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). The RFX signature was detected on promoters of 225 genes encoding HC-enriched transcripts, resulting in a &#x0223c;3-fold over-representation of the motif (<italic>P</italic> value=1.5E&#x02212;37; hypergeometric test) and tagging the corresponding genes as putative direct targets of RFX in HCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 5</xref>). A similar sequence analysis using promoters of the human and zebrafish orthologous genes also pinpointed the RFX motif as highly enriched and the top scoring motif in both organisms, suggestive of an evolutionarily conserved pathway (enrichment <italic>P</italic> value=2.9E&#x02212;30 and 9.2E&#x02212;29 for human and zebrafish promoters, respectively; hypergeometric test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Notably, the putative targets include <italic>Lrrc51</italic>, a known deafness-causing gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, <italic>Ift88</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>)<italic>, Wdpcp</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><italic>, Tmie</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><italic>, Ush2a</italic> and <italic>Ush1c</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, all of which have known roles in murine HC development. Consistent with the known role of RFX proteins as master regulators of ciliogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, the 225 putative RFX target genes were enriched for cytoskeleton and cilium genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). Overall, the expression of the putative RFX targets was significantly enriched in both the cochlear and the vestibular HCs, with the vestibular showing a greater level of elevated expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p>We next analysed two recent expression data sets that also recorded gene expression in the inner-ear and defined sets of HC-enriched genes. One of these studies purified cochlear HCs using the <italic>Atoh1</italic><sup><italic>A1GFP/A1GFP</italic></sup> mouse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, and the other used <italic>Pou4f3-GFP</italic> mice to isolate auditory and vestibular HCs for expression analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Notably, in both of these data sets we detect the RFX binding signature as the most highly over-represented motif in the promoters of genes encoding for HC-enriched transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>). We also find that the expression of the set of putative RFX target genes derived from our combined microarray and RNA-seq data sets is highly enriched in HCs as measured by these two independent studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8b,c</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>RFX targets identified by ChIP-seq are elevated in HCs</title><p>To validate and further identify which of the candidate target genes are bound <italic>in vivo</italic> by RFX, we analysed a chromatin-immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data set performed with antibodies for RFX1 and RFX3 in the mouse Min6 cell line<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. In this data set, RFX1 and RFX3 were found to bind the promoters of 2,540 and 3,575 genes, respectively, with a highly significant overlap (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref>). We found that as a group, the expression of ChIP-seq-identified RFX target genes was significantly elevated in HCs compared with their expression in ENHCs and NECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9b</xref>).

Therefore, RFX3 is likely to be an important TF-regulating HC development. To determine the role of RFX proteins in HCs, we generated conditional knockout (cKO) mice. First, we used the <italic>Gfi1-Cre</italic> mice to delete <italic>Rfx3</italic> from all inner ear HCs. Hearing measurements of 3-month-old <italic>Rfx3</italic> cKO revealed normal thresholds which could, however, represent functional redundancy with other RFX family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>).

In the mutant mice, the sensory epithelium appeared normal at P12 throughout the length of the cochlear duct, with no significant loss of HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). In contrast to P12, there was a widespread loss of outer but not inner HCs by P15, consistent with the elevated hearing thresholds at P22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). In addition, in contrast to wild-type inner HCs (IHCs), <italic>Rfx1/3</italic> cKO IHCs had retained kinocilia at P15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>), suggesting that RFX1/3 are involved in normal retraction of this organelle in the late development, at least in IHCs. By P90, we observed near complete loss of all OHCs throughout the length of the cochlear duct and progressive IHC degeneration associated with sporadic fusion of stereocilia on some of the remaining IHC stereociliary bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>).</p><p>To further clarify the mechanism of the loss of OHCs, we analysed the expression of select cell death markers by western blot analysis.

Thus, despite the intact appearance of the sensory epithelium, cell death has already initiated at P12, leading to a rapid and diffuse loss of OHCs by P15. These data indicate that a lack of RFX expression leads to programmed cell death in the OHCs.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Early differentiation of OHCs in <italic>Rfx1/3</italic> cKO mice is normal</title><p>As we observed an accelerated degeneration of HCs at P15, we next performed structural and functional studies to examine the HCs in the earlier postnatal period. We first evaluated the HC polarity using confocal microscopy, because the RFX TFs are associated with ciliogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Abnormalities of ciliogenesis in the inner ear usually result in the disruption of planar cell polarity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. We found that <italic>Rfx1/3</italic> cKO stereocilia bundles were properly polarized throughout the length of the cochlear duct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). We further evaluated the structure of the hair bundles using SEM and found that <italic>Rfx1/3</italic> cKO HCs at P8 have well-formed bundles, including intact primary cilia (kinocilia), stereocilia, tip-links and inter-stereociliary links (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a,c</xref>). To determine whether OHCs express markers associated with functional maturation in the first postnatal week, we stained cochleae for the OHC-specific molecular motor prestin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, and found an identical expression of prestin in the mutant and wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8d</xref>).

Our data revealed numerous HC and ENHC marker genes, common and divergent between the auditory and vestibular systems at P1. We identified and validated 183 HC and ENHC cell type-specific markers, many of which have not been previously described in the ear. Several of these markers include genes encoding regulatory proteins (for example, <italic>Insm1</italic>, <italic>Pou2af1</italic>), ion channels (for example, <italic>Ano4</italic>), kinases (for example, <italic>Fn3k</italic>, <italic>Nek5</italic>) or ubiquitin ligases (for example, <italic>Trim36</italic>). The list also includes numerous genes with a known function in inner ear development. In addition, using an analysis of expression levels of genes encoding for homologues of known deafness-causing genes, we found that differential cell type-specific expression in the ear can be suggestive of functional significance. Taken together, and given the high stringent criteria used to identify these newborn inner ear cell type-specific markers, we anticipate that many of their encoding genes carry critical roles in inner ear development.</p><p>Gene expression levels are often not sufficient to identify key regulatory pathways, because numerous transcription factors are expressed in any given cell type, and the level of expression does not necessarily correlate with a functional significance. Using an unbiased reverse-engineering approach for <italic>de novo</italic> identification of transcriptional regulators of gene expression, we identified the family of RFX proteins as evolutionary conserved regulators of the HC transcriptome. Furthermore, analysis of the single cell RNA-seq data in the accompanying study by Burns <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> identifies RFX binding motifs as the most enriched in the set of genes whose expression increases in differentiating HCs, consistent with our results. We also detected the RFX-binding motif as the top scoring over-represented signature in promoters of sets of HC-enriched genes defined by two recently published studies. Taken together, these results point to a central role for RFX TFs in controlling the HC transcriptome.</p><p>Based on the role of RFX in ciliogenesis, we anticipated either the loss of kinocilia in the mutant HCs or functional defects associated with ciliogenesis&#x02014;such as planar cell polarity defects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. The normal appearance of the HCs in the young postnatal <italic>Rfx1/3</italic> cKO mice was therefore surprising. In addition, the expression of the 225 predicted RFX target genes in the vestibular HCs at P1 is higher than the expression of these genes in the auditory HCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Therefore, the normal behavioural vestibular phenotype in <italic>Rfx1/3</italic> cKO mice was also surprising. However, we cannot exclude possible compensatory function of other RFX genes expressed in vestibular HCs, such as <italic>Rfx2</italic>, <italic>Rfx5</italic> or <italic>Rfx7</italic>. The absence of abnormalities of ciliogenesis or planar cell polarity in the mutant mice, coupled with the timing of HC death, only after P12, suggest a novel role for RFX TFs in hearing, independent of ciliogenesis. The exact mechanism of OHC degeneration in <italic>Rfx1/3</italic> cKO mice is yet unclear, but the loss of outer but not inner HCs could result from the well-known greater susceptibility OHCs to cochlear insults or from compensatory effects of other <italic>Rfx</italic> genes. In addition, differential requirement of TF for HC survival has been previously described; For example, while <italic>Barhl1</italic> is expressed in both auditory and vestibular HCs, it is only required for the survival of cochlear HCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Likewise, while <italic>Gfi1</italic> is expressed in all cochlear HCs, OHCs show a greater dependence on its expression compared with IHCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>.</p><p>Our data show that <italic>Rfx1/3</italic> are necessary for OHC survival at the latest stages of their development. In the absence of <italic>Rfx1/3</italic>, OHCs undergo very fast programmed cell death. The timing of the OHC death in the <italic>Rfx1/3</italic> cKO mice coincides with two critical processes both related to RFX biology. First, the kinocilia, which are normally resorbed in wild-type HCs during this period, are retained in the mutant mice. This suggests a largely unappreciated but possible link between normal recess of kinocilia and HC survival. Second, the endocochlear potential is also developed exactly at this developmental stage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. The appearance of endocochlear potential should dramatically increase the resting current through the mechanotransduction channels, Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx in the HCs through these channels and associated metabolic stress in the OHCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Metabolic stress after noise exposure has been shown to result in DNA damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Interestingly, RFXs have a known role in cellular homeostasis through regulation of DNA integrity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that RFX may regulate HC survival also through maintenance of DNA integrity.</p><p>Perhaps the most significant contribution of this study is in the identification of RFX as a new family of TFs with a role in regulating the HC transcriptomes. Previously described transcription factors important for HC differentiation such as ATOH1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), POU4F3 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>) and GFI1 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>) are necessary for early (embryonic) HC differentiation and survival, while RFX1/3 are crucial for the latest stage of HC development. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, rfx is directly regulated by atonal (the Atoh1 homologue), and in conjunction with a forkhead transcription factor, fd3F, regulates the differentiation of the chordotonal (mechanosensory) neurons involved in hearing in Drosophila<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. In mouse, the closest orthologue to fd3F is <italic>Foxj1</italic>, which is also expressed in the auditory and vestibular HCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>), and could be required together with RFX to regulate the maturation of HCs. Interestingly, a recent manuscript by Costa <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> showed that forced expression of ATOH1, POU4F3 and GFI1 in stem cells results in immature HC like-cells, which specifically lack the expression of the orthologues of some of the target genes of fd3F, consistent with our hypothesis that the RFX pathway is necessary for HC terminal differentiation. Future studies will explore the RFX-specific transcriptional cascade in the developing HCs and determine whether this family of TF can be applied for regenerative treatments for hearing loss.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Animals</title><p>Wild-type ICR mice were obtained as time-mated animals from Charles River Laboratories (Maryland).

Specifically, Illumina RNAseq libraries were prepared with the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep kit (Illumina) per manufacturer's protocol. Adapters containing 6-nt indexes were ligated to the double-stranded cDNA. The DNA was purified between enzymatic reactions and the size selection of the library was performed with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics). Libraries were pooled, and each received 0.25 a lane of sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 with a paired-end 100 base configuration. Library construction and sequencing were performed at the Institute for Genome Sciences of the University of Maryland, School of Medicine (IGS).</p><p><italic>RNA-seq data analysis</italic>. Sequenced reads were aligned to the mouse and zebrafish genomes (mm9 and Zv9) using TopHat<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. Based on profiles of base-calls quality, the reads in the mouse data set were trimmed and only the first 50&#x02009;nt were used for the alignment.

The mouse and zebrafish data sets were then normalized using quantile normalization and then a floor value of 20 reads was set (to avoid inflation of fold-change estimates due to division by low counts).

In all tests of HC-elevated genes, the top scoring motif matched the known binding signature of RFX TFs. The location distribution of this motif consistently showed a very sharp peak at the TSS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>), indicating that RFX commonly regulates the expression of its target genes by binding to their very proximal promoter region. Accordingly, the enrichment was most statistically significant when the search was narrowed to the interval between 200&#x02009;nt upstream and 100&#x02009;nt downstream of the TSSs. The results reported correspond to this interval.</p><p><italic>Deafness-related loci</italic>.
