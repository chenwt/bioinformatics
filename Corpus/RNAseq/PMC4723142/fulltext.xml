The processing of these variants is tightly controlled in a cell-type specific manner and has a significant impact on gene expression control. Here we investigate the differential translation rates of individual mRNA variants in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and in ESC derived Neural Precursor Cells (NPCs) using polysome profiling coupled to RNA sequencing. We show that there are a significant number of detectable mRNA variants in ESCs and NPCs and that many of them show variant specific translation rates. This is correlated with differences in the UTRs of the variants with the 5&#x02019;UTR playing a predominant role. We suggest that mRNA variants that contain alternate UTRs are under different post-transcriptional controls. This is likely due to the presence or absence of miRNA and protein binding sites that regulate translation rate. This highlights the importance of addressing translation rate when using mRNA levels as a read out of protein abundance. Additional analysis shows that many annotated non-coding mRNAs are present on the polysome fractions in ESCs and NPCs. We believe that the use of polysome fractionation coupled to RNA sequencing is a useful method for analysis of the translation state of many different RNAs in the cell.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>QWLW, CV, QYL, TYZ, VT and LAV were funded by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore.

Tight regulation of gene expression is essential for cells to maintain their self-renewal state. Upon differentiation, specific cascades of gene expression changes are implemented resulting in conversion of the cells to specific cell types. These gene expression changes are regulated and coordinated on multiple levels including transcription, RNA stability, translational control as well as protein function and degradation. This ensures a tight control over protein expression which is required for self-renewal or differentiation. Changes in transcriptional control are a major driving force for differentiation and much work has focused on mapping the binding sites of transcription factors in ESCs.[<xref rid="pone.0143235.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143235.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] More recently, post-transcriptional control has been shown to play a major role in ESC function. A number of miRNAs are known to promote ESC self-renewal while others are important for directed differentiation. [<xref rid="pone.0143235.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0143235.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>It is now well established that a single gene can give rise to many different mRNA variants, the majority of which will have different protein products. These variants can arise through a number of mechanisms including alternate transcription start sites (TSS), alternative splicing and alternative poly(A) tail site selection. Alternate TSSs are a major contributor to 5&#x02019;UTR diversity between transcripts from the same gene. In addition there is a large amount of tissue specific usage of alternative transcription start sites and a number of examples have been shown of TSS selection being developmentally regulated [<xref rid="pone.0143235.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143235.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Alternate TSSs can lead to altered 5&#x02019;UTR sequences and different start codons resulting in alterations or truncations in the N terminus of the protein. Inappropriate usage of TSSs has been associated with cancer progression highlighting the importance of tight control over TSS usage [<xref rid="pone.0143235.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Splicing is the most significant contributor to transcript diversity and it is estimated that over 95% of genes produce alternatively spliced mRNAs. Splicing is highly regulated and many tissues show very specific splicing patterns with some genes producing up to 25 different spliced isoforms in different tissues. Advances in sequencing technologies have confirmed the widespread prevalence of alternative splicing in different tissues yet the role of the majority of variants is still unknown [<xref rid="pone.0143235.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0143235.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Alternative splicing is regulated by specific RNA binding proteins that bind to the pre-RNA to control the function of the splicing machinery [<xref rid="pone.0143235.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A number of ESC specific splicing events have been characterised demonstrating the importance of splicing control in ESC maintenance [<xref rid="pone.0143235.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0143235.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Variant mRNA isoforms can arise from utilisation of alternative polyadenylation (APA) sites which affect the length of the 3&#x02019;end of the RNA. The majority of APA sites are present in the 3&#x02019;UTR so it affects 3&#x02019;UTR length. [<xref rid="pone.0143235.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143235.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] It has been estimated that approximately 70% of genes have APA sites with each gene having an average of two. [<xref rid="pone.0143235.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143235.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] During development the proximal polyA sites are frequently used causing mRNAs to have shorter UTRs. [<xref rid="pone.0143235.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Highly proliferative cells have also been shown to have shorter 3&#x02019;UTRs [<xref rid="pone.0143235.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Longer UTRs have a greater number of cis-acting regulatory sites and so are likely under greater post-transcriptional control resulting in changes in protein level [<xref rid="pone.0143235.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143235.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143235.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Alternate TSSs, splicing and alternate polyA site selection can all result in changes in the protein product produced from an mRNA variant. In addition they can affect sequences within the 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019;UTRs of an mRNA. The UTRs harbour many of the control elements that dictate when, where and at what rate an mRNA is translated. They also regulate the stability of an mRNA. This is mediated by many trans-acting factors in the form of RNA binding proteins and miRNAs that bind to the UTRs of target mRNAs. These post-transcriptional controls can greatly impact on protein levels in a cell. Recently the translation rate of different mRNA isoforms was compared using RNAseq in a human kidney cell line. It was reported that approximately 30% of mRNA isoforms are differentially loaded with ribosomes suggesting they are translated at a different rate. [<xref rid="pone.0143235.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Recent studies in mouse ESCs demonstrated that different splice variants of <italic>SERCA2</italic> can be differentially targeted by miRNAs in ESCs and embryoid bodies due to differences in UTR sequences [<xref rid="pone.0143235.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These and other studies highlight the importance of isoform specific UTR sequences in post-transcriptional control of gene expression [<xref rid="pone.0143235.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>We sought to address the impact of alternate UTRs on translation rate of different variants in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and ESC derived neural precursor cells (NPCs). We have separated mRNAs based on ribosomal load and assessed the relative translation rate of individual variants using RNA seq. We find that there are a significant proportion of variants that show differential translation rates in ESCs and NPCs. We further show that this altered translation rate correlates with processing events that affect 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019; UTR sequences with 5&#x02019;UTR sequences having the greater role. Our data suggests that analysing the translation state of mRNA variants is essential to get a more accurate read out of the protein levels in a cell.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Translationally regulated mRNAs on ESC to NPC differentiation</title><p>We set out to determine the role of splicing in the regulation of translation rate in ESCs and ESC derived NPCs. ESCs were differentiated into NPCs in a SOX1-GFP reporter line in N2B27 media for six days [<xref rid="pone.0143235.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0143235.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. SOX1 is a marker for NPCs enabling us to confirm efficient differentiation with over 80% of cells expressing SOX1-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0143235.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). To determine the translation state of RNAs in the two cell types, polysome profiling was performed to separate the differentially translated RNAs across a sucrose gradient. RNAs were pooled together as non-translated, low-translation and high-translation depending on their ribosomal load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0143235.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). RNAs with a greater ribosomal load sediment in the heavier sucrose fractions and are considered to be more highly translated. RNAs with few or no ribosomes are found in the lighter fractions and are considered to be non- or inefficiently translated. RNAs were also collected from the bottom of the gradient. To determine the translation rate of individual splice variants, we subjected each group of RNAs to RNA sequencing using the ABI SOLiD sequencing platform. Sequences were mapped to the UCSC mm10 reference genome and data was normalised to a pool of four bacterial poly(A) spike-in mRNAs. The location in the polysome profile of a selection of RNAs was validated by qRT-PCR and found to have a good correlation (R<sup>2</sup>-0.7134), suggesting our RNA sequencing gave an accurate read out of the polysome association of individual mRNAs.

Interestingly, the majority of translationally regulated RNAs were not co-regulated at the mRNA level. 58% of translationally regulated mRNAs showed less than 2 fold change in RNA levels suggesting they are predominantly translationally regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0143235.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). We used RT-PCR to confirm the polysome association of one translationally regulated mRNA <italic>Tchp</italic>.

We identified multiple splice variants for 650 genes in ESCs and 661 genes in NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0143235.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Of these, 10% and 8% of splice variants were enriched in different polysome pools in ESCs and NPCs respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0143235.s007">S1 Table</xref>). This suggests the splice variants are being translated at different rates within the same cell type. We next assessed the correlation between altered 5&#x02019; or 3&#x02019; UTRs and different translation rates between the variants. Interestingly, we saw an enrichment for variants with altered UTRs in the differentially translated group of variants compared to variants that show similar rates of translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0143235.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). In ESCs, for variants that showed different translation rates, 84% of variants had different UTRs (95% in NPCs). This is in contrast to variants that do not show changes in translation where only 66% of variants displayed altered UTR sequences (65% in NPCs). The majority of variations in both cases were in the 5&#x02019;UTR with over 60% (63% in NPCs) of translationally regulated splice variants having different 5&#x02019;UTR sequences. 16% (14% in NPCs) had different 3&#x02019;UTR sequences and 8% (18% in NPCs) had different 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019; UTRs. We analysed the 5&#x02019;UTRs of mRNA variants that showed differences in translation rate and altered 5&#x02019;UTRs. We found no significant difference in the GC content of the UTRs however there was an enrichment for longer UTRs in the more translationally repressed variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0143235.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). It is likely that the longer sequences contain regions that inhibit ribosome scanning and thus repress translation. There was also a correlation between translation rate and 5&#x02019;UTR free energy levels such that variants that were more highly translated had a greater free energy level in their 5&#x02019;UTRs. A higher free energy generally results in less stable RNA structures that could be more conducive to increased ribosomal scanning and thus increased translation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0143235.s002">S2 Fig</xref>)</p><fig id="pone.0143235.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0143235.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Translational regulation of splice variants in ESCs and NPCs.</title><p>(A) Analysis of the translation rate of all mRNAs with more than one variant in ESCs and NPCs.

An example of this is <italic>Ctage5</italic> which has three variants. Variant 1 and 3 have the same UTR sequences but differ only in the inclusion of exons 5 and 6 in variant one. Inclusion of these exons in variant 1 results in a significantly decreased ribosomal load compared with variant 3 suggesting it is being translated at a slower rate. Variant 2 excludes these exons in addition to having a different 3&#x02019;UTR and its translation is significantly stronger than variant 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0143235.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Exon 4 and 5 do not have an enrichment of rare codons suggesting the translational repression seen is not due to codon usage. It is likely that exon 5 and 6 contain cis-acting regulatory sequences that might bind to miRNAs or RBPs to repress translation of that variant.</p><p>mRNAs with long ORFs may be bound by a higher number of ribosomes which could contribute to the differences in ribosomal load we see between splice variants in one cell type. To see if ORF length was responsible for the altered ribosomal load seen on the different splice variants, we determined the ORF lengths for all variants showing a polysome shift and looked for a correlation with direction of the shift. We saw no strong correlation between longer ORFs and higher ribosomal load (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0143235.t001">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0143235.s007">S1 Table</xref>). For variants that were bound by more ribosomes less than half had longer open reading frames. This suggests that altered ORF length is not the predominant cause of the altered ribosomal load we see in different splice variants.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0143235.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0143235.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Relationship between ORF length and translation rate.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0143235.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0143235.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ESC</th><th align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NPC</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Genes with multiple variants that show different translation rates correlating with ORF size.</td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">33</td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20</td></tr><tr><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Genes with multiple variants that show different translation rates <bold>not</bold> correlating with ORF size.</td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">34</td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">33</td></tr><tr><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>TOTAL</bold></td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67</td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap><p>In order to validate the splice variant changes in translation we identified we first performed qRT-PCR with variant specific primers across three biological replicates.

We identified over 260 GenBank annotated non-coding RNAs in ESCs (280 in NPCs) that include long non-coding RNAs (lnc-RNAs), non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), small nuclear and small nucleolar RNAs. The lnc-RNAs include predominantly large intergeneic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) while the non-coding RNAs include predominantly pseudogenes. In agreement with previous studies we see a large proportion of these non-coding RNAs associated with the light and heavy polysome fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0143235.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). Over 70% of lnc-RNAs were associated with the low or high translation fractions in both ESCs and NPCs while over 90% of non-coding RNAs were associated with polysomes.

We find that many mRNAs are translationally regulated during differentiation of ESCs to NPCs. We have validated that a shift in ribosomal load has a consequence for protein production with <italic>Tchp</italic>. <italic>Tchp</italic> is translationally upregulated in NPCs resulting in an increase in protein levels. TCHP was originally described as a keratin filament binding protein and plays a role in ciliogenesis and centrosomal function [<xref rid="pone.0143235.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143235.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. TCHP has no known role in the nervous system but given its translational upregulation it may be a regulator of early neural differentiation. We identified 31 genes expressing multiple variants that are translationally regulated in a variant specific manner on NPC differentiation. In these cases multiple variants are detected but only one is under translational control on differentiation. In a number of cases there was a switch in the variant that was highly translated so that while the absolute levels of the RNA variants may be the same, their different translation rates will result in the protein products being present at different levels in ESCs and NPCs. Interestingly the role of the majority of these variants is not known so it remains to be determined how this variant specific translation impacts on neural differentiation.</p><p>The method of RNAseq analysis of polysomal fractions is different from the alternative approach of ribosomal footprinting which provides information on the mRNA sequence physically bound by ribosomes and is used to infer translation rate [<xref rid="pone.0143235.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143235.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Despite the high resolution of the method the footprint sequences do not provide information on UTRs. In addition, currently the technique is not able to distinguish between different splice variants. Polysome profiling coupled to RNAseq provides information on variant specific ribosomal load and enables the analysis of corresponding UTR sequences. Using polysome profiling coupled with RNAseq, we find that in ESCs ten percent of RNA isoforms display different translation rates. This correlates with differences in the UTR sequences which likely drive the altered translation rate. This suggests that the relative protein levels of the two isoforms will not correlate with their mRNA levels.</p><p>Alternate UTRs can arise through a number of different mechanisms including alternate TSS, alternative splicing and alternative polyA site selection. Our datasets were mapped to the RefSeq genome which has annotations for promoter start sites and known alternative splicing events. As such, our studies have focused only on variants arising from alternative transcription start site selection and alternative splicing. Our analysis does not take into account any APA that may be occurring and it is possible that the variants identified in our studies may be further regulated by APA in different cell types. We find that in ESCs 10% of mRNAs with multiple variants display different translation rates for each variant inferred from their ribosomal load. This strongly correlates with the variants having different 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019;UTR sequences. This represents over 67 genes with different detectable isoforms in ESCs. This demonstrates the importance of analysing the translation rates of RNA variants when studying gene expression patterns. We confirmed the differential ribosomal load of five variants by PCR and performed luciferase assays to confirm that the regulation was mediated through sequences in the UTRs of these mRNAs. We tested two variants that had altered 5&#x02019;UTRs and three that had altered 3&#x02019;UTRs. In all cases the UTR sequence was shown to regulate luciferase protein levels in a similar way to that predicted by the polysome profiling data. Where the variant had a decreased ribosomal load following polysome profiling, the UTR promoted a decrease in luciferase activity suggesting a role in translational repression. It is likely that the UTRs that are associated with a decreased ribosomal load have cis-acting sequences that confer translational repression. These could take the form of binding sites for miRNA or RNA binding proteins. Alternate 5&#x02019;UTRs could also contain uORFs which can function to repress translation [<xref rid="pone.0143235.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143235.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The variants that do not have these sequences are likely not targeted for repression. These different UTR sequences have likely evolved to confer additional levels of regulation on specific RNA variants and have the potential to precisely regulate their translation both spatially and temporally.</p><p>Analysis of the ORF size of the translationally regulated variants suggested that for most variants the differences in ribosomal load were not a consequence of altered ORF size. There were a minority of variants that had significantly longer ORFs that correlated with increased ribosomal load and in these cases the ORF length is likely the cause. For variants that did show a correlation between ORF length and ribosomal load the difference in size was not large enough (less than 25% larger) to result in a shift in the polysome fractions in most cases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0143235.t001">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly we identified a selection of splice variants that had different translation rates but no change in the UTRs. While some of these candidates will have a decreased ribosomal load due to a decreased ORF length it is likely that the remaining transcripts contain cis-acting regulatory sequences within their ORF. miRNAs have been shown to target the ORF of mRNAs [<xref rid="pone.0143235.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143235.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] so it is possible that the changes in ORF seen in these variants results in altered translational control in addition to altered protein function. Exon 4 and 5 in <italic>Ctage5</italic> variant 1 are associated with a decreased ribosomal load compared to variant 3 that skips these exons. While there was no enrichment for rare codons in these exons it is possible that these regions could bind to trans-acting factors or that the sequence itself is inhibiting translation. It will be interesting to determine if these exons can function to regulate translation from within the UTR or if they have to be in the ORF to function.</p><p>We assessed the ribosomal load of annotated non-coding RNAs and found that a significant number of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and non-coding RNAs were associated with the ribosomes. The lnc-RNAs include predominantly long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) while the non-coding RNAs include predominantly pseudogenes. The presence of the pseudogenes on the polysomes is in agreement with recent reports that analysed ribosomal footprinting data from a number of different species. [<xref rid="pone.0143235.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] Recent studies have demonstrated the presence of many non-coding RNAs on polysomes. Our studies confirm that many non-coding RNAs are in the polysome fraction but we cannot distinguish between RNAs that are actively being translated by the ribosome and those that may be binding the ribosome or other mRNA molecules that are being translated. It is possible that many non-coding RNAs could be associating with the ribosome in a regulatory capacity and so while associated with the ribosome would show no ribosomal footprint. It has been suggested that non-coding RNAs could be being translated to give short peptides but additional studies are needed to elaborate on this idea [<xref rid="pone.0143235.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143235.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143235.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Our data confirms the presence of non-coding RNAs on the ribosome and further investigation is needed to determine why they are there.</p><p>Taken together our data illustrates the importance of addressing the translation rate of individual mRNA variants. We demonstrate that different mRNA variants can have very different translation rates. This confirms and expands on previous reports from human cells and demonstrates variant specific translation rates in ESCs and NPCs. Additional work is needed to determine the mechanisms by which these mRNAs are regulated and their significance for ESC self-renewal and pluripotency.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>Sox1-GFP ESCs were a gift from Dr Austin Smith [<xref rid="pone.0143235.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143235.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].
