In the CC(I) group we found a cluster of homologs of Rpi-vnt1 (chromosome 9), Rpi-blb2 (chromosome 6), NRC1 (chromosomes 4 and 1) and R3 (chromosome 11). There is one notable cluster of the CC(II) type composed of proteins with homology to a not-yet-characterized and hypothetical protein according to Uniref positioned on chromosome 8.</p><p>There was no problematic grouping: all TNL and TN types grouped into the TIR clade; and those CNL and CN grouped together into CC(I) or CC(II) clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034775-g001">Figure 1</xref>). N/NLs were dispersed among both groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034775.s003">Figure S3</xref>); as previously mentioned <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Kohler1">[16]</xref>, this behavior indicates a diverse rather than monophyletic origin of this group of proteins. Proteins belonging to this group (N/NL) must be originated by a domain loss (that in most cases leads to the creation of pseudogenes), and in a very low frequency due to errors in our analysis or in the annotation. Errors in the start codon position or an exon skipped during the annotation would lead to a misidentification of a domain in the N terminal region.</p><p>Due to the striking differences between CC groups, we selected all the CC(II) proteins and a representative number of CC(I) proteins and used MEME and local alignments, using ClustalW to examine the differences between these groups of proteins, not only with respect to the NBS domain but also with respect to the N- and Carboxy-terminal regions.</p><p>In general, the CC(I) and CC(II) NBS regions share the main subdomains, P-loop, kinase-2, kinase-3 and the GLPL, but also have at least two regions with high divergence. The first region is found between the P-loop and the kinase-2, and the second one is near the GLPL subdomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034775-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Members of the CC(II), despite having two very different domains in the areas previously mentioned, still cluster together in the phylogenetic analysis due to the conservation of the principal subdomains. The difference between groups CC(I) and CC(II) is notable if we align these two subgroups (visualized with Jalview. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034775.s004">Figure S4</xref>; ClustalW raw output, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034775.s010">Table S5</xref>). If we analyze the CC(I) and CC(II) proteins in depth, we observe clear differences in the CC and carboxy terminal regions.

Also, the LRR motifs are quite different between these groups, in general CC(I) has a greater number of a smaller LRR motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034775-g002">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034775.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0034775-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0034775.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>MEME analysis of NBS and LRR regions between CC(I) and CC(II) proteins.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) NBS domain analysis.

This may be explained in part due to the predominance of CNL genes in potato (85&#x00025;). These clusters are in most cases homogeneous (highly similar to other NBS in the same genomic cluster). However, there are several cases where TNL genes are mixed with CNL genes in close super clusters. Truncated R genes lacking large portions of the NBS domain or the LRR region are often associated with full R-genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034775-g003">Figure 3</xref> in yellow; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034775.s008">Table S3</xref>).</p><p>TNL genes tend to form small clusters of up to 9 genes. Only 12 TNL proteins (19.6&#x00025; of anchored TNL genes) are not grouped (singletons); most members of this family are located within clusters with only two or three genes; 26 (42.6&#x00025;) and 23 (37.8&#x00025;) belong to clusters with more than four members. One exception is a cluster on chromosome 1 that has 9 of these genes, with similarity to the TMV resistance protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034775-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The other clustered TNL genes are similar to Bacterial spot disease resistance proteins, NL25 and a putative disease resistance protein. We found out that there is presence of TIR genes among the entire genome except for chromosomes 3 and 10. However, in chromosomes 8 and 12 we could only find one TIR gene each, and neither was annotated as a pseudogene, suggesting that genes that are not clustered together could be more stable. However, of the 9 unclustered TNL, 4 are pseudogenes due in most cases by premature stop codons.</p><p>Interestingly, although a large number of TNL genes do not occur physically in clusters, most of them are located near CC clusters. PGSC0003DMP400032156, for example, is a TNL gene with homology to N protein that is positioned at 3.71 Mb in chromosome 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034775-g003">Figure 3</xref>) near a CC cluster (starting at 3.73 Mb) of BS2 homologs. Few examples show TNL genes &#x0201c;alone&#x0201d; in the genome. One of these examples, however, is present in chromosome 7 where two genes, PGSC0003DMP400023972 (38.35 Mb), and PGSC0003DMP400030257 (47.13 Mb), can be found &#x0201c;alone&#x0201d; (&#x0003e;3 Mb from any NBS-gene). PGSC0003DMP400023972 has the structure of a full NBS gene with homology to a nematode resistance protein; however PGSC0003DMP400030257 has a frameshift mutation and lacks the LRR domain. It is interesting to note that the five remaining TNL genes in these chromosomes are also tagged as pseudogenes. Another example of TNL-alone genes is PGSC0003DMP400017113 on chromosome 6, encoding a full Bacterial spot disease resistance protein 4 homolog.</p><p>On the other hand, CC proteins group in large clusters which form super clusters. For example, at &#x0223c;50 Mb on chromosome 9 a group of 45 proteins occur in a 2 Mb region. This super cluster is an interesting example as it comprises four clusters (three CC clusters and one TIR cluster (four members). More common examples are super clusters that group only CC proteins such as the one starting at &#x0223c;41 MB in chromosome 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034775-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Pseudogenes</title><p>When the 435 NBS resistance genes were closely analyzed, a total of 179 pseudogenes were identified across the twelve linkage groups of potato. Most of these pseudogenes have very strong identity with another full NBS protein but their sequence is truncated by either a premature stop codon or a frameshift mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034775.s012">Table S7</xref>). We have also observed that some of these pseudogenes resemble partial genes and appear to be the product of deletions. More rare events are reported, such as some cases of pseudogenization by transposition, exon skipping, and a single case where the scaffold ends leading to a truncated gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034775.s012">Table S7</xref>). This very high number of pseudogenes, however, may be an underestimation as the pseudogenes identified have at least a partial NBS domain; other pseudogenes that might have lost the whole NBS domain are not taken into consideration as they were not included in this analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034775.s008">Table S3</xref>).</p><p>The distribution of pseudogenes among the chromosomes is described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0034775-t002">Table 2</xref>. Chromosome 3 groups only five NBS-coding genes, and only one of them (20&#x00025;) is annotated as pseudogene; chromosome 1 has 40 genes, and only 12 (30&#x00025;) are classified as pseudogenes. In contrast, chromosomes 6 and 9 have higher ratios of pseudogenization; 54.84&#x00025; and 57.89&#x00025; respectively. The number of pseudogenes also varies between groups. Counts of CNL and TNL-like pseudogenes are 156 and 23 respectively, which was expected, since 85&#x00025; of the total NBS-genes are CNL group while only 15&#x00025; are TNL-like.</p><table-wrap

It belongs to the Solanaceae family that included economically important species such as tomato, pepper, eggplant, and tobacco. Potato is not only important as a fresh market product, but has become of great interest for the French fries, chips and starch processing industries. Potato, however, is susceptible to many diseases and its growth is dependent on a huge amount of pesticides. Given the importance of this crop, improvement of disease resistance is essential, however, classical breeding of an autotetraploid species is a challenge. Moreover, asexual propagation and numerous market limiting traits complicate the task. The availability of the potato genome sequence provides us with the opportunity to identify the complement of NBS-containing R gene homologs as a first step in marker assisted genetic improvement or genomic selection of this vital crop.</p><p>NBS-LRR genes are the largest class of disease resistance proteins and have a major effect on the defense of the plant against its pathogens. We have initially found 435 NBS-containing proteins in the potato genome; this number is close to that found in poplar (402, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Kohler1">[16]</xref>). If we also consider those proteins related to this family that have lost the NBS domain, the number simply gets bigger. The &#x0223c;577 NBS members (435) and cluster associated NBS-derived genes lacking the NBS domain (142) represent &#x0223c;1.48&#x00025; of all the proteins predicted in potato. This number is higher compared to rice (&#x0223c;1&#x00025;, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Monosi1">[15]</xref>), <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (&#x0223c;0.43&#x00025;, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Meyers1">[9]</xref>), and <italic>Populustrichocarpa</italic> (&#x0223c;1&#x00025;, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Kohler1">[16]</xref>).This analysis was performed on a double monoploid potato but considering the highly heterozygous behavior and the haplotype diversity observed in the diploid <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic> RH genotype (PGSC. 2011) it's possible to envisage that a cultivated tetraploid potato may contain thousands of R genes.</p><p>The largest class of NBS in <italic>S. phureja</italic> is represented by non-TIR genes. The predominance of TNL or CNL genes through the genome may be determined by the pathogens that infect the plant species throughout its history or may be driven by another evolutionary force that could be related to the success of one or another type of R genes. TNL are the predominant class in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Meyers1">[9]</xref> and <italic>Brassica rapa</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Mun1">[10]</xref>; however, in <italic>P. trichocarpa</italic>, as in potato, CNL are the most abundant class <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Kohler1">[16]</xref>. A more drastic separation can be observed in the cereals where TNL genes have not been found; moreover, cereals have CNL genes that have no homologs among the dicot species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Monosi1">[15]</xref>. This behavior is observed also in potato, where a large group of CNL cereal reference R-gene clusters separate from any CC gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034775.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This evidence supports the idea that the resistance gene arsenal of dicot and cereal species have greatly diverged since their independent evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Monosi1">[15]</xref>.</p><p>According to Freedman and Baker (2007), R-gene evolution and quantity is dependent on the size and cluster complexity of these genes. The high number of resistance genes identified in this study could be explained mainly by the size of the NBS-clusters. The number of resistance-like genes near NBS coding clusters follows the same principle; the chromosomes with the highest number of these genes have the biggest clusters, for example chr1 and chr11. The low presence of the TIR domain could be explained by the fact that most of the TIR genes are either inside small clusters or out of any clusters.</p><p>The clusters identified in this study can be classified in mixed, simple and complex, and the genes near them have shown the same trend. Complex clusters have resistance and stress related-genes with varying domains. This attribute could be explained by intergenic recombination enhanced by R-gene clusters, previously hypothesized by Freedman and Baker (2007). It is therefore expected that these R-related genes keep growing in number, size and complexity in the potato genome, and expand the different functions of these genes in this crop.</p><p>Although most of the genes mapped in this study are grouped in clusters (77&#x00025;) we found some singleton genes. As observed in other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-AmelineTorregrosa1">[11]</xref> these singletons have homologs elsewhere in the genome. One hypothesis is that these solitary genes may act as &#x0201c;seeds&#x0201d; establishing the position for new clusters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-AmelineTorregrosa1">[11]</xref>. This idea must be revised as the singletons may be in a more stable genome region just by chance; studying the distribution and dynamics of these singletons from different potato species would allow us to make more inferences on this issue; in fact, a large proportion of CNL singleton genes in the DM genome are pseudogenes.</p><p>NBS resistance genes have a very rapid turnover, especially those that are encoded within clusters where large numbers of both new genes and pseudogenes are generated. We have found that in potato there are a very high number of pseudogenes that reaches 41.6&#x00025; of the total R-genes found in potato. This percentage is very close to that observed in a previous but less profound analysis (39.4&#x00025;, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Genome1">[21]</xref>). This unusual high rate of pseudogenization might parallel the rapid evolution of effector genes found in potato pathogens such as <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Genome1">[21]</xref>.</p><p>The pseudogene percentage in potato is very high if we compare it to similar analyses made in other plant genomes such as <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (8.05&#x00025;, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Meyers1">[9]</xref>) or <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> (14.74&#x00025;, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-AmelineTorregrosa1">[11]</xref>). On the other hand, in <italic>Lotus japonica</italic> a very high percentage of pseudogenes (39&#x00025;, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Li1">[18]</xref>) was also found. We believe that the pseudogene rate found in each species may be the product of a criterion bias, among other factors. In the two articles mentioned above, the authors had relatively restrictive criteria for identifying pseudogenes. Establishing parameters for selecting pseudogenes may help to reduce the difference but this may not be the only way to overcome this variability, as there are too many variables to take into consideration.</p><p>As pseudogenes could be non-functional genes that are just waiting to be eliminated from the genome, or reservoirs of genetic diversity that could be reached under recombination or gene conversion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Meyers2">[13]</xref>, a new hypothesis of their real function is taking shape. As mentioned before, it was demonstrated in mouse that a pseudogene was capable of regulating the messenger-RNA stability of its homologous coding gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Hirotsune1">[41]</xref>; moreover a recent investigation in tumor cells has demonstrated that expressed pseudogenes can regulate coding gene expression, as they compete for microRNA binding, thus revealing a non-coding function for pseudogenes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Poliseno1">[46]</xref>.</p><p>It is interesting that of the total 179 pseudogenes, 74 have evidence of being expressed by RNAseq analysis, 42 of those are expressed with a mapping depth higher than 10 FPKM (Fragments per Kb of exon per million reads) and a couple of these are expressed with values higher than 100 FPKM. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis in plants that uses available RNAseq information to analyze pseudogene expression. Expressed NBS-LRR pseudogenes have been reported for <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-AmelineTorregrosa1">[11]</xref>, pine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Liu1">[47]</xref>, and rice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Monosi1">[15]</xref>.</p><p>The pseudogenes presented in potato (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034775.s012">Tables S7</xref>) plus the more evident NBS-truncated proteins found around the NBS-clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034775.s008">Table S3</xref> yellow) could act as adaptor molecules, acting as recruiters or merely interacting with the NBS-LRR genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Belkhadir1">[48]</xref>. The products of the pseudogenes would be very similar to those that arose from alternative splicing as in TMV resistance protein (N); it was shown that in the presence of TMV p50 elicitor the resistance protein tends to oligomerize <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Mestre1">[49]</xref> and that in such conditions an N alternative splicing that lacks the LRR region is overexpressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-DineshKumar1">[50]</xref>. Taking these facts together, it was hypothesized that oligomerization of alternate N proteins may be crucial for the stability of N and the HR response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Friedman1">[40]</xref>. The expression of alternatively splicing isoforms derived by a single TMV resistance protein gene was experimentally confirmed in potato (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034775-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>In this scenario, different isoforms derived from alternative splicing may act in the same way as pseudogenes. As reviewed previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Gassmann1">[51]</xref> the phenomenon of alternative splicing is best described among TNL genes, as they generally have more exons than CNL genes, which in many cases are intronless, as are RPS2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Bent1">[52]</xref>, RPM1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Grant1">[53]</xref>, and RPS5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Warren1">[54]</xref>; moreover, no alternative splicing has been detected among any intronless Arabidopsis CNL gene. CNL alternative phenomenon was described only for the Mla locus in barley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Wei1">[55]</xref>; however, this family has no homologs among potato NBS genes.</p><p>It was tentatively thought that the infrequency of CNL alternative isoforms may be the reason why they form larger clusters than TNL genes in potato. In some CNL clusters, the proteins within this region have strong homology relationships as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034775-g004">figure 4</xref>, and some of them may be acting in a similar way as the alternative isoforms of N protein described previously. Large clusters of TIR genes have been observed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Meyers1">[9]</xref> and <italic>Brassica rapa</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Mun1">[10]</xref>, indicating that the ability to form alternative isoforms may not be related to the cluster nature of some R-proteins; this observation, however, needs more evidence to be cleared.</p><p>It was recently discovered, as mentioned above, that expressed pseudogenes could regulate their coding gene expression by competing for microRNA binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Poliseno1">[46]</xref>. Following this observation, NBS pseudogenes and truncated NBS genes may be preventing the degradation of their homologous functional R-genes by the local silencing system. It would be interesting to explore miRNAs in the potato genome targeting NBS genes and infer whether there is some kind of particular miRNA-driven regulation of these genes. A more appealing hypothesis would be that this kind of &#x0201c;protection&#x0201d; was originated in the coevolution of pathogens with plants. It is not yet clear, but there is published evidence that some viral siRNAs could be targeting host genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034775-Mlotshwa1">[56]</xref> and the expression of pseudogenes or the formation of alternative isoforms may be the plants way of countering the viral strategy to suppress their defense system.</p><p>This analysis on the genome-wide distribution of R gene sequences within potato is the first effort to understand the mechanisms of the evolution among resistance genes in the Solanaceae family. It would be of great interest to compare the number, cluster positions, and evolution of closely related organisms. With the upcoming sequencing of the tomato we would be able to compare two organisms with high levels of synteny in their sequences and genome structure that have different life cycles and pathogens. This comparison could shed some light on the dynamics and recent evolution of NBS genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting
