We have previously identified a panel of <italic>V. vinifera</italic> accessions from Central Asia with partial resistance to PM that possess a <italic>Ren1</italic>-like local haplotype. In this study, we show that in addition to the typical <italic>Ren1</italic>-associated late post-penetration resistance, these accessions display a range of different levels of disease development suggesting that alternative alleles or additional genes contribute to determining the outcome of the interaction with the pathogen. To identify potential <italic>Ren1</italic>-dependent transcriptional responses and functions associated with the different levels of resistance, we sequenced and analyzed the transcriptomes of these Central Asian accessions at two time points of PM infection. Transcriptomes were compared to identify constitutive differences and PM-inducible responses that may underlie their disease resistant phenotype. Responses to <italic>E. necator</italic> in all resistant accessions were characterized by an early up-regulation of 13 genes, most encoding putative defense functions, and a late down-regulation of 32 genes, enriched in transcriptional regulators and protein kinases. Potential <italic>Ren1</italic>-dependent responses included a hotspot of co-regulated genes on chromosome 18. We also identified 81 genes whose expression levels and dynamics correlated with the phenotypic differences between the most resistant accessions &#x02018;Karadzhandahal&#x02019;, DVIT3351.27, and O34-16 and the other genotypes. This study provides a first exploration of the functions associated with varying levels of partial resistance to PM in <italic>V. vinifera</italic> accessions that can be exploited as sources of genetic resistance in grape breeding programs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ascomycete <italic>Erysiphe necator</italic> can parasitize any green tissue of a grapevine causing a disease known as grape powdery mildew (PM, henceforth). Decline in leaf photosynthetic capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> and reduction in berry quality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> are typical symptoms of the disease. All commercial <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> cultivars are susceptible to PM forcing grape growers to apply frequent and costly fungicide treatments throughout the growing season. In the European Union over 80 000 tons of fungicides are applied annually to control PM, which corresponds to about 67% of the total fungicides used for all crops, although only 3.3% of the agricultural land is dedicated to grape production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> In California as much as 20% of the costs associated with wine grape cultivation are related to PM control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> Excessive fungicide use is not only detrimental to the environment and human health but it also increases selection pressure on pathogen populations to adapt and acquire increasing levels of fungicide resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup></p><p><italic>Erysiphe necator</italic> is considered to have originated in North America and is currently found in all grape-growing regions in the Northern and Southern hemisphere. It was introduced to Europe during the second half of the XIX century spreading throughout the continental and Mediterranean regions on susceptible <italic>V. vinifera</italic> cultivars. The genetic resistance often displayed by American grape species, of either <italic>Muscadinia</italic> or <italic>Vitis</italic> genera,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6 bib7 bib8 bib9 bib10">6&#x02013;10</xref></sup> supports the hypothesis of their co-evolution with <italic>E. necator</italic> populations. In <italic>M. rotundifolia</italic> major PM-resistant loci were mapped on both chromosome 12 (<italic>Run1</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> and 18 (<italic>Run2.1</italic> and <italic>Run2.2</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> Despite the presumed American origin of the disease, resistance to PM has also been found in accessions of the Chinese grape species <italic>V. romanetii</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup><italic>V. piasezkii</italic> (M.

This germplasm provides a unique opportunity to profile transcriptional changes that are induced by PM infection and gain insights into the complex multilayer defense strategy that grapevines from Central Asia have evolved against <italic>E. necator</italic>. The wider genetic basis and different horticultural attributes of this germplasm make it unique for breeding efforts, especially to stack resistance genes with different mechanisms to obtain more durable field resistance.</p><p>The type of reactions activated when specific resistance genes are expressed have been traditionally described using histochemical approaches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> High-throughput methods that monitor genome-wide transcriptional changes can help further characterize at the molecular level the pathways regulated by defense-related genes. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling approaches have been effectively used to characterize disease resistance processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19 bib20 bib21 bib22 bib23 bib24">19&#x02013;24</xref></sup> In this study, we applied RNA sequencing approaches (RNAseq) to identify genes whose expression correlates with PM resistance in a panel of two wild and five cultivated Central Asian <italic>V. vinifera</italic> accessions. Through comparative analyses focused on differentially expressed genes shared across all the resistant genotypes but not the susceptible <italic>V. vinifera</italic> control, we identified functions that may contribute to the <italic>Ren1</italic>-dependent resistance mechanisms as well as gained insights into the molecular bases of the varying levels of resistance among these accessions. Grapevines were inoculated under controlled conditions with a highly virulent <italic>E. necator</italic> isolate and mock-inoculated controls were included. Disease susceptibility was assessed macro- and microscopically, and by quantitative PCR. Transcriptomes were sequenced at two time points after inoculation.

Analysis of the orthologous locus in &#x02018;PN40024&#x02019; showed that the region is inherently prone to structural rearrangements and that NB-LRR genes proliferated through a combination of duplications and intragenic recombination events between paralogous genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> Similar genetic instability was found in the <italic>Mla</italic> PM resistance locus in barley.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">68</xref></sup> It is, thus, reasonable to hypothesize that among the Central Asian accessions there exists genetic variation within the <italic>Ren1</italic>-locus, as sequence polymorphisms, copy number variants, and presence/absence polymorphisms, which may underlie the different levels of resistance observed.

As the physical map of the <italic>Ren1</italic> locus is resolved and reconstructed in all seven accessions, re-mapping of the RNAseq reads generated in this study will enable the profiling of candidate genes that may be responsible for the different levels of partial resistance observed. The identification of novel sources of genetic resistance among <italic>V. vinifera</italic> cultivars is particularly important from a breeding perspective. The introgression into elite cultivars from a <italic>V. vinifera</italic> background can reduce the rounds of backcrosses necessary to decrease the linkage drag, which could affect the distinctive characteristics of the cultivar that is the objective of genetic improvement. Stacking by marker-assisted selection of genes that confer partial resistance with single dominant resistance genes will help achieve more durable field resistance. Further genetic studies combined with comparative transcriptomic analyses with additional PM-resistant accessions from Asia (e.g., <italic>V. piasezkii</italic> and <italic>V. romanetii</italic>) and North America (e.g., <italic>M. rotundifolia</italic>) will define the different mechanisms underlying the resistance to PM available in the grape germplasm and guide breeding efforts to combine multiple resistance loci, while minimizing functional redundancies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by funding to Dario Cantu from the American Vineyard Foundation (Grant: 2013&#x02013;1510) and from the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences (UC Davis) and from the Louis P.
