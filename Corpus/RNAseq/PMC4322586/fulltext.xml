Here, we present a dataset containing multiple tiers of stringent siRNA screening for genes that when knocked down conferred sensitivity to vorinostat-induced cell death. We also present data from a miRNA overexpression screen for miRNAs contributing to vorinostat sensitivity. Furthermore, we provide transcriptomic analysis using massively parallel sequencing upon knockdown of 14 validated vorinostat-resistance genes. These datasets are suitable for analysis of genes and miRNAs involved in cell death in the presence and absence of vorinostat as well as computational biology approaches to identify gene regulatory networks.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Background &#x00026; Summary</title><p>Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are a novel class of anti-cancer agents that elicit a range of anti-tumour responses including apoptosis. Vorinostat is an FDA-approved broad-spectrum HDACi, which has achieved remarkable clinical success in some patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref></sup>, particularly those with Cutaneous T cell lymphoma and Peripheral T cell lymphoma, however it remains unclear why certain patients remain unresponsive. Constitutive STAT activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref></sup>, overexpression of pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref></sup> and loss of HR23B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref></sup> have been identified as potential biomarkers of HDACi resistance, however none have improved the clinical utility of HDACi. High-throughput RNAi screening has demonstrated utility for identification of novel drug targets for cancer therapy and biomarkers for drug response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7&#x02013;10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">7&#x02013;10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">7&#x02013;10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">7&#x02013;10</xref></sup>. In addition, screening for synthetic lethality has successfully identified targetable cancer-specific vulnerabilities alone and in combination with existing therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11&#x02013;15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">11&#x02013;15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">11&#x02013;15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">11&#x02013;15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">11&#x02013;15</xref></sup>. Therefore, the study described within aimed to further elucidate vorinostat resistance mechanisms through a functional genomics screen to identify genes that when knocked down by RNA interference (RNAi) sensitised cells to vorinostat-induced apoptosis. Specifically we aimed to identify vorinostat-resistance genes that had not previously been described as important in vorinostat response. These genes may serve as molecular biomarkers for stratification of patients for HDACi treatment or as potential novel drug targets for development of new therapies to be used in combination with vorinostat.</p><p>A synthetic lethal functional screen using a protein-coding genome-wide RNAi library was used to
identify genes that when knocked down co-operated with vorinostat to induce tumour cell apoptosis in otherwise resistant cells. Briefly, cells were reverse transfected on day 1, media changed on day 2, treated with vorinostat or vehicle (DMSO) on day 3 and assessed for cell death on day 4. The screen contained two arms: the &#x02018;minus-drug&#x02019; (DMSO control) arm to determine those genes that were lethal by gene knockdown alone and would therefore be excluded from the analysis and the &#x02018;plus-drug&#x02019; (vorinostat treatment) arm to identify those genes that when knocked down, co-operated with vorinostat to induce cell death. The two parallel arms of the screen evaluated cell death using different measurements. The plus-drug arm was evaluated for general viability using Cell Titre Fluor (CTF) and apoptosis using Caspase-Glo 3/7. Together these assays constitute the Apo-Live Glo multiplexed assay (Promega). The multiplex assay was necessary to be able to distinguish rapid cell death from slower activation of caspase activity within the window of the assay and meant that different stages of cell death could be identified in the same sample at a single time point. The minus-drug arm was subjected to nuclear staining by DAPI followed by high content cell counting as a surrogate readout of cell death, thereby reducing cost and facilitating detection of strong cell cycle effects. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref> shows there was a high correlation between CTF, cell counting and Caspase 3/7 activity.</p><p>The primary SMARTpool siRNA screen yielded 450 gene hits, of which 106 validated in a secondary deconvolution screen using the four individual constituent siRNAs of each SMARTpool. Tertiary screening was conducted to evaluate the specificity of these genes to co-operate with vorinostat compared to conventional chemotherapeutics in multiple cell lines. Comparative gene expression analysis was undertaken upon knockdown of 13 vorinostat-resistance candidates from the tertiary siRNA screen. In addition, a miRNA mimic (overexpression) screen was conducted to identify miRNA involved in vorinostat sensitivity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> is a graphical representation of the experimental design employed in this study. The RNAi datasets described within will be useful for analyses of protein-coding genes and miRNAs crucial to cell survival in steady state and in the context of HDACi treatment. The gene expression profiling datasets will be suitable for computational biology analysis as they represent transcriptional changes in a cell line subjected to different perturbations (i.e., gene knockdown).</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Four human colon cancer cell lines were used in this study: HCT116-VR, SW480, SW620, LIM1215.

Positive and negative controls were positioned in columns 2 and 23 (eight wells for each control) and media only in column 24 of each assay plate. The positive controls were technical (PLK1 for cell death; doubled as a positive control for CTF) and assay specific (JAK2 for Caspase-Glo 3/7). The negative control was mock transfection (lipid only). At the time the screen was conducted we could not identify a non-targeting control that exhibited no phenotype. All liquid dispensing steps were carried out with the EL406 Microplate Washer Dispenser (BioTek) except the transfection itself, which required the SciClone ALH3000 Lab Automation Liquid Handler (Caliper Lifesciences).

A summary of the steps involved in each assay is provided below. In brief, the Apo-Live Glo multiplexed assay used for the plus-drug arm first measures cell viability using the fluorescent Cell Titer Fluor reagent, then caspase activation <italic>via</italic> cell lysis and luminescent readout of Caspase 3/7 activity using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 reagent.</p><p><italic>Cell Titre Fluor</italic>: CTF is a viability assay, whereby a fluorescent signal is generated in live cells through live-cell protease cleavage of a fluorogenic peptide substrate. The fluorescent signal is proportional to the number of live cells with intact plasma membranes. CTF substrate and buffer were combined in the ratio of 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;l substrate to every 2.5&#x02009;ml buffer. 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;l reagent was added to each well of the A and B plates, plates were placed on a microtiter plate shaker (MPS1, Ratek) at half maximum speed for one minute and incubated at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in a humidified incubator for 1.5&#x02009;h.

The reagent lyses cells, allowing cleavage of the substrate into the mature form, which is a luciferase substrate. Cell lysis, substrate cleavage and the luciferase reaction occur to produce light, which is proportional to the amount of activated caspases in the sample. Caspase-Glo 3/7 lyophilised substrate and buffer were combined and 12&#x02009;&#x003bc;l dispensed to each well of the A and B plates. Plates were placed on a microtiter plate shaker (MPS1, Ratek) at half maximum speed for one minute and incubated for 30&#x02009;min at room temperature followed by luminescence detection (Synergy).</p><p><italic>Nuclear staining for cell counting</italic>: DAPI nuclear staining was used to label each cell on the C and D plates for cell counting. First, medium was aspirated leaving 15&#x02009;&#x003bc;l and cells were fixed by addition of 15&#x02009;&#x003bc;l 4% PFA (final concentration 2% PFA). Plates were incubated for 10&#x02009;min, before removal of PFA and rinsing with Tris. Cells were permeabilised and stained with DAPI in a single step by adding DAPI solution containing Triton-X-100 (final concentration: DAPI 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml, Triton-X-100 0.2% (v/v)). Cells were incubated for 15&#x02009;min before removal of stain and addition of 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;l PBS per well. Plates were imaged on the Cellomics ArrayScan (Thermo Scientific) high content imager. The Cellomics Cell Cycle proprietary algorithm was optimised for object segmentation and was instructed to count a maximum of 1,500 cells or 25 fields, whichever was reached sooner. These cut-offs were based on negative controls, which consistently counted &#x02265;1,500 cells in 7-8 fields.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Data analysis</title><p><italic>Quantitation of cell number</italic>: A binning strategy incorporating cell count and field number was defined to evaluate the health of each well (SA=single agent).

For Caspase-Glo 3/7 and CTF, all plus-drug plates were analysed as an entire screen. Average background fluorescence and luminescence was removed on a per plate basis, followed by normalisation to the mock negative control. Duplicates plates were averaged and robust <italic>z</italic>-score normalisation applied across the entire screen. Following removal of controls and the 191 genes whose knockdown alone was lethal, Caspase-Glo 3/7 and CTF data was plotted in smoothed histograms showing the overall shape of the data distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). With robust <italic>z</italic>-score plotted against relative abundance, it was clear that Caspase-Glo 3/7 data was strongly positively skewed with a long tail of high robust <italic>z</italic>-scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2a</xref>). The distribution of CTF was slightly negatively skewed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2b</xref>). The robust <italic>z</italic>-score cut-offs were chosen to reflect the nature of the experimental design with approximately two thirds Caspase-Glo 3/7 hits and one third CTF hits as the screen was primarily set up to detect induction of apoptosis, with the viability readout as an extra measure so as not to omit very fasting-acting hits. Robust <italic>z</italic>-score cut-offs of <italic>z</italic>&#x02265;5.13 for Caspase-Glo 3/7 and <italic>z</italic>&#x02264; &#x02212;2.19 for CTF were chosen (originating from both SA2 and SA3 DAPI designations), resulting in a gene list of 450 targets, comprising 150 CTF (reduced viability) hits and 317 Caspase-Glo 3/7 (caspase activation) hits, with an overlap between the two assays of 17 genes (Data record 1). The chosen discovery rate of 450 targets represents ~2.5% of the genome.

Targets were excluded from the outer 2 rows and columns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>Analysis</italic>: The primary screen hits were determined by a robust <italic>z</italic>-score cut-off, however a <italic>z</italic>-score is inappropriate for the analysis of duplexes by the inherent nature of them all being hits. We used fold change to mock to validate the duplexes. The cut off thresholds were initially set based on the fold change value associated with the primary screen bin robust <italic>z</italic>-score cut off resulting in a value of 2.58 for Caspase-Glo 3/7 and 0.56 for CTF. However, the dynamic range of the secondary screen was reduced compared to the primary screen in terms of both controls and samples (average 31% less Caspase-Glo 3/7 luminescence and 12% less CTF fluorescence). This may have been due to higher raw values for mock in the secondary screen compared to the primary screen for both Caspase-Glo 3/7 (average 11% more luminescence) and CTF (average 23% more fluorescence) and batch variation of the assay reagents. A gene was considered to be validated with high confidence if 3 or 4 of the 4 duplexes reproduced the SMARTpool phenotype (i.e., 3/4 and 4/4). Given the reduced dynamic range, we re-assessed our hit list and looked more closely at targets initially validating as 3/4 and 4/4 based on the primary screen fold change cut-offs. We then revised our cut-offs based on the mean and standard deviation of fold change to mock for these genes and determined new fold change cut-offs as the mean minus or plus one standard deviation for Caspase-Glo 3/7 and CTF respectively. As a result, the secondary screen fold change cut-offs were reduced to 2.2 for Caspase-Glo 3/7 and 0.6 for CTF.</p><p>Targets for which 2 of the 4 duplexes validated and the remaining 2 duplexes had no phenotype were considered moderate confidence hits and were investigated for the purposes of bioinformatics and pathway analysis. Upon manual observation and literature searching, 14 genes that validated as 2/4 were up-graded into the high confidence gene list, as they were members of gene families or pathways of interest, with a third duplex failing to meet validation cut-offs by only a narrow margin. These genes were: SAS10, NPCL1, M96, SEMA4F, RERE, CBX7, CCNK, MED28, POLR2J, CDK10, EIF2B2, EIF2S1, EIF3S6IP, HIST1H1B. In total, the final validated gene list consisted of 106 genes: 31 scored 4/4, 61 scored 3/4 and 14 scored 2/4 (Data record 2). 11 of these genes validated with high confidence in both assays. The two screening assays measured different stages of cell death so the majority of hits would be expected to be an exclusive hit in one assay or the other, however having high caspase activity (Caspase-Glo 3/7) is not mutually exclusive of a reduction in viability (CTF).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Tertiary siRNA screen with multiple cell lines and drugs</title><p><italic>Methodology</italic>: To triage the 106 high confidence genes further, a tertiary screen was performed in which a panel of colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT116-VR, SW480, SW620, LIM1215) were treated with vorinostat and the conventional chemotherapeutic, etoposide. The aim was to identify genes that when knocked down sensitised specifically to vorinostat and not etoposide in multiple cell lines to reduce the list of candidates to those that acted specifically in concert with HDAC inhibition. The tertiary screen followed the same basic experimental workflow as the primary screen for each of the 4 cell lines, transfected in parallel. The tertiary screen library of 106 target SMARTpools was arrayed twice side-by-side on the library plate, allowing each half assay plate to be treated with a different drug. The plus-drug plates received vorinostat on one half and etoposide on the other. The minus-drug plates received DMSO.</p><p><italic>Analysis</italic>: New fold change cut-offs were defined for the tertiary screen to reflect the challenges of screening in multiple cell lines with different responsiveness to the combined effect of gene knockdown and drug treatment. The thresholds from the primary and secondary screens were lowered in accordance to reduced dynamic range of the tertiary screen while still maintaining selectivity for enhanced cell death. A fold change to mock of 0.75 or less was defined as the CTF cut-off and 1.6 or greater as the Caspase-Glo 3/7 cut-off. Each of the four cell lines was assessed in terms of CTF and Caspase-Glo 3/7 for vorinostat and etoposide treatment. For each assay (CTF and Caspase-Glo 3/7) the number of cell lines exceeding the defined threshold upon vorinostat treatment and etoposide treatment were counted. To be considered a validated, vorinostat-specific target, a gene must have scored as a hit in at least 2 more cell lines for vorinostat than etoposide. Of the 106 genes tested, 16 genes exhibited selectivity to vorinostat in multiple cell lines according to the criteria above (Data record 3). 15 of these genes were hits from the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay and a single gene was a hit from the CTF assay.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>miRNA overexpression (mimic) screen</title><p>The Dharmacon miRIDIAN miRNA mimic library version 13 contained 879 synthetic miRNAs (miRNA mimics) arrayed in 384 well format. The experimental workflow was the same as for the primary siRNA screen. Using the same statistical analyses and thresholds determined in the primary siRNA screen, a list of 24 miRNA hits was generated (Data record 4). In summary, there were 10 Caspase-Glo 3/7 hits and 14 CTF hits and no overlap between the two assays.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Transcriptome analysis using next generation sequencing</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Preparation of RNA for NGS</title><p>Transcriptome analysis was conducted on HCT116-VR cells subjected to gene knockdown using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology. 13 of the 16 genes from the tertiary screen were evaluated, as well as the screening control, <italic>JAK2</italic>. RNAseq was conducted on libraries generated from three independent biological experiments. HCT116-VR cells (2&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> cells per well) were reverse transfected in 12 well plates and harvested after 48&#x02009;h for RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) as per manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. RNA concentration and purity was assessed by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop) and RNA integrity was assessed using the Agilent RNA Nano chip on the Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer. Samples with a concentration of at least 170&#x02009;ng/&#x003bc;l, a 260/280 ratio between 2.0&#x02013;2.3 and RNA integrity number (RIN) of at least 7.0 were accepted for library preparation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Preparation of samples for the Illumina HighSeq 2000</title><p>RNA was prepared for sequencing on the Illumina HighSeq 2000 using the proprietary <italic>TruSeq</italic>TM <italic>RNA Sample Preparation v2 Guide</italic> with all kit reagents purchased from Illumina. This method was chosen as it is very robust and involves poly-A selection for enrichment of mRNA. In brief, poly-A containing mRNA was purified from 2&#x02009;&#x003bc;g total RNA using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads in two rounds of purification. This was followed by RNA fragmentation and first strand cDNA synthesis with reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers. The RNA template was removed and a replacement strand synthesised to generate double-stranded (ds) cDNA. After purifying the ds cDNA from the reaction mix with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter), the Illumina <italic>End Repair</italic> strategy removed overhangs and prepared the ds cDNA for adapter ligation in a way that prevented concatenation of fragments. Indexing adapters were ligated to the ends of the ds cDNA, which enabled hybridisation to the flow cell and multiplexing of samples within the flow cell. Next, the ds cDNA libraries were PCR amplified to enrich for fragments with adapters on both ends and to amplify the amount of DNA in the libraries. DNA concentration was assessed using the Qubit (Invitrogen) and average fragment size and purity was determined using the Agilent DNA-1000 chip on the Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer. Samples of concentration 25&#x02013;40&#x02009;ng/&#x003bc;l and 290&#x02013;340&#x02009;bp in size were accepted for sequencing. Final determination of concentration was achieved by qPCR according to the Illumina <italic>Sequencing Library qPCR Quantification Guide</italic>.

Caspase-Glo 3/7 controls showed variable Z&#x02032; factors across the screen. Therefore, to determine if the Caspase-Glo 3/7 controls were reporting as expected, the Z&#x02032; factor in combination with fold change to mock were assessed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>).

Poor Z&#x02032; factors in the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay were also due to the high sensitivity of the assay (compared to CTF) and therefore larger variability within control wells.
