However, cancer cell growth during the initial stages has not been fully explored using a genome-wide approach. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the transcriptome of breast cancer cells during the initial stages of tumoral growth using RNAseq in a model of Multicellular Tumor Spheroids (MTS). Network analyses showed that a metastatic signature was enriched as several adhesion molecules were deregulated, including EPCAM, E-cadherin, integrins and syndecans, which were further supported by an increase in cell migration. Interestingly, we also found that the cancer cells at this stage of growth exhibited a paradoxical hyperactivation of oxidative mitochondrial metabolism. In addition, we found a large number of regulated (long non coding RNA) lncRNAs, several of which were co-regulated with neighboring genes. The regulatory role of some of these lncRNAs on mRNA expression was demonstrated with gain of function assays. This is the first report of an early-stage MTS transcriptome, which not only reveals a complex expression landscape, but points toward an important contribution of long non-coding RNAs in the final phenotype of three-dimensional cellular models.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Multicellular tumor spheroids (MTS) are a type of cell culture that recreates the microenvironmental, molecular, functional and histomorphological characteristics of <italic>in vivo</italic> tumors. MTS acquire differentiated cell-cell junctions and a defined microenvironment. Later, the MTS grow to diameters between 200 and 500&#x02009;&#x003bc;M, form defined gradients of nutrients and oxygen, and establish a central apoptotic/necrotic area as they reach sizes larger than 500&#x02009;&#x003bc;M<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The initial growth phase of the MTS is reminiscent of the small avascular growth during the initial growth of primary tumor and metastasized cells. The cell-cell interactions and microenvironment of these structures results in multicellular resistance, a well-defined phenotypic change that is also present in tumors <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, and causes enhanced invasion and migration, as well as an increased clonogenic capacity. Although earlier studies have reported that phenotypic changes in MTS are associated with modulation of cellular transcription, relatively few studies have been conducted that analyze gene expression in MTS. Francia <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> performed differential display to find genes regulated in MTS and identified a network of expression that suppressed DNA mismatch repair and was responsible for multicellular resistance to alkylating agents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Similarly, Zhou <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> used dynamic array device integrating microfluidic circuits to analyze gene expression in MTS and found changes in cellular senescence and glucose metabolism genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Nevertheless, there are no genome-wide analyses to date characterizing early stage MTS.</p><p>MTS model is frequently used to analyze the effectiveness of anticancer drugs because for many chemotherapeutic drugs this model provides a well-established solid tissue environment that is associated with multicellular resistance, which is a better reflection of <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p><p>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) belong to a group of molecules without protein coding potential that range widely in size, from 200 to 10000 nucleotides. Similar to messenger RNAs, lncRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, 5&#x02032; capped, spliced and polyadenylated at the 3&#x02032; end<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. LncRNAs play a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression at several cellular levels, including the organization of nuclear sub-structures, the modulation of chromatin states, transcription and post-transcriptional processing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. In addition, lncRNAs can function as co-factors of proteins, messenger RNA stabilizers, miRNAs regulators, or translation modulators<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. The prevalence of lncRNAs is a subject of current debate, with large differences found depending in the technique used to identify them, and the particular definition used for their characterization. For example, Kaessmann H, <italic>et al.</italic> in 2014 identified all the lncRNAs of 11 tetrapod species and found 11000 lncRNAs in primates (almost 15000 in human) with 2500 of them highly conserved<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Given the recent identification of most lncRNAs, and their sheer number, their specific molecular functions remain unknown. Nevertheless, the importance of lncRNAs can be inferred due to their tissue-specific expression and specific regulation in diverse cellular processes, in both physiological and pathological conditions, such as genomic imprinting<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, pluripotency maintenance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, neurodegenerative disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, cardiovascular diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> and cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p><p>To gain more insight into the involvement of lncRNAs and mRNA in the cancer-associated phenotype at the early stages of tumoral and metastatic growth, we used small MTS with a size of &#x0003c;200 microns, which exhibit the classical multicellular resistance phenotype, to perform whole-genome transcriptome analyses.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Characterization of MTS</title><p>We were interested in analyzing the MTS that most closely mimic <italic>in vivo</italic> avascular tumors, because these MTS more accurately reflect the initial steps of cancer and micro-metastasis. For this, we initially characterized MTS cultivated during a eight-day course. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>, MTS cultured for six days exhibited diameters of &#x000b1;200&#x02009;&#x003bc;M, with only a small percentage of condensate (apoptotic) nuclei, similar to day 2 and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>, panel a&#x02013;c). This is consistent with previous reports that showed that hypoxic conditions generally start in the central areas of MTS when approaching 200&#x02013;250 microns in diameter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. In some MTS, this stratification was evident at 8 days, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>, panel d. To further characterize the functional dynamics of the MTS, we quantified cell proliferation using Ki67 immunocytochemistry. Ki67 is a nuclear protein that is present during all active phases of the cell cycle (G1, S, G2 and mitosis) but is absent from resting cells (G0). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>, panel b, shows that approximately 40% of the cells were positive for this nuclear protein. In addition, we found that approximately 60% of cells were positive for the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (p27Kip1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref> panel c), an enzyme inhibitor that regulates G0-to-S-phase transition.</p><p>As expected, at day 6 we could not identify expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1&#x003b1;), the main transcription factor that regulates hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>, panel d). In conclusion, we found that, at six days, MTS were already well-consolidated, in contrast to the previous days, during which the MTS were just cell aggregates that dislodge easily. At this early timepoint there is no stratification, no hypoxic areas, and more importantly, no evidence of cell death at the center of the MTS, in contrast to later timepoints. For these reasons, we selected the six-day timepoint for all our experiments.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Migration ability of cells grown as MTS</title><p>Since active migration of tumor cells is a prerequisite for metastasis, we evaluated this ability in cells derived from MTS using the xCELLigence technique.

For example, we detected a robust decrease in Claudin 1 (CLDN1), Plexin 2 (PLXDC2), Integrin beta 6 (ITGB6), Integrin alpha 2 (ITGA2) and an increase in E-cadherin (CDH1), Integrin beta 5 (ITGB5), Claudin 4 (CLDN4), EPCAM and transmembrane proteoglycans such as syndecans (SDC1 and SDC4) in MTS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p><p>To gain a global perspective on the main cellular processes modulated, we analyzed our data using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. Using this tool, we found several dysregulated networks, with the top five dysregulated networks being Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Oxidative Phosphorylation, EIF2 Signaling, Regulation of elF4 and p70S6K and mTOR Signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2</xref>). Additionally, we identified some interesting pathways associated with the cell cycle, such as estrogen-mediated S-phase entry, HER-2 signaling in breast cancer, cell cycle G1/S checkpoint regulation, cell cycle regulation by BTG family protein, PI3K/AKT and PTEN signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E</xref>). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S5</xref> shows the up and down regulated molecules associated with cell cycle pathways, and an image of the canonical pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref>).

In addition, we identified several upregulated genes involved in glycolysis (ENO1, FBP1, G6PD, GAPDH, ODC1, PDHB, PGD, PGK1, SDHB, TALDO1, TKT, TPI1, PFKL and ALDOA) as well as AKT1 and MYC, which have been reported as glucose metabolism regulators<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref> right panel).</p><p>This suggests that a mitochondrial/oxidative phosphorylation gene expression cassette is over-activated in the early stages of MTS.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>MCF-7 early-stage MTS exhibit a hyperactivation of oxidative mitochondrial metabolism</title><p>To corroborate the changes we found in the oxidative phosphorylation system (OxPhos), we measured the rate of oxygen consumption and the OxPhos flux. Cells from early-stage MCF-7 MTS exhibited a two-fold increase in basal respiration with respect to monolayer cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). When OxPhos flux was unveiled by adding oligomycin (a specific F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>-ATP synthase inhibitor), we observed that MCF-7 MTS had a 2-fold increase in ATP synthesis-coupled respiration with respect to monolayer cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). In addition, adding the protonophore CCCP to the reaction chamber induced maximal uncoupled respiratory activity. This molecule dissipates the mitochondrial electrochemical protongradient (&#x02206;&#x003bc;<sub>H</sub><sup>+</sup>) and stimulates respiration to its maximum value. Once again, MTS exhibited a higher increase of oxygen consumption than monolayer cells, 17.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.6&#x02009;vs. 7.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.1&#x02009;ngAO&#x000b7;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;(1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> cells)<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). A good parameter to estimate mitochondrial coupling is the ratio between the uncoupled respiration and basal respiration (U/B.R.). U/B.R. respiration values for MCF-7 MTS and monolayer cells were ~1.7 and ~1.3, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). All of these results suggest that the mitochondria of MTS have higher OxPhos activity, i.e., a higher ATP synthesis coupled to higher respiratory chain activity (hyperactivation of oxidative mitochondrial metabolism).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Changes in the cell cycle</title><p>We also found enrichment of different pathways that affect the cell cycle. To validate this, we analyzed the cell cycle using flow cytometry and found that MTS had a substantial decrease in the number of cells found in the synthesis (S) and the Gap2 (G2) phases, with a concomitant increase in the number of cells in the Gap1 (G1) phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>). The candidate molecules that could be regulating this phenotype in our experimental model were Tp53 Change to TP53, cMYC, p27KIP1 (CDKN1B), MAX/cMyc and CDK4, which were also involved in cell cycle G1/S checkpoint regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3A</xref>) and in estrogen-mediated S-phase entry pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S3B</xref>).

Eight-hundred and sixty-six lncRNAs (58%) were regulated positively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B,F</xref>), of which 390 were synthesized <italic>de</italic> novo in the MTS, as assessed with our methodology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Six-hundred and thirty-six lncRNAs (42%) were regulated negatively, of which 398 ceased to be expressed completely during the 6 days of MTS culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5F,B</xref>). We found a higher percentage of coding transcripts that were upregulated 82% (versus 58%) and downregulated 18% (versus 42%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5F</xref>).</p><p>In addition to this regulation, lncRNAs exhibited greater expression fold changes (up to 50-fold), in contrast to mRNAs (up to 5 fold), and nearly half of these lncRNAs were regulated in a binary manner (switched off completely or expressed <italic>de novo</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5E</xref>).</p><p>Sixty-percent of the regulated lncRNAs (906) had a length of less than 1000&#x02009;nt, 27% (403) were between 1000 to 2499&#x02009;nt, and only 12% (172) were larger than 2500&#x02009;nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Notably, no differences were found in the strand transcribed for the regulated lncRNAs, 767 lncRNAs originated from the positive strand versus 735 from the negative strand, which was similar to all the lncRNAs (58271 positive strand and 53339 negative strand). The Chi-square test was equal to 0.0011 degrees of freedom and a p-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.98172. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5D</xref>, we present the top 10 positive and negative regulated lncRNAs in the MTS. lnc-TCL1B-1:1 was the most up regulated molecule, with a fold change of 59, whereas the most down regulated lncRNA was lnc-FCGR1B-1:1 with a fold change of &#x02212;15.</p><p>With these data, we then sought to determine whether there were differences in the chromosomal localization of the regulated lncRNAs and mRNAs. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>, we show the distribution of dysregulated transcripts. No correlation was found between the number of mRNAs dysregulated and the length of each chromosome (R&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.55), but, as expected, we found a good correlation between the numbers of regulated mRNAs versus the number of all described mRNAs present per chromosome (density) (R&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.95) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>). Similarly, for lncRNAs, we also did not find a correlation between the number of regulated lncRNAs MTS along each chromosome (R&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.69) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>), or their density per chromosome (R&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.67) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>). In addition, we did not find a correlation between the number of regulated mRNAs and lncRNAs. Although both groups of RNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, and the number of coding RNAs is very similar to the number of lncRNAs in each chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>), we found that the number of lncRNAs and mRNAs regulated per chromosome were rather different in MTS, indicating a different regulation process for each group of transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>).</p><p>Although lncRNAs are able to regulate genes located thousands of base pairs away, most of them carry out their function in nearby genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. For this reason, we localized the nearest coding genes to the regulated lncRNAs and looked for co-regulation. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S6</xref> shows the fold change and localization of 63 co-regulated lncRNAs and mRNAs in MTS cultivated for six days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7A</xref>). We found 35 positively dysregulated lncRNA whose nearby genes were also increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7B</xref>). One of the most interesting was PMP22, which has been associated with breast cancer metastasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. We found two lncRNAs with a concordant lower expression of their mRNA neighbors, CHD2 and LRBA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7B</xref>). We also found 20 lncRNAs with an inverse expression pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7C</xref>).

Many of the phenotypic characteristics of cells grown in MTS are a consequence of gradients of nutrients and oxygen, which produces zonal heterogeneity and, in mature MTS, several cellular layers, an outer layer with proliferative cells, an intermediate layer containing quiescent cells and a central necrotic/apoptotic area. Nevertheless, avascular primary tumors and micro-metastasis are more accurately modeled by early stage MTS, in which the poor-hostile microenvironment of oxygen and nutrients are not properly established and most of the phenotype is derived by the presence of 3D cellular and extracellular matrix interactions.</p><p>To gain greater insight into the molecular mechanisms that are regulated during these early stages, we studied MTS with a diameter of approximately 200&#x02009;microns in which there is no HIF1&#x003b1; expression, indicating the absence of hypoxia. To further validate our model, we analyzed the expression of p27Kip1, a protein that blocks the cell cycle at the G1/S phase checkpoint and is highly expressed in cells arrested at the G0 and G1 phases.p27Kip1 expression was limited to sparse cells, without forming a clear middle layer in the MTS, as would be expected in a hypoxic layer that is rich in quiescent cells of mature MTS . In our model, increased p27Kip1 expression in sparse cells could be induced by cell&#x02013;cell contact<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. In addition to this, we measured Ki67, a nuclear protein that is present during all active phases of the cell cycle (G1, S, G2 and mitosis), but absent from resting cells (G0). As expected, Ki67 positive cells were mainly located in the external layer.</p><p>We then sought to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that could be regulated during this stage, and correlate this to the putative avascular tumor phenotype. Using massive RNA sequencing analysis we found 1122 dysregulated messenger RNAs in MTS of 6 days. As expected, among the top 20 regulated genes, all them were associated with cancer and eleven of them have been associated with breast cancer metastasis (i.e., NAALADL2, PMP22, CLDN4 and PGR) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S3</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p><p>These results strongly support the relevance of our model. Because we predicted that the main drivers for the phenotype would be related to cell-cell interactions, instead of hypoxic and/or cell cycle alterations, we focused on the regulation of membrane proteins. Indeed, we found that claudins, plexin 2, several integrins, syndecans, EPCAM and E &#x02013;cadherin were regulated in the MTS. E-cadherin the major cadherin implicated in epithelial cell-cell adhesion, is associated with invasion and, more interestingly, it is commonly re-expressed by metastatic cancer cells to recover the adhesion complexes that are temporarily lost during the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), which is required for effective dissemination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Additionally, claudins are the major component of the tight junctions and are very important for the growth of metastatic cancer cells. For example, Abd-Elazeem M.A. and Abd-Elazeem M.A.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> reported high levels of claudin 4 expression in 66.1% of triple-negative breast cancer, particularly in invasive carcinoma, which correlated with the expression of Ki67.

Syndecans are members of the syndecan-proteoglycan family involved in cell binding and signaling and cytoskeletal organization.

The changes in adhesion molecules could be playing a central role in the early stages of avascular tumors and micro-metastasis, as in our model.observed that the disaggregated spheroid cells showed a pattern of migration.</p><p>Previous research has extensively shown that cancer cells produce energy predominantly through a high rate of glycolysis, followed by cytosolic lactic acid production, as opposed to oxidation of pyruvate in mitochondria, a phenomenon termed the Warburg Effect<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Interestingly, we found a paradoxical respiratory increase in our model. Two pathways were associated with overactive oxidative phosphorylation respiration in mitochondria and mitochondrial dysfunction that included 55 mitochondrial genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S4</xref>). We corroborated this result by measuring mitochondrial respiration and found that it increased two-fold in MTS. This hyperactivation of oxidative mitochondrial metabolism has been described in microenvironment-regulated tumor metabolism, where tumor stroma and adjacent host tissues are catabolic, and as a consequence, cancer cells are anabolic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. In this model, energy is transferred from the catabolic compartment to the anabolic compartment via sharing of nutrients (onco-metabolites) that promote tumor growth. The two-compartment tumor metabolism model has been demonstrated in fibroblasts and breast cancer cells, and more recently between adipocytes and ovarian cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>.This effect can be phenocopied by incubating cancer cells alone with L-lactate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.</p><p>This is the first report that fully analyzed the transcriptome of early (6 days) MTS stages. Among the results, we found that 55 dysregulated genes were associated with mitochondria. Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Enr&#x000ed;quez S <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008 reported that in intermediate-stage MTS (11 day) the ATP supply was provided by both energy pathways (OxPhos and glycolysis) and, at this stage, the OxPhos flux was similar to that observed in cells cultured as monolayers and it decreased in older spheroids (15 days) in which the glycolysis increased significantly, reproducing the Warburg effect<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. The present results, showing an increase of oxidative phosphorylation at very early stages and deregulation of several metastatic genes and increased cellular migration suggest that both processes are linked. The use of early stage spheroids would be a good model for initial metastatic seeding.</p><p>Energy production is strongly associated with tumor cell processes such as apoptosis, metastasis and chemo resistance. The activation of OxPhos complexes provides an opportunity to use specific drugs directed toward these complexes for an antineoplastic effect. For example, metformin behaves as a weak mitochondrial poison because of its Complex I inhibitor activity, and metformin has been evaluated as an anti-cancer agent in preclinical animal models. Similarly, both malonate, which inhibits Complex II and azide, which is an inhibitor of Complex IV could be further developed for clinical testing. In the present report we also found a deregulation of genes associated with glycolysis, although to a lesser extent to OxPhos genes. It will be of great interest to analyze the relative participation of each process in the full energy metabolism of early-stage MTS, since this could have clinical implications.</p><p>Because the small size of the MTS precludes the presence of hypoxia, we hypothesize that these changes are mainly based on changes in the number and types of cell-cell interactions and the microenvironment. This latter change would be the result of the presence of new metabolites and/or pH changes that are being generated. Further experiments are needed to test the relative contribution of each phenomenon.</p><p>We also sought to investigate whether the three-dimensional structure could be affecting the expression of lncRNAs. Our analyses found a similar number of dysregulated lncRNAs and mRNAs. Many of these were synthetized <italic>de novo</italic> or downregulated to non-detectable levels. This binary behavior contrasted with mRNA expression patterns in which a wide range of expression changes was found. In addition, lncRNAs are less abundant than coding RNAs. Arjun Raj <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015, when analyzing the distribution of single cell counts, demonstrated the relatively low overall expression of lncRNAs, with 43% of lncRNA-cell pairs having 10 or fewer molecules per cell on average and with a median of 14 molecules across all gene-cell-pair distribution medians (vs 36 for the 49 mRNA-cell pairs we examined)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. This finding could account for the binary behavior of lncRNAs.</p><p>Previous research has shown that although lncRNAs are able to regulate genes located thousands of base pairs away, most of them carry out their function in nearby genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. For this reason, we located the nearest coding genes to the regulated lncRNAs and looked for co-regulation. We found 63 co-regulated lncRNAs and mRNAs. Of these, 35 were positively co-regulated, and one is particularly of interest. PMP22 is a messenger RNA that has been associated with breast cancer and metastasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Twenty lncRNAs had a change in the opposite direction with regards to a neighboring gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7C</xref>), and six lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8A</xref>) were co-regulated with two or three neighbor genes. Among these, lnc-GAPDH was co-regulated with three neighbor genes (GAPDH, MRPL51 and NOP2). GAPDH is an enzyme that, in addition to catalyzing the sixth step of glycolysis in the cytoplasm, has been shown to be involved in many cellular processes, including DNA repair, tRNA export, membrane fusion and transport, cytoskeletal dynamics and cell death. Interestingly, GAPDH has been found in particulate fractions of mitochondria with low levels that are rapidly increased under stressed conditions, such as serum deprivation and exposure to DNA-damaging agents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Mitochondrial GAPDH interacts with voltage-dependent anion channel 1 and regulates mitochondrial membrane potential and cell survival<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Previous research has demonstrated that rotenone, a common mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, induces GAPDH enrichment in particulate fractions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Further work is needed to assess whether lnc-GAPDH, which was one of the most dysregulated lncRNAs, could be concomitantly regulating the expression of all or at least some of its neighbor dysregulated genes.</p><p>Of particular interest, due to finding hyperactivation of OxPhos, is the coregulation of several lncRNAs and neighboring genes that are associated with mitochondrial function, including Gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase (GGCT)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome SBDS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, Parkinson protein 7, PARK7<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, progesterone receptor PGR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, Cytochrome b type B (CYB5B)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, ribosomal protein S14<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, ADP-ribosylation factor/ARF-like protein 4 (ARF4/ARL4)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> and Solute Carrier Family 12 (Sodium/Potassium/Chloride Transporter), Member 2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Finally, it is worth mentioning that we identified three co-regulated lnc-messenger RNA histone clusters on chromosomes 1, 6 and 12. These lncRNAs could be operating as enhancer-lncRNAs. Further molecular work is needed to evaluate this idea.</p><p>Finally the analysis of the interaction between the two networks mRNA and lncRNA we found that 14 lncRNAs which their molecular targets are known, 5 of them converge in MYC network and 6 converge in p53 network.</p><p>In summary, in this study we describe the coding and non-coding transcriptome of early breast cancer MTS three main groups of genes were dysregulated in this experimental model. The first set involved membrane proteins implicated in cell-cell junctions, such as claudins, plexin2, integrins, syndecans, EPCAM and E-cadherin. In addition to a migration pattern in cells spheroids. The second set involved metastasis genes, and the third set consisted of genes belonging to mitochondrial complexes. The regulation of these genes was associated with hyperactivation of OxPhos, which was confirmed in functional assays. In addition to coding RNAs, we found a clear deregulation of several lncRNAs, mostly in a binary mode. Several lncRNAs were co-regulated with neighboring genes, pointing toward new avenues for research. In particular histone coding and non-coding RNAs on three chromosomes were co-regulated, which is of interest to explore further.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell line culture</title><p>Breast cancer cells (MCF-7) obtained from the American Type Culture Collection # HTB-22 (ATCC, Manassa, VA, USA) were cultured in EMEM (Eagle&#x02019;s Minimum Essential Medium) containing 2&#x02009;mM L-glutamine and 1&#x02009;mM sodium pyruvate (ATCC #30-2003), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (ATCC #30-2020), 100&#x02009;I.U./ml penicillin and 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin (ATCC #30-2300), at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Generation of MTS</title><p>MT formation of the MCF-7 cell line was performed using the liquid overlay technique with some modifications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>.

Their sequences were synthetized as gBlocks (Integrated DNA technologies, IA, USA), designed to share 15&#x02009;bp of homology at their ends with the vector digested with the restriction enzyme EcoRI (New England Biolabs, MA, USA. R101S). Ligation of the vector-gblocks was carried out using the In-Fusion HD Cloning Plus CE kit (Clontech, CA, USA. 638916). The plasmids were transfected into MCF-7 cells using the Transfection reagent X-Fect kit (Clontech, CA, USA. 631317) according to manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations. Briefly, one day prior to transfection MCF7 cells were seeded at approximately 70% confluence in 6-well plates. Cells were transfected with 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;g of each vector and 1.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of the X-Fect Transfection Reagent. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the RNA was extracted to evaluate the levels of each transcript.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Pacheco-Mar&#x000ed;n, R. <italic>et al.</italic> Transcriptome profile of the early stages of breast cancer tumoral spheroids. <italic>Sci.
