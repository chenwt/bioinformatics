To clarify the mechanism behind mutually exclusive gene expression, we characterized the genetic properties of the surface antigen multigene family in the ciliate <italic>Paramecium tetraurelia</italic> and the epigenetic factors controlling expression and silencing. Genome analysis indicated that the multigene family consists of intrachromosomal and subtelomeric genes; both classes apparently derive from different gene duplication events: whole-genome and intrachromosomal duplication. Expression analysis provides evidence for telomere position effects, because only subtelomeric genes follow mutually exclusive transcription. Microarray analysis of cultures deficient in Rdr3, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, in comparison to serotype-pure wild-type cultures, shows cotranscription of a subset of subtelomeric genes, indicating that the telomere position effect is due to a selective occurrence of Rdr3-mediated silencing in subtelomeric regions. We present a model of surface antigen evolution by intrachromosomal gene duplication involving the maintenance of positive selection of structurally relevant regions. Further analysis of chromosome heterogeneity shows that alternative telomere addition regions clearly affect transcription of closely related genes. Consequently, chromosome fragmentation appears to be of crucial importance for surface antigen expression and evolution. Our data suggest that RNAi-mediated control of this genetic network by <italic>trans</italic>-acting RNAs allows rapid epigenetic adaptation by phenotypic variation in combination with long-term genetic adaptation by Darwinian evolution of antigen genes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>IMPORTANCE</title><p>Alternating surface protein structures have been described for almost all eukaryotic microbes, and a broad variety of functions have been described, such as virulence factors, adhesion molecules, and molecular camouflage. Mechanisms controlling gene expression of variable surface proteins therefore represent a powerful tool for rapid phenotypic variation across kingdoms in pathogenic as well as free-living eukaryotic microbes. However, the epigenetic mechanisms controlling synchronous expression and silencing of individual genes are hardly understood. Using the ciliate <italic>Paramecium tetraurelia</italic> as a (epi)genetic model, we showed that a subtelomeric gene position effect is associated with the selective occurrence of RNAi-mediated silencing of silent surface protein genes, suggesting small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated epigenetic cross talks between silent and active surface antigen genes.

This phenomenon has been observed in a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms, where it enables them to escape attack by the hosts&#x02019; immune system. The free-living microbe <italic>Paramecium tetraurelia</italic> can also switch surface proteins. Early studies revealed the presence of different serotypes using antibodies raised by injection of paramecia into rabbits (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The literature usually refers to the responsible proteins as surface antigens (SAgs), by analogy to the systems in related parasitic ciliates (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), although a more precise term would be phenotypic variation. Several studies indicate that the phenotypic variation of SAgs may protect paramecia from predators, either by masking mechanisms or by jettisoning antigens during attacks (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). It is not clear whether variation has other roles, as it can also be triggered by changing environmental factors, such as temperature or salinity, or changing biotic factors, such as availability of food or addition of homologous antibodies (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Such phenotypic variation has been reported for many free-living fungi and protists as well as most pathogens, and common mechanisms seem to be involved for distantly related species (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). This makes it attractive to use nonpathogenic model organisms such as <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Paramecium tetraurelia</italic> to study the genome organization and epigenetic mechanisms controlling antigenic variation (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>A variety of mechanisms have been implicated in antigenic variation in different species. A well-studied example involving DNA rearrangements is <italic>Tryposonosma brucei</italic>, where gene conversion events copy entire genes or fragments of genes into active expression sites; segmental gene conversions also create new chimeric genes, thus increasing antigenic variability (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, even in <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic>, <italic>in situ</italic> switches can occur with epigenetic chromatin modifications instead of DNA sequence alterations (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In many organisms, <italic>in situ</italic> switches seem to be the rule, e.g., the highly variable erythrocyte membrane protein 1 of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (PfEMP1) and the variant surface proteins (VSPs) of <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic>. Interestingly, the silencing of nonexpressed surface antigens occurs at different levels, as <italic>P.&#x000a0;falciparum</italic> regulates PfEMP1 at the level of transcription, whereas <italic>G.&#x000a0;lamblia</italic> transcribes all VSP genes and then posttranscriptionally cleaves mRNA of the nonexpressed genes using the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>In many species (e.g., free-living and parasitic fungi as well as <italic>P.&#x000a0;falciparum</italic> and <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic>), surface antigen genes have a subtelomeric location. It has been suggested that spreading of telomeric heterochromatin into subtelomeric regions might result in the transcriptional silencing of surface antigen genes (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In <italic>P.&#x000a0;falciparum</italic>, chromatin remodeling is involved in antigenic variation of the <italic>var</italic> gene family, as silent loci show high levels of H3K9 trimethylation, whereas active loci are characterized by H3 acetylation (reviewed in reference <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In some organisms, such as <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> and <italic>P.&#x000a0;falciparum</italic>, activation and silencing of the genes in association with epigenetic chromatin modifications were shown to involve transport of the genes into distinct subnuclear compartments, which allow active transcription (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In contrast, the posttranscriptionally controlled <italic>Giardia</italic> antigen genes do not show preferred subtelomeric localization. An involvement of transcription-regulating small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) comparable to the posttranscriptional <italic>Giardia</italic> system has not been shown for any organism exhibiting a telomere position effect of its antigen genes.</p><p>The serotype of <italic>Paramecium tetraurelia</italic> is due to the expression of a single surface antigen gene (<italic>SAg</italic>), and serotypes are inherited in a non-Mendelian manner, meaning that the gene expression pattern becomes transmitted to progeny by unknown epigenetic mechanisms (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Serotype switches can occur at any time without the need for sexual recombination. Individual serotype proteins show highly variable sequence areas in their central regions, indicating that diversity plays a major role in protein function. Comparison of the genes indicated that all these surface antigen proteins have an extraordinarily high percentage of cysteine which is distributed throughout the polypeptide with a highly specific periodicity (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) which is similar to the VSG in <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Both organisms were also reported to use GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) anchors to tether the surface antigen to the outer leaflet of the external membrane (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). <italic>Paramecium</italic> surface antigens share some similarity in their N- and C-terminal regions but have highly variable regions in the center (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Analysis of the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS ratio) showed a low proportion of nonsynonymous base changes in the terminal regions of the genes, indicating the action of purifying selection to conserve the amino acid sequence, whereas the central areas show high ratios of nonsynonymous substitutions (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Interestingly, these central regions often consist of internal tandem repeats. This suggested that the central region was responsible for the diversity of the surface proteins, which would be selected for during evolution, whereas the conserved terminal regions might have roles in maintaining tertiary structure and membrane anchoring. Immunological analyses support this hypothesis, indicating that the variable central parts are exposed to the medium, whereas the N- and C-terminal areas are immunologically hidden close to the membrane (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrated that <italic>Paramecium</italic> serotypes are controlled by RNA interference (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Knockdown of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Rdr3) resulted in a stable coexpression of all tested surface antigens rather than the exclusive expression of one surface antigen, as usually occurs during antigenic variation. This was accompanied by the disappearance of endogenous siRNAs. In contrast to the report of RNAi-controlled VSP regulation in <italic>Giardia</italic>, small RNAs seem to regulate <italic>Paramecium</italic> serotypes at a transcriptional level rather than through mRNA stability.</p><p>In this study, we used bioinformatics methods to characterize the genetic properties of the <italic>SAg</italic> multigene family. Surprisingly, most of the genes in this family are not ohnologous genes, and moreover, several of them show gene duplicates located on the same macronuclear chromosome. Because of three successive whole-genome duplications, <italic>Paramecium tetraurelia</italic> became a model to study the parameters forcing gene duplicate retention and loss (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), allowing us to interpret our data on <italic>SAg</italic> ohnologs and other gene duplicates in context with the requirements for subtelomeric localization to build a model for serotype evolution, which includes the crucial parameters for RNAi-mediated, mutually exclusive expression of <italic>SAg</italic> genes described here.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="h1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="h1.1"><title>The <italic>SAg</italic> gene family encodes large surface membrane-located proteins.</title><p>Eleven serotypes have been described for <italic>P.&#x000a0;tetraurelia</italic> using immunological methods, but until recently, sequence data were available only for genes corresponding to 6 serotypes: <italic>51A</italic> (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), <italic>51B</italic> (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), <italic>51C</italic> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), <italic>51D</italic> (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), <italic>51G</italic> (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), and fragments of <italic>51H</italic> (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Although the limited available sequence data for <italic>Paramecium</italic> serotypes indicate some conserved sequences in the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; coding regions of genes (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), this was not sufficient to allow a similarity-based database mining approach. Therefore, we used another exclusive feature of these proteins to identify further <italic>SAg</italic> genes in the genome: all serotypes sequenced so far showed a highly conserved cysteine periodicity throughout the protein, and we used a Pfam domain that was built accordingly for a proteome-wide <italic>in silico</italic> search (<italic>Paramecium</italic> peptides at <italic>Paramecium</italic>DB [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]). We extracted 96 candidate serotypes from the proteome with intact cysteine periodicity (Pfam <italic>E</italic>&#x000a0;value, &#x02264;10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup>); <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1A</xref> in the supplemental material shows the cysteine periodicity of 51H&#x003b2; and SAg 94, representative of all other proteins.</p><p>To decide whether genes have intact open reading frames, we manually reassembled the sequencing reads of the genome project. This was done to correct errors of the automated assembly and to verify start and stop codons by successive translation verifying N-terminal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) translocation signals and C-terminal GPI-anchoring peptides or transmembrane domains (see below). This was possible for 65 genes. Because of the high similarity of the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; coding regions and because of a low coverage of loci on very tiny macronuclear chromosomes, a complete reassembly of 31 of the genes failed. It is thus not clear whether these are intact (protein coding) genes. The subsequent analyses were confined to the 65 correctly reassembled genes; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table&#x000a0;S1</xref> in the supplemental material for details.</p><p>The 65 verified sequences were analyzed in more detail. Sixty of the proteins had N-terminal ER translocation signals (ER-TLS), suggesting that the proteins entered the secretory pathway (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig.&#x000a0;S2</xref> in the supplemental material). Of these, 55 SAgs contained C-terminal signal peptides predicting GPI anchors (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig.&#x000a0;S3</xref> in the supplemental material). One of these genes (<italic>SAg 83</italic>) was probably a pseudogene, because of the presence of a stop codon in the predicted reading frame. Thus, there were 54 genes with the 8-amino-acid cysteine periodicity, which could encode surface proteins with a GPI anchor. These included the four previously described sequences (<italic>51B</italic>, <italic>51C</italic>, <italic>51D</italic>, and <italic>51G</italic>) as well as the complete sequence of the <italic>51H</italic> gene (only segments were published earlier). In addition, the serotype genes <italic>51I</italic> and <italic>51J</italic> were identified using the unpublished sequences of cDNA fragments (A. Valatka and H. Schmidt, personal communication). The genome sequence used strain <italic>P.&#x000a0;tetraurelia</italic> d4-2, which has the genetic background of wild-type stock 51 but has the <italic>51A</italic> serotype allele replaced by the <italic>29A</italic> allele from stock 29. Thus, genes corresponding to 8 of the 11 known serotypes could be identified.</p><p>The gene sequences were also analyzed for the presence of potential transmembrane domains. In eight cases, C-terminal transmembrane domains were predicted. These proteins did not contain signal peptides for GPI anchors, suggesting that there might be an alternative mechanism for anchoring SAgs. Three of the genes contained ER-TLS, suggesting that the proteins would enter the secretory pathway, but the other five genes did not contain a detectable ER-TLS.</p><p>Putative <italic>SAg</italic> genes are large (the average length of the coding region is 6.6&#x000a0;kb, compared to an average of 1.4&#x000a0;kb for all protein-coding genes of <italic>P.&#x000a0;tetraurelia</italic>), which is in agreement with the sizes of previously sequenced <italic>SAg</italic> genes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig.&#x000a0;S4A</xref> in the supplemental material). However, most of the <italic>SAg</italic> genes do not contain introns (four genes each contain a single intron), whereas <italic>P.&#x000a0;tetraurelia</italic> protein-coding genes contain an average of 2.9 introns. The G+C content (34.4%) is also higher than that of the average gene (30.4%) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig.&#x000a0;S4B</xref> in the supplemental material). There are four large superantigen genes with an average coding region of about 12&#x000a0;kb.</p></sec><sec id="h1.2"><title>Serotype isoforms result from intrachromosomal gene duplications.</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure&#x000a0;1A</xref> shows a neighbor joining tree of proteins indicating three separated phylogenetic clusters, as indicated by the background shading: all proteins with transmembrane domains, a cluster containing the 51D and 51H serotypes with their individual isoforms (see below), and the largest cluster, which includes the 29A, 51B (and isoforms), 51G, 51C, and 51I serotype proteins as well as the superantigens. Only SAg 3 cannot be related to one of the clusters. This clustering is consistent with previous immunological studies describing serotype proteins 51A, 51B, 51G, and 51Q as well as a group immunologically related to serotypes 51D and 51J (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), although the gene for serotype 51Q remains to be annotated.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;</label><caption><p>Evolutionary relationship between SAgs.

These show a very high degree of identity, including 91% identity between 51H&#x003b1; and 51H&#x003b2;, an average identity of 79% for the four 51D isoforms, and an average identity of 82% for the four 51B isoforms, so their identity is drastically higher than the average for all SAgs (~27% identity). Although isogenes of the <italic>51D</italic> gene were reported earlier (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) this was not reported for any other serotype gene in <italic>P.&#x000a0;tetraurelia</italic>. Because of their high similarity, these isogenes appear to result from very recent gene duplications.</p><p>Aury et al. described the sequencing of the macronuclear genome and its evolution by three successive whole-genome duplications (WGD); consequently, the genome consists of a high number of ohnologous gene duplicates (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). As mentioned above, serotype genes share an individual degree of homology, and therefore, it seemed tempting to speculate that gene duplication in the context of whole-genome duplication also contributed to serotype diversity. However, this is not the case, because our data indicate that only 25 ohnologs of the ancient and intermediary WGD exist, but none of the classically described surface antigen genes have ohnologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1A</xref>). The neighbor joining tree indicates that the transmembrane antigens (TMA) are separated, whereas SAgs showing ohnologous duplicates build a cluster in the center of the tree which is surrounded by small clusters of highly similar gene copies of the classical surface antigens. To analyze the chromosomal distribution of these genes, we mapped them to the genome assembly; most of the assembled scaffolds do indeed represent macronuclear chromosomes, as telomere reads can be found at both scaffold ends (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Surprisingly, mapping of the antigen genes to the genome annotation revealed that almost all of the individual isogenes are located on the same macronuclear chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). This is true for the four <italic>51B</italic> isogenes on scaffold 143 and two <italic>51H</italic> isogenes on scaffold 142. In the case of the <italic>51D</italic> isogenes, <italic>51D&#x003b3;-1</italic> and <italic>51D&#x003b3;-2</italic> are located on scaffold 159, and only <italic>51J</italic>, which was originally described for the <italic>51D&#x003b5;</italic> isogene (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), is located on chromosome 128. Therefore, serotype isoforms appear to result from intrachromosomal duplication events. In contrast to these isogenes, chromosome 51 harbors four totally different <italic>SAg</italic> genes (<italic>51C</italic>, <italic>SAg 3</italic>, <italic>SAg 42</italic>, and <italic>51G</italic>) which do not show any phylogenetic relationship. Most of the <italic>SAg</italic> genes do not show intrachromosomal isoforms, e.g., <italic>29A</italic> on chromosome 106 (as well as all other genes not included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;</label><caption><p>Chromosomal localization of individual surface antigen genes.

To subsequently characterize chromosomal distribution, we had to consider the heterogeneity of <italic>Paramecium</italic> macronuclear chromosomes. In ciliates, there are two types of nuclei, because they show separation of germline and soma despite the fact that paramecia are unicellular organisms: the germline is represented by the micronuclei, which are responsible for sexual transmission, and the large macronuclei are responsible for somatic gene expression. During conjugation, macronuclei are generated from a zygotic nucleus by a complex process of DNA rearrangements and amplification to ~800n. During these processes, the large micronuclear chromosomes become shorter macronuclear chromosomes by two DNA elimination processes (reviewed in reference <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Both precise elimination of IESs (internal elimination sequences) and the imprecise elimination of repeat sequences are responsible for heterogeneity of the macronuclear chromosomes (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). In other words, the macronuclear chromosomes exist in versions of different lengths. The published assembly ignores minority telomeres to obtain long scaffolds, so that the question of whether a particular surface antigen gene has a subtelomeric location cannot always be answered from the assembled genome sequence. To characterize <italic>SAg</italic> genes in the genomic context, we took advantage of the whole-genome sequence (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) data and extracted all reads from the genome project containing at least three telomeric repeats (CCC[CA]AA) and allowing a single mismatch. After removal of these repeats, the genomic part of the reads was mapped to the genome assembly similar to the approach described in reference <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. To confirm the position of the genomic part of these reads, we examined the linking information of the paired-end sequencing by extraction of read mates and their subsequent mapping (data not shown). We defined a telomeric site as a minimum of four overlapping reads within a range of 2&#x000a0;kb, and these telomeric sites together with the <italic>SAg</italic> genes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>. For our prediction of macronuclear heterogeneity, the literature reports molecular evidence by restriction mapping or pulsed-field electrophoresis for telomeric sites on scaffolds 51 and 106 (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), which supports our approach and the further analysis of genome-wide telomeric sites. Surprisingly, telomeric sites often appeared close to <italic>SAg</italic> genes, and this was especially the case for the annotated antigens. To quantify this effect, we calculated the distance of the individual genes to the closest telomeric site and set this in relation to the <italic>E</italic>&#x000a0;value of the alignment with the domain profiles from Pfam, thus representing the integrity of the cysteine periodicity of the individual genes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure&#x000a0;3A</xref> shows that the mean distance of the gene to telomeres increases drastically for proteins showing a less conserved cysteine periodicity (indicated by increasing Pfam <italic>E</italic>&#x000a0;values). In fact, these genes show a more or less uniform distribution in the genome, comparable to that of the actin multigene family, which was used as a control. <italic>SAg</italic> genes encoding proteins with intact cysteine periodicity, reflected by low <italic>E</italic>&#x000a0;value, e.g., the annotated antigens (SAgs 29A, 51B&#x003b1;, 51C, 51D&#x003b1;, 51H&#x003b1;, 51I, and 51J), show close proximity to telomeric sites. This would indicate that selection pressure occurs on cysteine periodicity in subtelomeric regions, which would require telomere-dependent expression. However, to distinguish whether a correlation between ohnologs and nonohnolog <italic>SAg</italic> genes can also be identified, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3B</xref> plots the mean distance of these two groups to either the closest telomeric site or the end of the scaffold, indicating a significantly closer proximity of the nonohnologous <italic>SAg</italic> genes to telomeres. It therefore seems tempting to speculate that gene duplication and gene position are important factors in evolution of distinct classes of <italic>SAg</italic> genes: subtelomeric and randomly distributed. Our data indicate that the two classes of <italic>SAg</italic> genes (subtelomeric and intrachromosomal) derive from different gene duplication mechanisms.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;3&#x000a0;</label><caption><p>Analysis of chromosomal distribution of <italic>SAg</italic> genes in context of chromosome heterogeneity and whole-genome duplication.

Sixty-five SAgs had the characteristic cysteine periodicity and included 8 classical serotype genes (alphas) and 6 isogenes. However, 8 potential SAgs did not possess a GPI anchor and instead had transmembrane domains. It is not known what the function of these genes is, but as five of them do not show an ER-TLS, their function may be intracellular. Sixty-four <italic>SAg</italic> genes seemed to have structures compatible with expression (i.e., they were probably not pseudogenes). The codon usage with high CAI values was suggestive of highly expressed genes. Although most <italic>SAg</italic> genes are silent at some time, this is also consistent with the alpha <italic>SAg</italic> genes and their isoforms; however, those in particular have a codon bias which seems optimized for high-level expression. In fact, this correlates with our finding that only those genes can be activated during Rdr3 silencing as well as in serotype pure wild-type cultures, and it also agrees with reports that serotype proteins contribute to ~3.5% of the total cellular proteins (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). With respect to the large open reading frames (ORFs), an efficient optimization of transcription and translation is indeed required to ensure high-level protein expression. SAgs are high-molecular-weight proteins encoded by very long genes. Introns are definitely underrepresented, which may be due to optimization of transcription, although the tiny introns of <italic>Paramecium</italic>, which have a size between 20 and 34&#x000a0;nt (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), would not create such a drastic increase in transcript size.</p><p>In some cases, in addition to the major alpha gene, there are neighboring isogenes in the chromosome, and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>) showed that some of these were also transcribed. An attractive explanation for intrachromosomal coexpression in wild-type cells comes from studies in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> indicating a nuclear organization which allows the subnuclear translocation of loci into euchromatic regions, which allow transcriptional activity (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). A similar locus repositioning in <italic>Paramecium</italic> macronuclei might explain cotranscription of close loci (isogenes) on the same macronuclear chromosomes, whereas other loci showing a comparable degree of identity and/or <italic>trans</italic>-acting siRNAs which are located on different chromosomes are not coactivated. In support of this hypothesis, <italic>in situ</italic> localization of <italic>SAg</italic> transcripts indicated local transcription spots in the macronucleus (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="h2.2"><title>A telomere position effect controls RNAi-dependent gene regulation.</title><p>Although, in <italic>Paramecium</italic>, only one serotype is usually expressed, knockdown of Rdr3 results in expression of a mixture of SAgs (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In this paper, we show that only <italic>SAg</italic> genes with a subtelomeric location show this Rdr3-dependent silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref>).</p><p>One possibility to explain subtelomeric position of the genes is the involvement of the telomeric heterochromatin state in the expression mechanism. Telomeric and subtelomeric chromatin is usually heterochromatic. It is likely that Rdr3-associated siRNAs are involved in transcriptional silencing in <italic>Paramecium</italic> (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), and the coding region has been shown to control transcriptional activity of <italic>SAg</italic> genes (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). A precise understanding of the mechanisms involved will require characterization of the siRNAs present during the mutually exclusive expression of <italic>SAg</italic> genes as well as the changes occurring during phenotypic variation. However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig.&#x000a0;7</xref> shows that there is a relationship between mutually exclusive expression and the occurrence of potential <italic>trans</italic>-acting siRNAs, thus suggesting that such siRNAs are involved in the genetic cross talk enabling mutually exclusive expression. The details of siRNA source and targets need to be characterized at the molecular level to get an impression of the RNA-mediated networks occurring in the nucleus.</p><p>In general, endogenous <italic>trans</italic>-acting siRNAs have great importance for the regulation of endogenous gene expression, as they allow genetic cross talk and therefore flexible adaptation of a single gene as well as alterations in gene expression patterns. Position effects in correlation with <italic>trans</italic>-acting mechanisms have been reported for <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, where silencing depends on the position of the target gene: <italic>trans</italic>-silencing works efficient only in loci close to heterochromatic regions, such as centromeres (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). A different gene position effect was shown in <italic>Drosophila</italic>: transgenes inserted in subtelomeric regions repress expression of homologous genes in euchromatin, and this <italic>trans</italic>-silencing has also been shown to depend on components of the piRNA (piwi-interacting RNA) pathway, which is a germline-specific RNAi mechanism, and on heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1); interestingly, epigenetic inheritance has also been shown, and increasing data indicate cytoplasmically transmitted piRNAs responsible for maternal inheritance (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Although the two examples cannot be directly compared to each other, increasing evidence shows gene position effects as prerequisites for efficient <italic>trans</italic>-silencing; our example of <italic>SAg</italic> regulation in <italic>Paramecium</italic> would be one of the first examples in regulation of endogenous gene expression. Reports that these <italic>trans</italic>-silencing phenomena also allow epigenetic inheritance, as has also been reported for the <italic>Paramecium</italic> serotype system (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), could give rise to speculations that the telomere position effect may also be necessary for stable inheritance of gene expression patterns.</p></sec><sec id="h2.3"><title>Diversification of serotypes by gene duplication and chromosome fragmentation.</title><p>Epigenetic control of antigenic variation represents an exciting example combining Darwinian evolution of surface antigen genes as a kind of long-term adaptation with the capability for rapid phenotype alterations by epigenetic control of a variety of these genes and ciliate genetics and epigenetics heavily contributes to a better understanding of these rarely understood control mechanisms (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Across kingdoms, phenotypic evolution was described as resulting from the creation of new genes, predominantly originating from duplication events (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). The example of variant surface antigens has another aspect: as the creation of a new functional surface antigen also requires consideration of the gene expression mechanism (to include the newly evolved gene into the genetic network of telomeric <italic>trans</italic> silencing), translocation of the gene copy into a subtelomeric region is required.</p><p>Our analysis of the <italic>SAg</italic> family in <italic>Paramecium</italic> indicates its evolution by two different events of gene duplication: a subset of intrachromosomal genes show ohnologs from the <italic>Paramecium</italic> intermediate and recent WGD, and another subset of subtelomeric genes show intrachromosomal gene duplicates which need to result from a different mechanism. Strikingly, the latter subset of genes show (i) mutually exclusive transcription, (ii) intrachromosomal duplicates, and (iii) no ohnologs. As 68% of all genes in <italic>P.&#x000a0;tetraurelia</italic> still have their ohnologs from the last WGD, we see only 25 ohnologs in the <italic>SAg</italic> family, which has 65 genes.</p><p>Why do the subtelomeric <italic>SAg</italic> genes not have ohnologs? They might be eliminated soon after the WGD event, or subtelomeric <italic>SAg</italic> genes might have appeared after the last WGD. Both possibilities may also occur together. A preferential deletion of subtelomeric <italic>SAg</italic> ohnologs might be selected due to problems in the mechanism for mutually exclusive expression. Our data indicate that closely related <italic>SAg</italic> genes on different chromosomes are usually mutually exclusively expressed, e.g., <italic>51A</italic>-<italic>51G</italic> or <italic>51D</italic>-<italic>51J</italic>, by the above-discussed <italic>trans</italic>-acting siRNAs. Previous studies showed allelic exclusion in cells which are heterozygous for <italic>SAg</italic> loci, meaning that one of the two alleles became inactivated: also, several crosses and backcrosses led to the hypothesis that this silencing was due to an &#x0201c;allelic interaction&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Allelic exclusion of very similar subtelomeric alleles or <italic>trans</italic> silencing of duplicates might explain a low retention rate of subtelomeric <italic>SAg</italic> ohnologs.</p><p>Nevertheless, our data suggest gene duplication events after the last WGD contributing to <italic>SAg</italic> diversity. The phylogenetic analysis indicates a closer relationship between intrachromosomal duplicates than ohnologs, indicating that intrachromosomal isoforms are younger than the last WGD, which is in agreement with the absence of ohnologs. As they show cotranscription at a certain level with the individual alpha gene, this might explain the still existing selection pressure on (i) cysteine periodicity and (ii) N- and C-terminal areas. As a consequence of cotranscription, the minor abundance of isoforms together with the alpha serotype protein might allow diversification of the central and variable area of the proteins with parallel positive selection of tertiary structure.</p><p>The finding of intrachromosomal gene duplicates on macronuclear chromosomes raises the question of their origin. As one would expect from highly expressed intronless genes, retroposition might meet several criteria of these isogenes, e.g., lack of introns and high conservation of coding sequences (CDS) but not of regulatory up- and downstream regions. However, retroposition can be excluded, as all isogenes are also present in the micronuclear genome and all of them contain IES elements, which themselves show a high degree of similarity (data not shown). In ciliates, the germline chromosomes are interrupted by noncoding internal-elimination elements (IESs) which are present in coding and noncoding regions: their precise elimination during assembly of the new somatic macronucleus is crucial for building intact genes (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). The data of a recent sequencing of <italic>Paramecium</italic> IESs (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) also show IESs in the isogenes which show great homology to the IESs of the individual alpha gene, thus indicating that duplication occurs on micronuclear chromosomes.</p><p>What might be the biological significance of these intrachromosomal duplicates? Mutually exclusive transcription requires subtelomeric localizations; therefore, the evolution from intrachromsomal <italic>SAg</italic> isoforms into a new <italic>SAg</italic> would require gene repositioning. The observed gene position effects in context with macronuclear heterogeneity let us hypothesize that serotype evolution in ciliates involves a very elegant solution, as the heterogeneity of macronuclear chromosomes allows them to &#x0201c;move the telomere&#x0201d; instead of the gene. The appearance of the telomeric sites close to the <italic>SAg</italic> isoforms suggests that alterations of macronuclear chromosome heterogeneity by the creation/activation of new telomere addition sites on micronuclear chromosomes may be a mechanism to advance a <italic>SAg</italic> isoform to a new serotype gene by moving the gene into a subtelomeric region (see the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig.&#x000a0;8</xref>). As mentioned above, previous studies showed that imprecise elimination of repeated sequences (transposable elements or minisatellites) from micronuclear chromosomes leads to macronuclear chromosome polymorphisms: after deletion, the ends may be stabilized by telomere addition or religated (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). These imprecise deletions are epigenetically controlled: they can be experimentally induced by prezygotic silencing (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), and a non-Mendelian mutant was described which still contains the <italic>51A</italic> gene in the micronucleus but removes this locus during macronuclear development, showing an alternative telomere addition site upstream of the <italic>51A</italic> gene (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Although the detailed mechanisms remain to be clarified, these findings indicate that epigenetic mechanisms can contribute to the creation of macronuclear heterogeneity, which could move internal <italic>SAg</italic> duplicates into subtelomeric regions.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;8&#x000a0;</label><caption><p>Hypothetical model of serotype gene evolution. Gene duplication occurs in the micronucleus. As subtelomeric <italic>SAg</italic> genes do not show ohnologs, this may indicate that duplicates from WGD become deleted or that all subtelomeric <italic>SAg</italic> genes are younger than the last WGD and therefore cannot show ohnologs. In contrast, gene duplications leading to <italic>SAg</italic> genes on the same Mac chromosome show cotranscription in a homology-dependent manner, allowing diversification of the intrachromosomal duplicate with selection pressure on structurally relevant areas. This may lead to new immunological information on the duplicate with decreasing levels of cotranscription as a result of decreased homology. Genetic and epigenetic alterations driving alternative TAR (telomere addition regions) close to the intrachromosomal duplicate can move the divergent duplicate close to a telomere, advancing this gene into a new serotype gene, as the new subtelomeric localization allows mutually exclusive expression. Alternatively, the intrachromosomal duplicate may become a pseudogene, allowing rapid diversification by a loss of selection pressure, and serves as a source of new immunological information by copying the information on the subtelomeric serotype gene by gene conversion.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mbo0041419160008"/></fig><p>As gene conversion was shown to be involved in the creation of new variant antigen genes in many organisms, such as <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> spp<italic>.</italic> (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), cells may benefit from the intrachromosomal duplicates in different ways, because they offer a pool of new immunological information: as studies indicate the frequency of gene conversion to be inversely proportional to physical distance (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), this may be a mechanism to introduce new immunological data into the existing subtelomeric <italic>SAg</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="h3"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="h3.1"><title>Cell cultures and RNAi.</title><p><italic>Paramecium tetraurelia</italic> strains d4-2 and 51 were used and cultured as described before in WGP (wheat-grass powder) medium inoculated with <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> and supplemented with 0.8&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml &#x003b2;-sitosterol.
