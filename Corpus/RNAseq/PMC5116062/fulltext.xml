However, little is known about the relationship of protein and lipid composition of EVs and their source cells. Here, we report high-resolution lipidomic and proteomic analyses of exosomes and MVs derived by differential ultracentrifugation from 3 different cell types: U87 glioblastoma cells, Huh7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells and human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). We identified 3,532 proteins and 1,961 lipid species in the screen. Exosomes differed from MVs in several different areas: (a) The protein patterns of exosomes were more likely different from their cells of origin than were the protein patterns of MVs; (b) The proteomes of U87 and Huh7 exosomes were similar to each other but different from the proteomes of MSC exosomes, whereas the lipidomes of Huh7 and MSC exosomes were similar to each other but different from the lipidomes of U87 exosomes; (c) exosomes exhibited proteins of extracellular matrix, heparin-binding, receptors, immune response and cell adhesion functions, whereas MVs were enriched in endoplasmic reticulum, proteasome and mitochondrial proteins. Exosomes and MVs also differed in their types of lipid contents. Enrichment in glycolipids and free fatty acids characterized exosomes, whereas enrichment in ceramides and sphingomyelins characterized MVs. Furthermore, Huh7 and MSC exosomes were specifically enriched in cardiolipins; U87 exosomes were enriched in sphingomyelins. This study comprehensively analyses the protein and lipid composition of exosomes, MVs and source cells in 3 different cell types.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>extracellular vesicles</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>lipidomics</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) occur in most bodily fluids and cell culture supernatants. With the advent of parallel sequencing technologies, the RNA content of EVs is being heavily investigated as a new type of diagnostic biomarker (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The RNA contents of EVs from a variety of bodily fluids, including urine, saliva, blood and cerebrospinal fluid, have been explored as biomarkers for indications throughout the body (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). EVs as tumour biomarkers are especially valuable, since bodily fluid EVs provide an alternative to repeated biopsies for continuous monitoring and an option for tumours inaccessible to biopsies (i.e. brain tumours). EVs are also being explored as natural carriers of therapeutic RNAs (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). EVs for therapeutic applications are typically derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), a cell type well characterized for cell-based therapies (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Two EV subgroups in particular, exosomes and microvesicles (MVs), have the ability to carry biomarkers or therapeutic RNA. Exosomes are small vesicles (traditionally considered 50&#x02013;150 nm) that originate from endocytic compartments within the cell. During endosome maturation, intraluminal vesicles are formed by endosomal membrane budding inside multivesicular bodies, and intraluminal vesicles become exosomes upon the exocytosis of multivesicular bodies (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Compared with exosomes, MVs are larger vesicles (traditionally considered 200&#x02013;1,000 nm) and are formed by budding directly from the plasma membrane (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Available purification methods include separation based on size [differential ultracentrifugation (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and ultrafiltration (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>)], density [OptiPrep&#x02122; (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and sucrose (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>)], floatation velocity (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), immunoaffinity (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based precipitation (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). These strategies enrich EVs within certain size ranges but are not able to fully separate EV subgroups, resulting in mixed EV populations in the isolates (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The purification strategy defines the nature of EV subgroup mixture in the isolate, which in turn will determine its biological function and biochemical properties. Furthermore, EV purification strategies can co-isolate non-vesicular extracellular proteins and lipoprotein particles with EVs.</p><p>The protein and lipid compositions of EVs from various sources have been studied via biochemical assays and mass spectrometry (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and provide a robust basis for protein biomarker identification in EVs for research quality control purposes. Exosomal isolates commonly contain membrane proteins, specifically tetraspanins, as well as various amounts of extracellular matrix proteins; they are devoid of nuclear proteins (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Microvesicular isolates may contain proteins of mitochondrial or endoplasmic reticulum origin (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). A detailed understanding of the biochemical (protein and lipid) composition of EV subgroups and the extent to which EV composition reflects source cell composition is necessary for further development into diagnostics and therapeutics. To address this question, we performed a comparative analysis of the protein and lipid composition of 2 EV subgroups and their source cells. We chose a glioblastoma (U87) and a hepatocellular carcinoma (Huh7) cell line, since the EVs of these tumour types are in the focus of interest for diagnostic biomarker development (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). We further chose bone marrow-derived MSCs, since this cell type is frequently used for therapeutic vesicle production (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). For EV purification, we sought a strategy that would not introduce bias into the composition of EV isolates (unlike immunoaffinity-based purification), would not co-enrich non-vesicular extracellular proteins (unlike PEG precipitation) (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and would provide sufficient yield for mass spectrometric measurement. Differential ultracentrifugation is considered the gold standard of EV purification and met the above requirements.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S0002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S0002-S20001"><title>Preparation of EVs</title><p>U87 glioblastoma and Huh7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) and human bone marrow-derived MSCs (Lonza) in MSC basal medium (Lonza).

The grids were incubated in 50 mM glycine/PBS for 5 min and blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/(PBS) for 10 min and washed with 3&#x000d7; PBS followed by incubation in 1% glutaraldehyde for 5 min. Following 8 washes of 2 min with H<sub>2</sub>O, the grids were incubated for 5 min in uranyl oxalate and in 1% methyl cellulose: 4% uranyl acetate (9:1) for 10 min on ice. Excess liquid was removed with a filter paper, and the grids were air-dried for 5&#x02013;10 min.

Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation for 15 min at 13,000 rpm at 4&#x000b0;C. Supernatants were transferred to a new tube, and protein concentrations measured by Bradford assay. Proteins (50 &#x000b5;g) were loaded and simultaneously analysed on NuPAGE 4&#x02013;12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). After transfer to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (BioRad) membranes, antibody incubation and development was performed using Odyssey<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> system (Li-Cor) according to manufacturer's instructions. Primary antibodies used were calnexin (Cell Signaling, C5C9), CD9 (Santa Cruz, C4), CD63 (BD Biosciences, H5C6), CD81 (Santa Cruz, B11) and Tsg101 (Abcam, 4A10).</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S20004"><title>Proteomics</title><p>Protein extraction followed the same protocol as for Western blotting. Total protein (100 &#x000b5;g) was applied to an SDS&#x02013;PAGE. Once the entire protein sample entered the stacking gel, electrophoresis was stopped and the portion of gel containing proteins was excised and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. The fixed gel fragments were processed by University of Massachusetts Medical School Mass Spectrometry Core. Gel slices were cut into 1&#x000d7;1 mm pieces, placed in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes containing 1-ml water and incubated for 30 min. The water was replaced with 200 &#x000b5;l of 250 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 25 &#x000b5;l of 45 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and the samples were incubated for 30 min at 50&#x000b0;C. Samples were then cooled to room temperature, and alkylation was performed by adding 25 &#x000b5;l of 100 mM iodoacetamide and incubating for 30 min. The gel slices were washed twice in water, and then incubated in 1 ml of a 50:50 solution of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate/acetonitrile for 1 h at room temperature. The solution was replaced with 200 &#x000b5;l acetonitrile and incubated until the gel slices turned opaque white. The acetonitrile was removed, and gel slices were further dried in a Speed Vac. Gel slices were rehydrated in a 100-&#x000b5;l solution of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate containing 0.01% ProteaseMAX Surfactant (Promega) and 2 ng/&#x000b5;l trypsin (Sigma). Additional bicarbonate buffer was added to ensure complete submersion of the gel slices. Samples were incubated for 21 h at 37&#x000b0;C. Supernatants were transferred to a fresh 1.5-ml tube. Gel slices were further dehydrated with 200 &#x000b5;l of an 80:20 solution of acetonitrile/1% formic acid. The extract was combined with the supernatants of each sample. The combined supernatants containing digested proteins were then dried in a Speed Vac, and pellets were redissolved with 25 &#x000b5;l of 5% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid.

Raw data files were processed with Proteome Discoverer (version 1.4) before using Mascot Server (version 2.5) to search against the Uniprot_Human protein database. Applied search parameters were fully tryptic with 2 missed cleavages, parent mass tolerances of 10 ppm and fragment mass tolerances of 0.05 Da, and allowed for fixed modification of carbamidomethyl cysteine and variable acetyl-group modifications at the N-termini, for example, pyroglutamate for N-term glutamine and oxidation of methionine.

Analysis</title><p>EVs were purified from source cells on 6 independent days, and 3 replicate samples of cells, MVs and exosomes of each source cell type were used for proteomics analysis and the second set of 3 biological replicates of each sample type for lipidomics analysis. Lipidomic analysis additionally included 2 technical replicates of each biological replicate. Label-free quantification of proteins was performed via the iBAQ [intensity-based absolute quantification (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>)] method in Scaffold Viewer (Proteome Software). Briefly, precursor ion intensities of peptides matching to each particular protein were divided by the theoretical number of peptides that could be derived from each particular protein by trypsin digestion. Lipidomic quantitation of molecular species and lipid classes were normalized to the protein content of samples.</p><p>Since we collected a large data set without any a priori hypothesis, statistical analysis involved several hypothesis-generating methods. First, we compared total protein profiles (individual iBAQ values) and lipid profiles (nmol of lipid species normalized to total protein content) of exosomes, MVs and source cells by pairwise Pearson's correlation in Microsoft Excel and used R<sup>2</sup> to characterize the level of similarity between samples. Another statistical method to explore big data derived from several sample types is principal component analysis (PCA). We normalized protein (individual iBAQ values) and lipid (nmol of lipid species normalized to total protein content) profiles of exosomes and MVs to the protein and lipid profile of their source cells and ran PCA in R (&#x0201c;prcomp&#x0201d; command).

Furthermore, the current study provides the largest data set of EV lipid content to date.</p><p>We observed cell-type-specific enrichment of proteins and lipids in EVs. The clear difference between composition of source cells and EVs indicated that lipids and proteins are likely actively sorted into EVs. However, the enrichment of commonly used exosome markers was source-cell-type dependent, and although to a different extent, all exosomal markers were enriched in MVs as well. Enrichment of Rab proteins in EVs, a protein family indicated in exosomal biogenesis (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), showed marked source cell dependency, suggesting that protein sorting mechanisms into EVs may depend on source cell type. Commonly enriched pathways in EVs correlated well with previously described behaviours of EVs [such as heparin-binding (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), immune response stimulation (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), integrin content (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) and antiphagocytic CD47 (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) of exosomes and mitochondrial, proteasomal and ER content of MVs (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>)]. GO analysis found enrichment of certain post-translational modification motifs (e.g. glycosylation and prenylation) common to all EVs, although the exosome targeting palmitoyl modification (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) was not detected. We were not able to detect any protein biomarkers that were enriched in exosomes of all source cells and at the same time depleted in MVs of all source cells. Nevertheless, we showed that exosomal and MV content on the proteome level differed significantly from each other independent of source cell type. Therefore, we suggest that the correlation between exosome and MV content could be explored as an additional biomarker for &#x0201c;vesiculome&#x0201d; (mass spectrometry and RNASeq) studies.</p><p>Protein enrichment in exosomes distinguished cancer cells from the stem cells used in this study. If further studies on EVs derived from multiple malignant and benign cell types will confirm this observation, then protein enrichment in exosomes might become a particularly useful general cancer marker. Furthermore, this phenomenon suggests that stem cells and cancer cells may use different mechanisms to sort proteins into EVs. Hence, the biomarker value of exosomes might lie in indicating sorting dysregulation in their source cells, whereas MVs are valuable for reflecting the content of their source cells.</p><p>Protein and lipid sorting into EVs did not appear to be linked: U87 and Huh7 (cancerous) cells enriched similar proteins but different lipids in their EVs, while Huh7 and MSC (yielding few and smaller exosomes) cells enriched similar lipids but different proteins in their EVs. Hence, protein sorting into EVs associated best with stem or cancer cell origin in this study, whereas lipid sorting associated best with yield and size of exosomes. Further studies are needed to confirm whether these associations explain EV biogenesis mechanisms.</p><p>The current study mapped EV lipidome to a great depth, identifying almost 2,000 lipid species. Since lipids are not coded in the genetic code and biological functions of most lipids detectable by mass spectrometry are unknown, data interpretation may follow biochemical/structural principles. Here, we showed that not only head group identity but also head group charge, fatty acid tail length and saturation contributed to lipid enrichment in EVs. These parameters modify the head group-to-tail size ratio, which, in turn, defines the spontaneous curvature of a lipid monolayer. Since EVs are small vesicles, their limiting bilayer membranes are highly curved. We found exosomes to be enriched in positive curvature promoting (free fatty acids and lysophosphatidyl derivatives, both having 1 tail only and favouring outer membranes) as well as negative curvature promoting (cardiolipins having 4 tails and favouring inner membranes) lipids. While cardiolipin is believed to exclusively reside in the inner mitochondrial membrane (a highly curved membrane itself), other mitochondrial contents (proteins) were specifically depleted from the same Huh7 and MSC exosomes. These data suggest that cardiolipin must be actively sorted into exosomes of Huh7 cells and MSCs, and it might function to stabilize these unusually small vesicles. However, a wider screen of source cell types is necessary to establish a firm correlation between cardiolipin content and exosome size. Furthermore, it is intriguing to speculate that anti-cardiolipin antibodies present in several autoimmune diseases (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) might partially be generated due to the presence of cardiolipin on circulating exosomes.</p><p>Sphingomyelins and ceramides have been implicated in exosomal biogenesis in brain cells [oligodendrocytes (<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), neurons (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>), neuroblastoma (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>)] but not in in PC-3 cells (<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). We found enrichment of sphingomyelins in U87 glioblastoma (a brain cell type) exosomes only, whereas both sphingomyelins and ceramides were characteristically enriched in all MVs. Ceramide-triggered exosome formation pathway is thought to be independent of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-mediated exosome formation pathway (<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) and controls the packaging of only a subset of proteins into exosomes (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Hence, source cell type may influence, which pathway is predominantly involved in exosome formation and which lipid sorting mechanism is applied. Different exosome formation pathways may overlap with MV formation pathways in a source-cell-type-dependent manner.</p><p>We found that structural plasma membrane lipids, including phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylinositols, phosphatidylglycols and phosphatidylethanolamines, were depleted, whereas phosphatidylserines showed a mild enrichment in exosomes but not in MVs. These data are consistent with previous findings showing depletion of phosphatidylcholines and enrichment of phosphatidylserines in exosomes (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). These lipids comprise the majority of membranes, and their levels in MVs were more similar to source cells than their levels in exosomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S1"><caption><title>High-resolution proteomic and lipidomic analysis of exosomes and microvesicles from different cell sources</title></caption><media xlink:href="JEV-5-32570-s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S2"><caption><title>High-resolution proteomic and lipidomic analysis of exosomes and microvesicles from different cell sources</title></caption><media xlink:href="JEV-5-32570-s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S3"><caption><title>High-resolution proteomic and lipidomic analysis of exosomes and microvesicles from different cell sources</title></caption><media xlink:href="JEV-5-32570-s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S4"><caption><title>High-resolution proteomic and lipidomic analysis of exosomes and microvesicles from different cell sources</title></caption><media xlink:href="JEV-5-32570-s004.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S5"><caption><title>High-resolution proteomic and lipidomic analysis of exosomes and microvesicles from different cell sources</title></caption><media xlink:href="JEV-5-32570-s005.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S6"><caption><title>High-resolution proteomic and lipidomic analysis of exosomes and microvesicles from different cell sources</title></caption><media xlink:href="JEV-5-32570-s006.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Emily Y Chen and Justice McDaniel for their help in lipidomics analysis, Annie Hien for her help in initial EV preparations, Joerg Braun for help with Western blotting and Darryl Conte for help with manuscript preparation.
