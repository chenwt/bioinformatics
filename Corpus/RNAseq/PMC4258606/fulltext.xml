Beta2-integrins, which mediate adhesion and cytoskeletal organization, are emerging as negative regulators of myeloid cell-mediated immune responses, but the molecular mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Here, we show that loss of the interaction between beta2-integrins and kindlin-3 abolishes the actin-linkage of integrins and the GM-CSF receptor in dendritic cells. This leads to increased GM-CSF receptor/Syk signaling, and to the induction of a transcriptional program characteristic of mature, migratory dendritic cells, accumulation of migratory dendritic cells in lymphoid organs, and increased Th1 immune responses <italic>in vivo</italic>. We observe increased GM-CSF responses and increased survival in neutrophils where the interaction between integrin and the cytoskeleton is disrupted. Thus, ligand-reinforced beta2-integrin tail interactions restrict cytokine receptor signaling, survival, maturation and migration in myeloid cells and thereby contribute to immune homeostasis <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">Dendritic cells (DCs) function as the main antigen-presenting cells in the immune system. These cells are highly mobile and orchestrate immune responses by taking up antigen in the periphery before migrating to lymph nodes in both steady state and inflammatory conditions, where antigen is presented to T cells. The maturation or differentiation state of the DC determines the outcome of the immune response, and DCs control the initiation of helper, cytolytic and regulatory T cell responses <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P4">Beta2-integrin adhesion receptors are expressed in both T cells and DCs where they play strikingly different roles in immune regulation. In T cells, beta2-integrins and their regulation by talin and kindlin-3 are required for firm adhesion under conditions of shear flow, and therefore for T cell trafficking into lymph nodes and inflammatory sites<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.

In DCs, beta2-integrins play a very different role, as they are not required for DC migration to lymph nodes in steady state<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Instead, beta2-integrins have been described to restrict DC-mediated priming of T cells<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and Th17 differentiation<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, although the molecular mechanisms involved have remained unclear. Beta2-integrins have been reported to play a regulatory role in macrophages by restricting Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling through pathways dependent on Syk and IL-10<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, but have also recently been reported to promote TLR4 signaling in endosomes in DCs and DC-mediated T cell activation<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Therefore, both the roles of beta2-integrins in DC signaling and the molecular mechanisms involved in regulation of DC-mediated immune responses by beta2-integrins remain unclear.</p><p id="P5">Integrins integrate the cell exterior to the actin cytoskeleton, and integrin activation and signaling is regulated by the binding of cytoplasmic proteins, such as talin and kindlin-3, to the beta2-integrin cytoplasmic domain<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Kindlin-3 is an essential integrin regulator which binds to the integrin beta-chain cytoplasmic tail through a membrane-distal NPXY domain<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and a TTT-domain<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. A deficiency in kindlin-3 causes Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency type III (LAD-III), a disorder where beta2- and beta3-integrins cannot mediate leukocyte and platelet adhesion. LAD-III patients have a similar phenotype to patients with beta2-integrin subunit mutations (LAD-I), in that they suffer recurrent infections, with the addition of severe bleeding due to loss of platelet adhesion<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Recently, the actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in restriction of signaling in resting immune cells, by causing compartmentalization of the plasma membrane and thereby restricting mobility of cell surface receptors and associated molecules<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>.

We have previously investigated the activation of T cells from beta2<sup>TTT/AAA</sup> integrin knock-in mice, using <italic>in vitro</italic> models and <italic>in vivo</italic> adoptive transfer systems with WT DCs to prime T cell responses, and found knock-in T cell activation to be normal<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. To investigate the role of the integrin-kindlin-3 interaction in DC-mediated immune responses <italic>in vivo</italic>, beta2<sup>TTT/AAA</sup> integrin knock-in mice were immunized with peptide antigen in Complete Freund&#x02019;s Adjuvant (CFA) to induce T cell activation by beta2<sup>TTT/AAA</sup> integrin knock-in DCs. Strikingly, we found that the CD4 T cell response generated in both the spleen and the draining (inguinal) lymph nodes of beta2<sup>TTT/AAA</sup> integrin knock-in mice was elevated compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). This result led us to investigate the phenotype of beta2<sup>TTT/AAA</sup> integrin knock-in DCs.</p><p id="P9">We assessed the T cell priming ability of knock-in BMDCs in a co-culture system with TCR transgenic CD4 T cells specific for the ovalbumin (OVA) 323-339 peptide (OT-II T cells). Resting (non-TLR activated) peptide-loaded beta2<sup>TTT/AAA</sup>-integrin knock-in DCs induced higher levels of OT-II T cell activation <italic>in vitro</italic>, as measured by T cell expression of the activation markers CD69, CD25, and CD44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Using optical trapping, we show that knock-in DCs formed weaker antigen-dependent contacts with OT-II T cells, at both the initial contact (2min) and at longer (24hr) contact times, compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). This reduced adhesion strength is likely due to impaired binding of the integrin ligand ICAM-1 on the T cell surface by DC beta2-integrins, as the kindlin-integrin interaction has been described to regulate integrin adhesion to ligands<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Indeed, knock-in DCs showed reduced binding to the beta2-integrin ligands ICAM-1 and iC3b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), as well as to culture plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>), demonstrating the general importance of beta2-integrin-kindlin-3 interactions in integrin-mediated cellular adhesion. As has been reported for other cell types carrying the TTT/AAA mutation<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, surface expression of beta2-integrins was lower in knock-in DCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>), likely due to a deficiency in sorting nexin binding to the mutated integrin, leading to deficient integrin recycling from endosomes<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Indeed, treatment of cells with a lysosome inhibitor, bafilomycin, completely rescued the integrin surface expression defect in beta2<sup>TTT/AAA</sup> integrin-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). However, bafilomycin treatment did not rescue cell adhesion to ICAM-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>), confirming that the defect in DC adhesion is due to impaired integrin function rather than a deficiency in integrin surface expression.</p><p id="P10">Next we investigated CD4 T cell activation <italic>in vivo</italic> using MHC class II tetramers following the adoptive transfer of either WT or knock-in LPS-activated peptide-loaded DCs into WT recipient mice. In this system, only the DCs carry the TTT/AAA mutation whilst all other cell types are WT. In agreement with the <italic>in vitro</italic> data, beta2<sup>TTT/AAA</sup>-integrin knock-in DCs triggered a larger T cell response <italic>in vivo</italic> in the spleen than WT DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>), although as this experiment used small amounts of adoptively transferred DC, which have to survive and migrate in the WT hosts, the CD4 T cell response was not upregulated as much as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, as expected. Taken together, these results suggest that beta2<sup>TTT/AAA</sup>-integrin knock-in DCs are pre-disposed to activate T cells without TLR stimulation, driving elevated T cell activation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, despite showing reduced adhesion to integrin ligands and forming weaker antigen-dependent contacts with T cells.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Beta2-integrin knock-in DCs display elevated maturation</title><p id="P11">Our results show that adhesion-deficient beta2<sup>TTT/AAA</sup>-integrin knock-in DCs drive increased T cell immune responses <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. To further investigate the phenotype of knock-in BMDCs, expression of surface markers was analyzed by flow cytometry. Surprisingly, expression of MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecules CD80, CD86 and CD40 was higher in GM-CSF-cultured, as well as LPS-activated, knock-in DCs compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-B</xref>). Interestingly, expression of these markers showed a dose-dependent increase in response to GM-CSF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>). Bafilomycin treatment of the knock-in DCs, which rescued cell surface expression of TTT/AAA integrins, did not inhibit these increased responses to GM-CSF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref>), demonstrating that the decreased surface expression of integrins in knock-in DCs was not responsible for their active phenotype. In terms of cytokine production by knock-in DCs, IL-12p40 was significantly increased with GM-CSF stimulation, whilst IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IL-10, IL-23p19, TNF-alpha and nitric oxide were elevated following LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>), indicating that GM-CSF and TLR responses were elevated in knock-in cells.</p><p id="P12">As cellular responses to GM-CSF were elevated in beta2<sup>TTT/AAA</sup> integrin knock-in DCs, we went on to investigate GM-CSF signaling in knock-in BMDCs. Surface expression of the GM-CSF receptor was slightly increased in knock-in DCs compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). The GM-CSF receptor signals through the JAK/STAT pathway leading to activation of further downstream pathways such as MAPK and Akt. Although initial JAK2/STAT5 activation after GM-CSF stimulation was similar in WT and KI cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>), GM-CSF signaling was sustained in knock-in DCs, which displayed increased levels of p-MAPK, p-p38 and p-Akt downstream of JAK/STAT signaling at a 3h timepoint after GM-CSF addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). Syk has been previously shown to be downstream of beta-common chain-containing cytokine receptor signaling<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, and we found here that Syk signaling was also up-regulated in beta2<sup>TTT/AAA</sup> integrin-expressing cells downstream of the GM-CSF receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). TLR (LPS) stimulation did not further increase Syk signaling in these cells, but LPS stimulation did result in up-regulation of NF&#x003ba;B and Akt signaling in knock-in DCs, whilst levels of p-p38 and pErk after LPS stimulation were similar in WT and knock-in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). These results demonstrate that GM-CSF (and TLR) signaling is up-regulated in DCs where the kindlin-3-integrin link has been disrupted.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Knock-in neutrophils show increased responsiveness to GM-CSF</title><p id="P13">To investigate whether increased GM-CSF signaling was a general feature in the beta2<sup>TTT/AAA</sup> integrin knock-in mice, we investigated neutrophil GM-CSF responses. Neutrophilia is a significant symptom in murine models with defects in adhesion molecules, including the recently developed beta2<sup>TTT/AAA</sup> integrin knock-in mouse<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. In addition to the previously reported increase in neutrophil numbers in the bloodstream of these mice<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, we found neutrophil numbers in the bone marrow of beta2<sup>TTT/AAA</sup> integrin knock-in mice to be significantly elevated compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). As GM-CSF is known to be vital for neutrophil survival<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, we tested the survival capacity of WT and knock-in neutrophils <italic>in vitro</italic>. The results show significantly increased <italic>ex vivo</italic> survival of knock-in neutrophils, both in the absence of GM-CSF, likely reflecting continuing cellular responses to endogenous signals from their environment within tissues of the mice, and in the presence of GM-CSF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>). Knock-in neutrophils also showed increased GM-CSF signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3C</xref>). These data demonstrate a more general role for beta2-integrins in the regulation of GM-CSF signaling in leukocytes.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Knock-in bone marrow cells show elevated IL-3 response</title><p id="P14">Because the GM-CSF receptor shares the beta-common chain with the IL-3 and IL-5 cytokine receptors, we went on to investigate IL-3 responses in myeloid leukocytes. Myeloid leukocytes survived in culture without IL-3, but interestingly, beta2-integrin knock-in bone marrow myeloid cell proliferation in response to IL-3 was significantly increased compared to WT cells, with a greater effect seen at highest IL-3 concentrations (day 4 average MFIs for CFSE in KI cell cultures are 171 at 0.1ng/ml IL-3; 135 at 1ng/ml IL-3; 110 at 10ng/ml IL-3), although the effects on survival were not very substantial (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3D</xref>). These data indicate that beta2-integrins are especially important in the regulation of GM-CSF receptor (and TLR) signaling. In contrast, Flt3 ligand-cultivated DCs and M-CSF-cultured macrophages did not display increased activation responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4A-B</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that beta2<sup>TTT/AAA</sup> integrin knock-in myeloid cells are more responsive to GM-CSF/IL-3 family of cytokines than WT cells.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Beta2-integrin knock-in DCs have a mature migratory phenotype</title><p id="P15">Our data imply that maturation status is affected in adhesion-deficient beta2<sup>TTT/AAA</sup>-integrin knock-in DCs. To investigate the global effects on gene transcription in these cells, we performed next generation sequencing (RNAseq) from WT and beta2<sup>TTT/AAA</sup> integrin knock-in BMDCs to map the transcriptomes. The data reveal that there were significant differences in gene expression between WT and knock-in DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Datasets 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">2</xref>). Co-stimulatory molecules CD86 and CD40 and cytokines such as IL-12 were confirmed to be upregulated on the transcriptional level in knock-in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Also, molecules involved in antigen presentation (MHC class II and CIITA), and in the JAK/STAT signaling (JAK2, STAT5, SOCS2) pathway were upregulated, whilst components involved in antigen uptake (Sort1, CD68, Stab1) were downregulated in knock-in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), confirming that the maturation status was indeed affected in knock-in DCs. However, antigen uptake was not reduced in knock-in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that the cells can still take up antigen although they are in a more mature state.</p><p id="P16">Crucially, CCR7, which is essential for DC migration to lymph nodes, was found to be significantly upregulated in knock-in DCs, as determined by next generation sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) and flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). By comparing gene expression profiles to previously described profiles of DC populations <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>, it became apparent that there was a significant overlap of the transcriptomes of knock-in DC and <italic>in vivo</italic> migratory DC populations (non-lymphoid tissue cDCs that have migrated to lymph nodes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Dataset 3</xref>). In migratory DCs, beta2-integrins (<italic>Itgb2</italic> and <italic>Itgax</italic> genes) are downregulated, whilst CCR7 is upregulated; the same is true in knock-in DC (where beta2-integrins also display reduced adhesiveness due to the TTT/AAA mutation). Functional annotational clustering analysis<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> of genes which were upregulated in both migratory and knock-in DCs further (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Dataset 3</xref>) further revealed that genes encoding for proteins involved in small GTPase signal transduction (such as Arhgef40, Rabgap1l, Net1, Rap2b), zinc-finger containing proteins (Cbl-b, Trim24 etc) and certain cell adhesion proteins (VCAM-1) were common to both types of cells. In contrast, genes encoding for proteins of certain other cellular pathways, such as macromolecule catabolic processes (some ubiquitin ligases and caspases), were not upregulated in KI DCs but were upregulated in migratory cells. Of the genes that were upregulated in both migratory and KI DCs, small GTPases such as Rap2 and cell adhesion proteins such as VCAM-1 are well known to regulate cell migration, and Cbl-b has been previously described as a negative regulator of beta2-integrin-mediated adhesion<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Therefore, it appears that the non-adherent knock-in DCs had switched on a transcriptional program characteristic of DC populations which have matured and migrated to lymph nodes. Thus, the integrin-kindlin link, which is essential for DC adhesion to the environment, is crucial for restricting the DC maturation program.</p><p id="P17">To investigate whether switching on a transcriptional program characteristic of migratory DCs influenced knock-in DC behavior <italic>in vivo</italic>, we investigated numbers of DCs in lymphoid organs in beta2<sup>TTT/AAA</sup>-integrin knock-in mice. We found that there were indeed significantly increased numbers of CD11c+ MHC class II+ DCs in the spleen and peripheral lymph nodes of knock-in animals compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Specifically, numbers of migratory CD11b+ and CD103+ DCs were increased in knock-in lymphoid tissues, whereas numbers of CD8+ and CD8&#x02212; resident DCs were unaffected by the TTT/AAA mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). T and B cell numbers in lymph nodes were normal in na&#x000ef;ve knock-in mice<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and in immunized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>), but DC numbers in lymph nodes were increased in both resting and immunized knock-in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). In addition, knock-in splenic DCs from both resting and immunized mice displayed significantly increased expression of CD86 <italic>in vivo</italic>, and a trend towards elevated CD40 expression, although this did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Importantly, following administration of fluorescent OVA antigen into the skin, we found increased numbers of OVA+ DCs in the draining lymph nodes 24hrs later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). Therefore, loss of the beta2-integrin-kindlin-3 link in DCs induces a switch to a mature phenotype <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and induced DC migration to lymph nodes and/or increased survival of KI DCs.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Integrin-kindlin-actin links regulate DC maturation</title><p id="P18">Maturation of DCs is well known to be associated with reduced adhesion and changes in cell morphology<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, and we found that LPS maturation of DCs indeed significantly reduced adhesion to integrin ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). To investigate whether loss of functional integrins was responsible for induction of DC maturation in beta2<sup>TTT/AAA</sup> integrin knock-in cells, we analyzed signaling and maturation status in beta2-integrin null DCs. Similar to the beta2<sup>TTT/AAA</sup> integrin knock-in DCs, p-Syk and p-Akt levels were elevated in GM-CSF-stimulated beta2-integrin null DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). These cells also expressed more MHC class II, CD80, CD86 and CD40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>), and produced more IL-12p40 (in response to GM-CSF and LPS) and IL-10 (in response to LPS) than WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). These data indicate that the elevated signaling in knock-in DCs is due to the absence of functional beta2-integrins.</p><p id="P19">We next directly assessed the role of integrin-ligand interactions in the regulation of signaling and maturation of DCs by comparing adhered WT DCs to WT DCs which were detached and placed in tubes. The results show that p-Syk and p-p38 levels were elevated in the detached cells compared to adhered cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). The expression of the co-stimulatory markers CD80, CD86, CD40 and MHC class II by WT DCs was significantly increased in detached cells compared to adhered cells when stimulated with GM-CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). Additionally, production of IL-12p40 and IL-10 was increased in detached cells compared to adhered cells following GM-CSF and LPS stimulation, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). Together, these results indicate that beta2-integrin-mediated ligand binding regulates signaling and maturation in myeloid DCs. To confirm this, we investigated IL-12 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>) and CD86 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5I</xref>) by WT and knock-in DCs plated on different substrates, e.g. beta2-integrin substrates (petri dishes and ICAM-1), a beta1-integrin substrate (fibronectin) and tissue culture plates (unspecific substrate). As the knock-in mutation is in the beta2-integrin tail, knock-in DCs are not expected to display any abnormality when plated on a beta1-integrin substrate. Indeed, knock-in cells on beta2-integrin substrates displayed elevated maturation, whilst knock-in DCs on beta1-integrin substrates displayed similar activation to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H-I</xref>). These results indicate that WT beta2-integrin-mediated ligand binding and/or ligand-reinforced integrin tail interactions provides suppressory signals to the GM-CSF receptor complex, which are lost in KI DCs, and that ligand-induced beta1-integrin-mediated signals can compensate for the deficiency in function of beta2-integrins in KI cells.</p><p id="P20">To directly assess the role of adhesion (rather than integrin-kindlin-3 contacts) in regulation of DC signaling, we further investigated whether Mn<sup>2+</sup>, a traditional extracellular activator of integrin-mediated adhesion, could rescue KI DC adhesion and at the same time suppress signaling. Although Mn<sup>2+</sup> treatment of cells did not result in a formal rescue of adhesion, low amounts of Mn<sup>2+</sup> did result in a slight increase in KI DC adhesion to ICAM-1 and iC3b (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5A</xref>), but IL-12 production and CD86 expression were increased rather than decreased after Mn<sup>2+</sup> treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5B</xref>). These results show that increased adhesion alone, without integrin/kindlin links, was not sufficient to reduce GM-CSF receptor signaling in cells; rather, the integrin/kindlin link is required for integrins to suppress GM-CSF receptor signaling in DCs.</p><p id="P21">The cortical actin cytoskeleton is known to restrict receptor movement and signaling in immune cells<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Integrin cytoplasmic domains are important in linking the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton, and therefore play pivotal roles in actin organization. In addition, the integrin TTT/AAA mutation significantly perturbs integrin-mediated actin reorganization in cells<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Therefore, we investigated the subcellular localization of the beta2-integrins, kindlin-3 and the GM-CSF receptor in DCs. A significant amount of beta2-integrin, kindlin-3, talin and the GM-CSF receptor were localized to the cytoskeletal fraction of WT DCs, but the TTT/AAA-mutation of the integrin abolished these associations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>), indicating that the integrin-kindlin link is essential for actin recruitment of beta2-integrins and cytokine receptors. Levels of another membrane receptor, CD9, (a tetraspanin which mediates MHC II lateral associations in DCs<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>) were equivalent in WT and knock-in cytoskeletal fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>), indicating that not all cell surface receptors are regulated in this way. To test whether the loss of the integrin-actin link is responsible for the increased signaling in knock-in DCs, cells were treated with cytochalasin D to disrupt actin filaments. Cytochalasin D treatment of WT DCs resulted in up-regulation of p-Syk and p-MAPK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>), as well as an increase in CD86 and CD40 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>), and in IL-12p40 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). Together, these data indicate that ligand-reinforced integrin-actin interactions, regulated through kindlin-3, are necessary for the regulation of GM-CSF receptor signaling in DCs, and for the regulation of downstream effects including DC maturation.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Syk is partly responsible for the mature DC phenotype</title><p id="P22">Levels of p-Syk were elevated in beta2<sup>TTT/AAA</sup>-integrin knock-in DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). To investigate the role of Syk in the elevated DC activation status we made use of the selective Syk inhibitor II<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> and a p38 inhibitor (SB203580). Syk inhibition of WT DCs in suspension resulted in a reduction of both co-stimulatory marker expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>) and cytokine production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>), confirming that these activation properties of DCs are controlled by GM-CSF-induced Syk activity. Meanwhile, p38 inhibition in WT DCs reduced CD80 expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>) and IL-10 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>), but not CD86, CD40, MHC class II or IL-12p40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A-B</xref>), suggesting that the p38 signaling pathway downstream of Syk regulates CD80 and IL-10 in GM-CSF-stimulated DCs. In addition, Syk inhibition in both beta2-integrin knock-in and null DCs resulted in a partial reduction of IL-12p40 and IL-10 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>), showing that the active phenotype of knock-in DCs is due, in part, to elevated Syk activity. Together, these results reveal that integrin/kindlin-mediated signals negatively regulates downstream GM-CSF receptor signaling in DCs, mediated through Syk, which in turn regulates the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and production of cytokines.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Beta2-integrin knock-in DCs induce elevated Th1 responses</title><p id="P23">&#x0201c;Muted&#x0201d; DC activation has been associated with Th2 responses, whilst conventionally matured (TLR-activated) DCs generally promote Th1/Th17 responses<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>.

As such, beta2-integrins have been described to negatively regulate TLR and interferon signaling in macrophages<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. In addition, active beta2-integrins in DCs and macrophages inhibit their priming of T cells<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Mechanisms by which beta2-integrins negatively regulate signaling are emerging. CD11b-induced Syk activation has been proposed as a mechanism to negatively regulate TLR signaling in macrophages<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, and indirect mechanisms involving the signaling inhibitor A20 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 have also been described<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. However, the CD11b-integrin has also recently been reported to instead <italic>positively</italic> regulate TLR4 signaling in endosomes in DCs (as opposed to macrophages), and to be required for TLR4-triggered responses <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. In contrast, in this study, we describe that ligand-reinforced beta2-integrin tail interactions with kindlin-3 and cytoskeletal coupling negatively regulate DC maturation through restricting GM-CSF receptor signaling. Therefore, in DCs, ablating beta2-integrin-mediated cytoskeletal organization (through mutation of the kindlin-binding site in the integrin, or beta2-integrins themselves) results in a strikingly different phenotype than ablating the CD11b integrin subunit alone, likely reflecting redundancy between different beta2-integrins in DCs, as DCs express (at least) CD11a- and CD11c-chains in addition to CD11b.</p><p id="P27">Interestingly, we found that the integrin/kindlin connection also restricts GM-CSF receptor signaling in neutrophils. Neutrophilia is a significant symptom in murine models with defects in adhesion molecules<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>; our data suggests that increased GM-CSF receptor signaling in these cells may contribute to the significant neutrophilia found in these mouse models.</p><p id="P28">Intriguingly, ablating the beta2-integrin/kindlin-3 interaction - results in DC maturation to a migratory phenotype, increased DC trafficking to lymph nodes, and increased T cell priming <italic>in vivo</italic>. Reprogramming of DCs to a mature, migratory phenotype by loss of integrin/kindlin links implies that beta2-integrins contribute to immune homeostasis by restricting DC maturation in tissues until migration and maturation is required. Does loss of ligand-induced integrin signals contribute to DC maturation/migration also under physiological conditions? Interestingly, migratory DCs found in lymph nodes express less beta2-integrins than their tissue counterparts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Dataset 3</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>, indicating that under steady state conditions, beta2-integrins are indeed down-regulated when cells migrate to lymph nodes, possibly through a cell-intrinsic effect during the DC life cycle. We speculate that beta2-integrins, which are not required for DC migration to lymph nodes in steady state<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, instead mediate DC interactions with their extracellular environment in peripheral tissues, which <italic>restricts</italic> their migration to lymph nodes. Loss of ligand-binding due to integrin down-regulation reprograms DCs and contributes to migration to lymph nodes under steady-state conditions. In addition, it is well described that during DC maturation due to external stimuli, such as TLR stimulation, adhesion is downregulated and the cell morphology and actin cytoskeleton is fundamentally altered<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>, and the cells become more migratory<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>, and we show here that adhesion to integrin-ligands is indeed reduced in LPS-matured DCs. Therefore, maturation-induced loss of ligand-binding and/or cytoskeletal coupling may promote DCs to switch on the transcriptional program that allows for their migration to lymph nodes and for the subsequent activation of T cells.</p><p id="P29">The elevated maturation status in DCs lacking beta2-integrin-mediated cytoskeletal organization was mediated by increased GM-CSF receptor signaling. The membrane skeleton is essential for controlling signaling in resting immune cells<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> and integrins act as links or integrators between the cell exterior and the cell cytoskeleton in cells<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. They would therefore be well positioned for forming &#x0201c;pickets&#x0201d; in the &#x0201c;picket-fence&#x0201d; model of the plasma membrane, and for restricting movement of receptors in the plasma membrane<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. We propose that ligand-reinforced integrin- kindlin- linkages fundamentally restrict the movement of the actin-linked GM-CSF receptor (and possibly other receptors or adapter proteins) at the DC plasma membrane, thereby limiting downstream signaling, a function of integrins in immune cells that has not previously been appreciated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). We further show that increased GM-CSF receptor-induced Syk signaling is, in part, responsible for the elevated activation phenotype in these knock-in DCs. TLR responses were also elevated in knock-in DCs, although TLR signaling did not further activate Syk in these cells. Interestingly, a complex between the beta-common chain of IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSF receptors and the ITAM-containing Fc receptor &#x003b3;-chain has been previously described, leading to recruitment of Syk to the IL-3 receptor in basophils<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>; a similar mechanism may be at play in DCs and neutrophils. The exact mechanism(s) of integrin-mediated regulation of signaling receptors in DCs need to be established in future studies.</p><p id="P30">A striking result from this work was that beta2<sup>TTT/AAA</sup>-integrin knock-in DCs, which displayed an elevated activation state, induced elevated Th1 responses <italic>in vivo</italic>, whilst Th2 priming was impaired.

We show that increased Syk signaling resulted in elevated DC activation and increased IL-12 production by knock-in DCs, which may explain why these cells were poised to induce Th1, rather than Th2, immune responses <italic>in vivo</italic>, through counter-regulation of Th2 activation. In contrast, other Th1 polarizing factors, such as CD70<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>, although more highly expressed in knock-in DCs, were expressed at very low levels and therefore were unlikely to contribute to the Th1 polarization by the knock-in DCs. Also, IRF4, a transcription factor in DCs that has recently been described to be essential for Th2 development<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>, was not different between WT and knock-in cells. However, the GM-CSF-cultured knock-in DCs produced more CXCL10, a chemokine which has been shown to be involved in DC-dependent Th1 responses <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>; CXCL10 production was also dependent on Syk. Th17 priming by the knock-in DCs was normal, likely reflecting the observation that production of IL-6, the key cytokine that drives Th17 differentiation in this model<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>, was minimally affected by the knock-in mutation.</p><p id="P31">Beta2-integrins have been shown to promote tolerance<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, suppress colitis and dermatitis<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> and protect against endotoxic shock<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, consistent with regulatory and homeostatic roles of these integrins in immune responses <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Beta2-integrins, therefore, play dual roles in the immune system as they influence both the recruitment of leukocytes to sites of inflammation, as well as the regulation of inflammatory responses by restricting signaling in myeloid cells when they interact with their environment.

All FITC-conjugated antibodies were used at 1:100 dilution, and all other antibodies were used at 1:200 dilution. Fc block (clone 2.4G2, BD Biosciences, 1:100 dilution) was included in all stains. Propidium iodide or DAPI (Sigma) were added immediately before acquisition on an LSR Fortessa flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Data was analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar, OR, USA).</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Immunoblotting</title><p id="P42">DCs were lysed in 1% Tx-100, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 10 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 50 mM NaF, and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Alternatively, DCs were fractionated into subcellular fractions using a subcellular protein fraction kit (Thermo Scientific, NH, USA) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Primary antibodies against the following proteins were used (Cell Signaling, unless otherwise stated): p-JAK2, p-STAT5, p-Syk, p-p38, p-Erk, p-Akt, Akt, Src, Syk, beta-actin, beta2-integrin (Abcam, MA, USA), GM-CSF receptor beta-common chain (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA), kindlin-3 (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA), talin, CD9 (BD Biosciences). After incubation in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, blots were developed by standard chemiluminescence techniques. All uncropped blots are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>RNA preparation and Next-generation sequencing</title><p id="P43">RNA was prepared from DCs cultured from 3 WT and 3 knock-in mice using the NucleoSpin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel). RNA samples were analyzed by the Finnish Microarray and Sequencing Centre (Turku, Finland) after the quality of RNA was checked using the Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Sequencing of samples was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2500 using 1 &#x000d7; 50 bp runs on single-end libraries.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Selection of differentially expressed genes</title><p id="P44">All Sequencing data in the fastq format was analyzed using the Chipster General User Interface<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>. Sequences were trimmed at the 5&#x02019;end (minimum score 20) and filtered with a maximum length of 50 bp using PRINSEQ<sup><xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup>. Reads were aligned using TopHat2<sup><xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> onto the Mouse genome (mm10) for each sample (total genes 37315) and the aligned reads per gene were counted using HTseq. Differential expression analysis was performed by negative binomial distribution using edgeR<sup><xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> and DESeq<sup><xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup> software. Common genes chosen by both these software packages were chosen and those genes which had an expression level of less than 10 RPKM (Reads per kilobase per million reads) in at least one of the up-regulated samples were discarded. This left a total of 855 genes expressed higher in WT DCs and 862 genes expressed higher in knock-in DCs.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Comparison with resident and migratory DCs</title><p id="P45">Differentially expressed genes from migratory and resident DCs identified from a previous microarray study<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> were downloaded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary dataset 3</xref>). Genes which were represented more than once through multiple Microarray probes were combined and genes without an ENSMUS number were removed.
