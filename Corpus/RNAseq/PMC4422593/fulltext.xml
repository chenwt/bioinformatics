The mechanisms underpinning such host-restricted intracellular adaptations are poorly understood, in part, due to a lack of appropriate model systems. Here we explore the potential of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived macrophages (iPSDMs) to study such pathogen interactions. We show iPSDMs express a panel of established M&#x003c6;-specific markers, produce cytokines, and polarise into classical and alternative activation states in response to IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-4 stimulation, respectively. iPSDMs also efficiently phagocytosed inactivated bacterial particles as well as live <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhi and <italic>S</italic>.

Furthermore, iPSDMs can provide a flexible and practical cellular platform for assessing host responses in multiple genetic backgrounds.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Wellcome Trust funding to GD.

Despite overall similarities, there are subtle variations in published methods; such as iPSCs can be cultured either on a monolayer of feeder cells in the presence of animal serum; or on a layer of extracellular matrix component in a serum-free defined media. Similarly, EBs can be generated utilising either 10cm<sup>2</sup> dishes, 96 well plates or AggreWells; and myeloid precursors can be generated by culturing EBs in serum free X-vivo media or serum supplemented media. Here we systematically compared the impact of these subtle variations in terms of yield of iPSDMs, and established a relatively simple experimental protocol that generates high number of iPSDMs.</p><fig id="pone.0124307.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0124307.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Directed differentiation of M&#x003d5;s from human iPSCs.</title><p>A) A schematic diagram showing specific culture conditions required for each differentiation step from iPSCs to generation of M&#x003d5;s; as well as phase contrast photomicrographs of each differentiation step (B).

Approximately similar numbers of EBs were divided into two groups and further cultured in either serum free X-vivo media or serum-containing advanced DMEM/F12 media supplemented with IL-3 and M-CSF. Two weeks after transferring the EBs into myeloid differentiation media non-adherent myeloid precursors started accumulating in the media. The numbers of these precursors were counted every week and the expression of the haematopoietic lineage marker CD34 and myeloid lineage marker CD14 were assessed by flow cytometry. We observed that in the initial weeks a relatively homogeneous population of cells accumulated in these cultures that are morphologically smaller (assessed by microscopy and forward and side scatter of FACS), express CD34 but lack CD14. These immature haematopoietic precursors failed to generate any iPSDMs in subsequent culture in the higher M-CSF concentration (data not shown). However, after a few weeks a separate precursor cell population appeared that were larger, had dendrite like structures and expressed both CD34 and CD14 on their surface. The percentage of these larger CD34+CD14+ myeloid precursors was directly correlated with yield of iPSDM <bold>(<xref rid="pone.0124307.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A, 2B and 2C</xref>)</bold>. To further characterise these two precursors, we FACS sorted these two populations and placed them separately into macrophage differentiation culture. After 7 days CD14+ larger precursors attached onto tissue culture plastic and developed a characteristic spindle shaped morphology of macrophages, whereas CD34+ smaller precursors did not convert into macrophages, became apoptotic and did not survive in M-CSF containing media (<bold><xref rid="pone.0124307.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref></bold>).Thus, we show that the formation of EBs by different methods has no significant impact on the frequency of myeloid precursors and the subsequent yield of mature M&#x003d5;s. However, the presence of serum in myeloid differentiation media significantly compromised the differentiation of myeloid precursors from EBs. Therefore, in all subsequent experiments X-vivo serum free media was used to differentiate EBs into myeloid precursors.</p><fig id="pone.0124307.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0124307.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Effects of foetal calf serum on generation of macrophage progenitors.</title><p>(A) Forward and side scatter of myeloid precursor cells collected at different time points show a time dependent accumulation of larger granular cells (depicted in p3 gate in blue) that correlates with number of matured M&#x003d5;s obtained in subsequent differentiation steps.

Furthermore, these cells did not detectably express activation markers such as HLA-DR and CD86, indicating that the differentiation protocol allows them to fully mature but does not significantly immunologically activate them <bold>(<xref rid="pone.0124307.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>)</bold>.

The ability to generate high numbers of relatively homogeneous M&#x003d5; cells with different genetic backgrounds and over extended periods should be of general value to the community working in this area of research. A number of factors emerged from this comparative study. The inhibitory effect of foetal calf serum on differentiation of myeloid precursors was striking. This could be due to high levels of latent TGF-&#x003b2; in foetal calf serum that are known to be a potent inhibitor of myeloid development [<xref rid="pone.0124307.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The iPSDMs expressed established phenotypic markers of resting M&#x003d5;s and induced selective activation markers after classical and alternative activation. Furthermore, iPSDMs efficiently phagocytosed inactivated bacterial particles and produced inflammatory cytokines in response to specific TLR agonists. Cytokine response was generally more robust in iPSDMs compared to THP-1 M&#x003d5;s indicating the potential utility of iPSDMs in immunological studies. Direct comparison of iPSDMs and THP-1 M&#x003d5;s showed that both cells internalised and supported productive infections of <italic>S</italic>. Typhi and <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium but activated iPSDMs exhibited a strikingly higher cytokine response and more efficiently killed these Salmonella compared to THP-1 M&#x003d5;s.</p><p>Although <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium and <italic>S</italic>. Typhi are members of the same species, they show striking differences in host specificity and pathogenesis. Whilst <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium infections are generally associated with self-limiting acute gastroenteritis in a broad range of hosts; <italic>S</italic>. Typhi is significantly host-restricted to human and is associated with the systemic disease typhoid. Interestingly, isolates representative of these two serovars induced different patterns of cytokines in both types of M&#x003d5;s, as well as different patterns of invasion and killing [<xref rid="pone.0124307.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Genetic differences between these isolates are most likely responsible for their immunological and virulence phenotype. <italic>S</italic>. Typhi can express the Vi polysaccharide capsule, which has been shown to inhibit phagocytic uptake by M&#x003d5;s and modulate IL-10 production [<xref rid="pone.0124307.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, the iPSDM model described here can recapitulate several hallmarks of Salmonella interactions with M&#x003d5;s and also reflected subtle differences in cellular responses to these related serovars.</p><p>Host and pathogen factors that contribute to species restriction and intracellular adaptations of <italic>S</italic>. Typhi are poorly defined. Since pluripotent (ES and iPS) stem cells are particularly amenable to genetic manipulation, M&#x003d5;s derived from mutant iPSCs can be utilised to study specific gene function during infection; or genome-wide mutant libraries can be screened to discover new candidate genes involved in host defence against Salmonella and potentially other human adapted pathogens. Monocyte-derived M&#x003d5;s are the most accessible primary M&#x003d5; population and are regarded as a gold standard in human M&#x003d5; research, but these bone marrow-derived patrolling population are not true representatives of tissue resident mature M&#x003d5;s that originate from primitive haematopoietic precursors in early embryonic life and locally self-renew within adult tissues [<xref rid="pone.0124307.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. There is significant phenotypic and functional heterogeneity among tissue resident M&#x003d5;s and pathogens often show tropism for specific tissue resident M&#x003d5; populations. Currently, options are limited to study pathogen interactions with tissue resident M&#x003d5; populations. iPSC derived <italic>in vitro</italic> haematopoiesis resembles primitive haematopoiesis, and iPSDMs share phenotypic similarities with embryo-derived M&#x003d5;s [<xref rid="pone.0124307.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In future, as our knowledge matures about specific signals and transcription factors that regulate development of tissue resident M&#x003d5;s, iPSDMs can be further reprogrammed into specific tissue resident populations. Some success is already achieved in developing selected tissue M&#x003d5; populations [<xref rid="pone.0124307.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124307.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>In summary, iPSDMs are a flexible system to study host/pathogen interactions, especially human adapted pathogens. Furthermore, iPSDMs can provide a flexible and practical cellular platform for assessing host response in multiple genetic backgrounds. We also conclude that iPSDM approaches provide a novel genetically tractable and physiologically relevant cellular system that can be used to study fundamental macrophage biology beyond host pathogen interactions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Drs Ludovic Vallier, Foad Rouhani, Christina Ortmann and Sally Cowley for supplying cell lines, sharing the protocols and helpful comments.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0124307.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>PR</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Martinez-Pomares</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Stacey</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>HH</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>GD</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal> (<year>2005</year>) <article-title>Macrophage receptors and immune recognition</article-title>. <source>Annu Rev Immunol</source><volume>23</volume>: <fpage>901</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>944</lpage>. <?supplied-pmid 15771589?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15771589</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0124307.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Asrat</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>de Jesus</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hempstead</surname><given-names>AD</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ramabhadran</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Isberg</surname><given-names>RR</given-names></name> (<year>2014</year>) <article-title>Bacterial Pathogen Manipulation of Host Membrane Trafficking</article-title>. <source>Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol</source>. <volume>30</volume>: <fpage>79</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>109</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100913-013439">10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100913-013439</ext-link></comment>
