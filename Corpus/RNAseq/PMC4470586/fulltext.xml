Currently, oncologists lack diagnostic tests to determine which chemotherapy regimen offers the greatest chance for response in an individual patient. Here we present the results of gene expression analysis for two genes, ERCC1 and TS, measured with the commercially available ResponseDX: Colon assay (Response Genetics, Los Angeles, CA) in 41 patients with de novo metastatic colon cancer diagnosed between July 2008 and August 2013 at the University of California, San Diego. In addition ERCC1 and TS expression levels as determined by RNAseq and survival data for patients in TCGA were downloaded from the TCGA data portal. We found that patients with low expression of ERCC1 (n = 33) had significantly longer median OS (36.0 vs. 10.1 mo, HR 0.29, 95% CI .095 to .84, log-rank p = 9.0x10<sup>-6</sup>) and median time to treatment to failure (TTF) following first line chemotherapy (14.1 vs. 2.4 mo, HR 0.17, 95% CI 0.048 to 0.58, log-rank p = 5.3x10<sup>-4</sup>) relative to those with high expression (n = 4). After accounting for the covariates age, sex, tumor grade and ECOG performance status in a Cox proportional hazard model the association of low ERCC1 with longer OS (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.26, p = 0.0448) and TTF (HR 0.16, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.21, p = 0.0053) remained significant. Patients with low TS expression (n = 29) had significantly longer median OS (36.0 vs. 14.8 mo, HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.074 to 0.82, log-rank p = 0.022) relative to those with high expression (n = 12). The combined low expression of ERCC1/TS was predictive of response in patients treated with FOLFOX (40% vs. 91%, RR 2.3, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test p = 0.03, n = 27), but not with FOLFIRI (71% vs. 71%, RR 1.0, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test p = 1, n = 14). Overall, these findings suggest that measurement of ERCC1 and TS expression has potential clinical utility in managing patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>American Society of Clinical Oncology: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.asco.org">www.asco.org</ext-link>, Young Investigator Award to J.P.S., Marsha Rivkin Center for Ovarian Cancer Research: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.marsharivkin.org">www.marsharivkin.org</ext-link>, Scientific Scholar Award to J.P.S., United States National Institutes of Health: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov">www.nih.gov</ext-link>, R01 ES014811 to T.I., U24 CA184427 to T.I.

The introduction of new cytotoxic and targeted agents for patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) has improved overall survival (OS) rates, with expected median survival now in excess of 20 months with many patients surviving beyond two years[<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The current treatment paradigm consists of 5-Fluorouracil based regimens in combination with either oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or irinotecan (FOLFIRI), potentially combined with therapy targeting either EGFR or VEGFR [<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Prior large, prospective clinical trials have shown that when used as first line therapy options, response rates (RR) for either FOLFOX or FOLFIRI are around 55% [<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Currently, oncologists have limited diagnostic tools to predict which first line chemotherapy option is best for an individual patient. Choice of first line therapy is of great importance in mCRC as it has been shown that patients who respond to first line therapy have longer OS[<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and some of these patients with oligometastatic disease can proceed to undergo metastatectomy with curative intent[<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Many potential predictive biomarkers for mCRC have been reported using a variety of molecular data types [<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These markers include the mutation status of KRAS[<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126898.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], BRAF [<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126898.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and TP53[<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Other prognostic markers include microsatellite instability (MSI)[<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126898.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) copy number[<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], 18q allelic imbalance, TP53 expression as well as the expression levels of Thymidylate Synthase (TS) [<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126898.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and Excision Repair Cross-Complementation Group 1 (ERCC1) [<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126898.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, outside the exception of KRAS mutation status predicting response to the anti-EGFR antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab, the demonstrated clinical value of other biomarkers has been limited [<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126898.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>ERCC1 and TS expression levels have been previously described as potentially promising biomarkers in mCRC [<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. ERCC1 is known to be involved in the nucleotide excision and repair pathway, a part of the cellular response to DNA damage. Patients with low levels of ERCC1 expression have been reported to have an improved response and a longer OS in gastrointestinal tumors treated with FOLFOX [<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. TS is an enzyme responsible for the generation of deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTMP), which is needed for the formation of the nucleic acid thymine. Most notably, TS is the target of the commonly used antimetabolite 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). TS gene expression has been shown to be predictive of response to 5-FU-based therapy in patients with mCRC [<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Low levels of TS have also been correlated with improved response rate and OS in patients treated with FOLFOX, but had no prognostic value in patients treated with FOLFIRI [<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126898.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126898.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Because gene expression is a continuous variable, for diagnostic purposes it is important to establish a threshold level that defines a population with high expression and a distinct population with low expression. For ERCC1, threshold values have been suggested based on response to platinum-based chemotherapy in colon, gastric, head/neck, bladder and non-small-cell lung cancer [<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Specific to mCRC, the CONFIRM-1 and -2 trials included 122 patients with mCRC and established the clinical utility of existing thresholds for high vs. low ERCC1 and TS gene expression as measured by qPCR and normalized against actin[<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In those studies, patients with high TS and/or high ERCC1 showed shorter OS of 15.6 months compared to 37 months in patients who had low expression levels of both genes.</p><p>In view of these data, we have incorporated at our institution routine measurement of ERCC1 and TS expression as part of standard care for mCRC patients. Here we review our single institution cohort of patients with de novo mCRC as well as a cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to assess the clinical utility of ERCC1 and/or TS expression gene expression levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study Design</title><p>For this study, we performed a retrospective analysis on two cohorts of patients with known ERCC1 and TS expression levels. Treatment time to failure (TTF) to first line chemotherapy was chosen as primary end point. Secondary end points included objective response rate (ORR) to therapy and OS. TTF was calculated from the start of treatment with either FOLFOX or FOLFIRI until clinical or radiologic evidence of progression. OS was calculated from the time of initiation of treatment until death from any cause. ORR was calculated as the sum of complete or partial responses, determined by improvement in either serial imaging or serial biomarker measurement. Eligibility criteria were defined as follows: Pathological diagnosis of mCRC, first line of treatment with either FOLFOX-6 or FOLFIRI, imaging with computed tomography (CT) within at most three months of the start of therapy. The exclusion criteria included prior adjuvant chemotherapy, advanced comorbidities defined as a recent myocardial infarction or unstable angina, uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes mellitus, hepatic or renal failure. Patients with incomplete or unavailable clinical records were also excluded. Patients treated with concurrent bevacizumab or cetuximab in addition to cytotoxic chemotherapy were included in the analysis. The UCSD Institutional Review Board approved this study. Given its retrospective nature it represented no more than minimal risk to the subjects, therefore per the Code of Federal Regulations on the Protection of Human Subjects a waiver of informed consent was granted. Data for TCGA cohort were obtained from the Genome Data Analysis Center (GDAC) Firehose website. All data were downloaded from the 15 January 2014 standard data and analyses run.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Molecular Analysis</title><p>The ResponseDX: Colon assay includes quantitative PCR to measure gene expression for ERCC1, TS, and VEGFR as well as specific mutations. Extracted DNA was used to detect mutations in exon 2 of KRAS using PCR with primers specific to known mutations[<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The threshold values for the normalized gene expression measurements used to stratify patients into high or low expression groups were 4.0 and 1.73 for TS and ERCC1, respectively.

Kaplan&#x02013;Meier functions were used to estimate the survival probabilities. Gene expression measurement for TCGA patients was performed using RNAseq, as described[<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Because there was no prior established threshold for ERCC1 or TS levels measured by RNAseq, for TCGA cohort the mean value of ERCC1 and TS was used as threshold.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Analysis of TTF and OS curves were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and reported as hazard ratio (HR), significance of differences between groups was assessed using the log-rank method.

Differences in ORR are reported as relative risk (RR), significance was tested using 2-sided Fisher&#x02019;s Exact test. Cox multiple regression analysis of TTF and OS was used to assess the contribution of age, sex, tumor grade, and ECOG performance status.

FOLFOX and FOLFIRI, the two major backbone chemotherapy regimens used to treat mCRC have been shown to have equivalent response rates when averaged across a large cohort of mCRC patients[<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, given the tremendous molecular diversity between different individual colon tumors[<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], presumably there are subsets of tumors more likely to response to one regimen than the other. However, for patients with metastatic colon cancer, currently the majority of cytotoxic chemotherapy is given without any biomarker to predict response. It was the goal of this study to investigate whether molecular data from the commercially available gene expression and mutation panel ResponseDx Colon could be used to predict response and TTF to first line therapy.</p><p>Our study design was inherently limited by its retrospective design and modest sample size, and was further limited by the smaller than expected number of patients with high ERCC1 expression. It should be noted we used previously established cutoffs for ERCC1 and TS[<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Due to these limitations the study was powered to detect only particularly large magnitudes of effects with statistical significance. Despite these limitations, an observation of potential clinical importance can be made that patients with low levels of both ERCC1 and TS had a remarkably high response rate of 91% (20/22) to FOLFOX. It is difficult to make a direct comparison to the FOLFIRI response rate of 71% (5/7) given the small sample size, however if these response rates are confirmed in larger studies this finding would suggest that in the absence of contraindications to platinum therapy, FOLFOX may be the preferred first line of treatment in these patients. These patients with low ERCC1 and TS expression had a significantly longer TTF relative to patients with high expression for either or both genes regardless of whether they were given first line FOLFOX or FOLFIRI, suggesting dual low expression of ERCC1/TS could be a marker of general chemo-sensitivity rather than specifically platinum sensitivity.</p><p>The twelve patients with tumors expressing high levels of either TS or ERCC1 trended towards worse response rate relative to those with dual low expression. The magnitude of difference would be clinically significant if confirmed in larger studies, however due to limited sample size it did not reach statistical significance in this study. Interestingly the response rate to FOLFIRI was the same for tumors with dual low expression and those with high expression of either or both ERCC1 or TS. In contrast, the response rate to FOLFOX was only 40% (2/5) for tumors with high expression of either or both ERCC1 or TS. Although conclusions drawn on a sample of this size should be treated with caution, these results support FOLFIRI as first line chemotherapy for tumors with high expression of either ERCC1 or TS. With similar caution we report the dismal prognosis of the four patients with high expression of both ERCC1 and TS, having TTF of only 2.4 months and OS of 10 months. There were no patients with high ERCC1 and low TS, so the relative contribution of ERCC1 and TS to this observed poor prognosis cannot be assessed in this study. There was only one patient with high ERCC1 and high TS in our cohort who was treated with FOLFIRI, and this patient did not respond, potentially suggesting that the concomitant elevation in ERCC1 and TS expression confers resistance to multiple types of chemotherapy.</p><p>We examined the association of ERCC1 and TS expression with OS in TCGA pan-cancer and mCRC cohorts to see if the observed trends would generalize to these independent cohorts. For ERCC1 there was a slight trend toward worse OS with high expression in both pan-cancer and mCRC cohorts, the magnitude of which was exaggerated in patients treated with platinum chemotherapy. This finding is consistent with the known function of ERCC1 in DNA repair following platinum therapy. For TS there was significantly worse OS with high expression in the TCGA pan-cancer cohort, but this effect was not seen in the mCRC cohort.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential utility of ERCC1 and TS gene expression as prognostic and possibly predictive biomarkers in mCRC, consistent with prior studies [<xref rid="pone.0126898.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It identifies a population with poor prognosis (high ERCC1/TS expression) as well as a population with a remarkably high response rate to FOLFOX chemotherapy (low ERCC1/TS expression). In the future the prognostic and predictive value of ERCC1 and TS expression should be examined the context of a larger prospective clinical trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec013"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0126898.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Patient Characteristics.</title><p>Table showing demographic, histologic, molecular, and treatment data for the 41 patients included in the UCSD cohort.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0126898.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Research funding to P.F. in part through the generous support of Arthur Athans in the name of his wife, Barbara Mae Athans.
