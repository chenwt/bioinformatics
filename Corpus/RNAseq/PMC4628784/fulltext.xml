While many studies have interrogated well known and annotated genes in DLBCL, none have yet performed a systematic analysis to uncover novel unannotated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) in DLBCL.

Long read single molecule sequencing supports the splicing structure of many of these lncRNAs. More than one-third of novel lncRNAs are differentially expressed between the two major DLBCL subtypes, ABC and GCB. Novel lncRNAs are enriched at DLBCL super-enhancers, with a fraction of them conserved between human and dog lymphomas. We see transposable elements (TE) overlap in the exonic regions; particularly significant in the last exon of the novel lncRNAs suggest potential usage of cryptic TE polyadenylation signals. We identified highly co-expressed protein coding genes for at least 88&#x000a0;% of the novel lncRNAs. Functional enrichment analysis of co-expressed genes predicts a potential function for about half of novel lncRNAs. Finally, systematic structural analysis of candidate point mutations (SNVs) suggests that such mutations frequently stabilize lncRNA structures instead of destabilizing them.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Discovery of these 2,632 novel lncRNAs in DLBCL significantly expands the lymphoma transcriptome and our analysis identifies potential roles of these lncRNAs in lymphomagenesis and/or tumor maintenance.

These studies identified two main DLBCL subtypes - activated B-cell like (ABC) and germinal center B-cell (GCB) &#x02013; associated with distinct clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. They also identified involvement of other signatures, for example, a stromal signature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These studies used microarray to measure gene expression and therefore only interrogated well-known and annotated genes. Additional recent studies used transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to look for gene fusions and deregulated pathways in DLBCL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>In theory, RNA-seq data can be examined to look for novel, yet unannotated, transcripts. While it is generally thought that most of the proteins coding genes encoded in the human genome have been discovered, many yet unannotated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are thought to exist. LncRNAs are a type of ncRNA that are at least 200&#x000a0;bp long and are spread across the intergenic regions in the genome. Based on recent studies, some of these lncRNAs, despite being non-coding, are shown to play critical roles in disease specific epigenetic gene regulation, including in cancer biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. For example, several lncRNAs interact with the Polycomb complex (PRC1/PRC2) to promote repression of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The discovery of novel lncRNAs is challenging for a number of reasons, including their frequent low expression, the algorithmic and statistical complexity of <italic>de novo</italic> discovery. Nonetheless, these challenges are being overcome and several groups have performed systematic analysis of lncRNAs in normal cells and also in primary tumors. A recent cross-cancer study by the Chinnaiyan group uncovered thousands of novel lncRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Another study by the Maher group identified a large number of novel lncRNAs in lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we sought to discover and characterize novel lncRNAs in DLBCL using a <italic>de novo</italic> transcript discovery strategy based on RNAseq of primary DLBCLs and normal B cell samples. We performed a systematic analysis of 116 tumors and used stringent filtering based on conventional characteristics of lncRNAs in terms of coding properties, length, exon counts, and expression levels to identify high-confidence novel lncRNAs. We identified a total of 2,632 novel DLBCL lncRNAs. Subsequently, we applied a broad range of analyses to these lncRNAs to further understand their function. For example, we looked for lncRNAs co-expressed with PRC2 components such as <italic>EZH2</italic> to identify potential PRC2 interaction partners. We analyzed the network of co-expressed protein coding genes to identify a potential function for each lncRNA. We inspected the local genomic neighborhood of lncRNAs to look for functional enrichment. We analyzed the correlation between lncRNAs and disease features such as tumor subtypes (ABC vs. GCB), DLBCL super-enhancers and how mutations in lncRNAs may impact their function. For the first time, a cross-species analysis of lncRNAs was performed and&#x000a0;we found that a non-negligible fraction of human DLBCL lncRNAs is also expressed in canine lymphoma. We also identified novel features of lncRNAs, such as their significant overlap with transposable elements, especially within the last exon. Altogether, these analyses strongly suggest that novel DLBCL lncRNAs are functionally embedded within lymphoma gene networks and play important roles in lymphomagenesis and/or maintenance of the lymphoma phenotype. At a time where antisense oligonucleotides are starting to demonstrate clinical potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] this study provides a wealth of potential new anti-lymphoma pharmacological targets. The conservation of some of these lncRNAs in dogs suggests a potential route for developing anti-lymphoma strategies based on dog therapeutic trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Data</title><p>Computational analysis was performed on multiple sets of RNAseq data, including 116 TCGA dbGAP DLBCL tumor samples (dbGaP accession number phs000235.v6.p1 &#x02013; dbGaP approval for this specific project was granted). The eight normal B-cell (four na&#x000ef;ve B cells and four germinal center B cells) samples were obtained from a previous study dataset (GEO dataset: GSE45982) and 30 DLBCL cell lines (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) were obtained from the Melnick lab. The na&#x000ef;ve B cells (from tonsillar na&#x000ef;ve B cells) and centroblast (from tonsillar germinal center B cells) were treated by magnetic bead cell separation and the total RNA was extracted for RNA-seq using Qiagen kits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Polyadenylated RNA-seq was performed using the standard Illumina Truseq kits and samples were sequenced using HiSeq2000 with one to three samples per lane.

This consensus transcriptome was parsed to filter out any previously annotated transcripts such as known protein coding genes and known lncRNAs. A consensus dataset of known annotations was created using protein coding gene annotations from UCSC, GencodeV17, RefSeq, and Ensembl, while known lncRNA annotations were obtained from Human lncRNA catalog-Broad institute.

Filtering was done for coding potential, transcript length, and number of exons. Coding Potential Assessment Tool (CPAT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] was used to compute the coding potential for each transcript. Given a FASTA input, CPAT uses logical regression model based on ORF size, Fickett score, and hexamer usage bias. Based on these, CPAT predicts each transcript&#x02019;s coding property and assigns a coding potential score in the range of 0&#x02013;1, with CPAT score &#x0003c;0.364 assigned for non-coding transcripts and &#x0003e;0.364 for protein-coding transcripts. The length of each non-coding transcript was also obtained from the results of CPAT, which was used in filtering for transcript length, selecting long sequences (&#x0003e;&#x02009;=&#x02009;200&#x000a0;bp). An in-house script was used to count the number of exon per transcript from the assembled unannotated transcripts GTF and those with at least 2 exons or more were included for analysis. A final novel lncRNA GTF was then created with the filtered in transcript fragments. Using the novel lncRNA GTF as reference, novel lncRNA candidates were quantified for FPKM levels in all samples in DLBCL tumor, normal B cells, and DLBCL cell lines, using CuffLinks. Based on the obtained FPKM levels, each lncRNA expressed in at least two or more samples were established as the selected novel lncRNA candidates and used for all further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Divergently transcribed lncRNAs</title><p>LncRNAs transcribed in an opposite orientation from the identified nearest protein-coding gene.

Partial or complete exonic overlaps were only considered as valid overlaps. Another tool, RepeatMasker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], was used to obtain sequence based overlap of TE with novel lncRNA for lncRNAs, giving the TE-derived percentage. Dividing the base-by-base TE overlap for a transcript by the total length of that transcript returned the TE-derived percentage.

RNA-Seq reads from a cohort of 116 primary DLBCL tumor samples (dbGaP accession number phs000235.v6.p1) were aligned to human reference using an RNA-seq aligner (STAR) and were then subjected to <italic>ab initio</italic> transcript assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We also processed eight normal B cell RNA-seq samples (four na&#x000ef;ve B cells and four germinal center B cells) using the same analysis. The initial transcript sets were merged and only those transcripts that do not overlap any previously annotated protein-coding gene or known lncRNAs according to annotations from known gene databases (UCSC, GencodeV17, RefSeq, Ensembl, Human lncRNA catalog-Broad institute) were retained (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). This set of novel candidate lncRNAs was put through further stringent filtering based on established properties of a lncRNA, including coding potential, transcript length, and exon numbers, to obtain a specifically characterized group of lncRNAs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Novel candidate lncRNAs were first checked for coding potential to determine if they held coding properties, using CPAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. LncRNAs which passed the CPAT coding potential score cutoff (&#x0003c;0.364) for non-coding genes, were selected for further analysis. Out of the non-coding transcripts, we selected transcripts with length of 200&#x000a0;bp or greater. Since it is possible that <italic>de novo</italic> assembly may have improperly assembled artefactual background noise, un-spliced pre-mRNA or gene extensions, only multiexonic transcripts were selected for further analysis. After applying these stringent filters, we were left with 2,913 novel DLBCL/normal B cell lncRNAs. We quantified the expression levels of these 2,913 lncRNAs in all tumors and all normal B cell samples and only retained lncRNAs that have expression (FPKM &#x0003e;0.1) in at least two or more samples in each of the sample groups. The FPKM threshold was chosen after analyzing the known lncRNAs, which show comparable levels of expression and other previously published lncRNA analysis in other cancers which also used FPKM cutoff of &#x0003c;0.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This analysis led to 2,632 lncRNAs expressed in tumors and 941 lncRNAs expressed in normal B cell samples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).

<italic>De novo</italic> transcript discovery identifies 2,632 novel lncRNA in DLBCL tumors. <bold>a</bold> A well-organized pipeline was used to discover and obtain candidate lncRNAs. Using aligned 116 tumor and eight normal B cell samples, the transcriptome was reassembled using CuffLinks in <italic>de novo</italic> mode. A cohort of the assembled transcripts for each sample was then created using CuffMerge and parsed out for novel unannotated transcripts using CuffCompare, given a consensus reference of all known annotations from various sources &#x02013; UCSC, RefSeq, ensemble, and GencodeV17. Initially we discovered 40,258 unannotated novel transcripts. <bold>b</bold> Stringent filtering steps applied to the initially discovered novel transcripts to remove artefactual novel lncRNAs, based on selection of non-coding transcripts using CPAT, transcript length, and exon count. Post these, expression level filtering (FPKM&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.1 in two samples or more) across each sample group was performed, respectively. <bold>c</bold> GENEID coding potential score was used to validate the coding potential comparing known LncRNAs, novel lncRNAs, and protein-coding genes.

This showed novel lncRNAs to emulate the low average coding potential score of the known lncRNAs in comparison to the higher average coding potential score characterizing the protein coding genes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). We also verified that our novel lncRNAs follow similar length density distribution of known lncRNAs (even though they tend to be longer) and are on average shorter than protein-coding genes (t-test, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;2.2e-16) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Finally, we compared the number of exons of our lncRNAs with the numbers for known lncRNAs and protein-coding genes: the novel lncRNAs emulate known lncRNAs, with the majority of them between 2 and 4 exons, while protein-coding genes have a much larger exon count (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). When we counted how many lncRNAs are expressed in each tumor, we found that many lncRNAs were expressed in a few tumors while a smaller number were expressed across a large number of tumors (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). When we compared our 2,632 novel lncRNAs with those uncovered by Iyer <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] in 27 tissues and cancer types but not in B cell lymphomas, we only found 17&#x000a0;% overlap suggesting that the vast majority of our DLBCL novel lncRNAs are DLBCL specific (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S1).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Many of the novel DLBCL lncRNAs are tumor-specific</title><p>We further sought to subdivide the 2,632 tumor-expressed lncRNAs based on their expression in normal B cells and DLBCL cell lines. In the latter case, we quantified expression levels of the 2,632 lncRNAs in a panel of 30 DLBCL cell lines. As before, a lncRNA was considered expressed if at least two samples within the cell line group had expression &#x0003e;0.1. Altogether, we found that 763 lncRNAs are expressed in tumors and cell lines but not in normal B cells. Across the normal B cell subtypes &#x02013; we found that 718 lncRNAs of the 2,632 novel lncRNAs are expressed in centroblasts (FPKM &#x0003e;0.1 in two or more samples) and 575 in na&#x000ef;ve B cells. We also found that only 927 lncRNAs were expressed both in tumors and normal cells. Out of these 927 lncRNAs, 334 were significantly differentially expressed across the two normal subtypes &#x02013; na&#x000ef;ve B Cells and GCB (FDR &#x0003c;0.05) and clustering (supervised clustering, using hclust function; method ward) based on the lncRNAs recapitulated the respective sample groups (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S2).

For example, we noticed that a small but significant fraction of our lncRNAs (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;166) are transcribed divergently (see <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>) from nearby protein coding genes, such as <italic>RELA</italic> (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S4), perhaps contributing to regulating their gene expression. To expand on this analysis, we first examined the function of genes located nearby novel lncRNAs in the genome by using the computational tool GREAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. GREAT analysis using Gene Ontology revealed gene functions in the vicinity of novel lncRNAs were related to immune cell activation and differentiation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Analysis using a disease-oriented ontology revealed that novel lncRNA neighborhoods are enriched with lymphoma or other immune cell malignancy genes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). This suggests that novel DLBCL lncRNAs are not randomly located in the genome but preferentially located near genes with key functions in B cells and malignant B cells, perhaps contributing to the regulation of the function and expression of these genes.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Integrative analysis reveals potential functions of DLBCL specific novel LncRNAs. <bold>a</bold> Biological processes GO ontology from GREAT, shows enrichment for various B cell and lymphoma-related pathways based on the nearby genes possibly regulated by the novel lncRNA. <bold>b</bold> Disease ontology from GREAT also shows lymphoma-specific disease pathways enriched based on gene in proximity to the novel lncRNAs. <bold>c</bold> Example of some lncRNAs with significant <italic>P</italic> values (Boniferroni, <italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c;0.05) which possibly regulate the functional pathways related to CD40- shown here with number of co-expressed protein coding genes for each, the related CD40-functional pathway, the subset of those co-expressed genes present in the pathway gene set. <bold>d</bold> Example of a significantly positively correlated lncRNA expression with <italic>EZH2</italic> expression across DLBCL tumor samples. <bold>e</bold> Example of significantly negatively correlated lncRNA expression with <italic>EZH2</italic> expression across DLBCL tumor samples</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13073_2015_230_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p>To further explore the potential function of novel lncRNAs we performed a systematic co-expression analysis with known protein-coding genes. Correlating each lncRNA expression to known protein coding gene expression generated sets of significantly co-expressed (Spearman correlation; FDR &#x0003c;0.2) genes for each novel lncRNA (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>). About 88&#x000a0;% of the lncRNAs showed significant correlation with at least one protein-coding gene. We performed pathway analysis on the set of co-expressed protein coding genes for each lncRNA using Gene Ontology and lymphoid biology gene sets from the Staudt lab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Overall, 43&#x000a0;% of the lncRNAs with co-expressed protein coding genes showed enrichment for at least one or more specific functional pathways (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>) such as CD40 upregulation and CD40 downregulation pathways (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Reasoning that the function may in theory be transferred between co-expressed protein coding genes and lncRNAs, this means that a bit under half of our novel lncRNAs can be given at least one putative function. We then specifically examined correlations between our lncRNAs and expression of <italic>EZH2</italic>, a transcriptional repressor, implicated in tumorgenesis in DLBCL due to frequent mutations and with known interactions with lncRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Since co-expressed genes are known to be enriched for physically interacting gene products, we reasoned that positive correlations might uncover potential <italic>EZH2</italic> interaction partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] or alternatively lncRNAs regulated by the same transcriptional mechanisms as EZH2.

In a siRNA knockdown analysis of EZH2 in four DLBCL cell lines - OCI-Ly7, Farage, SUDHL5, and WSUDLCL2, 182 of the lncRNAs negatively correlated with EZH2 were seen as upregulated (log2 fold change siEZH2/ control &#x0003e;1). This number was significantly higher than expected by chance according to the hypergeometric test (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.011), supporting the hypothesis that many lncRNAs negatively co-expressed with EZH2 may indeed be repressed by EZH2. Similar analysis with <italic>BCL6</italic> expression across tumors resulted in 323 negatively correlated lncRNAs (FDR &#x0003c;0.2). In a siRNA knockdown analysis of <italic>BCL6</italic> in OCI-LY1 DLBCL cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], 104 of these lncRNAs were also seen to be upregulated (log2 fold change siBCL6/siNT &#x0003e;1) at 24&#x000a0;h time point <italic>BCL6</italic> knockdown, while 48 of them are upregulated (log2 fold change siBCL6/siNT &#x0003e;1) at a 48&#x000a0;h time point knockdown of <italic>BCL6</italic>.

Increasing the overlap threshold to 10&#x000a0;bp we found similar TE overlap of approximately 90&#x000a0;%. Overall, nearly half (53&#x000a0;%) of the lncRNA transcript sequences are TE-derived, that is 53&#x000a0;% of lncRNA nucleotides originate from TEs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>; see <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>).

We reasoned that identifying conserved features between human and dog lymphoma lncRNAs may help underscore the importance of these features. Thirteen dog lymphoma samples were aligned to the dog genome (CanFam3), put through <italic>de novo</italic> transcript assembly and filtered to obtain multiexonic transcripts, similar to the novel lncRNA pipeline we used for human DLBCL analysis. For a uniform comparison across human and dog genomes, the Liftover tool was used to convert human novel lncRNAs to the dog genome coordinates and BEDTools was used to assess overlap.

Upon further filtering of variants found in our eight normal B cell RNA-seq samples (analyzed with the same parameters), we were left with 9,447 tumor-specific candidate mutations. This analysis suggests that lncRNAs may harbor frequent mutations (SNV) in DLBCL. We note, however, that this analysis is limited by the absence of matched normal comparators for our RNA-seq cases and that it cannot be excluded that some of these SNVs are in fact rare germline SNPs or sequencing errors. Out of these novel 9,447 SNVs, about 60&#x000a0;% of them re-occurred in at least 10&#x000a0;% of the tumor samples. A hotspot analysis, to find mutation frequency over a window of 100&#x000a0;bp, revealed 1,805 mutation hotspots with at least six or more mutations (either from independent samples or from the same sample). This suggests significant clustering of mutations in novel lncRNAs. We then wondered whether putative mutations in these lncRNAs would stabilize or destabilize the lncRNA secondary structure, leading to dysregulation of possible target genes and pathways. A Minimum Free Energy Score (MFE) was calculated for the native lncRNA sequence and the corresponding lncRNA sequence with one or more novel mutations using the tool RNAfold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and difference in MFE was calculated for each lncRNA. While many mutations did not seem to show any change in the MFE post mutation, a shift was evident toward stabilization of secondary RNA structures due to the positive difference in the MFEs of the original lncRNA and the mutated lncRNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9a</xref>).

We found that a majority of our novel DLBCL specific lncRNAs seemed to have significant correlations with known data sets (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">14</xref>), which suggests many of these discovered novel lncRNA potentially hold regulatory functions in DLBCL. H3K4me3 density (obtained by ChIPseq in a DLBCL cell line) at and around the predicted TSS of these lncRNAs shows a similar pattern compared to known protein coding genes, indicating their potential roles as active genes. These analyses provide a strong validation for the potential role and activity of these lncRNAs in DLBCL tumorgenesis and possibly tumor maintenance. Gene correlations with protein-coding genes show a large fraction (&#x0003e;80&#x000a0;%) of lncRNAs to be significantly co-expressed with at least one gene, suggesting potential co-regulation of genes not only nearby but also in the distant genome and their strategic positioning along these potent co-regulated genes. A significant number (43&#x000a0;%) of our lncRNAs show enrichment for important DLBCL-related functional pathways based on the co-expressed protein coding genes. Studying some of these pathways should provide insight on the specific functions of these lncRNAs and their roles. Some of these lncRNAs also expressed in cell lines, make them tractable targets to be studied in future experimental testing, for example to identify their tumor driver role or their regulatory functions.</p><p>In accordance with previous studies, our findings show lncRNAs to have a significant amount of overlap with transposable elements, which we hypothesize, may help define the regulatory functions for some of these novel lncRNAs. The preferential last exon overlap may also suggest a role for repeat element in birth of new genes, perhaps as a result of polyadenylation signals contained in these repeat sequences.</p><p>Finally, while previous studies have identified novel lncRNAs across specific cell types, to our knowledge, none have performed a cross species analysis of their lncRNAs in canine lymphomas. A cross-species reference in dog lymphomas additionally strengthens our claim for the existence of lymphoma specific lncRNAs and may facilitate focused anti-lncRNA therapeutic trials in dogs.</p><p>Finally, a number of supporting evidences point to a potential driver role for at least some of our novel lncRNAs. First we find that several lncRNAs are highly expressed in only a few tumor samples, reminiscent of aberrant over-expression due to gene fusions. We discovered many novel mutations in the exonic regions of these novel lncRNAs and subsequent analysis suggests that these mutations may frequently stabilize the lncRNAs secondary structures; this suggests frequent gain of regulatory function due to increased lncRNA stability, perhaps reinforcing epigenetic deregulation linked with lymphomagenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This exhaustive analysis of novel lncRNAs in DLBCL using RNA-seq from primary tumors, uncovers novel lncRNAs with our validations suggesting their potential regulatory roles and functions in DLBCL tumorgenesis. The cross-species analysis cross-validates the existence of these lymphoma specific lncRNAs and could potentially serve as a basis for future lymphoma clinical trials in Dogs. In addition to expanding the DLBCL transcriptome, these lncRNAs also provide abundant source of new targets for antisense oligonucleotide pharmacology.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec24"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13073_2015_230_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
