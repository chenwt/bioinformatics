However, to identify such therapies it is essential to determine the genomic and transcriptional alterations present in one tumor relative to control samples. This presents a challenge since use of a single sample precludes many standard statistical analysis techniques. We reasoned that one means of addressing this issue is by comparing transcriptional changes in one tumor with those observed in a large cohort of patients analyzed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). To test this directly, we devised a bioinformatics pipeline to identify differentially expressed genes in tumors resected from patients suffering from the most common malignant adult brain tumor, glioblastoma (GBM). We performed RNA sequencing on tumors from individual GBM patients and filtered the results through the TCGA database in order to identify possible gene networks that are overrepresented in GBM samples relative to controls. Importantly, we demonstrate that hypergeometric-based analysis of gene pairs identifies gene networks that validate experimentally. These studies identify a putative workflow for uncovering differentially expressed patient specific genes and gene networks for GBM and other cancers.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>1R01NS067289.

Importantly, this heterogeneity necessitates genome and transcriptome analyses of each tumor individually in the hopes of discovering patient specific therapies <xref rid="pone.0115842-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, discovering patient&#x02013;specific transcriptional alterations is difficult given the low patient sample size (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1). This is especially true when using RNA sequencing given the discordance of different RNA-Seq alignment and analysis algorithms when sample size is small <xref rid="pone.0115842-Seyednasrollah1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>One possibility to increase the available sample size is to utilize transcriptome data in publicly available databases as a reference. For instance, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has performed gene expression microarray analysis in over 400 GBM patients examining them using two different platforms (Agilent and Affymetrix). Thus, it is possible to use these data as a reference set, to compare the RNA sequencing results from a single tumor sample and identify differentially expressed genes and gene networks. Utilizing a novel bioinformatics pipeline we were able to perform a patient-specific analysis of the GBM transcriptome based on the overlap between our RNA-Seq data and the TCGA GBM data. This approach allowed us to identify and filter out potential artifacts due to low sample size.</p><p>In this report we identified a patient specific list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which can be used as input for multiple types of analyses including gene co-expression networking. Genes that co-express across multiple samples are often implicated in similar functions <xref rid="pone.0115842-Stuart1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and many disease-associated genes have been discovered through co-expression network analysis <xref rid="pone.0115842-Horvath1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Most methods used in previous studies are based on the calculation of correlation coefficients (usually Pearson) of gene pairs as an indication of co-expression. Furthermore, either weighted <xref rid="pone.0115842-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> or unweighted <xref rid="pone.0115842-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> processes involving the proposed connections between genes are used to determine the significance thresholds for assigning a connection between any two nodes (i.e., genes) in the resulting network. Our studies suggest that utilizing correlation and hypergeometric tests identifies experimentally validated gene connections, which can potentially assist in discovering patient specific therapies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>RNAseq quality control and genome mapping</title><p>We performed whole transcriptome sequencing on two GBM tumors (GBM17 and GBM31) and two control samples from epileptic patients using the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform.

Focusing on patient specific transcriptionally expressed genes, we compared the transcriptome of each tumor individually with the two controls. In order to ameliorate the increased uncertainty of the different algorithms due to low sample size <xref rid="pone.0115842-Seyednasrollah1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, we used four, rather than one, differential expression tools (baySeq, Cuffdiff, EdgeR and DESeq), as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref> Section. As expected, the four algorithms yielded mostly non-overlapping lists of differentially expressed genes. We defined a given gene as &#x02018;differentially expressed (DE)&#x02019; if at least three of the four algorithms called the gene as differentially expressed. By performing this type of analysis, we identified 1,081 DE genes for GBM17 and 967 genes for GBM31, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115842-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115842.s001">S1 Fig</xref>.).</p><fig id="pone-0115842-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0115842.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Pipeline for identifying patient-specific gene association in GBM.</title><p>Our first step in our pipeline is to identify Differentially Expressed (DE) genes that are represented in 3 out of 4 algorithms.

We then calculate the Correlation Coefficient and a hypergeometric p-value for every gene pair. Finally, by selecting the gene pairs with the highest correlation values we create a patient specific gene correlation network, which can be experimentally verified. As a starting point for our experiments, we can use the sub-networks in which, already verified connections exist in the literature.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0115842.g001"/></fig><p>In order to assess whether these results represent the phenotype of interest (GBM) or individual sample variability, we compared our RNA sequencing results to results from a greater number of samples, namely, the TCGA microarray dataset. Previous studies have shown that RNA-Seq results can be compared to those derived from microarrays <xref rid="pone.0115842-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0115842-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0115842-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. We created a TCGA DE gene list by comparing TCGA patients and TCGA controls. In order to avoid any platform specific biases, we selected only TCGA patients (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;433) and controls (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10) that were analyzed with both microarray platforms (Agilent and Affymetrix). When we examined these data, we found that 5,200 genes were found by both platforms to be DE and concordant, i.e, <italic>not</italic> upregulated in one platform and downregulated in another platform. Of these 5,200 DE genes, we found that 585 are DE in GBM17 and 514 are DE in GBM31 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115842.s001">S1 Fig</xref>.). In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115842.s002">S2 Fig</xref>. we can see that when using the consensus of at least 3 algorithms, the number of common DE genes between our RNAseq data and the TCGA data remains relatively the same. On the other hand, when only one algorithm was taken into account, the number of overlapping genes (between RNAseq and TCGA) was greatly dependent on the fold change threshold selection. Therefore, we opted for the 1.2 fold change threshold, in an attempt to obtain a high and significantly relevant number of genes.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Identifying Gene Pairs and Networks Using Hypergeometric Test Analysis</title><p>As acquired drug resistance is one of the main reasons for the ineffectiveness of current glioblastoma treatment, the identification and simultaneous inhibition of multiple therapeutic targets is essential for identifying effective combination therapies. However, the large genetic variation among glioblastoma tumors necessitates a more patient-specific approach when identifying potential therapeutic targets. For this, we tried to create gene networks based only on genes that were DE in that specific RNA-Seq sample. After determining the DE genes for each sample, and &#x02018;filtering&#x02019; or selecting those that are also DE in the TCGA data, we searched for any significant co-expression among these patient-specific DE genes in the TCGA data. Our hypothesis was that if there were any functional association between gene pairs, then this association could be observed based upon their co-expression in the TCGA population. We utilized two methods to identify co-expression. First, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) was used to determine if the expression level of one gene could be indicative of the expression level of the second gene. Next, a hypergeometric test was used to calculate the probability of a pair of genes being both DE in a specific number of patients by chance. Gene pairs with a low p-value indicate the tendency of these genes to be DE together in a higher number of patient samples than we would expect by chance. For every gene pair, we plotted both its PCC and its hypergeometric probability in the TCGA population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115842.s001">S1 Fig</xref>.). Our results indicate that pairs of genes that are DE in a larger proportion of patient samples also have more highly correlated expression values across the total TCGA GBM cohort. Finally, as outliers heavily influence the PCC, we calculated the Spearman Correlation Coefficient for every gene pair as well. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115842.s003">S3 Fig</xref>. we found that gene pairs with high PCC also have a very high Spearman Correlation Coefficient, indicating that the PCCs we calculated were generally not the byproduct of outliers.</p><p>As our aim was to define patient-specific and glioblastoma-relevant gene networks, we used the most statistically significant gene pairs in each RNA-Seq sample in order to reconstruct the networks. Our most significant gene pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115842.s005">S1 Table</xref>) consisted of the ones that had a PCC above 0.7 and were in the lowest 40% of the range of the hypergeometric log<sub>10</sub> scale ([&#x02212;46.15, &#x02212;27.69] for GBM17 and [&#x02212;44.72, &#x02212;26.83] for GBM31). These gene pairs were selected for each patient sample separately and were imported to Cytoscape <xref rid="pone.0115842-Cline1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> where the network was created. In order to verify the functional relevance of these networks, we employed the STRING9.1 Protein-Protein Interaction Platform <xref rid="pone.0115842-Franceschini1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. STRING 9.1 can take into account a variety of sources in order to reconstruct networks out of a given gene list. For our study, we only chose the conservative options of searching in Databases, Experiments and Text-mining. To ensure the accuracy of the text-mining algorithm, we manually verified the text mining output. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115842-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, there is overlap between the networks created from our pipeline and gene associations indicated by STRING 9.1. To examine whether the hypergeometric test yielded greater experimentally verified interactions, we kept the PCC filter (&#x0003e;0.70) constant but varied the hypergeometric test p-values. As before, we compared our gene networks with curated interaction data via STRING 9.1.

We therefore reasoned that the gene networks robustly uncovered by the bioinformatics pipeline described above would potentially include the interactions of DE genes involved in signaling or epigenetic pathways. To test this, we created a discrete gene list consisting of 464 genes (through KEGG Pathways) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115842.s007">S3 Table</xref>) that encoded for either epigenetic modulators, or genes implicated in the Notch, Shh and Wnt Pathways.

These studies yielded potential interactions of signaling pathways or epigenetic regulators with GBM patient specific DE genes.</p><fig id="pone-0115842-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0115842.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Correlation networks identified that intersect epigenetic pathways/signaling pathways with patient specific DE genes.</title><p>Connections were calculated for gene-gene pairs emanating from epigenetic pathways or genes in the Notch, SHH, or WNT pathways and genes that were Differentially Expressed in each patient.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0115842.g004"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Combination therapies that effectively disrupt multiple pathways are likely to reduce GBM recurrence. However, identifying these therapies is contingent upon uncovering patient-specific genomic and transcriptomic alterations. One major issue is how to generate robust analytical results from gene expression data when sample size is low. To circumvent this problem, we elected to employ multiple different RNA-Seq algorithms and compare the results common to most algorithms with results based on the transcriptional profile of over 400 GBM tumors analyzed by TCGA. With this approach, we identified genes that not only were differentially expressed in our patient specific sample but also were differentially expressed in a significant number of TCGA patient samples. These true positive genes were subsequently used to create gene co-expression networks to identify any potential functional similarity. By using a hypergeometric test in addition to the PCC, we identified experimentally validated gene-gene interactions.</p><p>One gene network that has been experimentally verified in multiple biological contexts is the highly conserved MCM (Mini-Chromosome Maintenance) network containing the DNA replication licensing factors MCM2, MCM3, and MCM7. We identified this network as overexpressed in GBM sample 31. With the hypergeometric test, we detected a high probability of the MCM subunits to be overexpressed in the same patient samples in the TCGA dataset and were able to distinguish them from other gene pairs that only showed a high correlation coefficient (but little co-occurrence within patients). Importantly, the MCM pathway has been implicated in multiple cancers including GBM <xref rid="pone.0115842-Lei1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0115842-Erkan1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Thus, our pipeline can be utilized to identify DE gene-gene interactions and networks in GBM that have a higher likelihood of validation relative to interactions and networks identified by correlation alone.</p><p>The stringency of our filtering of the DE genes from any given patient, however, is likely to also yield false negatives. For instance, we chose to only explore DE genes that were detected in at least 3 out of 4 RNA-Seq algorithms, which may have excluded some true positives. It may be informative to use other statistical methods in addition to the hypergeometric test to determine whether there are alternative approaches that would also yield results that are enriched for experimentally verified gene networks. In addition any proposed pipeline will involve subjective choices of thresholds and criteria for significance. We have made reasonable choices, but it is possible that moving to nonparametric and permutation-based results to establish a more systematic approach to threshold selection could lead to pipeline improvements. Nonetheless, our studies identify a robust method for identifying patient-specific gene networks, which can inform the design of effective combination therapies.</p><p>We implemented this method to identify potential targets for combination therapies involving epigenetic pathways and the Notch, SHH, and WNT pathways. Our recent studies and those from other laboratories suggest that epigenetic pathways contain attractive new therapeutic targets in GBM <xref rid="pone.0115842-Clarke1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0115842-Pastori1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Similarly, the Notch, SHH, and WNT pathways are implicated in GBM cell growth and have been linked to epigenetic pathways <xref rid="pone.0115842-ArzateMejia1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Thus, we reasoned that identifying interaction nodes between either signaling pathways or epigenetic modulators and DE genes could lead to potential synergy in reducing tumor growth. We identified possible nodes of interaction among epigenetic and signaling pathways using our pipeline. Interestingly, we identified possible interaction of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 with the MCM proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115842-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). However, these interactions have not been experimentally verified according to STRING 9.1. Nonetheless, they may exist in some GBM patients as DNMT1 has been shown to be a potential GBM therapeutic target whose inhibition leads to an increase of several tumor suppressor genes <xref rid="pone.0115842-Foltz1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0115842-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0115842-Fanelli1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Future studies will experimentally verify whether drug combinations that target these gene-gene networks are useful clinically for treating GBM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0115842.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><p><bold>Overlap of DE genes calculated by 4 RNAseq Algorithms (EdgeR, Bayseq, Cufflinks, DEseq).</bold> We analyzed genes that were shown to be DE by at least 3 out of the 4 algorithms (* symbol).
