on plant growth, diversity and ultimately global food security. Thus, focused
efforts to fully understand plant response to stress are urgently needed in order to
develop strategies to cope with the effects of climate change. Because
<italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> holds a key evolutionary position bridging the gap
between green algae and higher plants, and because it exhibits a well-developed
stress tolerance, it is an excellent model for such exploration. Here, we have used
<italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> to study genome-wide responses to abiotic stress
through transcriptomic analysis by a high-throughput sequencing platform. We report
a comprehensive analysis of transcriptome dynamics, defining profiles of elicited
gene regulation responses to abiotic stress-associated hormone Abscisic Acid (ABA),
cold, drought, and salt treatments. We identified more than 20,000 genes expressed
under each aforementioned stress treatments, of which 9,668 display differential
expression in response to stress. The comparison of <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic>
stress regulated genes with unicellular algae, vascular and flowering plants
revealed genomic delineation concomitant with the evolutionary movement to land,
including a general gene family complexity and loss of genes associated with
different functional groups.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> (<italic>P. patens</italic>) represents an important model
plant species for understanding evolutionary dynamics of genes involved in different
cellular processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Because mosses represent an evolutionary stage
linking green algae to vascular plants, studies on extant mosses can yield insights on
the evolution of plant responses to various environmental challenges and perturbations.
Plant growth and yield potential are significantly influenced by various abiotic
stresses caused by limited water availability on land, strong irradiation by sunlight,
and varying temperatures. These stresses necessitate extensive modifications in
signaling and physiological processes to modify body plans and activate complex
regulatory networks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, which consist of transcriptional as well as
post-transcriptional regulators<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Although the importance of abiotic
stress signaling is recognized, some molecular components remain unknown. Additional,
in-depth studies are needed to understand the species&#x02019; response to
environmental factors limiting growth and development under non-ideal conditions.</p><p>The abiotic stress-associated hormone, Abscisic Acid (ABA) is a major player in mediating
the adaptation of plants to stress and functions in many plant developmental
processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. For instance, ABA is required for the induction of genes
as a response to dehydration stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. While the transcriptional
regulation of ABA response pathways has been intensively studied in seed plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, the knowledge on ABA mediated gene expression in <italic>P. patens</italic> is
currently restricted to the conserved ABA-mediated activation of ABA-responsive
<italic>cis</italic>-elements (ABRE)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Freezing or exposure to extremely low
temperature constitutes a key factor influencing plant growth. Freezing stress at
temperatures below 0 &#x000b0;C and chilling stress at non-freezing temperatures by
which chilling tolerance is induced in plants is known as cold acclimation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Sun <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> and Beike <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> have shown that cold acclimation in <italic>P. patens</italic> displays distinct
differences in some aspects when compared to higher plants, suggesting significant
alterations during the evolution of land plants.</p><p>Dehydration tolerance is an adaptive trait thought to have been necessary for the
colonization of land by plants, and remains widespread among bryophytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. <italic>P. patens</italic> has been classified as a drought tolerant plant since it has a high
ability to recover water loss, even after a water loss of 92% on a fresh-weight
basis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. <italic>P. patens</italic> has also been classified as a halophyte; a
plant that naturally grows under high salt concentrations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. It can
maintain growth at Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations that would be detrimental to most
vascular plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p><p>However, in the field, plants are subjected to a combination of different stresses, e.g.,
drought often coincides with an increase in salinity or high temperature. Therefore,
focus on molecular, physiological or metabolic research should not be limited to the
effect of a single stress factor.</p><p>Based on EST-derived transcriptome analysis, the first microarrays were designed and used
for comparative transcriptome analyses in <italic>P. patens</italic>, focusing on the
identification of genes that respond to osmotic stress and ABA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.
The transcriptome analysis was based on EST sequences derived mainly from partially
sequenced cDNAs that are often incomplete in coding sequences and lack information from
transcripts not represented in the RNA pools. High-throughput sequencing technologies
are tremendously useful for analyzing transcriptome complexity and gene regulation. The
RNAseq approach<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> produces millions of short cDNA reads that are mapped
to a reference genome to obtain a genome-wide transcriptional map that provides greater
insight and accuracy than microarrays<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Here we used
high-throughput Illumina HiSeq sequencing system for transcriptome analysis of <italic>P.
patens</italic> under abiotic stress treatments. This identified temporal- and
stress-specific candidate genes. Phylogenetic analyses of these genes in turn elucidated
lineage-specificity of stress responses. The genes of the different expression clusters
associated with different functional categories clearly indicate the biological,
molecular and cellular events involved in <italic>P. patens</italic> stress responses.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Transcriptome sequencing and mapping of the reads to <italic>P. patens</italic>

pooled from three biological replicates for each sample was subjected to cDNA
library preparation to generate a broad survey of transcripts associated with
the <italic>P. patens</italic> stress treatments. Raw Illumina sequencing reads were
quality and adapter trimmed to yield a total of 220,031,432 short reads
comprising 22.64&#x02009;Gb of sequence data from the runs. Sequence reads
were mapped to the <italic>P. patens</italic> genome annotation V1.6, which is
480&#x02009;Mb in size with 32,272 protein-coding loci and 38,357 protein
coding transcripts annotated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Approximately 198.4 million reads,
89.79% of total reads, were perfectly aligned to the reference genome, and 91%
of those matched annotated gene regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Reads mapped to the annotated gene regions
were counted to calculate RPKM to estimate gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.
Among the mapped reads, we found nearly 9.5 and 0.11 million paired reads
located in the annotated exonic regions and across the exon-intron junctions,
respectively.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Global analysis of gene expression</title><p>One of the primary goals of RNA sequencing is to compare gene expression levels
between samples. RNAseq data were processed to calculate RPKM values, a
normalized measure of read density that allows transcript levels to be compared
both within and between samples. A total of 23,971 genes were detected in the
samples. Their expression in the four abiotic stress treatments with selected
time points (0.5 and 4.0&#x02009;h) are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig.
1a</xref>. Venn diagrams show the distribution of expressed genes from
abiotic stress treatments (ABA, cold, drought and salt) with selected time
points (0.5 and 4.0&#x02009;h) compared to the control sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary
Datasets 1&#x02013;4</xref>). Among these genes, the number of
stress-specifically expressed genes was 531 (ABA 0.5&#x02009;h), 384 (ABA
4.0&#x02009;h), 273 (ABA 0.5/4.0&#x02009;h), 499 (cold
0.5&#x02009;h), 487 (cold 4.0&#x02009;h), 468 (cold
0.5/4.0&#x02009;h), 448 (drought 0.5&#x02009;h), 381 (drought
4.0&#x02009;h), 362 (drought 0.5/4.0&#x02009;h), 662 (salt
0.5&#x02009;h), 401 (salt 4.0&#x02009;h), and 435 (salt
0.5/4.0&#x02009;h). Although there were 17,381 genes expressed among all
stress treatments and control sample, many of them were quantitatively regulated
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Dataset 5</xref>); while some of these genes had little
variation across abiotic stress treatments, suggesting they fulfill housekeeping
functions.</p><p>Hierarchical clustering was performed using Pearson&#x02019;s correlation
coefficient as a distance metric and using the average agglomeration method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. The genes were clustered according to the expression profile in
the samples. The clustering shows that the samples of ABA 4.0&#x02009;h and
control sample have a high correlation of 0.91 indicating that the variables are
positively and linearly related between these samples. Moreover, other stress
treatment samples have a correlation coefficient of 0.73 with the control, and
the variables were less related for these treatments. Generally, early and late
response time points did not cluster together, with the exception of cold
treatment, where both the 0.5 and 4&#x02009;h time points were found to
cluster together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). To investigate if this
consequence of a specific clustering strategy that was used, different
clustering methods were used based on either correlation or Euclidean distance
with complete and average linkage, the dendrograms show the clustering of the
expression profiles of stress treatments and the control sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). The results show that
control and ABA 4.0&#x02009;h tend to cluster together and salt
4.0&#x02009;h and drought 4.0&#x02009;h tend to cluster together while
the rest of stress treatments closely grouped (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Additionally,
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was preformed in order to summarize the
systematic patterns of variations in the data and the grouping of expression
profiles of each sample in the experiment. In agreement with clustering
analysis, the PCA shows that control and ABA 4.0&#x02009;h expression
profiles closely cluster, salt 4.0&#x02009;h and drought 4.0&#x02009;h
also have similar profiles, and the expression profiles of cold
0.5&#x02009;h and 4.0&#x02009;h treatments tend to cluster with ABA
0.5&#x02009;h, drought 0.5&#x02009;h and salt 0.5&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Changes in gene expression profiles of different abiotic stress
treatments</title><p>Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) were identified relative to the control
sample grown under standard conditions (see Methods). To obtain significant
differences in gene expression among the abiotic stress treatments and the
control sample, we compared the RPKM-derived read count using a Log<sub>2</sub>
Ratio calculation (a log ratio of 1 represents a 2-fold change). There were
about 17,381 genes that were expressed across all stress conditions with RPKM
values above zero. To minimize false positives, we set a relatively conservative
threshold of an RPKM value &#x02265;10. The results indicated that a set of
7,921 (ABA 0.5&#x02009;h), 9,426 (ABA 4.0&#x02009;h), 8,524 (cold
0.5&#x02009;h), 8,084 (cold 4.0&#x02009;h), 7,285 (drought
0.5&#x02009;h), 7,791 (drought 4.0&#x02009;h), 7,605 (salt
0.5&#x02009;h), 8,407 (salt 4.0&#x02009;h) and 9,668 genes across all
stress treatments without any redundancy were DEGs above RPKM 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Dataset
6</xref>).</p><p>To identify genes showing a significant change in expression among the two time
points (0.5 and 4.0&#x02009;h) we compared all DEGs across all stress
treatments. A total of 12,184 genes were up regulated and 14,800 genes were down
regulated; the number of DEGs uniquely appearing in 0.5&#x02009;h time point
was 4,911 (up regulated) and 6,702 (down regulated), while 7,273 (up regulated)
and 8,098 (down regulated) genes were uniquely appearing in the
4.0&#x02009;h time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Dataset 7</xref>). These results
suggest that the differentiation of expressed genes are exposure-time dependent
and they are more differentially expressed when the <italic>P. patens</italic> protonema
tissues are exposed to the stress treatments for 4.0&#x02009;h as compared
to 0.5&#x02009;h.</p><p>For all comparisons of pairs, a large number of DEGs were specific for a certain
stress treatment and time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Datasets 8&#x02013;11</xref>).
Among all DEGs across all stress treatments for 0.5&#x02009;h, transcripts
of 1,715 genes were induced, and 2,640 were repressed persistently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Comparison of all DEGs across all stress
treatments for 4.0&#x02009;h showed transcripts of 776 genes were induced,
and 1,529 were repressed persistently among all stress treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). All significantly induced and repressed genes
derived from pairwise comparisons were compared with each other, the Venn
diagrams depict the overlaps between each pairwise comparison.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Gene ontology and gene set enrichment analysis for DEGs</title><p>To facilitate more analysis on gene expression, all predicted <italic>P. patens</italic>
stressed-DEGs were assigned to different functional categories using Blast2GO.
The annotations were verified manually and integrated using gene ontology (GO)
classification. For all DEGs, GO term annotations were analyzed; 8,383 of the
9,668 DEGs were annotated in at least one of the three GO categories: cellular
component, biological process or molecular function; whereas 1,285 (13.29%) of
the DEGs had no available GO annotation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Datasets 6, 12&#x02013;14</xref>). Several hundreds of
genes related to translation, oxidation-reduction process, regulation of
transcription, response to stress, protein binding, and ATP binding were
enriched amongst differentially expressed genes in all stress treatments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). Some of these
functional groups were enriched with a large number of genes; metabolic process
included 3,887 genes and was a dominant group under the main category of
biological process for instance. Binding and cell functional groups comprised
4,121 and 6,214 genes, and were dominant in the main categories of molecular
function and cellular component, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Datasets 12&#x02013;14</xref>). We
also detected a large number of genes in the functional groups of cellular
process with 3,825 genes, catalytic activity with 3,466 genes, and cell part
with 6,213 genes.</p><p>The g:Profiler tool<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> was used to classify the gene set enrichment
analyses (GSEA) of <italic>P. patens</italic> stressed-DEGs for each condition (ABA, cold,
drought and salt) based on up and down regulated genes, and they were
categorized into 710 and 579 functional groups, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Datasets 15</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">16</xref>). Among these groups, the terms related to
biological process (GO:0008150), metabolic process (GO:0008152), cellular
process (GO:0009987), biosynthetic process (GO:0009058), gene expression
(GO:0010467), translation (GO:0006412) and response to stimulus (GO:0050896)
were dominant in all stress treatments. Most of these groups showed
statistically significant differences in GSEA based on GO terms (biological
process) for up and down regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). We
detected a high percentage of down regulated genes from functional groups of
single organism process (GO:0044699) in treatments of drought 0.5&#x02009;h
and cold 4.0&#x02009;h, and high percentage of up regulated genes from
functional groups of cellular metabolic process (GO:0044237) in ABA
4.0&#x02009;h and cold 4.0&#x02009;h treatments. Additionally, the up
regulated genes from functional groups of signaling (GO:0023052) were present in
ABA, cold and drought but not in salt treatments; and RNA metabolic process
(GO:0016070) functional group for down regulated genes was present only in
4.0&#x02009;h stress treatments. Interestingly, the functional group related
to response to salt stress (GO:0009651) in down regulated genes was absent in
salt 0.5 and 4&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Furthermore, it
was observed that some functional groups are present for certain stress
treatments in up regulated genes yet were absent in the same treatments for down
regulated ones and conversely. Notably, GSEA of DEGs was observed for different
functional groups involved in different pathways, which suggests that there are
considerable differences between the physiological processes among <italic>P.
patens</italic> stressed-DEGs.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The early stress response genes</title><p>Many genes display up or down regulation during early abiotic stress response
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Identifying <italic>P. patens</italic> genes that are
early regulators in stress responses and ABA signaling is critical for
elucidating abiotic stress response mechanisms.</p><p>To identify early genes strongly induced by stress treatments, we compared the
RPKM-derived read count using a Log<sub>2</sub> Ratio calculation to identify
genes representing a high fold change in stress samples as compared to the
control one at the 0.5&#x02009;h time point. There were seven genes highly
up regulated across all stress conditions at 0.5&#x02009;h with
&#x02265;50 fold change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). These highly
regulated early stress genes have distinct functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). For example,
Pp1s370_29V6.1 encodes late embryogenesis abundant protein, LEA-3. The broad
subcellular distribution of LEA proteins highlights the need for each cellular
compartment to be provided with protective mechanisms to cope with desiccation
or cold stress, and this gene might be involved in maturation and desiccation
tolerance of seeds also<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. The Arabidopsis homolog of this
transcript is involved in the salt stress pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Pp1s43_3V6.1
and Pp1s55_253V6.1 are members of the AP2/EREBP family of transcription factors;
recognize the drought-responsive element (DRE) in target promoters<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. All of these genes appear to be over represented in salt and
drought, where both of those treatments are clustered together, and less
represented in cold and ABA treatments, where there is another cluster for those
treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). There were also four genes highly
down regulated across all stress conditions at 0.5&#x02009;h with a
&#x02265;10 fold change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>) and they encode
different functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table
S3</xref>) such as beta-expansin 3 (Pp1s251_59V6.1), which has been shown to
respond to water deficiency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, and another expansin transcript
(Pp1s11_29V6.1), which is involved in plant-type cell wall organization and
perhaps morphological adaptation.</p><p>Another group of early stress response genes were predicted at high and low
expression levels based on absolute RPKM values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>,
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). These
co-expressed genes in early stress response might be lying in the same pathway.
For example, Pp1s100_117V6.1 encodes ATP synthase beta subunit protein, which
responds to oxidative stress. The acyl-CoA-binding protein 6 (Pp1s36_294V6.1)
responds to both cold and salt stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, and in agreement with

on the RPKM results, the two genes (Pp1s13_134V6.1 and Pp1s56_240V6.1) are
constitutively expressed with no significant difference among all stress

two genes were considered endogenous controls (reference genes) for qPCR data
normalization. Additionally, we designed primer pairs to specifically detect the
transcript level of 10 DEGs (up- and down-regulated) that were encoding
different functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table

levels for the 10 selected genes were differentially regulated under stress
conditions, and the expression patterns showed high degrees of concordance
between qPCR assays and RNAseq analyzed data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>).
Taken together, this independent qPCR evaluation confirms the reproducibility

Several orphans have been implicated to play a role in plant responses to the

understanding of the origins of lineage-specific genes is key to gaining
insights on how novel genes can arise and acquire functionality in different
lineages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. The presence of lineage-specific genes was a
striking and dominant feature revealed in the re-annotation of the <italic>P.

abiotic stress responsive genes in <italic>P. patens</italic> had no orthologs in other

early and late stress responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Dataset 18</xref>). Generally, they appeared to be
differentially regulated across all the stress treatments, but some genes were
differentially regulated in a specific stress treatment. For example,
Pp1s120_56V6.1 has no available GO annotation but appears to be regulated only
in ABA 4.0&#x02009;h, and Pp1s124_18V6.1 encodes anthocyanin transcriptional

Most of these groups showed statistically significant GO representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). Among these groups, the terms of response to

significant over-representation based on the obtained <italic>P-values</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). Notably,
over-representation of GO terms in <italic>P. patens</italic> orphan stressed-DEGs was
observed for different functional groups involved in different morphological,

studies. During 470 million years of divergent evolution, extant mosses and seed
plants developed different strategies for survival, leading to evolution of the
dominant gametophytic and sporophytic, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Were the
evolution of these morphological changes accompanied by changes and innovation in
new stress responses? One of the main objectives of evolutionary conservation
analysis between bryophytes, algae and angiosperms is to uncover the core networks
of processes that led to the diversity of responses observed among extant plants. By
comparative analysis of gene function in the species representing different
evolutionary steps, it is possible to differentiate between gene families that
emerged recently in the course of evolution and conserved gene families encoding
proteins with fundamental functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Our data are discussed in an
evolutionary context in order to dissect plant response strategies to stress, also
to reveal stress induced expression of moss-specific genes, which may have
contributed to the evolutionary success and survival of these poikilohydric
plants.</p><p>Adaptation to land also required the evolution of proteins that protect against
stresses. One example of this is the expansion of the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70)
family to 13 cytosolic members in <italic>P. patens</italic>, whereas all algal genomes
sequenced to date encode one single cytosolic HSP70. Our results indicated that
these members are present and expressed among all the stress treatments with
different expression levels. Some were highly expressed like: Pp1s2_216V6.1,
Pp1s351_21V6.1 and Pp1s97_279V6.1, but others like: Pp1s351_24V6.1,
Pp1s262_62V6.1and Pp1s298_26V6.1, were expressed at a low level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Dataset 5</xref>).</p><p>Dehydration tolerance in seeds is dependent on ABA to induce expression of
seed-specific genes, such as late embryogenesis abundant proteins (LEAs), a group of
proteins that accumulate during dehydration. <italic>P. patens</italic> contain orthologs of
LEA genes and other genes expressed during the abiotic stress responses. The <italic>P.
patens</italic> genome contains putative homologs of the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> ABA
receptors, such as, the transcription factor ABI5, which implicates it in the
regulation of ABA-mediated gene expression.</p><p>Our analysis identified that ABA- and drought- responsive genes include those
encoding a number of LEA proteins and a dehydration-responsive element-binding
protein (DREB) transcription factor. In <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, some
dehydration-responsive genes are activated by transcription factors mediating an
ABA-dependent pathway, which include basic-leucine zipper (bZIPs), MYC/MYB and
ABI3/VPI families that recognize specific binding sites in the promoter regions of
these genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Similarly in <italic>P. patens</italic> ABA-specific induction
operates via binding of bZIP transcription factors to ABREs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>.
Salt-induced genes have been identified in <italic>P. patens</italic> encoding regulatory
proteins such as calmodulin binding proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, a
Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, and the AP2/EREBP transcription
factor PpDBF1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. In agreement with our analysis, a high number of
salt-specifically expressed genes have been identified and a large number of
salt-DEGs were expressed after 0.5 and 4.0&#x02009;h exposure to
350&#x02009;mM NaCl, including the aforementioned genes. In plants, once primary
sensors perceive a low-temperature signal, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are
activated and cytosolic levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase triggering the
activation of proteins which provide cellular protection such as the activation of
the LEA family genes and the expression of cold-regulated genes (COR)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. The activation of the related signal transduction pathway will result in the
accumulation of osmoprotectants like sugars, amines and compatible solutes which
eventually lead to membrane stabilization and altered gene expression to provide
protection at all levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Our results indicated ABA-responsive
genes in <italic>P. patens</italic> were induced when treated with salt and cold, which
suggests the involvement of these genes in response to multiple stresses. Such
cross-talk can be mediated by calcium, a second messenger, which increases during
the various abiotic stresses and induces the signaling pathway and consequently the
expression of various genes that have a role in maintaining the cell
homeostasis.</p><p>Orphans may be defined as genes with coding sequences utterly unique to the species;
in other words, genes that presumably produce previously novel proteins. However,
every evolutionary lineage harbors orphan genes that lack homologues in other
lineages and whose evolutionary origin is poorly understood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.
Considering the high number of orphan genes among the persistent stressed-DEGs
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>) we conclude
an important role of species- or lineage- specific genes in the acquisition of
abiotic stress tolerance in mosses. Species- or lineage- specific genes could also
be responsible for poikilohydry, as this phenomena is also noted in many forms of
algae.</p><p>Because the majority of DEGs representing these processes have orthologs in other
Viridiplantae, we conclude that basic molecular mechanisms of abiotic stress
responses may occur in the gametophyte of mosses (the dominant form in bryophytes)
and the sporophyte of flowering plants (the dominant form in vascular plants), and
this will extend our understanding of stress molecular biology and provide a
foundation for future studies on the stress regulatory mechanisms of <italic>P.
patens</italic> and other plant species. Additionally, Species or lineage-specific
stress-regulated genes not found in higher plants suggest that these unknown and
