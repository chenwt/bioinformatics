However, research is hindered by the lack of suitable models to study each subtype. To address this limitation, we classified bladder cancer cell lines into molecular subtypes using publically available data in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), guided by genomic characterization of bladder cancer by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). This identified a panel of bladder cancer cell lines which exhibit genetic alterations and gene expression patterns consistent with luminal and basal molecular subtypes of human disease. A subset of bladder cancer cell lines exhibit <italic>in vivo</italic> histomorphologic patterns consistent with luminal and basal subtypes, including papillary architecture and squamous differentiation. Using the molecular subtype assignments, and our own RNA-seq analysis, we found overexpression of GATA3 and FOXA1 cooperate with PPAR&#x00263; activation to drive transdifferentiation of a basal bladder cancer cells to a luminial phenotype. In summary, our analysis identified a set of human cell lines suitable for the study of molecular subtypes in bladder cancer, and furthermore indicates a cooperative regulatory network consisting of GATA3, FOXA1, and PPAR&#x00263; drive luminal cell fate.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Urothelial carcinoma (UC) of the bladder is the second most common urologic malignancy, accounting for over 70,000 new cancer diagnoses in the United States each year<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Through the discovery of intrinsic molecular subtypes of bladder UC with particular phenotypic characteristics, several research groups have revolutionized our understanding of this common malignancy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. For example, the &#x0201c;luminal&#x0201d; subtype comprises the majority of early stage (non-invasive) bladder cancers, as well as a significant fraction of muscle invasive disease. This subtype is enriched for papillary histomorphology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. The &#x0201c;basal&#x0201d; subtype often exhibits squamous differentiation, is biologically aggressive, and is found almost exclusively in invasive disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Evidence suggests that putative markers and transcriptional regulators of urothelial differentiation are upregulated in the luminal molecular subtype and downregulated in the basal subtype of bladder cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. However, there is limited experimental data (with some notable exceptions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) identifying a direct contribution of these transcription factors to molecular subtype. Indeed, an incomplete understanding of the suitability of available models to test the direct contribution of specific factors to the establishment of a given molecular subtype in UC is a significant hurdle to experimental design. Moreover, the optimal approach for analysis of gene data derived from genetic analysis is not always clear. Therefore, our research group undertook a detailed analysis of publically available gene expression, copy number alteration, and mutational data for 27 bladder UC cell lines available through the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), and applied analyses similar to those performed in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>) study. This approach identified a subset of cell lines as suitable models for the study of molecular subtypes of bladder cancer. In conjunction with other published studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, this will provide an important resource for the bladder cancer research community. As previous research indicates transcriptional regulation is associated with molecular subtype in bladder cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, we additionally used our approach to directly test the ability of the transcription factors GATA3 and FOXA1, which are consistently associated with the luminal molecular subtype of UC, to cooperate with activation of PPAR&#x003b3; to drive the luminal molecular subtype.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Urothelial Cancer Cell Line Classification</title><p>Bladder UC cell lines (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;27) were classified into molecular subtypes using publically available CCLE data, in a manner similar to TCGA bladder cancer analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.

Embryos were isolated as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, and bladders were microdissected under dissecting microscope (Olympus SZX7, Waltham MA) from isolated embryos, and embryonic bladders were separated from the urogenital sinus at the bladder neck and the attached ureters carefully dissected using Vanna spring scissors (Fine Science Tools, Foster City CA). Whole bladders were then placed into calcium and magnesium-free Hanks&#x02019; saline (Gibco) containing 25&#x02009;mM EDTA (Sigma, St. Louis MO) for 90&#x02009;min at room temperature to release the bladder urothelium. The mesenchyme and urothelium were separated manually under microscopic examination using two 25 gauge needles connected to a 1cc syringe, leaving the mesenchyme behind as a bladder shell.

RNA integrity number (RIN) was measured using BioAnalyzer (Agilent) RNA 6000 Nano Kit to confirm RIN above 6. For RNAseq, SureSelect Strand Specific RNA Library Preparation Kit (Agilent) was used to generate cDNA libraries as per the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Briefly, polyA RNA was purified from 2&#x02009;&#x003bc;g of total RNA using oligo (dT) beads. Extracted RNA underwent fragmentation, reverse transcription, end repair, 3&#x02032;-end adenylation, adaptor ligation and subsequent PCR amplification and SPRI bead purification (Beckman Coulter). The unique barcode sequences were incorporated in the adaptors for multiplexed high-throughput sequencing. The final product was assessed for its size distribution and concentration using BioAnalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent) and Kapa Library Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems). The libraries were pooled and diluted to 2&#x02009;nM in EB buffer (Qiagen) and then denatured using the Illumina protocol.

In order to determine if a subset of UC cell lines classified as luminal or basal additionally exhibited a histomorphologic pattern consistent with molecular subtype assignment, we performed tissue recombination xenografting (see materials and methods) using RT4 (luminal), UMUC1 (luminal), and SCaBER (basal) UC cells.</p><p>As we previously reported, tissue recombinants containing RT4 cells (luminal) exhibited a morphologic pattern consistent with a high grade, non-invasive urothelial cell carcinoma, with papillary histology characterized by fibro vascular cores and no destructive invasion into the renal parenchyma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>, top panel). Immunohistochemical analysis of RT4-based tissue recombinants show that these tumors express FOXA1, GATA3, and uroplakins, as well as the basal markers KRT5/6, but fail to express the basal markers KRT14 and EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>; bottom panels). Tissue recombinants containing UMUC1 (luminal) had a conventional invasive urothelial carcinoma morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>, top panel). Interestingly, UMUC1 cells were extremely aggressive, and exhibited deep invasion into the kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref> H&#x00026;E) as well as local extension into adjacent structures. Immunohistochemical analysis of UMUC1-based recombinants revealed these tumors expressed a subset of both luminal and basal markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>; bottom panels) consistent with our gene expression analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). This observation, as well as additional immunohistochemistry for KRT20 and specific uroplakin family members (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Figure 4</xref>) suggests a limited panel of markers is not sufficient to differentiate a relatively small set of xenograft tumors as belonging to a specific molecular subtype.

While FOXA1 is reportedly a PPAR&#x00263; target gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>, it is unknown if these transcription factors cooperate to regulate genes associated with molecular subtypes of bladder cancer. Moreover, while GATA3 is differentially expressed in histologic variants of UC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, and overexpression of GATA3 is associated with the luminal molecular subtype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, it is unknown how GATA3 regulates the expression of genes associated with molecular subtypes of bladder cancer. Based on our analysis of differentially expressed transcription factors identified through the TCGA bladder study, and our characterization of bladder cancer cell lines showing similar transcription factor expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>), we chose to examine the impact of GATA3 and FOXA1 expression on the regulation of markers of luminal and basal bladder cancer in the presence and absence of the PPAR&#x00263; agonist rosiglitazone. By western blot analysis of FOXA1 in a subset of bladder cancer cell lines included in the CCLE data and cultured in our laboratory, we found that other than a small amount of FOXA1 detected in the &#x0201c;non-type&#x0201d; T24 cells, FOXA1 expression was restricted to the luminal bladder cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Western blotting analysis for PPAR&#x00263; showed that this receptor was detected to various degrees in all of the cell lines. However, we noted that the luminal cell lines largely expressed PPAR&#x003b3;1, while 3 out of 4 basal cell lines expressed both PPAR&#x003b3;1 and PPAR&#x003b3;2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Similarly, while GATA3 transcript was detected to various degrees in the luminal cell lines, the &#x0201c;non-type&#x0201d; cell lines and the basal cell lines also expressed GATA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Based on the observation that the cell line 5637 exhibits undetectable levels of FOXA1 and low levels of GATA3, but expresses high levels of both PPAR&#x00263; isoforms, we chose this basal cell line for additional studies. Specifically, we sought to determine the impact of transient overexpression of GATA3 and FOXA1, individually and in combination with each other, and in both the absence and presence of the PPAR&#x00263; agonist rosiglitazone, on the expression of markers of luminal (FGFR3 and KRT20) and basal (EGFR and KRT6) bladder cancer. Interestingly, GATA3 overexpression alone was sufficient to increase expression of FGFR3 in 5637 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>), whereas rosiglitazone treatment repressed FGFR3 expression, which was partially rescued by GATA3 alone and/or in combination with FOXA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>). On the other hand, KRT20 expression was only marginally (albeit significantly) increased by the overexpression of GATA3 and FOXA1 alone or in combination with each other, whereas rosiglitazone treatment alone was sufficient to dramatically increase expression of KRT20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Expression of EGFR was significantly repressed by overexpression of GATA3 or FOXA1, alone and in combination, while rosiglitazone treatment increased EGFR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4E</xref>), as was the case for KRT6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4F</xref>). We characterize 5637 cells as representative of the basal molecular subtype of human disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). In order to determine the impact of FOXA1 and/or GATA3 overexpression on the expression of basal markers at the protein level in this cell line, we performed western blotting for KRT5/6 and EGFR (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplemental figure S5</xref>). Western blotting analysis revealed that overexpression of FOXA1 and/or GATA3 had no effect on KRT5/6 expression, even in the presence of rosiglitazone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplemental figure S5</xref>). However, western blotting revealed that GATA3 overexpression appeared repress EGFR expression, and this was enhanced following rosiglitazone treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplemental figure S5</xref>). This is interesting, as the GATA3 paralog GATA6 was shown to be a negative regulator of EGFR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. In summary, the impact of individual and combined GATA3 and FOXA1 expression, as well as PPAR&#x00263; activation, results in statistically significant, marker-dependent changes in gene expression at the transcriptional level in 5637 cells. These results suggested to us that a less biased and more broadly-based approach for data analysis was required, which takes into account expression of a much larger number of genes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Multiple gene-based analysis identifies a coordinated transcription factor network consisting of GATA3, FOXA1, and PPAR&#x00263; that activates a luminal gene expression program in bladder cancer cells</title><p>In an effort to perform an unbiased analysis regarding the impact of altered GATA3 and FOXA1 expression and PPAR&#x00263; activity on molecular subtype, as well as the extent to which these factors cooperated to regulate global gene expression, we performed RNA-Seq analysis on 5637 cells transiently overexpressing GATA3 and/or FOXA1 in the presence and absence of the PPAR&#x00263; agonist, rosiglitazone. Using a fold change of 2 as the threshold for identifying differentially expressed genes, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;310 protein coding genes were upregulated in rosiglitazone treated 5637 cells overexpressing FOXA1 and GATA3 when compared 5637 cells transfected with empty vector and treated in the presence of DMSO, while n&#x02009;=&#x02009;730 protein coding genes were downregulated (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplemental figure S6</xref>).

However, we were still unable to determine the extent to which (if any) PPAR&#x00263;, GATA3, and FOXA1 cooperate to establish a luminal molecular subtype in basal 5637 cells. Therefore, Classification of Nearest Centroid analysis (ClaNC) was used to more precisely investigate the impact of combinatorial expression of GATA3, FOXA1 and PPAR&#x00263; on development of a luminal expression signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>). A nearest centroid predictor, which uses 50 genes optimally chosen from the TCGA expression subtype gene list (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplemental protocols</xref>) was used to assign all experimentally manipulated 5637 cells as belonging to the luminal or basal expression subtype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. As expected, 5637 cells transiently transfected with empty vector plasmid and treated with vehicle control were classified as basal by this method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Movement of 5637 cells toward the luminal centroid was seen with the addition of GATA3 alone, FOXA1 alone, and following PPAR&#x00263; activation alone. However, no single factor, including PPAR&#x00263; activation in 5637 cells by rosiglitazone, conferred sufficient movement to classify experimentally manipulated cells as luminal in both replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>). In contrast, both replicates of 5637 cells treated with PPAR&#x00263; agonist and overexpressing FOXA1, and both replicates with PPAR&#x00263; and combined GATA3 and FOXA1, exhibited sufficient movement toward the luminal centroid to classify as luminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>). No cell line without PPAR&#x00263; activation was classified as luminal in both replicates. Based on ClaNC analysis, our results show that individual overexpression of GATA3 or FOXA1, or activation of PPAR&#x00263; alone in 5637 cells, is insufficient to drive a gene expression pattern that qualified as luminal. While our conclusions are limited to this one cell line, our analysis indicates these factors act in concert and cooperate with PPAR&#x00263; to reprogram the basal bladder cancer cell line 5637, resulting in activation of a gene expression pattern consistent with the emergence of a luminal molecular subtype.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification of FOXA1 occupied <italic>cis</italic> regulatory regions in RT4 cells reveals a complex network of potential transcriptional co-regulators</title><p>In order to obtain information regarding the extent to which FOXA1 cooperates with GATA3 and PPAR&#x00263;, as well as to identify other transcription factors that potentially regulate gene expression in a luminal bladder cancer cells, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation of FOXA1 in RT4 cells followed by high throughput next generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq). This approach resulted in the identification of 33,377 shared FOXA1 binding sites following two separate ChIP-Seq experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>). In addition, motif analysis identified 172 motifs significantly associated with FOXA1 occupied sites (q&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplemental table ST1</xref>), several of which were unanticipated. For example, binding sites for the stress response transcription factor ATF3 were the most enriched over background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>, not including FOXA1 and other forkhead factors). In addition, binding sites for AP-1 were enriched near FOXA1 occupied regions (20.3% of FOXA1 occupied sites associated with an AP-1 motif, compared to 5.28% of background; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>). The association of AP-1 bound sites was interesting, as binding sites for several components of the AP-1 pathway (FRA1, BATF, FOSL2, JUN-AP1) were frequently enriched near FOXA1 occupied regions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary table ST1</xref>). In addition, binding sites for TP63 (6.47% of FOXA1 occupied regions versus 1.95% of background) and TP53 (6.47% of FOXA1 occupied regions versus 1.95% of background) were also associated with FOXA1 occupied regions relative to background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>). However, we were surprised that motif analysis identified a minimal amount of GATA3 binding sites (q&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05; 2.91% of FOXA1 occupied regions versus 1.11% of background) and PPAR&#x00263; binding sites (q&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05; 7.86% of FOXA1 occupied regions versus 5.79% of background) as being associated with FOXA1 occupied regions. This observation suggested to us that additional transcriptional regulators identified by this process almost certainly play a role in cooperating with FOXA1 to regulate gene expression in luminal RT4 cells. However, as overexpression of FOXA1 combined with PPAR&#x00263; activation was sufficient to promote a luminal gene expression pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>), we performed additional analysis of our ChIP-Seq data to identify biological processes and pathways, with a focus on FOXA1 occupied regulatory elements associated with GATA3 and PPAR&#x00263; binding sites identified by motif analysis. Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) pathway misspelled identified the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR alpha) signaling pathway as being associated with genes as potentially co-regulated by FOXA1, GATA3 and PPAR&#x00263; (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplemental Figure S7</xref>). In addition, MSigDB Perturbation analysis of FOXA1 occupied regions with associated GATA3 and PPAR&#x00263; motifs identified a number of gene sets expression signatures of interest, including a set of genes with associated p53 binding sites (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplemental Figure S8</xref>), and this observation supported our motif analysis. In summary, our ChIP-Seq experiments identify AP-1 factors, as well as additional unanticipated factors as potentially cooperating with FOXA1 to co-regulate genes in RT4 cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Coordinated analysis of human and cell line expression data identifies a set of regulated transcription factors potentially contributing to the emergence of a luminal molecular subtype</title><p>While our experimental data indicated GATA3 and FOXA1 cooperate with PPAR&#x00263; activation to drive basal to luminal transdifferentiation in 5637 cells, we were curious if the regulation of additional transcription factors associated with molecular subtypes of UC played a role in our experimental system. Therefore, we used gene expression data following the individual and combined overexpression of GATA3 and FOXA1 in the presence and absence of PPAR&#x00263; agonist to identify additional transcriptional regulators that may play a role in the activation of a luminal bladder cancer-specific gene expression. Strikingly, overexpression of GATA3 and FOXA1 in the presence of PPAR&#x00263; agonist modulated the expression of several transcription factors that are differentially expressed between luminal and basal human bladder cancers, including ELF3, SNAI1, and SNAI2 (both implicated in epithelial to mesenchymal transition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>) and TFAP2A<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref> among others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplemental protocol</xref>).

Our data also indicates this occurs by altering the expression of key downstream transcription factors implicated in bladder cancer.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Clinical outcomes for the treatment of muscle invasive bladder cancer are enhanced following use of multimodal therapy, which includes neoadjuvant, cisplatin-based chemotherapy followed by cystectomy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>.

However, recent molecular characterization studies, including the molecular data provided by the TCGA bladder effort, provide an outstanding opportunity to identify novel mechanisms responsible for the malignant phenotype, as well as actionable genetic alterations associated with aggressive disease. Importantly, this unique opportunity to improve the clinical management of disease requires robust experimental systems representative of human disease which can be used for translational research. For this reason, we have capitalized on molecular data available through the TCGA, to undertake a comprehensive analysis of 27 human bladder cancer cell lines available through the CCLE. Through this approach we identified a subset of cell lines that are representative of luminal and basal molecular subtypes of bladder cancer.

In the current study, we have now additionally identified cell lines suitable for experiments focused on elucidating cancer biology associated with the luminal molecular subtype of bladder cancer. Importantly, the molecular subtypes represented in these cell lines are also associated with genetic alterations typically associated with a given subtype in human tumors as identified by TCGA. For example, luminal bladder cancer cell lines were enriched for mutation and amplifications in <italic>FGFR3</italic>, while mutations in <italic>TP53</italic> and deletions of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> were more evenly distributed throughout the cell lines examined, much as is the case with clinical disease. In addition, our analysis of tumor tissue collected following <italic>in vivo</italic> tissue recombination xenografting experiments show that a subset of cell lines exhibit histology consistent with their molecular subtype assignment, with luminal cell lines exhibiting a non-invasive papillary or conventional invasive UC phenotype, whereas the tested basal cell line exhibited an invasive phenotype with squamous differentiation. In short, our analysis, and the analysis of other groups<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> has helped to establish the relevance of these cell lines for the design of experiments to understand the role of molecular subtype in bladder cancer.</p><p>One of the most striking observations made during our comparisons of gene expression in the CCLE cell lines and human tumors was the degree to which key transcriptional regulators were correlated with a luminal and basal gene expression signature in both data sets. Similar to what other groups have observed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, this observation suggested a predominant role of transcriptional regulators in the regulation of molecular subtype. However, the level of evidence regarding the role of specific transcription factors in the establishment/regulation of a given molecular subtype varies. For instance, previous experimental studies indicate an important role for PPAR&#x00263; and EGFR in the positive regulation of genes associated with the luminal and basal molecular subtypes of bladder cancer, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Similarly,FOXA1 was recently identified as a target of microRNA-99a and &#x02212;100<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>, both of which are diminished in a subset of FOXA1 and FGFR3 overexpressing luminal bladder cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Our previous xenografting and inducible knockout studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> have also established a role for FOXA1 in bladder cancer, and suggest a direct contribution of this factor to the luminal subtype. In addition, while recent analysis of publically available gene expression and ChIP-seq data is strongly suggestive of a direct role for GATA3 and other novel factors in the luminal molecular subtype of bladder cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, to our knowledge there is no direct evidence regarding a role of GATA3 in the establishment of molecular subtype. In addition, the extent to which these factors cooperate with each other to establish and/or maintain molecular subtype is unknown. Accordingly, our integrated analysis of CCLE and TCGA data provided us a unique opportunity to design experiments to directly test the individual and combined contribution of GATA3, FOXA1, and PPAR&#x00263; to the regulation of genes associated with the luminal molecular subtype of bladder cancer, as well as the establishment of the luminal molecular signature in bladder cancer cells. Because of the complex nature of this data, we chose a detailed approach incorporating both hierarchical clustering and Classification of Nearest Centroid (ClaNC) analysis, and we feel this is a particularly innovative approach for the analysis of experimental data. Significantly, we show that pharmacologic activation of PPAR&#x00263; is sufficient to cluster the basal cell line 5637 into a large cluster containing luminal cell lines, a finding consistent with a previous reports identifying an important role for PPAR&#x00263; in the activation of luminal-specific genes expressed in bladder cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. However, ClaNC analysis shows that 5637 cells cannot be classified as transitioning from basal to luminal by any single factor alone, including PPAR&#x00263; activation. Rather, our analysis shows that GATA3 and/or FOXA1 cooperate with PPAR&#x00263; activation to reprogram basal 5637 cells to a luminal molecular subtype. Our in-depth approach of data analysis understandably limits us to the analysis of one cell line following rosiglitazone treatment and overexpression of FOXA1 and GATA3. Therefore, while we must be cautious in how we interpret this data, our approach validates the importance of PPAR&#x00263; and additionally shows a direct impact of GATA3 and FOXA1 on the expression of markers of the luminal molecular subtype of bladder cancer. Most importantly, our data show that these factors can cooperate to establish a given molecular subtype. While it is important that future studies examine the effect of manipulating these factors in other bladder cancer cell lines, these findings have important implications for the potential &#x0201c;plasticity&#x0201d; of molecular subtype which reportedly can be altered following multimodal therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, or even possibly during tumor progression.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Warrick, J.
