Alternative splicing of myosin VI mRNA generates two distinct isoform types, myosin VI<sub>short</sub> and myosin VI<sub>long</sub>, which differ in the C-terminal region. Their physiological and pathological role remains unknown. Here we identified an isoform-specific regulatory helix, named &#x003b1;2-linker that defines specific conformations and hence determines the target selectivity of human myosin VI. The presence of the &#x003b1;2-linker structurally defines a novel clathrin-binding domain that is unique to myosin VI<sub>long</sub> and masks the known RRL interaction motif. This finding is relevant to ovarian cancer, where alternative myosin VI splicing is aberrantly regulated, and exon skipping dictates cell addiction to myosin VI<sub>short</sub> for tumor cell migration. The RRL interactor optineurin contributes to this process by selectively binding myosin VI<sub>short</sub>. Thus the &#x003b1;2-linker acts like a molecular switch that assigns myosin VI to distinct endocytic (myosin VI<sub>long</sub>) or migratory (myosin VI<sub>short</sub>) functional roles.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">Molecular motors exert critical roles in virtually all cell processes. Myosin VI belongs to a superfamily of more than 20 different classes of actin-based motor proteins<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> that hydrolyze ATP for mechanical work and movement of cargos along actin tracks. The ability to walk towards the minus end of actin filaments makes myosin VI unique among the myosin family<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. This unusual property appears to bestow on myosin VI a number of specific cellular functions, such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis and vesicular transport<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Myosin VI was originally discovered in Drosophila, where it participates in cell migration during ovary development<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, spermatogenesis<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and neuroblast asymmetric division<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. In mammalian cells, myosin VI localizes to the Golgi complex, membrane ruffles at the leading edges of migrating cells, clathrin coated pits at plasma membranes, APPL1-positive early endosomes and autophagosomes (reviewed in<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Detailed mechanisms underlying the function of myosin VI in these diverse processes are currently unclear.</p><p id="P4">At a molecular scale, myosin VI consists of two functional domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), a motor&#x02013;IQ domain sufficient for pointed-end (minus-end) directed movement, and a tail domain, which can be further divided into a long helical region, reported as a coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal globular region, known as a cargo-binding domain (CBD). A MIU (Motif Interacting with Ubiquitin)<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> is located at the boundaries. The CBD contains two myosin VI ligand interaction surfaces, the &#x0201c;RRL&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;WWY&#x0201d; motifs<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. The RRL triplet is responsible for myosin VI binding to endocytic adaptors, including GAIP-interacting protein C-terminus (GIPC)<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, and autophagy receptors, such as optineurin<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, Nuclear Dot Protein 52 (NDP52)<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, and Traf6-binding protein (T6BP)<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>.</p><p id="P5">An intrinsic level of complexity in deciphering the functions of myosin VI comes from the presence of different isoforms. Two regions are alternatively spliced within the tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), leading to an insertion between the helical domain and the CBD (large insert, LI)<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, as well as additional residues at the C-terminal (small insert, SI)<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. Although myosin VI is widely expressed in most tissues, isoforms containing the LI are specifically found in polarized epithelial cells with well-developed apical microvilli<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. How the presence of LI in the tail influences the functions and intracellular targeting of myosin VI is not known. Up to now, isoforms lacking the LI present no specific expression and localization but are required for polarized transport of tyrosine motif containing basolateral membrane proteins<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and for maintaining an active pool of secretory granules near the plasma membrane of neurosecretory cells<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>.</p><p id="P6">The role of myosin VI in cell migration has been linked to ovarian<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and prostate cancers<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, where myosin VI overexpression correlates with clinically aggressive behavior.

By analyzing the interactomes and the conformational structure of myosin VI isoforms, we provided mechanistic insights into how myosin VI function becomes pathological in human cancers and demonstrated the importance of an isoform-specific helix in assigning myosin VI to distinct functional roles.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="S1"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Selective expression of myosin VI<sub>short</sub> in ovarian cancer</title><p id="P8">Several studies report overexpression of myosin VI in prostate<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and ovarian cancers<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, which positively correlates with their grade and metastatic potential. No information is available concerning specificity of isoform expression. To shed light on this issue, we analyzed human myosin VI transcripts in detail. The gene consists of 36 coding exons, three of which (exons 29, 30 and 31) generate the LI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). We focused on the main myosin VI isoforms expressed in human cell lines<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, namely isoforms 1 and 3, which have different LI lengths (23- or 32-residues long, respectively, due to the presence or absence of exon 29, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>), and isoform 2, which lacks the LI entirely (exons 29, 30 and 31 are absent, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Interestingly, these alternative exons are conserved throughout evolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>), suggesting a relevant function for the regulated splicing in myosin VI.</p><p id="P9">To gain insight into possible differential expression of myosin VI isoforms in tumors, we analyzed their expression by RT-PCR using primers positioned in exon 28 and 33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). The PCR reaction was able to discriminate between the different isoforms, as demonstrated in the control lanes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). RT-PCR was performed using RNA extracted from high-grade primary ovarian cancer cells cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> for two passages. In contrast to their normal counterpart (ovarian surface epithelium, OSE), ten out of ten tumors expressed almost exclusively isoform 2, suggesting a positive selection for this isoform in tumor progression and metastasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). We then examined a number of ovarian cancer cell lines for myosin VI isoform expression in order to identify possible cellular models for <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. OVCAR-5 is unique among them as it expresses all myosin VI isoforms, while the remaining 6 cell lines tested selectively expressed isoform 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Knocking-down myosin VI substantially inhibits migration <italic>in vitro</italic> and reduces dissemination of ovarian tumor cells propagated in nude mice<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. To gain insight into the possible advantages derived from overexpression of myosin VI isoform 2 in cancer cells, we looked at cell migration as an important feature of cancer metastasis. We analyzed the effect of myosin VI depletion in SK-OV-3, HEY and OVCAR-5 cell lines in wound-healing assay. Depletion of myosin VI was complete and comparable in all cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). In the absence of myosin VI, SK-OV-3 and HEY cells were severely impaired in their ability to migrate and to close wounds, whereas the migration efficiency of OVCAR-5 cells was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary movies 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">3</xref>). Comparable results were obtained with different oligos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a,b</xref>). Hence, only ovarian cancer cells that selectively express myosin VI isoform 2 were deficient in cell migration upon myosin VI depletion.</p><p id="P11">Next, we looked at possible partners of myosin VI in this process. In A549 cells, ablation of myosin VI or its interactor optineurin<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> inhibits polarized delivery of the epidermal growth factor receptor into the leading edge and leads to profound defects in lamellipodia formation<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. This prompted us to test the effect of optineurin depletion in our model system. Optineurin knockdown reduced the migration ability of SK-OV-3 but did not further decrease cell speed in myosin VI-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary movie 4</xref>). The lack of additive effects suggests that the two proteins are acting in the same axis.</p><p id="P12">Our functional data suggested that optineurin may specifically interact with myosin VI isoform 2. Optineurin binding requires the RRL motif<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> of myosin VI which lies outside of the splicing region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Nonetheless, we tested its binding to the different isoforms. A sequence alignment of the utilized region of myosin VI (myosin VI<sub>998&#x02013;1131</sub>, amino acid numbering from isoform 3) together with its features is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>, optineurin binds specifically to isoform 2 and to a shorter construct lacking the alternatively spliced region (1080&#x02013;1131). This prompted us to test for a possible preference of the other known RRL interactors; GIPC<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, NDP52 (ref.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and T6BP<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. Surprisingly, all three interactors showed a clear preference for isoforms 2<sub>,</sub> which lacks the large insert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Myosin VI isoforms display different interaction partners</title><p id="P13">Distinct functions for myosin VI isoforms are described but no molecular rationale for such differences is provided<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. The results obtained with the RRL interactors prompted us to hypothesize that the various myosin VI isoforms may have different interactomes. Thus, we performed a mass spectrometry-based proteomic screen, aimed at comparing the interaction profiles of the various isoforms. GST-tagged myosin VI<sub>998&#x02013;1131</sub> constructs were used in pull-down assays with HEK293T cellular lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). A label-free quantitative experiment was performed, and resulting data were analysed by MaxQuant software. Inspection of the gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>), confirmed by data presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, indicated that isoforms 1 and 3 have almost identical binding partners. Most of these binding partners are implicated in endocytosis and vesicular trafficking and are not shared by isoform 2. Isoform 2-specific interactors were more heterogeneous and comprised nuclear factors, an E3 ligase (DDB1&#x02013;DCAF1) and few GEFs, among which the previously identified myosin VI binding partner DOCK7 (ref.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Few interactors common to all three isoforms (e.g. COPB2) were also identified. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> reported examples of the top hits for each class with their total peptide counts. None of the previously characterized RRL interactors were present. Since we cut the gel higher than GST fusion proteins, GIPC was automatically excluded from the analysis whereas NDP52 and T6BP were identified with a single peptide and thus filtered out. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref> reported the complete list of proteins that differentially interact with isoform 1, isoform 2 and 3 vs GST control confirmed by additional proteomics experiments.</p><p id="P14">Experimental validation confirmed the most abundant identified interactors (5 out of 5 tested) and their specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>).

It is well-known that myosin VI and clathrin form a ternary complex with the Dab-2 adaptor<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. However, neither the WWY motif of myosin VI (ref.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), or the larger surfaces implicated in binding to Dab-2 (ref.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) were present in the constructs used for the proteomic screening. Thus, we inferred that myosin VI could also interact with clathrin directly.</p><p id="P16">To map this novel interaction surface, we generated a panel of GST-tagged deletion constructs and tested their interaction with endogenous clathrin starting from isoform 3 myosin VI<sub>998&#x02013;1131</sub>, which was used for the proteomic screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a-c</xref>). Regions deleted from the C-terminal end did not show any clathrin binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>), whereas fragments deleted at the N-terminal end retained clathrin interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). The minimal binding region appeared to be 1055&#x02013;1131, which includes the isoform-specific LI region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>) and the region directly following it. Further N-terminal shortening, or even small internal deletion disrupted binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b,c</xref>).</p><p id="P17">We used NMR techniques to solve the structure of the clathrin binding surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The twenty calculated NMR structures with lowest energy from 100 starting structures converged well (stereoview showed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>) with a backbone root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.18 &#x000c5;, following the exclusion of an 11-amino acid flexible loop that directly follows the LI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). In the isoform-specific LI region, residues 1055&#x02013;1068 form an amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix (&#x003b1;2-linker, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3e</xref>) that packs against two other helices present in all isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), named &#x003b1;3 and &#x003b1;4. Interaction between the isoform-specific &#x003b1;2-linker and the common helices &#x003b1;3 and &#x003b1;4 (&#x003b1;3/&#x003b1;4) is defined by 106 NOE interactions, as exemplified for L1118 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3f</xref>). A hydrophobic surface of the &#x003b1;2-linker formed by M1058, M1062, and L1066 inserts into a cleft formed by the &#x003b1;3/&#x003b1;4 interface and interacts with hydrophobic residues Y1091, F1114, L1118, and Y1121 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a and 3c</xref>). In addition, a salt bridge is formed between &#x003b1;2-linker E1061 and &#x003b1;3 R1095 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Mutually exclusive association of clathrin and RRL binders</title><p id="P18">The RRL motif is embedded in helix &#x003b1;4 of the clathrin-binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>, R1117A (RAL), L1118A (RRA) and the triple AAA mutation abrogated the ability of myosin VI<sub>998&#x02013;1131</sub> to pull-down clathrin from cell lysates, whereas the R1116A (ARL) mutant behaved as wild type. Circular dichroism data of the R1117A-containing fragment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3g</xref>) revealed that R1117 is required for structural integrity of this myosin VI region.</p><p id="P19">The structural data provided an explanation for the myosin VI<sub>short</sub> selective interaction of RRL binders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>) but raised an issue related the triple AAA mutation. Thus, we probed the ability of all RRL interactors to interact with a myosin VI fragment carrying mutations in the RRL motif. We used a minimal fragment (G1080&#x02013;R1131) that includes &#x003b1;3/&#x003b1;4 but lacks the &#x003b1;2-linker and retains binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). As for clathrin, and consistent with the structural data, the destabilizing R1117A mutation either alone or in the context of the AAA mutant impaired binding to partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Analyses performed with the other single point mutants demonstrated that R1116 and L1118 are critical for GIPC and optineurin binding, whereas T6BP and NDP52 associate with myosin VI<sub>1080&#x02013;1131</sub> in an RRL-independent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Taken together, these data implied that packing of the &#x003b1;2-linker against the &#x003b1;3/&#x003b1;4 helices in myosin VI<sub>long</sub> determined: i) its exquisite clathrin-binding ability and ii) its impairment in RRL-mediated binding (i.e. optineurin). We endeavored to validate the functional impact of the myosin VI<sub>long</sub> conformation by testing point mutation(s) capable of disrupting interaction between &#x003b1;3/&#x003b1;4 and the &#x003b1;2-linker. We replaced M1062, which is sandwiched between &#x003b1;3 and &#x003b1;4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), with glutamine, and evaluated this variant together with the previously characterized L1118A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>), for binding to RRL-specific interactors by pull-down assays. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>, M1062Q was impaired in clathrin binding, similarly to L1118A. Strikingly, GIPC and optineurin gained binding to M1062Q but not to L1118A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>), consistent with the evidence that L1118 belongs to their interaction surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Finally, NDP52 and T6BP interacted with both mutants at levels similar to myosin VI<sub>short</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Thus, these point mutations were able to induce a conformational change that converts a myosin VI<sub>long</sub> into a myosin VI<sub>short</sub>-like protein. NMR data of the L1118A mutant further validated this conclusion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3h</xref>).</p><p id="P21">These results confirmed the conformational differences between the myosin VI isoforms induced by the presence of the &#x003b1;2-linker and established their mutually exclusive association with clathrin and RRL interactors (i.e. optineurin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Functional analysis of Myosin VI<sub>long</sub>&#x02013;clathrin interaction</title><p id="P22">To functionally evaluate these findings, we generated GFP-tagged versions of full-length myosin VI<sub>long</sub> wild type, L1118A and M1062Q mutants. As controls, we used myosin VI<sub>short</sub> and a myosin VI<sub>long</sub> mutated in the WWY motif (W1192L) and impaired for Dab-2 binding<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. We transfected the constructs in HeLa cells where we knocked-down endogenous myosin VI to avoid confounding effects due to the presence of the endogenous protein (e.g., dimerization). Results showed that endogenous clathrin was immunoprecipitated by myosin VI<sub>long</sub> but not by myosin VI<sub>short</sub> and that L1118A and M0162Q mutations were sufficient to abrogate this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). In this context, the W1192L mutant showed binding comparable to that of wild type myosin VI<sub>long</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>), suggesting that Dab-2 is dispensable for a stable interaction with clathrin. We also analyzed the behavior of the isoforms by immunofluorescence analysis. As previously reported<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, myosin VI<sub>long</sub> strongly co-localized with clathrin, whereas myosin VI<sub>short</sub> exhibited no significant co-localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e,f</xref>). Notably, W1192L, L1118A and M1062Q mutants failed to co-localize with clathrin, similarly to myosin VI<sub>short</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e,f</xref>). Similar results were obtained using myosin VI tails (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>), which recapitulate myosin VI interaction and localization<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Taken together, these findings led us to conclude that, in addition to the known Dab-2-binding motif, a second isoform-specific binding surface drives myosin VI<sub>long</sub> interaction with clathrin.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Exon skipping is a common event in cancer</title><p id="P23">Our findings revealed that the isoform-specific &#x003b1;2-linker defines specific conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>) and localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e,f</xref>) of myosin VI isoforms.

We evaluated the relative expression of the isoforms by exploiting the presence of exon 31, which encodes for the &#x003b1;2-linker (outlined in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1a</xref>) as a discriminating marker of myosin VI<sub>long</sub>. As a source of data, we used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and included all experiments performed using RNAseq technology. The resulting dataset consisted of 293 control and 1646 tumor samples, belonging to 14 different tumor types. The relative abundance of exon 31 (E31RA) was obtained as the ratio of its RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase of Exon Model per Million Mapped Reads, see Materials and Methods for details) and the average RPKM values of the four flanking constitutive exons (namely E27, E28, E32 and E33, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P25">The box plot relative to the overall analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>) showed that exon 31 skipping is a common event occurring with significantly increased frequency in tumor compared to normal samples. Thus, myosin VI<sub>short</sub> is selectively expressed in tumors. The analysis conducted at the single cancer type level showed that exon skipping is highly frequent among certain tumors, but not others (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>), and suggested that the function of myosin VI<sub>short</sub> may be critical and positively selected only in specific types of cancers. Of note, in the case of ovarian cancer, no &#x02018;normal&#x02019; controls were present in the database, but compared to the average of normal samples, exon E31RA is barely measurable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>), further confirming the data obtained in primary tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). As proof of principle, we selected two breast cell lines, MCF10A and MDA-MB-231. This latter cancer cell line showed high levels of myosin VI<sub>short</sub>-only in both sparse and confluent conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Upon myosin VI depletion, MDA-MB-231 cells displayed a clear impairment in wound closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary movie 5</xref>), while MCF10A cells were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary movie 6</xref>).

We provided for the first time a rationale for clathrin selectivity, as the presence of the isoform-specific &#x003b1;2-linker, together with the following region defines a novel clathrin-binding domain and dictates isoform-specific interactions. This finding has important functional implications. During epithelial cell polarization, an isoform switch of myosin VI occurs<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>.

It is tempting to speculate that the existence of distinct interaction surfaces for clathrin and Dab-2, both of which are required for co-localization with clathrin-coated pits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e,f</xref>) may provide critical synergy that regulates the myosin VI motor ability. Clathrin binding may recruit and concentrate myosin VI at clathrin-coated pits where Dab2 could tether it into a stable and active dimer, crucial to convert myosin VI into a cellular transporter<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>.</p><p id="P28">Unexpectedly, our data showed a clear preference of RRL interactors towards myosin VI<sub>short</sub>. In the case of optineurin and GIPC, structural data elucidated this specificity as R1116 and L1118, which belong to their interaction surface, are masked in the myosin VI<sub>long</sub> conformation. A similar explanation could also apply for NDP52 and T6BP, although their precise interaction surface remains to be established. Whatever the case, our data suggested that myosin VI<sub>short</sub> is the isoform specifically involved in the functional interaction with these adaptor proteins that have an established role in autophagy<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>.</p><p id="P29">Myosin VI is implicated in cell migration both in Drosophila and mammals (reviewed in <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). However published data lead to an intriguing conundrum. On the one hand, myosin VI depletion from epithelial cells leads to loss of vinculin from adhesion sites and weakens E-cadherin complexes<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>. Such rearrangement results in loss of cohesive forces in epithelial layers, a well-known prerequisite for invasive cancer cell migration. On the other hand, myosin VI is remarkably upregulated in prostate and ovarian cancer cells, where its overexpression correlates with aggressive clinical behavior<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. In this context, silencing of myosin VI expression in ovarian and prostate cancer cell lines decreases the migratory potential of these cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and ovarian tumor dissemination <italic>in vivo</italic><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. Our results provided a molecular explanation for this conundrum, ascribing the cohesive and migratory defects to the two different myosin VI isoforms. We found that myosin VI<sub>short</sub> is overexpressed in ovarian and other invasive cancers, whereas myosin VI<sub>long</sub> is expressed in polarized epithelial cells, in which it likely promotes E-cadherin stabilization at cell-cell junctions.</p><p id="P30">In Drosophila, the border cell migration occurring during oogenesis is reminiscent of tumor cell invasion<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Initially, the border cells are polarized epithelial cells with strong cell-cell contacts. For migration to begin, cell polarity changes from apico-basal to front-rear, and proteins found at cell-cell junctions reorganize at the invasive edge of the cell to facilitate motility and invasion<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>. During these events, myosin VI changes localization, from the baso-lateral membrane to membrane ruffles at the front edge of moving cells<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>. An interesting possibility is that at the onset of border cell migration, an isoform switch towards the shorter myosin VI isoform occurs. Nothing is known about the differential expression and functions of myosin VI isoforms in Drosophila. However, we noticed that different splicing variants also exist in the fly gene. Secondary structure prediction analysis suggested that, even if the primary sequence is not conserved, the exon that is skipped in the shortest isoforms encodes an alpha helix with length and position similar to the &#x003b1;2-linker in mammals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p id="P31">Our data suggest that cancer cells positively select myosin VI<sub>short</sub> because it confers them with a migratory advantage. The exact molecular mechanism through which myosin VI<sub>short</sub> modulates cell migration remains to be established.

In addition, we have demonstrated that myosin VI has a novel ubiquitin-binding domain<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> that most likely contributes to optinerurin interaction and to myosin VI<sub> short</sub> migratory function.</p><p id="P32">The contribution of alternative splicing in human diseases is widely recognized<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. Unbalanced expression of splicing variants or failure to properly express the correct isoform is clearly part of cancer cell biology<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>. Here, we found that exon skipping determines the expression of myosin VI<sub>short</sub>-only in in several types of tumors. Cancer-associated alternative splicing variants are considered new tools for the diagnosis and classification of cancers and could become targets for innovative therapeutic interventions based on highly specific splicing correction approaches. The selective expression of myosin VI<sub>short</sub> in cancer may very well fit in this context. This unexpected finding paves the way for defining the splicing mechanism of myosin VI and provides an exciting starting point to understand and therapeutically exploit novel key events in pathological cell migration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S9" specific-use="web-only"><title>Online Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Cell lines, Media and Constructs</title><table-wrap id="T3" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><table frame="box" rules="all"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cell line</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Source</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Medium</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HEK293T</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ICLC</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">DMEM (Lonza), 10% FBS S.A.
