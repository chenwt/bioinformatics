expressed PhbF protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075066-Kadowaki1">[11]</xref>, and our results now confirm the ability of this transcriptional repressor protein in binding PHB granule <italic>in vivo</italic>. Since PhbF binds to the promoter region of <italic>phb</italic>-related genes and also to PHB granules, the regulation of <italic>phb</italic> genes expression most likely involves disruption of PhbF-DNA and formation of PhbF-granule complexes as previously proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075066-Potter1">[8]</xref>.</p><p>The most abundant protein associated with the <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> PHB granule is the phasin which has been described as responsible for preventing granule coalescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075066-Jurasek1">[27]</xref>. Genome analysis indicated two genes coding for phasins in <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> (Hsero_1639 and Hsero_4759) (GenBank accession number ADJ63152.1 and ADJ66220.1, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075066-Pedrosa1">[12]</xref>). These genes code for 19.8 kDa proteins with pI of 6.7, sharing 58% identity and 74% similarity. Our analysis indicates that PhaP1 (encoded by Hsero_1639) is the main phasin coating PHB in <italic>H. seropedicae</italic>, since under our experimental conditions, PhaP2 (Hsero_4759) was not observed. However, absence of PhaP2 cannot be rule out since transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) indicates that <italic>phaP2</italic> is expressed, although at a very low level when compared to <italic>phaP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0075066-t002">Table 2</xref>). A <italic>phaP1</italic> deleted mutant was constructed in order to verify if PhaP2 could substitute PhaP1 in coating PHB granules in <italic>H. seropedicae</italic>. The <italic>&#x00394;phaP1</italic> mutant produces PHB indicating that synthesis of PHB is not impaired by <italic>phaP1</italic> deletion, however, the macroscopic aspect of the granule suspension is different compared to the wild type (data not shown), which may suggest a different morphology of the PHB granule. Protein analyses of the <italic>&#x00394;phaP1</italic> PHB granule-associated proteins show a high concentration of PhaP2 indicating that in the absence of PhaP1, the second phasin PhaP2 is expressed and coats the PHB granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075066-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, another protein associated with the PHB granule was also identified in the <italic>&#x00394;phaP1</italic> mutant strain. Hsero_2402 (GenBank accession number ADJ63901.1) encodes a hypothetical protein with a calculated 21.6 kDa and pI of 6.2 and no conserved domain. It has 14.3% identity and 36% similarity with PhaP1 and 13.3% identity and 34.5% similarity with PhaP2. Although Hsero_2402 encoded protein shows low similarity with PhaP1 and PhaP2, prediction of secondary structure indicates a protein with high content of &#x003b1;-helix (supplementary material, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0075066.s002">Fig. S2</xref>) which may be involved in binding to PHB granule as reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075066-Neumann1">[28]</xref>. Transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) of the wild type strain (SmR1) indicated that both Hsero_2402 and PhaP2 (Hsero_4759) are expressed at the similar levels, and lower expression level as compared to that of PhaP1 (Hsero_1639) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0075066-t002">Table 2</xref>). This difference in the transcription levels could favor the identification of PhaP1 and not the PhaP2 and Hsero_2402 by PMF in the wild type strain. Other organisms have been reported to carry more than one phasin, but their role on PHB metabolism differ. In <italic>Ralstonia eutropha</italic> five genes coding for phasins were identified and recently two more phasins were described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075066-Pfeiffer1">[29]</xref>. Although all the seven genes are expressed during PHB synthesis, PhaP1 seems to be the main protein covering PHB granules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075066-Potter2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075066-Pfeiffer1">[29]</xref>.

These proteins share 45% identity and 62% similarity. The Hsero_1622 encoded protein was found bound to PHB granule (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0075066-t001">Table 1</xref>) therefore it is most likely the candidate for PHB degradation and was named PhaZ1. The observed amount of PhaZ1 bound to PHB was below 1% of total granule-associated proteins probably due to the growth stage of the culture which favors PHB production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075066-g003">Figure 3</xref>) rather than degradation.</p><p>In addition to PhbF, PhaP1, PhbC1 and PhaZ1, a leucyl aminopeptidase was also identified associated to PHB.

Ren et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075066-Ren1">[30]</xref> also reported a similar protein associated with polyhydroxyalkanoate granules from <italic>P. putida</italic>. Although it has been suggested as an enzyme involved in turnover of granule-associated proteins, its role in PHB metabolism or granule biogenesis has not yet been demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075066-Ren1">[30]</xref>.</p><p>Our results also revealed novel proteins associated with the PHB granules in <italic>H. seropedicae</italic>. The second most abundant protein associated with PHB granules was a histone-like protein carrying a putative HC2 domain (Histone H1-like nucleoprotein HC2) encoded by Hsero_0382. The HC2 protein has been studied mainly in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> sp. It contains DNA- and RNA-binding activities, and has been shown to be involved in DNA condensation and regulation of both transcription and translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075066-Klint1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075066-Pedersen1">[32]</xref>.

The HC2 homologue from <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> is a 282 amino acid protein with high content of alanine (45.4%), lysine (28%) and proline (11%), mainly in 15 pentameric repeats of AAAKK and AAPKK distributed throughout the protein and rendering positive charges evenly distributed. The high pI (11.8) of HC2 homologue leads to an unusual migration rate in SDS-PAGE (migrates as 40 kDa as compared to the calculated 26.9 kDa). Histone&#x02013;like proteins associated with PHB granules have also been described for PhaF from <italic>P. putida</italic> and PhaM from <italic>R. eutropha</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075066-Galan1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075066-Pfeiffer2">[34]</xref>. These proteins show alanine/lysine repeats located at the C-terminal portion of the protein, but in contrast with <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> HC2 homologue, different motifs at the N-terminal portion: a phasin domain in PhaF and potential transmembrane domains in PhaM. These proteins have been implicated with PHB granules association and their appropriated segregation during cell division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075066-Galan1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075066-Pfeiffer2">[34]</xref>. Although, the <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> HC2 homolog has not other known domains, a similar role in PHB granule segregation may not be rule out.</p><p>The hypothetical protein Hsero_3471 was also identified attached to the PHB granules at high levels (14% of the total granule-associated protein). Two genes encoding proteins homologous to Hsero_3471 were located in the <italic>Cupriavidus necator</italic> N-1 genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075066-Poehlein1">[35]</xref> (protein CNE_1c33190 - identity 48% and protein CNE_BB1p06610 - identity 45%). These proteins do not show any significant homology to known domains, with exception of a very low homology (e-value of 0.26) to the eukaryotic MACPF protein (membrane attack complex perforins). Analysis of the promoter region of Hsero_3471 indicates a potential PhbF-binding site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075066-Kadowaki1">[11]</xref> located at &#x02212;190 position from the start codon, suggesting that its expression is regulated by PHB metabolism.</p><p>Two proteins related to porins have been also found associated with the <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> PHB granules: Hsero_4295 and Hsero_3696 which share similarity to OmpC and OmpA, respectively. Together these proteins represent approximately 10% of total PHB-associated proteins. Although they were not identified in a previously reported membrane proteome analysis of <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> SmR1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075066-Huergo1">[21]</xref>, a possible contamination during PHB granules extraction cannot be ruled out. Transcriptomic assays (RNAseq) indicated that both genes are heavily expressed (RPKM of 18591&#x000b1;5029 and 5756&#x000b1;220 for Hsero_4295 and Hsero_3696, respectively), corresponding to the highest expressed OmpC-like and OmpA-like coding genes in <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> under the assay conditions. Interaction of PHB of short chain (cPHB) with <italic>E. coli</italic> OmpA and its potential role on protein sorting and folding has been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075066-Reusch1">[36]</xref> which could explain the binding of these <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> proteins to PHB granules upon extraction.</p><p>The conserved hypothetical protein Hsero_4241, a minor component of the PHB granule proteins, contains the domains CYTH (adenylyl cyclase family) and CHAD (conserved histidine &#x003b1;-helical domain) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075066-Iyer1">[37]</xref> with significant scores as determined by the Pfam analysis. The CHAD domain contains histidines that are predicted to either chelate metals or act as phosphoaceptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075066-Iyer1">[37]</xref>, and proteins containing domains CYTH-CHAD, as Hsero_4142, are thought to be organo-phosphate-recognizing enzymes that may have an active role in nucleotide and polyphosphate metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075066-Iyer1">[37]</xref>.</p><p>Interestingly, the aconitase AcnA was identified attached to PHB granules in <italic>H. seropedicae</italic>. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the presence of an aconitase is reported on PHB granules. Aconitases can occur in two forms in bacteria. Under iron-replete condition they are catalytically active, containing a [4Fe-4S] cluster, but under iron-starvation or when the concentration of reactive oxygen species increases, the [4Fe-4S] cluster is lost and the apo-aconitase is formed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075066-Green1">[38]</xref>. Gupta and co-workers have shown that the apo-aconitase from <italic>E. coli</italic> has its surface hydrophobicity increased and that GroEL rescues the apo-protein from aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075066-Gupta1">[39]</xref>. In this case, due the hydrophobicity of PHB, it is possible that the aconitase could bind to the granules non-specifically. Conversely, if one considers that the active aconitase is associated, it is expected that the sequestration by PHB may have metabolic consequences to the cell, mainly through modulation of metabolic flux of the TCA cycle.</p><p>The extraction of native granules by mild manipulation in glycerol gradients, associated with mass spectrometry analysis allowed identification of known and new proteins associated with PHB granules from <italic>H. seropedicae</italic>. Although contamination with proteins not related to PHB metabolism could not be ruled out, we decide to analyze those proteins found at higher concentration with the PHB granules, in order to minimize proteins unspecifically bound to PHB granule. Moreover the identified proteins were also compared to those previously described in the total proteome as well as the membrane proteins of <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> wild type strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075066-Huergo1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075066-Chaves1">[40]</xref>. Except for PhaP1 (Hsero_1639) and PhbF (Hsero_2997), none of the proteins identified in this work has been described before using a proteome approach, suggesting a lower overall amount when compared to the whole protein sample or those found within the cellular membrane. These reinforces the specificity of the proteins described in this work related to PHB metabolism.</p><p>Among the different proteins identified are those which have been previously found to be involved in <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> PHB-metabolism such as PhbC1, PhaZ1 and PhaP1. This approach allowed us to determine the main proteins involved in synthesis and degradation as well as the main phasin coating PHB granule. <italic>&#x00394;phbC1</italic> is impaired in producing PHB while <italic>&#x00394;phaP1</italic> deletion mutant showed another protein with low similarity to phasin also associated with PHB. Besides those, novel proteins present in high amount associated with the PHB granule such as a histone-like protein HC2, aconitase AcnA, and a hypothetical protein containing the CYTH-CHAD organo-phosphate recognizing enzyme domains, are likely to play important roles in the metabolism of intracellular PHB granules. The function of these new players will be the object of future work to determine possible links in the PHB metabolism of <italic>H. seropedicae</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s4"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0075066.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>Proteins were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) in a MALDI ToF/ToF Autoflex II spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, USA using positive reflector mode, voltage aceleration of 20 kV, intervals of ion extraction of 150 ns and aquisition of 800&#x02013;3200 m/z.</bold> Spectra analyses were performed using the FlexAnalysis 3.0 (Bruker Daltonics).
