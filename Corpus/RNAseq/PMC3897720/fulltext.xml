The database is created using sequence of the cultivar Heinz 1706. High quality single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) sites between the genes of Heinz 1706 and the wild tomato <italic>S. pimpinellifolium</italic> LA1589 are also included. Genes are classified into different families. 5&#x02032;-upstream sequences (5&#x02032;-US) of all the genes and their tissue-specific expression profiles are provided. Sequences of the microRNA loci and their putative target genes are catalogued. Genes and 5&#x02032;-US show presence of SSRs and SNPs. SSRs located in the genomic, genic and 5&#x02032;-US can be analysed separately for the presence of any particular motif. Primer sequences for all the SSRs and flanking sequences for all the genic SNPs have been provided. TGRD is a user-friendly web-accessible relational database and uses CMAP viewer for graphical scanning of all the features. Integration and graphical presentation of important genomic information will facilitate better and easier use of tomato genome. TGRD can be accessed as an open source repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://59.163.192.91/tomato2/">http://59.163.192.91/tomato2/</ext-link>.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was financially supported by the core grant of National Institute of Plant Genome Research, New Delhi, India and the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India.

Tomato fruits are a rich source of carotenoid pigment, which is the precursor of vitamin A. Tomato has been used extensively for genetic studies because of several reasons such as, its diploid genome, short generation time, availability of homozygous inbred lines, efficient transformation technology and its genes are largely sequestered in contiguous euchromatic regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086387-Khush1">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086387-Zamir1">[10]</xref>. Apart from basic research, tomato is the second most-consumed vegetable in the world. Researchers from fourteen different countries together have published a reference genome sequence of an inbred tomato cultivar Heinz1706 and a draft sequence of wild tomato, <italic>Solanum pimpinellifolium</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086387-TomatoGenome1">[11]</xref>. These sequence information have provided the basic and applied researchers an opportunity to scout for gene function, genetic diversity and evolution not only in tomato, but also in other <italic>Solanaceae</italic> members, for studying basic biology and bio-diversity based breeding. The Sol genomics network (SGN) serves as the most referred host for storing and integrating most of the information on <italic>Solanaceae</italic> crops and is continuously developing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086387-Bombarely1">[12]</xref>. There has been existence of a number of other tomato databases on specific aspects even before the release of tomato genome such as, SolEST database, MoTo DB, Tomato functional genomics database, miSolRNA, TOMATOMA, KaTomicsDB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.kazusa.or.jp/tomato/">http://www.kazusa.or.jp/tomato/</ext-link>) and several others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086387-DAgostino1">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086387-Shirasawa1">[18]</xref>. These databases serve extensively as resources for genomic and biochemical information and biological material for the <italic>Solanaceae</italic> research community. However, there is a need to amalgamate different genomic and trait information together graphically along all the chromosomes of tomato in a single window to enable the basic and applied researchers to integrate and utilize all the information in a better and easier way.</p><p>Microsatellite markers (simple sequence repeats, SSRs) are important for various applications such as construction of high-density linkage maps, comparative genome mapping, identification of variety, marker-assisted selection, studying genetic diversity and so on. They are reliable because of high experimental reproducibility, multiallelic nature and co-dominant inheritance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086387-Kalia1">[19]</xref>. Simple sequence repeats (SSR) are the most popular microsatellite markers. Genes are the most important functional part of a genome and define the trait of an organism. Integration of SSRs with genes in a single window will allow the researchers to look for presence of SSRs in the coding, non-coding and the upstream activating sequences of a gene and subsequently for intra- and inter-species polymorphism. Genetic variation of a trait within a species can be attributed to a single gene or joint action of many genes that can be mapped on the genome (QTL, Quantitative trait loci) by genetic markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086387-Causse1">[20]</xref>. Integration of well-known QTLs with the genes and SSRs along chromosomal length will provide the users an easier access to the genes and SSRs co-localizing with a QTL. Changes in gene expression may lead to phenotypic differences between two individuals. Apart from transcriptional regulation, gene expression can be regulated at various stages including through microRNAs (miRNAs). Several studies demonstrated that development and metabolism of plants are regulated by miRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086387-Chen1">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086387-RubioSomoza1">[23]</xref>. miRNAs might also have potential role in transgressive phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086387-Shivaprasad1">[24]</xref>. Therefore, inclusion of tissue-specific expression of genes, miRNAs and their predicted target genes together with SSRs, genes and QTLs would be useful. Small and red-fruited <italic>Solanum pimpinellifolium</italic> is the closest wild relative of domesticated tomato. Introgression lines for <italic>S. pimpinellifolium</italic> in the background of cultivated tomato are used for mapping different traits. There is a 0.6% nucleotide divergence between the inbred cultivar Heinz1706 and the <italic>S. pimpinellifolium</italic> accession LA1589. This huge resource of SNPs, especially in the genic region, would immensely benefit the breeders to utilize the natural trait reservoir for crop improvement. In view of above, we have integrated SSRs, genes, miRNAs, known QTLs and SNPs between the sequenced cultivated and wild tomato accessions in a single window along the length of all the twelve chromosomes of tomato.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sequence Retrieval</title><p>S. <italic>lycopersicum</italic> Heinz 1706 reference genome sequence, raw sequence reads of <italic>S. pimpinellifolium</italic> LA1589, latest annotation (ITAG 2.3), and gff files were downloaded from Sol genomics network database (SGN) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.solgenomics.net">www.solgenomics.net</ext-link>).

Similarly, 510 R genes are subdivided into eight families including the receptor like protein kinases. Chromosome 4 contains the highest number (85) of R genes. Functional genomics involves tissue-specific and treatment-specific expression of genes at different developmental stages of plants to predict function of a gene. We analyzed RNAseq data of tomato to reveal tissue-specific expression profiles of tomato genes. Hierarchical expression of all the genes in a family in leaf, root, flower and matured green fruit is provided in the form of heat maps and in RPKM values for individual genes. Total 6404 genes did not show any expression in these four tissues at these developmental stages. 73 genes were found to express preferentially in leaf while 665, 442 and 43 genes were found to express preferentially in root, flower and mature green fruit, respectively, at the specific developmental stage as mentioned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086387-g004">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0086387.s005">table S2</xref>). Physical positions of all the genes in a family can be viewed under this tab and, therefore, paralogous genes can be identified. Further, functional divergence of the genes present in collinear blocks can be analyzed from expression data as shown for two collinear blocks on chromosome 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086387-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Integrated with QTL map, physical map of the genes provide an opportunity to associate candidate genes with important agronomic traits. 887 genes yet to be assigned to the chromosomes were listed with their detail under chromosome zero separately.</p><fig id="pone-0086387-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0086387.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Heat map showing genes preferentially/specifically expressed in four tissue samples.</title><p>The number of genes and tissue specificity is noted at the right side.

High quality genomic sequence reads of <italic>S. pimpinellifolium</italic> were mapped to the tomato reference genome. Stringent filtering criteria were applied to extract highly probable SNPs between these two accessions. Total 2,971,025 high quality SNPs were obtained of which 290,445 are in protein-coding genes. Chromosome 7 and 12 possesses the highest (5361/Mb) and lowest (2551/Mb) frequencies of SNPs, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0086387.s006">table S3</xref>). Frequency distribution of genomic and genic SNPs and genes in each million base interval were plotted for each chromosome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0086387.s002">figures S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0086387.s003">S3</xref>) for better understanding of SNP distribution across chromosomes and especially in euchromatic regions.

Comparison of distributions of genes and genic SNPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0086387.s003">figure S3</xref>) identified ten regions of 1 Mb interval with twenty or more SNPs per gene and all these regions are in the low-gene heterochromatin regions of the respective chromosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0086387.s007">table S4</xref>). A list of genes containing more than ten SNPs is listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0086387.s008">table S5</xref>. Most of them encode unknown proteins. Three genes encoding calcium-transporting ATPase, two encoding WD-repeat proteins and one encoding receptor-like protein kinase are among the annotated high SNP-containing protein-coding genes. All the genic SNPs are anchored to their respective locations in each chromosome and can be accessed directly from map or from the genes. Flanking sequences of 100-base length for each SNP are provided for designing primers to convert them as markers.</p><p>The genic SNPs identified can be utilized in finding allelic variation of known genes of economic importance and may initiate new studies. As an example, fruit size locus <italic>fw2.2</italic> is one of the QTLs selected during tomato domestication and accounts for as much as 30% of the difference between the fruit sizes of small-fruited wild <italic>S. pennellii</italic> and large-fruited domesticated <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086387-Tanksley1">[44]</xref>. <italic>fw2.2</italic> corresponds to a gene (Solyc02g090730.2.1, Chr 02&#x02236;46830407-46831197) that encodes a protein &#x02018;Cell number regulator 1&#x02032; having structural similarity to human oncogene <italic>Ras</italic>. Of 42 SNPs between two alleles, only three SNPs change three amino acids within first nine residues of the protein. Therefore, the allelic variation in <italic>fw2.2</italic> was thought to modulate fruit size by differentially regulating carpel cell number due to differential expression of two genes rather than structural differences in proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086387-Frary1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086387-Cong1">[46]</xref>. Sequence comparison of Solyc02g090730.2.1 of domesticated Heinz1706 and another small-fruited wild <italic>S. pimpinellifolium</italic> LA1589 detected only two SNPs in the open reading frame. Of them, only one (SNP-Chr-02-23437), common for both <italic>S. pennellii</italic> and <italic>S. pimpinellifolium</italic>, changes the third amino acid. However, the 5&#x02032;-upstream sequence (2 kb from translation start site), which regulates transcriptional expression of a gene, showed twenty one structural variations between Heinz1706 and LA1589, of which 15 are SNPs and six are in-dels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0086387.s009">table S6</xref>).

However, use of different mapping populations for QTL mapping hinders unified physical localization of multiple QTLs on a single physical map. We tried to anchor some QTLs to tomato chromosomes according to the physical locations of their flanking markers. We used QTLs described in SGN QTL map. This map is based on a mapping population derived from a cherry tomato line Cervil and a round large-fruited line Levovil, which was different from the mapping population (<italic>S. lycopersicum</italic> M82 X <italic>L. pennellii</italic> LA716) used for EXPEN2000 map <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086387-Causse1">[20]</xref>. Hence, the boundaries of QTLs could not be delineated accurately due to unavailability of sequence-characterized flanking genetic markers. The nearest sequence-characterized genetic markers or the corresponding EXPEN2000 genetic locations were, therefore, used to physically localize the QTLs, which resulted in assignment of a little wider physical length than the actual. Following this approach we could localize fifty-four QTLs to eight chromosomes. According to the recombination nodule frequency map the assigned QTLs are in high recombination frequency regions of the corresponding chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086387-TomatoGenome1">[11]</xref>. Diseases caused by different bacteria, fungus and viruses tremendously attenuate yield potential of tomato. Resistance loci associated with diseases caused by Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (<italic>Ty1/3</italic>), <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> (<italic>Pto</italic>), <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic> (<italic>Bs4</italic>), <italic>Cladosporium fulvum</italic> (<italic>Cf-9</italic>), Verticillium albo-atrum (<italic>Ve</italic>) and root knot nematode (<italic>Mi</italic>) were identified by map-based cloning (32&#x02013;37). Physical locations of these pathogen-resistance loci, as derived from their marker or gene sequences, were also shown on the map as references.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Tomato genome sequence has created a huge impact on <italic>Solanaceae</italic> research. The reference genome is increasingly being used for sequence-based approaches to answer basic biological questions of plant development as well as for agricultural improvement of fruit quality and quantity. Although several databases for tomato in addition to SGN exist, we tried to provide the most sought-after basic information about a genome in TGRD in a user-friendly way and we feel that graphical presentation of this important genomic information will facilitate a better use of tomato genome. A tutorial with graphical and video description has been provided for better use of the site. Regulation of gene expression is equally important as the gene sequence in influencing traits of an organism. For this reason we provided 2 kb-long 5&#x02032;-upstream sequences with all the genes. Incorporation of SSR- and SNP-information within this region will be useful in exploiting intra- and inter-specific polymorphic sequences in studying functional divergence of homologous genes. Focus of the breeding programs carried out in the last century has been on increase in yield while fruit quality traits did not receive proper importance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086387-Klee1">[47]</xref>. Improvement in traits such as, flavor, taste and nutrient content is challenging because these are regulated by biochemically complex processes. Recent advances in mapping some of the QTLs for these traits will lead to our understanding of these complex traits. Availability of tomato genome sequence and effort to assign physical locations of some of the flavor-related QTLs on the reference genome integrated with SSRs and SNPs in TGRD may facilitate biochemical characterization of these traits. Transcriptome sequences of a few wild relatives of tomato are now available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086387-Koenig1">[48]</xref>. We will keep on updating our site by incorporating SNP data of those wild accessions once their genome sequence data are available to allow robust mining of SNPs with stringent filtering criteria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0086387.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>Description of schema used to construct tomato genome database.</bold></p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0086387.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0086387.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p><bold>Graphical distribution of frequency of genomic (in black) and genic (in red) SNPs between Heinz1706 and LA1589 in each million base interval of each chromosome.</bold></p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0086387.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0086387.s003"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><p><bold>Graphical distribution of frequency of genic SNPs (in red) between Heinz1706 and LA1589 and genes (in black) in each million base interval of each chromosome.</bold></p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0086387.s003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0086387.s004"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p><bold>Chromosome-wise and motif-wise distribution of simple sequence repeats in tomato genome.</bold></p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0086387.s004.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0086387.s005"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p><bold>Genes preferentially/specifically expressed in each tissue sample, as compared to others in a tissue-by-tissue comparison.</bold> Genes showing at least two-fold change (upregulated above the blank cell and downregulated below the blank cell) as compared to the other tissue samples were given.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0086387.s005.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0086387.s006"><label>Table S3</label><caption><p><bold>Chromosome-wise distribution and frequency of single nucleotide polymorphic sites between </bold><bold><italic>S. lycopersicum</italic></bold><bold> Heinz1706 and </bold><bold><italic>S. pimpinellifolium</italic></bold><bold> LA1589.</bold></p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0086387.s006.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0086387.s007"><label>Table S4</label><caption><p><bold>Genomic regions showing high frequency of SNP per gene in 1 Mb interval between </bold><bold><italic>S. lycopersicum</italic></bold><bold> Heinz1706 and </bold><bold><italic>S. pimpinellifolium</italic></bold><bold> LA1589.</bold></p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0086387.s007.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0086387.s008"><label>Table S5</label><caption><p><bold>A list of genes containing ten or more SNPs (between </bold><bold><italic>S. lycopersicum</italic></bold><bold> Heinz1706 and </bold><bold><italic>S. pimpinellifolium</italic></bold><bold> LA1589).</bold></p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0086387.s008.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0086387.s009"><label>Table S6</label><caption><p><bold>Structural variations between </bold><bold><italic>S. lycopersicum</italic></bold><bold> Heinz1706 and </bold><bold><italic>S. pimpinellifolium</italic></bold><bold> LA1589 in the 5&#x02032;-upstream region of gene &#x02018;Cell number regulator 1&#x02032; (Solyc02g090730.2.1).</bold></p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0086387.s009.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Acknowledgement is due to the Director, National Institute of Plant Genome Research, New Delhi, India (NIPGR) for providing facilities.
