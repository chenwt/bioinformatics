In this study, we evaluated whether the analysis of the gene expression profile of skin-migrated dendritic cells (DCs) could be informative for the <italic>in vitro</italic> prediction of immunogenicity of vaccine, using canine adenovirus serotype 2 (CAV2) as vaccine vector. CAV2 has been shown to induce immunity to transgenes in several species including sheep and is an interesting alternative to human adenovirus-based vectors, based on the safety records of the parental strain in dogs and the lack of pre-existing immunity in non-host species. Skin-migrated DCs were collected from pseudo-afferent lymph in sheep. Both the CD11b<sup>+</sup> -type and CD103<sup>+</sup> -type skin-migrated DCs were transduced by CAV2. An analysis of the global gene response to CAV2 in the two skin DC subsets showed that the gene response in CD11b<sup>+</sup> -type DCs was far higher and broader than in the CD103<sup>+</sup> -type DCs. A newly released integrative analytic tool from Ingenuity systems revealed that the CAV2-modulated genes in the CD11b<sup>+</sup> -type DCs clustered in several activated immunogenicity-related functions, such as immune response, immune cell trafficking and inflammation. Thus gene profiling in skin-migrated DC <italic>in vitro</italic> indicates that the CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC type is more responsive to CAV2 than the CD103<sup>+</sup> DC type, and provides valuable information to help in evaluating and possibly improving viral vector vaccine effectiveness.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Agence Nationale pour la Recherche (VacGenDC ANR 06 GANI 015-03; PhylogenDC, ANR 09 BLAN 0073).

We reasoned that because dendritic cells (DCs) are key actor cells in bridging the innate and adaptive immune systems, their early gene response might offer an <italic>in vitro</italic> evaluation tool of vaccine vector immunogenicity. In support of this proposal, a recent study showed that the gene expression profile of bone marrow-derived sheep DCs in response to recombinant myxoma virus vectors included many genes that were previously shown to predict vaccine efficacy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Top1">[3]</xref>.

Skin-migrated DCs can be obtained from human or animal skin explants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-deGruijl1">[6]</xref> and from afferent lymph in species that are amenable to lymph duct catheterization (ruminants, pigs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Epardaud1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Marquet1">[8]</xref>. In sheep, skin-migrated DCs collected from pseudo-afferent lymph include two major subsets, the CD26<sup>+</sup> SIRP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and CD26<sup>&#x02212;</sup> SIRP<sup>+</sup> DCs that were shown to be homologous to the mouse CD8<sup>+</sup>&#x003b1;/CD103<sup>+</sup> DC and CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC types respectively, based on transcriptomic and functional assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Contreras1">[9]</xref>. The CD26<sup>+</sup> SIRP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DC subset is specialized in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation in mixed leukocyte reactions and in soluble antigen cross-presentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Contreras1">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Canine adenovirus serotype 2 (CAV2) is one of the most attractive non-human adenovirus for use as a recombinant vaccine vector <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Kremer1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Perreau1">[11]</xref>. CAV2 represents an alternative to the largely documented human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) vector whose clinical application is impaired due to the frequent pre-existing immunity that interferes with the development of the desired immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Benlahrech1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Lindsay1">[13]</xref>; furthermore, in the context of regulatory constraints in many countries, non-human adenoviruses are likely to be preferred over Ad5 as vaccine platforms for veterinary species. Wild type CAV2 has been used since over 30 years to vaccinate dogs against the Rubarth Hepatitis and has proven to be safe in dogs. A non replicative CAV2 (Cav R<sup>0</sup>) has been generated by deletion of the E1 gene and has been documented to efficiently transduce neurons and to be poorly inflammatory in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Keriel1">[14]</xref>. Several studies document its effectiveness as a recombinant vaccine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Bru1">[15]</xref>. For instance, recombinant CAV2 encoding for the Gn protein of the Seoul virus provided long-term immunity against this Hantavirus in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Yuan1">[16]</xref>. Furthermore recombinant CAV2 encoding for the rabies G protein induced protective immunity to rabies in dogs, cats, pigs and sheep with high levels of neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Hu1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Hu2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Liu1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-BouetCararo1">[20]</xref>. The demonstrated immunogenicity of CAV2 and the availability of skin-migrated DCs in sheep led us to assess the gene response profiling of DCs to vaccine vectors in this model system. We found that CAV2 transduced both the CD11b<sup>+</sup> and the CD103<sup>+</sup> -type DCs <italic>in vitro,</italic> with a slightly higher efficiency in the later, but only the CD11b<sup>+</sup>-type DC subset presented a broad pattern of gene responses to CAV2 that is associated to dendritic cell maturation, communication between innate and adaptive immune cells, immune cell trafficking, and immune response. Thus our data suggest that the skin-migrated gene response could be used as an <italic>in vitro</italic> tool to help in vaccine design and evaluation of effectiveness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Recombinant CAV2 Vectors</title><p>The replication-deficient CAV2 vectors used in this study were derived from the Manhattan strain that was deleted of the E1 region.

The ovine microarray has been partially annotated by the SIGENAE group (INRA - SIGENAE [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sigenae.org/">http://www.sigenae.org/</ext-link>]).

The molecules from the CAV2-modulated gene data set were associated with Biological Functions in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. Right&#x02010;tailed Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was used to calculate a p&#x02010;value determining the probability that each biological function assigned to the data set is due to chance alone. In addition, the recently released version of IPA offers functional annotations of downstream effects of gene expression data. The downstream effect analysis of IPA examines genes in the dataset that are known to affect biological function and compares their direction of change to what is expected from the literature. When the direction of change is consistent with the literature across the majority of genes, then the function is predicted to be increased in the biological sample (z-score &#x0003e; 2), whereas if the direction of change is mostly anti&#x02010;correlated with the literature then the function is predicted to be decreased in the biological sample (z-score &#x0003c; -2).</p><p>The CAV2-modulated gene data set was also subjected to the Ingenuity Canonical Pathway Analysis that identifies the pathways from the IPA Knowledge Base library of canonical pathways that are most significant to the data set. The significance of the association between the data set and the canonical pathway was measured in 2 ways: 1) A ratio of the number of molecules from the data set that map to the pathway divided by the total number of molecules that map to the canonical pathway is displayed. 2) Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was used to calculate a p&#x02010;value determining the probability that the association between the genes in the dataset and the canonical pathway is explained by chance alone.</p><p>Finally, the CAV-2 modulated gene data set was overlaid onto a global molecular network developed from information contained in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. Networks were algorythmically generated based on their connectivity. Molecules are represented as nodes and the biological relationship between two nodes is represented as a line. All lines are supported by at least one reference from the literature from a textbook, or from canonical information stored in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. The intensity of the node color indicates the degree of up&#x02010; (red) regulation.

Mo-DCs and skin-migrated DCs are distinct DC types: the later originate from common DC precursors in the bone marrow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Kushwah1">[30]</xref>, whereas the former are derived from monocytes cultured with GM-CSF and IL-4 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Indeed several groups have reported that skin-derived DCs, and especially skin-migrated DCs, are more permissive to Ad5 or Ad35 transduction than Mo-DCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-deGruijl1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Adams1">[31]</xref>. Furthermore, skin-migrated DCs from cattle were previously found to be highly susceptible to Ad5 transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-CubillosZapata1">[25]</xref>. Difference of species (human/sheep) may also explain the discrepancy of the results for CAV2 transduction in sheep skin-migrated and human Mo-DCs, that may implicate differences in viral receptors and/or intracellular trafficking. For instance Ad35 shows species-specific interactions with target cells, due to the selective expression of its receptor CD46 in primate cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Verhaagh1">[32]</xref>. Nevertheless, the percent of sheep skin lymph DCs transduced by CAV2 remained relatively low in the two CD103<sup>+</sup> and CD11b<sup>+</sup> -type DCs (6.2 and 3.6 % respectively). Of note, the increase in co-stimulatory molecules expression could be detected in the overall DC population cultured with CAV2, much beyond the limited fraction of transduced cells. Thus it is likely that CAV2 activates DCs via sensing mechanisms that do not require complete transduction by the vector. Indeed UV-inactivated Ad5 activates DCs to the same extent as non UV-irradiated Ad5 for the production of inflammatory cytokines and NF-&#x003ba;B activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Morelli1">[33]</xref>. Sensors such as the heparin-sensitive adenovirus receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Cheng1">[34]</xref>, TLR9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Lindsay1">[13]</xref> and the helicase DDX41 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Zhang1">[35]</xref> that are involved in Ad5 sensing need to be tested for their implication in CAV2 signaling in DCs.</p><p>The direct transduction of skin-migrated DCs by CAV2 observed in our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments may participate in CAV2 immunogenicity but may not be the key mechanism of CAV2 vector immunogenicity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Indeed in the case of Ad5 in mice, DCs were required for induction of immunity to transgene but their direct transduction seemed not to be required for inducing immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Henning1">[36]</xref>. In addition Hangalapura et al documented that Ad5 essentially transduced non DC cells when given intradermally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Hangalapura1">[37]</xref>. The preferential transduction of non DC cells may possibly due to their expression of the Coxsachie and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR), the Ad5 primary receptor, whereas DCs do not express CAR and use a not yet defined fiber shaft receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Cheng1">[34]</xref>. In the case of CAV2 that also utilizes CAR to transduce epithelial and neuronal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Soudais1">[38]</xref>, the transduction of non DC cells in the skin may play an important role in its immunogenicity, leading to cross presentation by the DCs in the lymph node <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Henning1">[36]</xref>. Notably the general activation of the skin-migrated DCs by CAV2, that we report here, may allow the proper priming of DCs for triggering efficient antigen presentation both after their direct transduction and after capture of non DC transduced cell fragments (cross presentation).</p><p>The distinct capacities of the two skin-migrated DC subsets to induce gene responses to CAV2 cannot be explained by difference in transduction efficiency because CD103<sup>+</sup> -type DCs are better transduced by CAV2 than are the CD11b<sup>+</sup> -type DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052513-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). We can not exclude that technical artifacts such as differential response/activation to sorting conditions or differential timing for optimal response explain the differences of the DC subset response to CAV. However despite limited global gene activation in response to CAV2, the CD103<sup>+</sup> -type DCs still presented their intrinsic properties, with higher IL-12p40 mRNA basal levels and further increase upon CAV2 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052513-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). In addition, several genes were induced under our CAV2 activating conditions in the CD103<sup>+</sup> -type DCs, at the same or higher extent than in the CD11b<sup>+</sup> -type DCs (<italic>IL12p40, PDZK1, TACC3, CKS1B, MBP, IL8, IRF7, IRF1,</italic>
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0052513.s003">Table S1</xref> ) supporting that the CD103<sup>+</sup> -type DCs kept its functionality and capacity for being activated. Indeed the CD103<sup>+</sup> -type DCs were efficient at activating antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells upon CAV2 stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0052513.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). In addition, the viability of both DC subsets cultured with CAV2 is similar (&#x0003e;90% as measured by 7-Amino-Actinomycin D exclusion, data not shown) and both subsets show similar z-scores for the cell death function in the 2 subsets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0052513-t001">Table 1</xref>). The higher and broader gene response to CAV2 stimulation encountered in the CD11b<sup>+</sup> -type DCs might be explained by the different expression of viral sensors in the two subsets. Indeed murine CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> and CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Edwards1">[39]</xref> and sheep lymph DC subsets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Nalubamba1">[40]</xref> express different sets of TLR receptors. In addition, murine CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DCs largely lack the receptors required to sense certain viruses in the cytoplasm, such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Luber1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052513-Buschow1">[42]</xref>. However we could not detect consistent differences between the two lymph DC subsets in the mRNA expression of known adenovirus sensors, (our microarray data, not shown). Other yet unknown adenovirus sensors may be involved, and proteomic studies are also needed to detect differences of sensor expression.</p><p>Our data suggest that the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcriptomic signature of DCs in response to vaccines may bring information on the possible downstream immunogenicity. This approach brings complementary information to classical functional <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. Indeed, while a direct antigen presentation assay by CAV2-transduced CD103<sup>+</sup> and CD11b<sup>+</sup> -type DCs showed a slightly higher efficiency of the later DC type for stimulating antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, the transcriptomic analysis provided a broad information on the global DC subset activation by the vector, that may be even more pertinent if indirect antigen presentation is concerned. Indeed the transcriptomic signature unraveled that CAV2-stimulated CD11b<sup>+</sup> -type DCs for B and T cell activation and immune cell trafficking. The signature that we obtained here would be strengthened and completed by using RNAseq strategy as the limited array available for sheep studies probably bias the results. Finally subsequent studies need to be conducted to establish gene expression signatures in DCs <italic>in vitro</italic> that predict the magnitude of the immune response using formal training and validation test processes. These transcriptomic signatures may vary with vectors and vaccine formulations. DC gene response signatures to different vaccine vectors and formulas may importantly help in vaccine improvement.</p><p>Altogether, this work indicates that CAV2 activates the CD11c<sup>+</sup> -type and not the CD103<sup>+</sup> -type DCs to express a transcriptomic signature related to stimulation of immune response. Thus the analysis of the DC gene responses <italic>in vitro</italic> stands as an interesting and convenient assay to evaluate and possibly improve vaccine effectiveness. The <italic>in vitro</italic> innate gene response of DCs combined to other parameters such as the strength and duration of transgene expression, structural analyses of predictive antigenicity of the transgene-encoded protein, and classical immunological functional assays could altogether allow prediction of downstream immunogenicity and offer new avenues to reasoned vaccine developments, while reducing the number of animal tests.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0052513.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>CD103<sup>+</sup> -like and CD11b<sup>+</sup> -type DCs induce antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses upon transduction with Cav-NS1 R<sup>0</sup> and Cav-VP7 R<sup>0</sup>.</bold> CD103<sup>+</sup> and CD11b<sup>+</sup> -type DCs (2&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup>) were cytometry-sorted from sheep #61 and pulsed overnight with Cav-NS1 R<sup>0</sup> and Cav-VP7 R<sup>0</sup> (BTV label), with Cav-null R<sup>0</sup> (null label) or left alone (- label).
