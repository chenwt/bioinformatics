Here, a sRNA library of mature seeds and three mRNA libraries from three different seed development stages were generated by deep sequencing to identify and characterize the miRNAs and pre-miRNAs of <italic>J. curcas</italic>. Computational analysis was used for the identification of 180 conserved miRNAs and 41 precursors (pre-miRNAs) as well as 16 novel pre-miRNAs. The predicted miRNA target genes are involved in a broad range of physiological functions, including cellular structure, nuclear function, translation, transport, hormone synthesis, defense<bold>,</bold> and lipid metabolism. Some pre-miRNA and miRNA targets vary in abundance between the three stages of seed development. A search for sequences that produce siRNA was performed, and the results indicated that <italic>J. curcas</italic> siRNAs play a role in nuclear functions, transport, catalytic processes and disease resistance. This study presents the first large scale identification of <italic>J. curcas</italic> miRNAs and their targets in mature seeds based on deep sequencing, and it contributes to a functional understanding of these miRNAs.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e Tencol&#x000f3;gico - CNPq grants numbers (559636/2009-1 and 307868/2011-7), Ministerio de Ci&#x000ea;ncia e Tecnologia - MCT and Coordena&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Aperfei&#x000e7;oamento de Pessoal de N&#x000ed;vel Superior- CAPES.

Thus, environmentally friendly sources of fuels, such as bioethanol and biodiesel, are promising alternatives for fossil fuels. In this context, great interest has been generated regarding the potential of <italic>Jatropha curcas</italic> L. for biodiesel production. This species belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is found in almost all tropical areas; it occurs on a large scale in tropical and temperate regions <xref rid="pone.0083727-Carels1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083727-Divakara1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. <italic>J. curcas</italic> has potential for biodiesel production because it is perennial, drought-resistant and has a high oil content (&#x0223c;40%). Additionally, this crop can be grown in degraded soils (non-agricultural lands), which controls erosion without competing for food production habitats <xref rid="pone.0083727-Berchmans1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083727-Becker1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>In spite of having the potential for high fuel production, improving the quality of <italic>J. curcas</italic> seed oil remains challenging. The desired traits include increased oil content, decreased unsaturated fatty acid content (to increase the oxidative stability), decreased free fatty acid content (to prevent soap formation and increase biodiesel productivity) and decreased 18 carbon fatty acid content (to reduce viscosity) <xref rid="pone.0083727-King1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Furthermore, reducing seed toxicity and increasing pest tolerance are also desirable <xref rid="pone.0083727-Carels1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083727-King1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression <xref rid="pone.0083727-Filipowicz1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. They are typically transcribed by RNA Polymerase II as long polyadenylated transcripts, with an imperfect stem-loop structure known as pri-miRNA, which is recognized and processed by DICER-Like1 (DCL1) into an miRNA precursor (pre-miRNA). This sequence is further processed to generate mature miRNAs, which are composed of single-stranded RNA molecules of approximately 21 nucleotides (nt) in length <xref rid="pone.0083727-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0083727-Voinnet1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. To regulate protein-coding genes, the mature miRNA binds to sites in the 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; untranslated regions (UTR) or the coding sequence (CDS), leading to mRNA degradation or translational inhibition, depending on the degree of complementarity between the miRNA and its target transcript <xref rid="pone.0083727-Bartel1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083727-Huntzinger1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.

One study used a small RNA cloning methodology and did not provide the precursor sequence from Jatropha <xref rid="pone.0083727-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The other study used known plant miRNAs from Viridiplantae to search for <italic>J. curcas</italic> miRNAs in publicly available EST and GSS databases; therefore, only conserved miRNAs were identified by this approach <xref rid="pone.0083727-Vishwakarma1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In the present study, conserved and novel miRNAs from <italic>J. curcas</italic> were identified through the deep sequencing of small RNAs (sRNA) from mature seeds. The targets of these miRNAs were predicted <italic>in silico</italic>, and the results indicate that miRNAs are involved in a wide range of physiological processes in seeds, including growth, hormone signaling, stress resistance and lipid metabolism, among others. In addition, polyadenylated transcript sequencing (mRNA-seq) libraries from three seed development stages (immature, intermediate and mature) were used to identify and characterize the abundance of pre-miRNAs and miRNA targets, providing important information related to regulatory timing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>J. curcas</italic> Seed Collection and RNA Isolation</title><p>For the RNA isolation, fruits from <italic>J. curcas</italic> plants grown in an open environment at Embrapa Clima Temperado (Pelotas, RS, Brazil) were collected at 10&#x02013;20 (immature seeds), 20&#x02013;40 (intermediate seeds) and 40&#x02013;60 (mature seeds) days after flower opening (DAF).

Sequences were considered to be pre-miRNA if the RNA sequence could form an appropriate stem-loop structure with a mature miRNA sitting in one arm of the hairpin structure; the secondary structure had a high negative minimum folding free energy (MFE, 17&#x02013;110 kcal/mol), using RNAstructure 5.3 <xref rid="pone.0083727-Mathews1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, and a high negative minimum folding free energy index (MFEI, higher than 0.5). All putative pre-miRNAs were verified by a BLASTn algorithm from NCBI databases and the miRBase database (Release 19, August 2012).

For reference, all identified pre-miRNAs in this study were used. The SAM files from Bowtie were then processed, as discussed above. The scaling normalization method proposed by Robinson and Oshlack <xref rid="pone.0083727-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> was used for data normalization. Both R packages, EdgeR <xref rid="pone.0083727-Robinson2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and A&#x02013;C test <xref rid="pone.0083727-Audic1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, were independently used to assess whether the pre-miRNA was differentially represented. In brief, EdgeR uses a negative binomial model to estimate the over dispersion from the pre-miRNA count. The dispersion parameter of each pre-miRNA was estimated by tagwise dispersion. The differential expression is then assessed for each pre-miRNA by using an adapted exact test for over dispersed data. The A-C test computes the probability that two independent counts of the same pre-miRNA came from similar samples. Pre-miRNAs were considered to be differentially represented if they had a p-value &#x02264;0.001 in both statistical tests.

To identify homologous miRNAs in the <italic>J. curcas</italic> sRNA library, a set of 2,585 unique mature plant miRNA sequences were extracted from the miRBase database and used for alignment against the sRNA library. Only sequences with exactly the same size and nucleotide composition were considered. A strict criterion of sharply defined distribution patterns for one or two block-like anchored sRNAs and at least 10 reads of a single miRNA sequence were used to predict novel miRNAs (see methods). The read depth distribution along putative pre-miRNAs was previously shown to be a reliable guide for differentiating possible miRNAs from contaminant sequences, such as the degradation products of mRNAs or transcripts that are simultaneously expressed in both sense and antisense orientations <xref rid="pone.0083727-Krbes1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083727-Schreiber1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083727-Guzman1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.

Overall, the Jcu_MIR167 family was the most abundant conserved miRNA family present in <italic>J. curcas</italic> seeds, accounting for 842,066 reads, and the largest families were Jcu_MIR156 and Jcu_MIR166, with 23 and 21 members, respectively. Of the remaining miRNA families, 19 contained between 2 to 8 members, and 16 were represented by a single member (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083727-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083727.s005">Table S2</xref>). Furthermore, the results indicate that different members of the same miRNA family have clearly different expression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083727.s005">Table S2</xref>). For example, Jcu_MIR166 presents members ranging from 1 to 35,439 reads. Interestingly, the conserved miRNAs represented the most abundant <italic>J. curcas</italic> miRNAs and were distributed throughout seven families (MIR156, MIR157, MIR159, MIR166, MIR167, MIR168 and MIR396). These abundant miRNA families are largely found in Viridiplantae, indicating a fundamental role in plant life maintenance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083727.s005">Table S2</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0083727-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0083727.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Known miRNA families identified in mature <italic>J. curcas</italic> seeds.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The total number of miRNA members (isomiRNAs) from each miRNA family.

Two (Jcu_MIR166_3p and Jcu_MIR167_5p) of them were also identified in the present study, and three conserved miRNAs were identified only in the library from leaves. Moreover, the miRNA JcumiR004, which was identified as a novel plant miRNA, according to Wang et al. <xref rid="pone.0083727-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, was annotated in the present study as Jcu_MIR171_5p because the mature sequence showed a perfect match with the MIR171 from several species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083727.s005">Table S2</xref>, sequence UGAUUGAGCCGUGCCAAUAUC). Therefore, the discrepancies in identifying conserved miRNAs from the present study and the one performed by Wang et al. <xref rid="pone.0083727-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> correspond mostly to a difference in selected tissues and methods. During the cloning approach, there was a chance miRNAs with low expression level would not be detected. A more recent work by Vishwakarma and Jadeja <xref rid="pone.0083727-Vishwakarma1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> also focused on the identification of conserved miRNAs from <italic>J. curcas</italic> after transcript and partial genome sequence analysis. These authors were able to identify 24 predicted miRNAs belonging to five miRNA families (Jcu_MIR166, Jcu_MIR167, Jcu_MIR1096, Jcu_MIR5368 and Jcu_MIR5021). A lower number of miRNA families were identified by these authors relative to the present study, most likely because they used known plant miRNAs from Viridiplantae to search the conserved <italic>J. curcas</italic> miRNAs homologs in publicly available (and relatively small) EST and GSS databases compared to the database from the RNAseq generated in the present study.</p><p>To identify putative conserved pre-miRNA sequences, the sRNA library was matched against a set of <italic>de novo</italic> assembled contigs from three developmental stages of <italic>J. curcas</italic> seeds (L1&#x02013;L2&#x02013;L3 library). The candidate pre-miRNAs were predicted by exploring the secondary structure, the minimum folding free energy (MFE) and the minimum folding free energy index (MFEI). Candidate mRNA sequences with a stem-loop hairpin structure showing MFE values of 40&#x02013;100 kcal/mol, MFEI values higher than 0.85 and more than 10 miRNA reads anchored in the same orientation in the 5p and/or 3p arm in a two block-like pattern were considered putative pre-miRNAs. The precursor identity was determined by BLAST searches against mature miRNAs in miRBase and the NCBI database. As a result, 41 known full-length plant pre-miRNA sequences were identified along with 18 miRNAs anchored in the 3p-arm and 19 miRNAs in the 5p-arm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083727.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The precursors had an average length of 154 bp, a CG content of 43.45%, an MFE of &#x02212;53.13 and an MFEI of &#x02212;0.86 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083727.s006">Table S3</xref>), which were similar to the pre-miRNA characteristics in other plant species <xref rid="pone.0083727-Krbes1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083727-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083727-Sunkar1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.

Ten miRNAs were anchored in the 3p-arm and 15 miRNAs in the 5p-arm of these pre-miRNAs. The most abundant novel miRNA yielded 11,899 reads (Jcu_nMIR001), and it is the sixth most abundant miRNA in <italic>J. curcas</italic>, suggesting an important role in this tissue. The majority of novel miRNAs are 21 nt longer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083727.s008">Table S5</xref>), as was observed for conserved miRNAs.

IsomiRNAs are considered to be a consequence of inaccuracies in Dicer pre-miRNA processing. Length heterogeneity can also arise by the exonuclease &#x02018;nibbling&#x02019; of the ends, which produces a shorter template product, or by the post-transcriptional addition of one or more bases <xref rid="pone.0083727-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In the present study, the alignment of the sRNA library with identified <italic>J. curcas</italic> pre-miRNAs allowed for the estimation of the number and abundance of each isomiRNA corresponding to conserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083727.s005">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083727.s002">Figure S2</xref>) and novel <italic>J. curcas</italic> miRNA families (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083727.s003">Figure S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083727.s008">Table S5</xref>).</p><p>IsomiRNAs were produced from both known and novel predicted pre-miRNAs of <italic>J. curcas</italic>. It was possible to observe that miRNA families differ significantly from each other in the number and abundance of isomiRNAs, as was observed in other studies <xref rid="pone.0083727-Krbes1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083727-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083727-Sunkar1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The known pre-miRNA Jcu_MIR168 and the novel pre-miRNA Jcu_nMIR001 produced more isomiRNAs than the other pre-miRNAs. Unexpectedly, a variant of the novel Jcu_nMIR001 showed more than 10,000 reads because species-specific miRNAs usually present low levels of expression compared to the conserved miRNAs. The predicted targets of Jcu_nMIR001 miRNA are ribosomal proteins, which could explain the high abundance of this miRNA. It is also interesting to note that in some conserved miRNA families, the most abundant miRNA was not the canonical miRNA described for other species. This wide variation suggests that the same miRNA family is involved in divergent functions and may be necessary at different levels, according to the species, timing, tissue and/or other situations, such as environmental conditions and stresses. It has been shown that isomiRNAs can be expressed in a cell-specific manner, and numerous recent studies suggest that at least some isomiRNAs may affect target selection, miRNA stability, or loading into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) <xref rid="pone.0083727-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Abundance of <italic>J. curcas</italic> Pre-miRNAs during Seed Development</title><p>Because pre-miRNAs are processed as mRNAs species, <italic>in silico</italic> approaches can be used as a reliable tool for estimating the abundance of pre-miRNAs. Although this analysis does not directly predict the abundance of mature miRNA or the isomiRNAs, the number of precursor sequences present in seed developmental stages can provide information about the overall variation of the miRNA set generated from each precursor. The abundance analysis revealed that the majority of pre-miRNAs were present at similar levels in all libraries, suggesting that they are necessary during all seed development processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083727.s006">Tables S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083727.s004">S4</xref>). Nevertheless, the abundance of some pre-miRNAs varied from one library to another, suggesting that the miRNAs from these precursors may be associated with the mRNA silencing involved in specific seed stage process, such as growth or maturation. Among the pre-miRNAs that were differentially represented, Jcu_MIR390 was only detected in L3 seeds; Jcu_MIR169a was only detected in L2 seeds; Jcu_MIR167a, Jcu_MIR172 and Jcu_MIR845 were only detected in L1 seeds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083727.s006">Table S3</xref>); Jcu_MIR156d, Jcu_MIR167b and Jcu_MIR319 were better represented in the L2 and L3 libraries; and Jcu_MIR390 was better represented in L3. Among the novel <italic>J. curcas</italic> miRNAs, Jcu_nMIR001 was better represented at the beginning of seed development, and Jcu_nMIR003, Jcu_nMIR007 and Jcu_nMIR016 were more represented in the intermediate seed stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083727.s007">Table S4</xref>). It is also important to note that some novel pre-miRNAs were highly abundant, such as Jcu_nMIR001, which was the most expressed precursor during immature and mature seed stages, and Jcu_nMIR003, which was the most expressed in the intermediate stage, indicating that they play an important role in this plant. In summary, the prediction of pre-miRNA abundance among libraries increased the understanding and implications of post-transcriptional regulation in <italic>J. curcas</italic> seeds.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>siRNA in <italic>J. curcas</italic> Seeds</title><p>In contrast to the biogenesis and action of miRNA, siRNAs are 24-nt long sequences produced by double-stranded RNAs that can act at the transcriptional level through DNA methylation and histone modification and at the post-transcriptional level through the regulation of gene expression <xref rid="pone.0083727-Carthew1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.

Because of the large abundance of 24-nt sequences in the <italic>J. curcas</italic> sRNA library, we investigated the presence of siRNAs. The sRNAs that were 24 nt were matched against contigs assembled from L1&#x02013;L2&#x02013;L3 libraries. Putative contigs with typical sRNA distribution patterns along the matching sequences were further subjected to annotation (see methods). As a result, 42 siRNA precursors were identified and annotated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083727.s009">Table S6</xref>). This analysis indicates that siRNAs play a role in nuclear functions and in transport, catalytic processes and disease resistance. As expected, transposons and retroelements were relatively abundant among siRNA precursors, supporting their mechanism of action in guide chromatin-based events and resulting in transcriptional silencing <xref rid="pone.0083727-He2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. It was reported that siRNA precursors can also be formed by cellular RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity (RdRp) <xref rid="pone.0083727-Ahlquist1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. In fact, most <italic>J. curcas</italic> siRNA precursors were annotated as RdRps.

In this study, the putative target genes of <italic>J. curcas</italic> miRNAs were predicted by using the web-based computer server psRNATarget, based on perfect or near perfect complementarity between miRNAs and their targets. The most abundant mature miRNAs from each family (isomiRNAs were not considered) were aligned with a set of unigenes generated from assembled <italic>J. curcas</italic> contigs from all seed development mRNA-seq libraries (L1&#x02013;L2&#x02013;L3). A total of 57 sequences were predicted as potential targets of 28 known plant miRNAs and 12 novel miRNAs, with an average of 1.8 targets per miRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083727.s010">Table S7</xref>).</p><p>All of the identified targets were analyzed by using BLASTX against protein databases, followed by a GO analysis to evaluate their putative functions. According to the categorized GO annotation, 109 genes are involved in cellular components, with the majority of conserved and novel miRNA targets localized in intracellular membrane-bounded organelles. In the molecular functions category, 107 genes participate in catalytic or signaling transduction activities and binding activities with proteins and nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083727-g003">Figure 3</xref>). With respect to biological processes, 216 genes primarily participate in stimulus responses and different cellular and metabolic processes, suggesting that the novel and conserved <italic>J. curcas</italic> miRNAs are involved in a broad range of physiological functions. These functions include participation in plant growth and development (pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein, auxin response factor 10, seed maturation protein, etc.), lipid metabolism (phosphatidylserine decarboxylase and glycerophosphoryl diester), nutrient/cellular transport (amino acid transporter, high affinity nitrate transporter, metal transporter nramp6-like, etc.), and, primarily, in defense (tir-nbs-lrr resistance protein, cc-nbs-lrr resistance protein, cytosolic class I small heat shock protein partial, proline synthetase associated, dehydration responsive element binding proteins, etc.) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083727.s010">Table S7</xref>). The miRNAs targets were differentially represented during seed development, suggesting that they are regulated according to seed needs. For example, caffeoyl-o-methyltransferase and seed maturation protein are the most represented targets at the end of seed development, and subtilisin-like protease-like and auxin response factor 10 are better represented at the beginning of seed development than the other targets.</p><fig id="pone-0083727-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0083727.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Targets of the miRNAs identified in mature seeds of <italic>J. curcas</italic>.</title><p>The percentage (%) of contigs for each Gene Ontology (GO) term is relative to the total number of contigs from each gene category.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0083727.g003"/></fig><p>The auxin response factor (ARF) is a plant-specific family of DNA binding proteins involved in hormone signal transduction <xref rid="pone.0083727-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083727-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.

These genes, as well as some other predicted targets, such as proteins associated with nucleotide synthesis, ribosomal proteins, metal transporters and membrane proteins, may play a role in seed growth and formation. Another important gene targeted by Jcu_MIR156, Jcu_MIR168, Jcu_MIR403, Jcu_MIR472 and the novel Jcu_nMIR005 and Jcu_nMIR009 is the pentatricopeptide repeat gene (PPR), which participates in the regulation of gene expression and was present at considerable levels in all seed developmental stages, especially immature <italic>J. curcas</italic> seeds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083727.s010">Table S7</xref>).

DRE/CRT has been identified as a cis-acting element involved in one of the ABA independent regulatory systems of abiotic stress response.

Glycerophosphoryl diester (predicted target of Jcu_MIR001) and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (predicted target of Jcu_MIR403) provide glycerol-3-phosphate for TAG assembly in the Kennedy pathway, and they were also more represented in intermediate seeds.
