For the last hundred years, the use of petroleum has been possible due to a balance between supply and demand. However, the increased consumption of energy has created an environment where need could begin to exceed supplies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Perhaps even more important are the environmental impacts of petroleum consumption. In terms of carbon, the fossil fuels consumed in one year release 44&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>18</sup>&#x02009;g of carbon, and this is 400-fold the amount of annual carbon fixed during net primary productivity by the global biota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This is a massive influx of carbon into the atmosphere mediated through the burning and consumption of petroleum-based products, and it is becoming increasingly clear that renewable biofuels (<italic>e.g.</italic>, ethanol, butanol, H<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, biodiesel) are needed to help replace petroleum-dependence in the United States and the world. However, while present technology can be used to help circumvent and reverse current environmental trends, both fundamental and applied research is needed to advance the feasibility and utility of renewable energy sources that use direct phototrophic CO<sub>2</sub>-fixation into liquid biofuels.</p><p>Diatoms are a diverse group of eukaryotic unicellular microalgae that account for up to 40% of the total marine primary production each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In addition to photoautotrophic growth (<italic>i.e.</italic>, carbon fixation via sunlight), some green algae and diatoms can store carbon and energy in the form of lipids (<italic>i.e.</italic>, triacylglycerides, TAGs), and this fact has re-invigorated the possibilities of algal oil being used for the production of liquid fuels. Chisti (2007) estimates that biodiesel from microalgae would only take 3% of the arable crop land in the U.S. to replace 50% of the country&#x02019;s liquid transportation fuel needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Courchensne et. al. 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] reviewed many of the efforts focused on increasing microalgal lipid production, including biogeochemical and genetic approaches. Although we understand many aspects of carbon assimilation in diatoms, the direct responses and contributive flow of inorganic carbon to lipid accumulation are not known for many eukaryotic photoautotrophs under different growth conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Most approaches have had some success, but there is still much work to be done to fully understand the efficient and economical enhancement of lipid production in microalgae.</p><p>The marine diatom, <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum,</italic> is classified in the phylum <italic>Bacillariophyta</italic>, and this phylum comprises one-third of all known marine phytoplankton. <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> is a chlorophyll c-containing alga known as a heterokont [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and has been studied as a &#x02018;model&#x02019; diatom in the context of physiology, biochemistry, and genomics. <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> is a pleomorphic diatom that has been isolated and classified into 10 different strains over the last century based upon genetic and phenotypic differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> 8.6 (CCAP 1055/1; CCMP2561; strain Pt1) has a major morphotype of fusiform and was selected for whole genome sequence determination. The Pt1 strain has a 27.4&#x02009;Mb genome with over 10,000 predicted genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and the chloroplast genome sequence has also been determined (117,000&#x02009;bp; 162 genes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This wealth of genomic knowledge has revealed the evolutionary lineage of diatoms and has also uncovered the physiological potential of lipid-accumulating diatoms and green algae. Accompanying the sequenced genomes are over 130,000 ESTs (Expressed Sequence Tags) from 16 different growth conditions of <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and the data is compiled in the Diatom EST Database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>This extensive research background is the foundation for using Pt1 as a model diatom system to better understand cellular responses during lipid-accumulation under different growth conditions. Nutrient deficiency or nutrient stress has been well documented to increase TAG accumulation in microalgae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Specifically, nitrogen- or phosphate-limitation can increase lipid accumulation in numerous microalgae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and TAG accumulation in <italic>Phaeodactylum</italic> has been studied under nitrogen depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In the current study we used the model diatom, <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> strain Pt1, to characterize global gene expression via RNA-seq during enhanced lipid production as a consequence of nitrogen- and phosphate-depletion.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Depletion of nitrate and phosphate</title><p>Sodium nitrate and potassium phosphate were the only sources of nitrogen or phosphorus available during growth of <italic>P. tricornutum,</italic> and ASPII medium was used as recently described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The exogenous nitrate and phosphate was monitored daily to determine nutrient availability. The classic Redfield ratio of nitrogen/phosphorus (N/P) is 16:1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] in phytoplankton, however it can be dependent on the source of nitrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The growth medium in the described experiments had a N:P ratio of approximately 20.5:1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Growth parameters and gene expression were measured at three time points, early-exponential (Q1), transition from exponential to stationary-phase (Q2), and stationary-phase (Q3). The growth data (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>a) suggested that nitrogen and not phosphate depletion coincided with the onset of stationary-phase. Exogenous phosphate was depleted after 72&#x02009;h, but exponential growth continued for another 24&#x02009;h. At 96&#x02009;h, the exogenous nitrate was depleted and cells transitioned to stationary-phase within one doubling-period. At this time, a decrease in chlorophyll a content was observed ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1), and these results suggest a recycling of nitrogen rich compounds (<italic>e.g</italic>., chlorophyll). Similar results have been observed during nitrogen depletion in the green alga, <italic>Neochloris oleoabundans</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Elemental analysis ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S1) revealed that cells in nutrient-replete Q1 had a N:P ratio of 4:1, but with the depletion of both exogenous nitrate and phosphate, cellular N:P ratios shifted to 8:1 and 9:1 in Q2 and Q3, respectively. These results indicate that under the tested growth conditions of a starting exogenous N:P ratio of 20.5:1, cells transitioned to stationary-phase at an approximate cellular N:P ratio of 8 to 9.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Growth characterization of</bold><bold><italic>P. tricornutum</italic></bold>.

Exogenous DIC declined during the exponential growth phase, and the decline continued past the depletion of exogenous nitrate and phosphate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>b). The decline in DIC followed cell accumulation during exponential-growth. At the onset of nitrate depletion, the light-phase DIC remained low for approximately 25&#x02009;h, and these results suggested the culture consumed the DIC at the mass transfer rate from the air-sparge. The DIC began to increase when the cells entered stationary-phase. The DIC levels at Q3 (approximately 50&#x02009;h after the depletion of nitrate) increased back to similar levels observed at the initiation of growth (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). These results indicate lower carbon fixation under nutrient-deprivation and that biological activity was no longer limited by DIC mass transfer.</p></sec><sec><title>Lipid-accumulation under nutrient stress</title><p>Throughout <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> growth, lipid accumulation was monitored via the Nile Red (NR) assay as a way to measure relative abundance of triacylglycerols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The NR fluorescent intensities increased significantly as the cells transitioned to stationary-phase (approximately 95&#x02009;h under the tested growth conditions; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The specific NR fluorescence (NR fluorescence intensity/cell) continued to increase after 96&#x02009;h and these results indicate that the lipid accumulation was not merely a result of increasing cell numbers. After nutrient depletion, the NR specific fluorescence increased 4.5-fold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>a), and the increased fluorescence coincided with a cessation of population growth (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>a). The data indicate that lipids started to increase as exogenous phosphate was depleted, but the rate (specific NR fluorescence/time) increased upon nitrate depletion (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>b and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). A previous study reported that phosphate limitation could increase lipid content in <italic>P. tricornutum,</italic> but not green flagellates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Our results suggest that depletion of exogenous phosphate might be an early trigger for lipid accumulation that is magnified upon nitrate depletion; and therefore, the N:P ratio could be an important parameter to monitor when examining mechanisms of lipid accumulation.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Characterization of lipid accumulation in</bold><bold><italic>P. tricornutum</italic></bold><bold>during increase in Nile Red fluorescence intensity (&#x025a0;) with respect to cell number (&#x025b2;) (A).</bold> Nile Red fluorescence intensity indicating the increase in lipids is shown with the depletion of external nitrate (&#x025cb;) and phosphate (<bold>&#x025ca;</bold>) <bold>(B)</bold>.

This increase in lipid accumulation could also be characterized in context of the increased cellular carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N). At Q1 and Q2, the C:N ratio was 7.5:1 and 6.5:1, respectively, which is similar to the Redfield C:N ratio of 6.6. However, as lipids accumulated, the C:N ratio increased to 15.4:1, and previous studies have documented a similar increase in the C:N ratio after exogenous nitrate depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Thus, elemental analysis indicated continued carbon influx after exogenous N and P depletion. In addition, specific cellular carbohydrate (&#x003bc;g carbohydrate/cell) did not increase ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Figure S2), and intracellular lipid droplets were observed via epifluorescent microscopy ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Figure S3).</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of RNA-sequence data</title><p>A time course assessment strategy was employed to identify transcripts that were differentially expressed during growth and lipid accumulation from early-exponential (Q1), late-exponential (Q2), and stationary-phase cells (Q3) in conjunction with pH, nutrient availability, light, DIC, cell number, protein, carbohydrate, and lipid. Cultures were sampled in duplicate for each time point, total RNA extracted, and each sample sequenced via an individual lane of Illumina sequence determination. RNA-sequence analysis was used to globally monitor gene expression during nutrient-depletion and lipid accumulation under the tested growth conditions. Using TopHat and Cufflinks (see Materials and Methods), the transcript relative abundance was calculated and reported as FPKMs (Fragments Per Kilobase of exon per Million fragments mapped), a normalized quantity that is directly proportional to transcript abundance as recently reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. To compare transcript levels between the time points, Q2 and Q3 were reported as the relative ratio compared to Q1. The Q1 time point was considered the basal transcript level condition in which cells were growing exponentially under nutrient-replete conditions with low lipid levels.</p><p>Based upon work in bacteria, transcript and protein abundances are not necessarily correlated, although some genes can show similar transcript and protein trends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Therefore, different data sets (<italic>i.e</italic>., transcript and protein) can reveal key aspects of the physiological state of the cells. Previous studies have shown differences between transcript and protein abundances for selected genes in diatoms and yeasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] while a recent <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> study showed similar abundance trends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The presented data are based upon transcript abundances although other mechanisms of control most likely contribute to overall metabolism.</p></sec><sec><title>Global transcript differential expression</title><p>Each sample (<italic>i.e</italic>., biological replicate) was sequenced on a respective Illumina lane with an average of 31 million reads per sample (1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;54 nucleotides). Cufflinks assembled 30,373 transcripts to 10,125 mapped loci, and 1,259 genes were expressed at statistically significant levels (approximately 12.5% of the genome) at all three time points ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>: Table S2). Of all significant genes, approximately 180 genes were differentially expressed between all three time points, 546 genes between any two time points, and 177 genes between only two time points. Genes annotated as hypothetical proteins represented 37% of the significantly expressed genes (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;465). For example, the third most abundant transcript detected in Q2/Q1 (500-fold; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) and Q3/Q1 (136-fold; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) is a gene of unknown function (55010) that is annotated as a pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylase. The putative <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> protein has significant sequence homology (44%; 6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>-159</sup>) with a coccolith-scale associated protein-1 (AB537972.1) from <italic>Pleurochrysis carterae</italic>. <italic>P. carterae</italic> has been shown to accumulate lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. While the exact role of this putative protein in <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> is not known, it is interesting to speculate a possible role in inorganic carbon homeostasis.</p><p>Approximately 170 transcripts that showed significant changes in abundance were mapped with respect to major carbon pathways and cellular compartmentalization for Q2/Q1 and Q3/Q1 and included nitrogen metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, photosynthesis, glycolysis, TCA cycle, and fatty acid metabolism (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, respectively). A majority of the up-expressed genes during exponential-growth phase (Q2) were involved with nitrate and phosphate acquisition or utilization (<italic>e.g.</italic>, nitrate transporter, phosphate transporter, nitrite transporter, nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase, and putative aspartate aminotransferase). Similar genes and/or functions remained up-expressed during transition to stationary-phase at Q3, but up-expressed genes also included a putative nucleotidase and alkaline phosphatases. The nucleotidase and alkaline phosphatases may be further responses to nutrient deprivation in order to sequester and recycle both nitrogen and phosphate. The largest down-expression at Q2 was the presumptive plastidic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which may coincide with a decline in photosynthetic carbon flow from 3-phosphoglycerate and phosphoglyceraldehyde phosphate to pentoses and hexoses. Light-harvesting complexes were also significantly down-expressed at Q2, and genes involved in light-harvesting complexes continued to be down-expressed into stationary-phase (Q3). These results suggest that overall energy-generation via light was down-expressed during the light cycle after exogenous N and P depletion.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Proposed cellular metabolic map for</bold><bold><italic>P. tricornutum</italic></bold><bold>during nutrient depletion and initial lipid accumulation as compared to nutrient replete conditions (Q2 vs. Q1).</bold> Differences in fold change are based on log<sub>2</sub> scale.

The up-expression of transporters coincided with enzymes that utilize ammonium ions for amino acid and nucleotide pools (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>a and 6b). Most of the transporters remained up-expressed in Q3, most likely as a response to continued nitrogen deprivation.

Glutamate dehydrogenase and both glutamine synthetases remained at similar up-expressed levels during Q2 and Q3 and these results suggest that the cells expressed the GS/GOGAT (glutamine synthetase/glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase) pathway for ammonia sequestration possibly to recycle intracellular nitrogenous compounds (<italic>e.g</italic>., proteins, chlorophyll).</p><p>When exogenous nitrogen was depleted and cells entered stationary-phase, chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> content decreased ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1) and this observation coincided with decreased gene expression for light-harvesting complex (LHC) genes (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

However, most of the photosynthetic reductase components did not decrease below exponential-phase levels, and this result may suggest a basal level of light-harvesting coupled to carbon fixation even during nutrient-deplete conditions. Photosynthetic transcripts were highly up-expressed in Q1 during nutrient replete conditions, but as depletion ensued and DIC consumption was high there was a metabolic shift to reduce overall photosynthesis via a decrease in Calvin cycle genes in the chloroplast.

Reinfelder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] recently published an extensive review on CCMs in eukaryotic marine phytoplankton. It is speculated that marine diatoms have two possible types of CCMs, a biophysical and a biochemical mechanism. A biophysical CCM is the direct transport of inorganic carbon across multiple membranes using transporters and carbonic anhydrases. The other mechanism for concentrating inorganic carbon around the plastid is the use of a C4- (four carbon intermediate) CCM. In a biochemical C4-CCM, relatively high affinity carboxylases fix inorganic carbon to a C3 intermediate and form C4 compounds that can be transported to the chloroplast. The C4 intermediates are then decarboxylated to deliver the inorganic carbon to the relatively low-affinity RubisCO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and the C3 intermediate is recycled for another round of carbon fixation In this sense, the CCM takes advantage of the C4 carboxylases low K<sub>m</sub> for inorganic carbon and affords the cell an additional mechanism to concentrate carbon. In the debate of C3 versus C4 in diatoms, evidence for both a biophysical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and biochemical CCM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] have been presented.

In the proposed model based upon gene expression, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is converted to pyruvate by pyruvate kinase_6 (mitochondria), and pyruvate is then carboxylated to oxaloacetate via pyruvate carboxylase <italic>(pyc_</italic>1, 30519) in the mitochondria. The oxaloacetate is converted to malate from an up-expressed (6-fold) malate dehydrogenase (<italic>mdh</italic>, 51297) in the mitochondria. The malate is decarboxylated by the malic enzyme (ME, 51970, B7FZD7) in the peroxisome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>a). The malic enzyme is up-expressed 8-fold, and sequence data suggest that the malic enzyme could be located in the peroxisome. Peroxisomal proteins usually have a c-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1) peptide consensus of (S/A/C)-(K/R/H)-(L/M) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. The c-terminus of the malic enzyme has a SKK motif, and thus may be targeted to the peroxisome.

For example, an acyl-ACP desaturase was up-expressed 7.4-fold and 3.5-fold in Q2 and Q3, respectively and may be involved in incorporation and/or production of unsaturated fatty acids.

In response to nitrogen and exogenous phosphate depletion, cells maintained up-expression of transcripts for nitrogen transport and assimilatory genes as well as presumptive phosphate transporters. Under the growth conditions tested, cell numbers continued to increase after the depletion of exogenous phosphate, and these results corroborated the notion that <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> can store internal phosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. The extracellular phosphate was depleted before nitrate, and Terry <italic>et al</italic>. (1985) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] surmised that the ability of <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> to accumulate nitrogen was extremely restricted during phosphate limitation. Lipids started to accumulate when exogenous phosphate was approximately half the initial levels and the external N:P ratio was approximately 27. The rate of lipid accumulation (specific NR fluorescence/time) increased (3.3-fold) once external nitrate was depleted. These results indicate that phosphate depletion could be an initial trigger for lipid accumulation that was &#x0201c;magnified&#x0201d; upon nitrate depletion in <italic>P. tricornutum</italic>.</p><p>The lipid accumulation at Q2 coincided with up-expression for acetyl-CoA carboxylase (<italic>acc</italic>_1) and 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase. At Q2, <italic>acc</italic>_1 was up-expressed 3.1-fold, the <italic>acc</italic> &#x003b2;-subunit was up-expressed 3.7-fold, and the acyltransferase was up-expressed 5.8-fold. However, the expression for these genes declined during Q3 when lipid was being accumulated at a faster rate (specific NR fluorescence/time). In addition, <italic>acc</italic>_2 was down-expressed 2-fold at Q2 and 5-fold at Q3. These results could suggest that carbon is being &#x0201c;pushed&#x0201d; into fatty acid synthesis via elevated acetyl-CoA and NADPH levels and thus not being &#x0201c;pulled&#x0201d; by a large abundance of fatty acid synthesis activity. While it is possible that protein levels are increased for fatty acid biosynthesis, the transcript data do not suggest this scenario.</p><p>A &#x0201c;push&#x0201d; condition is when flux processes occur prior to a pivot point (&#x0201c;hinge&#x0201d;), and a &#x0201c;pull&#x0201d; condition occurs following the &#x0201c;hinge&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. With respect to lipid accumulation, the &#x0201c;hinge&#x0201d; is the committed step in fatty acid biosynthesis (<italic>i.e</italic>., acetyl-CoA carboxylase), and we postulate that a &#x0201c;push&#x0201d; condition accounts for a significant portion of the metabolic flow based upon gene expression. If acetyl-CoA was being pulled, up-expression would be expected to be maintained throughout lipid accumulation (Q2 through Q3) for most fatty acid and TAG biosynthetic genes. This metabolic step has been tested by overexpression of <italic>acc</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], but overexpression did not result in an increase of overall lipid biosynthesis.</p><p>We conclude that during the transition from growth to lipid accumulation, <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> utilized pyruvate carboxylase in the mitochondria as the primary inorganic fixation step in a C4 pathway with subsequent decarboxylation of malate by the malic enzyme in the peroxisome to concentrate CO<sub>2</sub> for diffusion to the chloroplast. During the initial transition, exogenous DIC was low, and therefore, it appeared that a biochemical mechanism to concentrate carbon predominated. At the later time point (Q3), DIC levels had returned to initial levels, lipid accumulation continued, but two carbonic anhydrases (CA_6 and CA_7) were up-expressed. These results indicate that a biophysical carbon-concentrating mechanism then predominated to maintain carbon flow for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction during nutrient deprivation.</p><p>The cells appeared to continue CO<sub>2</sub> reduction when population growth was arrested and different carbon-concentrating mechanisms were used dependent upon exogenous DIC levels. The fixed carbon as C3 and/or C4 intermediates can then be &#x0201c;pushed&#x0201d; into fatty acid biosynthesis. Alternative pathways that could utilize HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> were also suggested by the gene expression profiles (<italic>e.g</italic>., propionyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA). In addition, a putative decarboxylase with sequence homology to a coccolith-associated protein was significantly up-expressed.

Further work is needed (proteomic, metabolomic, modeling) to provide more insight into metabolic control points that are crucial for the routing of fixed carbon into lipid accumulation by photoautotrophs, but our results based upon genome expression analysis suggested multiple routes for inorganic carbon flow during lipid accumulation. Future work includes proteomic analyses for the identification of key proteins and enzymes for lipid accumulation and storage, as well as metabolomic analysis, particularly in response to dissolved carbon. It will be advantageous to consider the type and level of inorganic carbon for bio-oil production systems and how different microalgae respond during autotrophic, lipid accumulation.

Cells were grown on a 14:10 light (450 &#x003bc;E<sup>-1</sup>sec<sup>-1</sup>):dark cycle at 20&#x02009; &#x000b0;C. Tubes were aerated with ambient air at a regulated flow rate of 0.40&#x02009;L min<sup>-1</sup> and CO<sub>2</sub> from air was the only available source of carbon for the diatoms. Initial inocula were grown in similar growth conditions and after two transfers were inoculated into photobioreactors during exponential-phase to a cell concentration of approximately 1x10<sup>5</sup> cells x mL<sup>-1</sup>. Contamination checks were performed using ASPII medium supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract and 0.5% glucose as well as plating on R2A agar. Cultures remained axenic throughout experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Physiological parameter analysis</title><p>Cells and media were collected and analyzed daily to measure chlorophyll <italic>a,</italic> pH, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), nitrate, phosphate, protein, carbohydrate, cell number, and Nile Red fluorescence. All measurements were done in triplicate. Cells (1&#x02009;mL) were collected daily via centrifugation (10,625&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;g, 10&#x02009;min) at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The supernatant was removed and stored for nitrate and phosphate analysis at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. For chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> extraction, 100% methanol (1&#x02009;mL) was added to the pellets followed by 30 seconds of mixing to extract chlorophyll <italic>a,</italic> and extracts were stored in the dark at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 24 hours. Cellular debris was pelleted (10,625&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;g, 10&#x02009;min) and the methanol extract was measured on a spectrophotometer. Absorbance was measured at 652&#x02009;nm and 665&#x02009;nm and concentrations (&#x003bc;g/mL) calculated using equations reviewed by Porra (2002) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Absorbance was measured on a spectrophotometer (UV-1700 PharmaSpec UV&#x02013;vis, Shimadzu). The medium pH was measured using a standard tabletop pH meter. Daily, cell culture (7&#x02009;mL) was filtered (0.2&#x02009;&#x003bc;m nylon membrane filters) in preparation for DIC measurement using a Formacs<sup>HT</sup> TOC/TN Analyzer (SKALAR, Buford, GA). The analysis of nitrate and phosphate were done by following the manufacturer&#x02019;s colorimetric assay protocols Szechrome NAS (Polysciences, Inc.) and SensoLyte MG Phosphate Assay Kit (AnaSpec), respectively. The absorbance measurements were taken on a 96-well plate spectrophotometer (Synergy HT, Biotek). Protein was extracted by boiling 1&#x02009;mL of pelleted (10,625&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;g, 10&#x02009;min) cells in 100&#x02009;mM (Tris&#x02013;HCl, 4% SDS, at pH 6.8) for 5&#x02009;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Proteins were precipitated overnight at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in 10% TCA/acetone. Precipitated protein was pelleted at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and supernatant was removed. Proteins were then washed with 100% acetone and re-pelleted. Supernatant was decanted and precipitated proteins were rehydrated in Tris&#x02013;HCl. Protein concentration was measured by a Qubit Protein Assay and the Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen). The analysis of carbohydrates was performed by following a modified monosaccharide protocol previously described by Chaplin et. al (1994) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Cells (1&#x02009;mL) were pelleted and the supernatant decanted, and L-cysteine HCl (1&#x02009;ml; 700&#x02009;mg/L) in cold sulfuric acid was added to cells, vortexed, and boiled at 100&#x000b0;C for 3 minutes. Samples were rapidly cooled on ice and absorbance measured at 415&#x02009;nm with a 96-well plate spectrophotometer (Synergy HT, Biotek).</p><p>For lipid accumulation, we followed the Nile Red assay protocol as previously described by Cooksey et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Cells were diluted with 1.8% NaCl (to minimize cell lysis) to an appropriate cell density that correlated to a linear relationship of cell density and Nile Red florescence that can be measured spectrofluorometrically. Nile Red (Sigma-Aldrich) solution (4 &#x003bc;L of 250&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL in acetone) was added to a cell suspension (1&#x02009;mL). Specific fluorescence was determined by dividing the Nile Red fluorescence intensity by the cell number. Cell density was monitored via cell counts in duplicate with a hemocytometer.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA sampling, extraction, and sequencing</title><p>RNA extraction was done in duplicate from seven identical photobioreactors. At early exponential phase (Q1), 1.5&#x02009;L of culture biomass (1&#x02009;L from 1 reactor plus 0.5&#x02009;L from a replicate reactor) were collected (10,625 x g, 10&#x02009;min at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) for each duplicate, the supernatant was discarded, and the collected cells were immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). The use of three reactors for duplicates were necessary due to the lower cell density in the early exponential-phase. The same collection procedure was used for late exponential (Q2) and stationary phases (Q3) when cell numbers were higher except that 1&#x02009;L was collected for each in duplicate. Flash frozen aliquots were stored at &#x02212;80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C until RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted following the Spectrum Total RNA kit (Sigma Aldrich-STRN50) protocol with on-column DNAase digestion using DNase10 (Sigma-Aldrich) as suggested by the manufacturer. Initial lysis was done by a 30 second cell disruption via sonication. The protocol was performed in an RNAse free-hood to prevent RNA degradation. Total RNA was not pooled but kept as respective duplicates, and samples were sent to the National Center for Genome Resources (NCGR, Santa Fe, NM). At NCGR, mRNA was isolated twice by polyadenylation purification, and first and second strand DNA was generated with random primers. Gel products were purified and PCR enriched. Products were quantified on a Nanodrop fluorometer (Thermo Scientific) and checked for quality on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent). Using Illumina&#x02019;s standard protocols, flow cell construction and sequence determination was performed. Each duplicate was run on a single lane (6 total samples, 3 duplicates). Single reads were put into FASTQ format for analysis.</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of temporal biomass sampling from replicate bioreactors.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1754-6834-5-40-9"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Transcript assembly</title><p>Single-end Illumina reads were analyzed using the following pipeline. First, reads from each sample were aligned against the <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> genome (v. 8) from ENSEMBL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>] with the TopHat algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. TopHat was configured to use known splice junctions for Pt1, as retrieved from genome annotation version 61 from ENSEMBL. Mapped reads were assembled into putative transcripts using Cufflinks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Abundance of each transcript was estimated in each sample then compared across samples using Cuffcompare and Cuffdiff, parts of the Cufflinks toolkit ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>: Table S2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Similar pipelines have been validated as well as the accuracy of RNA-seq with spike in experiments and qPCR comparisons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Transcript identification and pathway analysis</title><p>Cufflinks output files had transcripts identified by uniprot accessions. Using the DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>] Gene ID conversion tool, uniprot accessions were converted to Locus Tag IDs and Protein IDs. Once all accessions were converted, the DAVID Functional Annotation tool was used to retrieve gene names as well as KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) Pathway information. For genes that were identified as hypothetical proteins, searches were performed on the JGI <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic> v2.0 genome website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Phatr2/Phatr2.home.html">http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Phatr2/Phatr2.home.html</ext-link>) and based on best hits, %ID, score, and consistency of the top hits, genes were either identified or remained as hypothetical. Genes were also searched on NCBI and ENSEMBL genome browsers for cross-referencing. To assign genes into pathways, we used KEGG maps for <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> as a backbone. Genes for major pathways were searched manually to find genes not directly annotated in the <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> KEGG maps. Gene lists were compiled for the major pathways and developed into network maps.</p><p>Organelle targeting for transcript products was done based on annotations from the databases of JGI, NCBI, and ENSEMBL. If no localization was found, eukaryotic organelle localizations were predicted with TargetP 1.1. server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>] in both plant and non-plant mode. Amino acid sequences were also checked for a peroxisomal targeting sequence (SKL, serine-lysine-leucine). If potential targeting was not identified, we assumed that the gene product occurred in the cytoplasm. If the gene was an integral membrane protein we again checked JGI, NCBI, and ENSEMBL, and if targeting could not be determined we located the gene in the most biologically relevant membrane (<italic>e.g</italic>., light harvesting complex in the plastid).</p></sec><sec><title>Elemental analysis</title><p>To better understand the effects of nutrient limitation on lipid accumulation, the elemental carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus (C:N:P) composition was determined at Q1, Q2, and Q3. Cells were grown in the same conditions and harvested at the same time points at which RNAseq occurred. Cells were collected via centrifugation (10,625 x g, 10&#x02009;min at 4&#x000b0;C). Supernatant was discarded and concentrated cells were transferred to 50&#x02009;mL tubes and centrifuged (10,625 x g, 15 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C). Supernatant was discarded and pelleted cells were placed in a 60&#x000b0;C incubator to dry. Dried cells were sent to the University of Missouri Soil Testing and Plant Diagnostic Service Laboratories (Columbia, MO) for elemental analysis. Percentages of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus were used to calculate the C:N:P ratios in the cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>TAG, Triacylglyceride; NR, Nile Red; DIC, Dissolved Inorganic Carbon; CYC, Cyclin; CCAP, Culture Collection of Algae and Protozoa; CCMP, Formerly Culture Collection for Marine Phytoplankton, now NCMA, National Center for Marine Algae and Microbiota; Pt1, Phaeodactylum tricornutum strain 1; EST, Expressed Sequence Tag, RNA-seq, RNA-sequencing; FPKM, Fragments Per Kilobase of exon per Million reads; dsCYC, diatom specific cyclin; GS/GOGAT, Glutamine synthetase/glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase; LHC, Light harvesting complex; CCM, Carbon concentrating mechanism; C3, 3-carbon metabolite; C4, 4-carbon metabolite; PEP, Phosphoenolpyruvate; PYC, Pyruvate carboxylase; MDH, Malate dehydrogenase; ME, Malic Enzyme; PTS1, Peroxisomal targeting signal; pepc, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; RubisCO, Ribulose-1, 5-Bisphospate carboxylase oxygenase; TCA, Tri-carboxylic cycle; CA, Carbonic anhydrase; ACC, Acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ACP, Aceyl carrier protein; NADPH, Reduced form of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; ASPII, Aquatic Species Program; TCA/Acetone, Trichloroacetic acid in acetone; NCGR, Nation Center for Genome Resources; DAVID, Database for Annotation, Visulization, and Integrated Discover; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; SKL, Serine-lysine-leucine.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that there are no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>JV carried out growth, biomass harvest, activity assays, RNA extraction, participated in RNA-Seq data analysis, and drafted the manuscript.
