However, fully understanding the regulation and evolution of <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic> development in comparison to other animals requires a genomic perspective. Although research on <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic> has provided major new insights, gene analysis to date has been limited to candidate gene approaches. Furthermore, the few available EST collections are based on embryonic transcripts, which have not been systematically annotated and are unlikely to contain transcripts specific to post-embryonic stages of development. We therefore generated cDNA from pooled embryos representing all described embryonic stages, as well as post-embryonic stages including nymphs, larvae and adults, and using Illumina HiSeq technology obtained a total of 625,076,514 100-bp paired end reads. We combined these data with 24,360 ESTs available in GenBank, and 1,040,006 reads newly generated from 454 pyrosequencing of a mixed-stage embryo cDNA library. The combined sequence data were assembled using a custom <italic>de novo</italic> assembly strategy designed to optimize assembly product length, number of predicted transcripts, and proportion of raw reads incorporated into the assembly. The <italic>de novo</italic> assembly generated 446,427 contigs with an N50 of 1,875 bp. These sequences obtained 62,799 unique BLAST hits against the NCBI non-redundant protein data base, including putative orthologs to 8,917 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> genes based on best reciprocal BLAST hit identity compared with the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> proteome. Finally, we explored the utility of the transcriptome for RNA-Seq studies, and showed that this resource can be used as a mapping scaffold to detect differential gene expression in different cDNA libraries. This resource will therefore provide a platform for future genomic, gene expression and functional approaches using <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic>.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>MH was funded by the European Union via the Marie Curie RTN ZOONET (MRTN-CT-2004-005624) to WGMD.

Many evo-devo studies have focused on arthropods, the most speciose and diverse animal phylum. The largest sub-group of arthropods are the insects (e.g. flies, beetles) with approximately one million described species <xref rid="pone.0104885-Hamilton1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104885-degaard1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Together with the remaining sub-groups (myriapods, crustaceans and chelicerates) the arthropods as a whole comprise almost two thirds of all species on Earth <xref rid="pone.0104885-Purvis1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>To facilitate evo-devo research, a broader range of organisms than those traditionally used for laboratory work (often termed "emerging model" species), have been and continue to be established. Despite significant recent advances in gene expression and gene function methodology, the discovery of new and lineage specific developmental genes in emerging model organisms remains a bottleneck due to the difficulty of forward genetic screens and paucity of sequenced genomes for many such organisms. However, the advent and development of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies now offers solutions to this problem. NGS has been applied to sequence the transcriptomes and genomes of a number of emerging model arthropods. The majority of these are insects with 139 assembled genomes and more than 12 million DNA/RNA and EST sequences publicly available (National Center for Biotechnology Information, NCBI, search term &#x0201c;insecta&#x0201d;, as of February, 2014). For crustaceans three assembled genomes and approximately 2 million DNA/RNA and EST sequences have been submitted to NCBI, while for myriapods only one genome sequence and less than 15.000 DNA/RNA and EST sequences can be found in the NCBI database (NCBI, search terms &#x0201c;crustacea&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;myriapoda&#x0201d;, as of February, 2014). For the chelicerates, genomics and transcriptomics resources are available for several subgroups including horseshoe crabs (Xiphosura), mites (Acari), scorpions (Scorpiones) and spiders (Araneae) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104885.s004">Table S1</xref>). Two acari genomes (<italic>Tetranychus urticae</italic>; <xref rid="pone.0104885-Grbi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic>; <xref rid="pone.0104885-Hill1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104885-Vectorbase1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>), one horseshoe crab genome (<italic>Limulus polyphemus</italic>; <xref rid="pone.0104885-Nossa1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>) and one scorpion genome (<italic>Mesobuthus martensii</italic>; <xref rid="pone.0104885-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>) have been published to date. Recently genome assemblies for the African social velvet spider <italic>Stegodyphus mimosarum</italic> and the mygalomorph Brazilian white-knee tarantula <italic>Acanthoscurria geniculata</italic> have been published <xref rid="pone.0104885-Sanggaard1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Spiders have long been the subject of applied biological research aimed at elucidating toxin components <xref rid="pone.0104885-King1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, the biochemical basis of silk production <xref rid="pone.0104885-Omenetto1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, myosin assembly and muscle function <xref rid="pone.0104885-Woodhead1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and hemocyte antimicrobial substances <xref rid="pone.0104885-Lorenzini1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104885-Grigorian1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

Additionaly, the recently published genome sequences of two spider species and the accompanied transcriptomic data were mainly analyzed in detail with respect to venom and silk genes <xref rid="pone.0104885-Sanggaard1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Although these resources allow the identification of new genes involved in a given process, they all have in common that they are restricted to adult individuals and in some cases even to a specific organ or tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104885.s004">Table S1</xref>). Limited embryonic transcriptomic data is only available from the common house spider <italic>Parasteatoda tepidariorum</italic> (previously placed in the genus <italic>Achaearanea</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0104885-Kanayama1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104885-Oda1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However, these data comprise an incomplete set of EST sequences from a single embryonic stage. There is thus a need for a reference transcriptome with comprehensive coverage of multiple embryonic, post-embryonic, larval and adult stages of both sexes of a spider.</p><p>Research on spider developmental genetics has mainly focused on two species: the Central American wandering spider <italic>Cupiennius salei</italic> and the common house spider <italic>Parasteatoda tepidariorum</italic>. These efforts have resulted in valuable insight into spider developmental biology and its relation to the spider body plan <xref rid="pone.0104885-McGregor1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104885-Hilbrant1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Additionally, the basally branching position of chelicerates (including spiders) in the arthropod phylogenetic tree suggests that many findings in spiders will help to infer which developmental processes might be ancestral in arthropods and which ones are derived for a given group.</p><p>Two major reasons for the emergence and success of <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic> as the primary chelicerate model for developmental genetics research are its small size and short life cycle. Additionally, a number of essential methods have been established to investigate gene function <xref rid="pone.0104885-Hilbrant1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Detailed embryonic and postembryonic staging tables allow for exact descriptions of developmental processes <xref rid="pone.0104885-AkiyamaOda1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104885-Mittmann1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and protocols for immunocytochemistry and whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization are available to study cell proliferation, cell death and gene expression patterns <xref rid="pone.0104885-AkiyamaOda1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104885-Prpic1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104885-Pechmann1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Gene function can be studied by parental or embryonic RNA interference (RNAi) and recent advances include single cell injections that can be used to label and track cell clones or to achieve local misexpression or downregulation of genes <xref rid="pone.0104885-Kanayama1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104885-AkiyamaOda2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>Despite these advances, most recent studies have been constrained by the lack of comprehensive genomic or transcriptomic resources for <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic>. In the absence of such data, the study of genes involved in spider development has relied on the cloning of candidate genes hypothesized to be involved in the process of choice based on studies in model systems like <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. This leads to a bias towards more conserved genes and makes the discovery of new genes and novel regulatory interactions difficult. In order to overcome this candidate gene approach and to facilitate gene discovery in spiders, we have generated a reference transcriptome for <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic> that encompasses all developmental stages from embryonic to larval, nymphal and adult, and that aims to contain the majority of all mRNAs expressed from the <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic> genome during these stages.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sequencing and <italic>de novo</italic> assembly</title><p>For <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of a comprehensive <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic> transcriptome we used RNA extracted from all embryonic and postembryonic stages, including adult male and female specimens.

stages, adult male and female) cDNA library on two lanes of the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform, resulting in 332,245,126 embryonic and 292,831,388 postembryonic paired-end reads of 101 bp length each. To assemble the full transcriptome of <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic> as completely as possible (i.e. attempting to identify and fully sequence all existing transcripts from all life cycle stages) quality trimmed reads of the two Illumina libraries (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104885-t001">Table 1</xref>) were combined with the isotigs and singletons from the previous 454/EST assembly into a total of 366,721 transcripts using Velvet (version 1.2.08) and Oases (version 0.2.08) <xref rid="pone.0104885-Zerbino1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104885-Schulz1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>We found that 79,706 sequences longer than 110 bp originating from the 454/EST assembly ended up in the unused reads fraction of the Velvet/Oases assembly. We suspected that those 454/EST based transcripts were likely to represent embryonic transcripts or fragments thereof that did not pass the coverage cutoff set (-cov_cutoff 3) applied for the assembly. This could be due to a low number of Illumina reads supporting these long fragments, as well as to a low abundance of these long sequences itself. One further reason for the discrepancy between the 454/EST sequence set and the Illumina sequence set might be differences in library preparation and fundamental differences in processes like immobilization, cluster formation, elongation and imaging between the two sequencing platforms that we used <xref rid="pone.0104885-Metzker1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In a study by Luo et al. (2012) <xref rid="pone.0104885-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, more than 10% of all 454 reads were shown to be platform specific when compared to Illumina reads obtained from the same DNA sample, further supporting the hypothesis that the differences in the results obtained using the two technologies is due to platform-specific biases. Since it is likely that the almost 80,000 454/EST sequences represent real transcripts, these sequences were incorporated into the full assembly after the Velvet/Oases run, resulting in 446,427 transcripts composed of 274,224,393 bp with a N50 of 1875 bp (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104885-t002">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104885-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Apart from the 79,706 454/EST-only sequences, a number of Illumina reads also ended up in the unused reads fraction. In total, 171,286 high-quality Illumina reads were not incorporated into the final Velvet/Oases assembly. Since these reads were all shorter than 100 bp, they were omitted from the final assembly (termed "Assembly 3" in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104885-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). All transcripts of the final comprehensive assembly are accessible via the Assembled Searchable Giant Arthropod Read Database (ASGARD) (<xref rid="pone.0104885-Zeng1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://asgard.rc.fas.harvard.edu">http://asgard.rc.fas.harvard.edu</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>GC content and alternative splicing</title><p>The GC content of predicted open reading frames (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>) of the final assembly is 35.9%, which is a relatively low value compared to the coding sequence GC content of other arthropod genomes analyzed to date. These include the first 12 sequenced <italic>Drosophila</italic> genomes (47&#x02013;55%, <xref rid="pone.0104885-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>), as well as those of <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> (39%), <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic>, <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> (46%), <italic>Acyrthosiphon pisum</italic> (38%), <italic>Daphnia duplex</italic> (47%) <xref rid="pone.0104885-Gilbert1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104885-Gilbert2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <italic>Mesobuthus martensii</italic> (42.7%) <xref rid="pone.0104885-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and <italic>Tetranychus urticae</italic> (37.8%) <xref rid="pone.0104885-Grbi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The observed GC content is also low in comparison to estimates for coding sequences of various vertebrates like <italic>Danio rerio</italic> (47.9%), <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> (48.1%), <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (53.2%) and <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> (55.1%) <xref rid="pone.0104885-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. The significance of the low GC content of <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic> found in the transcriptome data is unclear. Generally it has been shown that coding regions are more GC-rich compared to surrounding genomic regions <xref rid="pone.0104885-EyreWalker1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104885-Lander1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. If this is true for <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic>, the GC content of the entire genome is expected to be much lower than the 35% observed for this transcriptome. A GC content of 30.3% for the entire final assembly including untranslated regions and potential non-coding RNAs supports this hypothesis. The GC content of coding sequences has also been shown to correlate positively with transcript length <xref rid="pone.0104885-Kudla1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and expression level of the respective locus <xref rid="pone.0104885-Oliver1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, suggesting that <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic> transcripts might tend to be shorter and that overall transcription activity is lower compared to other species.</p><p>Many <italic>de novo</italic> assembly algorithms attempt to predict alternatively spliced isoforms of a given transcript. As part of the Oases step, sequences that share high similarity are pooled into so-called loci. The transcripts within one locus ideally represent all RNA isoforms of the same gene <xref rid="pone.0104885-Schulz1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In order to estimate the accuracy of this clustering process, we analyzed the number and composition of loci in the final assembly. The 446,427 transcripts of the final assembly were clustered into 106,589 loci with on average 1.9 transcripts per locus. However, we observed that locus 1 encompasses 166,847 transcripts of various lengths and with very different gene predictions, showing that the similarity analysis performed by the Oases algorithm has its limitations and tends to combine unrelated transcripts if they do not match other loci defined by the algorithm. This effect might be related to the long-branch attraction artifact known from other similarity analyses that also use phylogenetic criteria for similarity <xref rid="pone.0104885-Felsenstein1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104885-Telford1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Another explanation for the prediction of highly complex loci might be the presence of sequencing errors, because transcripts that only differ by one nucleotide will be treated as two individual sequences of the same cluster. Since the RNA for the different libraries was extracted from various individuals at different time points (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>) it is also possible that naturally occurring polymorphisms contribute to the assembly of complex clusters. However, this effect might only account for a small portion of the complexity since the G&#x000f6;ttingen spider culture is inbred since at least 18 generations. Although locus 1 must be regarded as a computational artifact, there are other loci with higher numbers of transcripts that might be real: We found 13 loci with 100 or more transcripts and 3,909 loci with 10 or more transcripts. This data is supported by a recent detailed study of the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> transcriptome, which shows that 90% of all genes are transcribed into at least 10 transcripts and five isoforms <xref rid="pone.0104885-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Brown et al., even identified 47 genes that have the potential to code for more than 1,000 isoforms each, suggesting that highly complex loci as identified in our study might be real. In order to test this hypothesis, we analyzed the locus with the second most transcripts in detail (Locus 1038, 398 transcripts). 81.4% (324 of 398 transcripts) of these transcripts are shorter than 500 bp. Of these only 23 transcripts (7.1%) resulted in BLAST hits against nr. Of those transcripts longer than 500 bp (18.6%) nearly 50% (36 of 74 transcripts) resulted in a BLAST hit. In total, 14.8% (59 of 398 transcripts) resulted in a BLAST hit against nr with 22 different hits. The other twelve loci with more than 100 transcripts show a similar pattern with a high number of short transcripts and 3 to 25 different BLAST hits per locus (not shown). On one hand this data suggests that these loci are very complex because of the inclusion of many short transcripts. On the other hand, based on BLAST annotations, these clusters are likely to represent at least in part artificial clustering of transcripts. One general approach to reduce the complexity of the assembly for subsequent analyses is to retain only one transcript per locus <xref rid="pone.0104885-Chiara1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. However, if this method had been applied to the present assembly, over 166,000 transcripts would have been lost. Since our main aim was to provide a comprehensive transcriptome, we decided to keep all transcripts for further analysis. A complete analysis of isoform complexity will only be possible when the transcriptome data presented here are combined with genome sequences for genome annotation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Annotation of the final transcriptome</title><p>All transcripts of the final assembly were compared with the NCBI non-redundant protein database (nr) using BLASTX to estimate the number of unique transcripts in the obtained dataset. We found that 52.8% (235,588) of all transcripts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104885-t002">Table 2</xref>) showed similarity to at least one protein in the nr database, applying an E-value cutoff of 1e-5. On average 3.4 transcripts of the final assembly share the same hit against nr (maximum: 3,613; minimum: 1). Additionally, it is expected that many transcripts may show similarity to the same nr accession due to sequencing errors and the potential of the assembler to predict different isoforms. Therefore, we obtained the number of distinct nr accessions that mapped to at least one predicted transcript in the final assembly (defined as unique transcripts). This analysis revealed 62,799 unique transcripts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104885-t002">Table 2</xref>). A BLASTX search against the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> proteome (FB2011_03 Dmel Release 5.35; 23,361 protein sequences) with an E-value cutoff of 1e-10 identified 41,766 unique transcripts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104885-t002">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104885-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Applying a similar approach, only &#x0223c;40,000 unique transcripts were predicted for two spider species based on transcriptome analysis <xref rid="pone.0104885-Croucher1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. One reason for this discrepancy might be that this dataset is based on adult spiders, while the transcriptome presented here represents all developmental stages and both sexes. However, based on these results it is of course difficult to estimate the number of potential gene models present in the <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic> genome. The main reason is that in both protein databases used to identify unique transcripts, more than one protein sequence of the same locus might be present. Another source of uncertainty about the true number of gene models in <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic> might be the presence of incompletely assembled transcripts, especially those resulting from incorrectly assembled untranslated regions (UTRs), which could result in false positive BLAST hits. In addition, the high number of transcripts within some of the loci (see above) might artificially increase the apparent complexity of the transcriptome. Altogether, the present transcriptome analysis is likely to represent an overestimation of the actual gene number in genome. For the two recently published spider genomes the predicted number of gene models ranges from 27,235 in the velvet spider to &#x0223c;70,000 in the tarantula <xref rid="pone.0104885-Sanggaard1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.

A BLASTX search against the nr database with an E-value cutoff of 1e-10 resulted in 53,247 (11.9%) transcripts with and 393,180 (88.1%) transcripts without a BLAST hit respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104885.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>). Both sets of transcripts were queried against the PROSITE functional protein domain database <xref rid="pone.0104885-Sigrist1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104885-Sigrist2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> using an InterPro scan <xref rid="pone.0104885-Zdobnov1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104885-Quevillon1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>.

A comparison of these protein domains to those predicted for transcripts that showed BLAST hits against nr did not reveal a qualitative difference in the protein domains found in both datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104885.s001">Fig. S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104885.s005">Table S2</xref>).

Of the more than 440,000 transcripts in the final assembly, 75.8% (338,487 of 446,427) are shorter than 500 bp (see also below). Only 5.7% of those short transcripts show BLAST hits against nr, while 46.2% of the transcripts longer than 500 bp result in hits against the nr database. This data is further supported by ESTSCAN (v-3.0.3) results showing that only 10.8% of the short transcripts have coding potential. In contrast, 49.6% of the longer transcripts (&#x0003e;500 bp) code at least partially for proteins or peptides. A similar result has been shown for other spider transcriptomes, where 30&#x02013;40% of transcripts longer than 200 bp could be annotated based on BLAST searches against various protein databases <xref rid="pone.0104885-Clarke1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104885-Croucher1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Furthermore, it is likely that many of the transcripts with no clear BLAST hit against nr might represent non-coding RNAs since only 2.4% (9,052 of 377,291) and 8.6% (32,304 of 377,291) of these sequences show coding potential based on open reading frame prediction and an ESTSCAN, respectively. In contrast, 71.3% (49,279 of 69,136) and 83.8% (57,907 of 69,136) of the transcripts with BLAST hits against nr have open reading frames or at least ESTSCAN results, respectively. It has previously been shown that the expression of a large variety of non-coding RNAs ranging from a few nucleotides (e.g. microRNAs, small interfering RNAs or PIWI-associated RNAs) to several kilobases (e.g. long non-coding RNAs, lncRNAs or X-inactive-specific transcript RNA, Xist RNA) <xref rid="pone.0104885-Cech1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> are potential sources of transcribed sequences without clear similarity to other sequences in the database. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> a recent transcriptome sequencing study revealed nearly 2,000 potential lncRNAs that code for approximately 3,000 transcripts with no clear protein-coding potential <xref rid="pone.0104885-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. An alternative source of transcripts with no clear orthology to functional proteins are retroelements, which have been shown to significantly contribute to transcriptomes of mammalians <xref rid="pone.0104885-GuohuaXu1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104885-Faulkner1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> and insects <xref rid="pone.0104885-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>.

This analysis revealed that 28% (19,368 of 69,136) and 13,1% (49,413 of 377,291) of the transcripts with and without BLAST hits, respectively were masked, suggesting that retroelements are unlikely to be enriched in those transcripts without clear orthology. And finally, one potential natural source of expressed transcripts lacking sequence and protein domain conservation are small open reading frames (smORFs), which are hard to identify by traditional means of gene prediction <xref rid="pone.0104885-Basrai1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>.

All three approaches resulted in comparable numbers of transcripts with a length of up to 400 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104885-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Using the Illumina data alone allowed the assembly of longer transcripts (up to 21 kb) and increased the number of transcripts longer than 400 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104885-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). This suggests that, with our assembly method, the numerous short reads produced by the Illumina technology are superior to the longer but fewer reads produced by Roche 454 with respect to assembled transcript length. However, when we combined both datasets, we not only obtained the highest number of long transcripts, but also the longest transcripts of all datasets.</p><p>We cannot rule out that this positive effect of combining data from both sequencing platforms was caused by artificial transcript fusions (i.e. computational merging of unrelated sequences into longer but false "transcripts"). However, based on gene prediction (against <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>) and BLAST searches against nr, these long transcripts indeed have orthologs. For instance, the longest transcript in the whole survey (55.9 kb) shows high similarity to vertebrate TOR proteins including the conserved kinase domain (not shown). Additionally, it is likely that very long transcripts do exist in the <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic> transcriptome, since several extremely long coding sequences have already been described in the genomes of other organisms. For example, the human <italic>titin</italic> gene, which is involved in building muscle structure, has a coding sequence of 82 kb <xref rid="pone.0104885-Labeit1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>.</p><p>The combination of Illumina data and the combined 454/EST assembly not only resulted in longer transcripts, but it also improved the overall assembly quality as measured by N50 values and in terms of annotation. While the N50 of the 454/EST assembly alone was only 398 bp, the sequential addition of Illumina data resulted in an N50 value of 1875 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104885-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). BLASTX searches against the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> proteome resulted in more unique transcripts when the 454/EST data was combined with Illumina reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104885-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Finally, the gene prediction pipeline based on reciprocal BLAST hits identified 42.56% more <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> orthologs (15.16% if paralogs are excluded) when the data from different sequencing platforms was combined during the assembly procedure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104885-t002">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104885-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we could show that with our assembly method the use of Illumina reads for <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly clearly outperforms the 454 pyrosequencing platform alone.

One way to estimate this is to calculate the ortholog hit ratio (OHR) <xref rid="pone.0104885-ONeil1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>. This value is calculated as the ratio of the number of continuous homologous nucleotides of a <italic>de novo</italic> assembled transcript and the total length of the best ortholog in the proteome. Ideally, the OHR is calculated on the basis of genomic information of the organism of interest. However, since no annotated genome sequence for <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic> is available yet, the OHR was defined based on the proteomes of the fruit fly <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and the tick <italic>I. scapularis</italic>, respectively. A spider transcript with an OHR of 1 would represent a putative full-length transcript based on comparisons to the fly or tick ortholog sequences. We found that 52.6% of all assembled transcripts represented 50% of the respective <italic>Drosophila</italic> sequence, and 26.9% of all transcripts were likely to represent at least 80% of the predicted full-length sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104885-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). A much higher OHR could be observed when <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic> predicted transcripts were compared to <italic>Ixodes</italic> sequences.

This result is consistent with the fact that <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic> and <italic>I. scapularis</italic> are phylogenetically more closely related to each other than either species is to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Accordingly, we showed based on BLAST results that there is an overall much higher sequence similarity of the spider transcriptome to chelicerates compared to dipterans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104885-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0104885-g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0104885.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Ortholog hit ratio (OHR) analysis of assembled transcripts in the <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic> transcriptome.</title><p>An OHR of one suggests that a transcript has been assembled to its true full length.

In order to estimate the influence of the number of short transcripts on the OHR, we calculated this value for the subassemblies that were based on progressively larger datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104885-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). This analysis clearly demonstrates that, consistent with the assembly of more short transcripts, the OHR is lower when more reads are used (compare 10% to 70% in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104885-g006">Fig. 6B,C</xref>). Consequently, the overall OHR is much higher for the 10% subassembly, where 52.3% (compared to 39.8% for the complete assembly) of all transcripts represent 80% or more of the orthologous <italic>Ixodes</italic> sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104885-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>).

To this end, the high quality and Poly-A trimmed paired reads and singletons of the embryonic sample were randomly selected to generate seven sub-datasets that were composed of 10% to 70% of all the reads with one paired and one singleton file each (randomSelection.pl, the script is available on request). Those sub-datasets were assembled <italic>de novo</italic> with Velvet (version 1.2.08) <xref rid="pone.0104885-Zerbino1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and Oases (version 0.2.08) <xref rid="pone.0104885-Schulz1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> using the following settings for velvetg (<italic>-ins_length 300 -min_pair_count 2 -read_trkg yes -unused_reads yes</italic>) and oases (<italic>-ins_length 300 -min_pair_count 2 -unused_reads yes</italic>), respectively. As described above, the interleaved paired files were defined as <italic>&#x02013;shortPaired</italic> and the files containing the singleton were defined as <italic>&#x02013;short</italic>. The number of assembled transcripts in each of the seven sub-assemblies was analyzed by gene prediction (see below).</p><p>In addition to the assembly of progressively larger datasets, we estimated the coverage for each transcript in the final comprehensive assembly based on the number of mapped reads. The paired high quality reads (singletons excluded) from the embryonic and postembryonic Illumina libraries were independently mapped against the full assembly (see below). For each transcript in the final assembly the sum of mapped reads from each library was used to calculate the coverage as number of reads divided by the length of the respective transcript. The correlation between transcript length and the number of mapped reads was calculated using R (version 2.15.2) <xref rid="pone.0104885-R1" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>.
