Reconstructing the evolution of metazoans from their single celled ancestors promises to illuminate one of the major transitions in evolutionary history, while also revealing fundamental mechanisms underlying metazoan cell biology and multicellularity. Although the first metazoans evolved over 600 million years ago, insights into their biology and origin may be gained through the comparison of metazoan genomes with those of their closest living relatives, the choanoflagellates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Indeed, the genome of the first sequenced choanoflagellate, the single-celled species <italic>Monosiga brevicollis</italic>, provided evidence that diverse protein domains characteristic of metazoan signaling and adhesion proteins (for example, tyrosine kinase (TK), cadherin, and Hedgehog (Hh) domains) evolved before the divergence of choanoflagellates and metazoans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The evolution of metazoans from their single-celled ancestors is hypothesized to have involved a transition through a colonial intermediate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], the Urblastea, which may have been composed of choanoflagellate-like cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The rosette-shaped colonies formed by the choanoflagellate <italic>Salpingoeca rosetta </italic>evoke the hypothesized Urblastea (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a, b</xref>). In addition to rosette colonies, the life history of <italic>S. rosetta </italic>includes diverse cell types and morphologies, including linear chains of cells ('chain colonies'), slow and fast swimmer cells, and thecate cells that attach to substrates through a secreted structure called a theca (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The diversity of these forms is comparable to the number of cell types observed in sponges and placozoans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Therefore, sequencing the <italic>S. rosetta </italic>genome would provide an opportunity to investigate how genome evolution and cell differentiation in the ancestors of metazoans and multicellular choanoflagellates laid the foundations for metazoan cell biology and development. Furthermore, comparisons between the genomes of <italic>M. brevicollis </italic>and <italic>S. rosetta </italic>offer the opportunity to investigate the genetic bases of multicellularity in choanoflagellates. To these ends, we have sequenced and analyzed the <italic>S. rosetta </italic>genome and transcriptome during multiple key phases in the <italic>S. rosetta </italic>life history.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Salpingoeca rosetta </italic>as a model for studying the ancestry of metazoan multicellularity</bold>. <bold>(a) </bold>Choanoflagellates are the closest living relatives of Metazoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>].

The genome assembly is largely complete, capturing approximately 96% of transcripts assembled <italic>de novo </italic>from RNA-seq data (Table S2 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Predicted telomeres were found at both ends of 21 scaffolds and 24 additional scaffolds contain a single telomeric end, suggesting that <italic>S. rosetta </italic>has a minimum of 33 chromosomes (Table S3 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). A starting set of <italic>ab initio </italic>gene predictions generated by the Broad Institute annotation pipeline trained with ESTs (generated by Sanger chemistry) was refined using 21 Gb of transcriptome sequence (generated by Illumina chemistry) collected from diverse life history stages (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, Figure S1). This gene catalog contains 11,629 genes, of which 98% are supported by transcriptome sequence data (Table S1 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Aligning the protein sequences from this gene set to the <italic>M. brevicollis </italic>protein set revealed 4,994 orthologous pairs, yet the two species display relatively little gene synteny (Figure S14 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><p>To reconstruct the gene contents of the progenitors of metazoans and choanoflagellates, we compared the genomes of <italic>S. rosetta </italic>and <italic>M. brevicollis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] with the sequenced genomes of 32 representative metazoans and metazoan outgroups (Table S4 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Evolutionary relationships among genes from different genomes were predicted using OrthoMCL2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] to identify 'ortholog clusters' (Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). The 11,629 genes of <italic>S. rosetta </italic>fall into 9,411 ortholog clusters (that is, some ortholog clusters contain multiple <italic>S. rosetta </italic>genes). The evolutionary history of each ortholog cluster was inferred by mapping its distribution onto a reference phylogeny (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>), allowing us to gain insight into the composition of ancestral genomes and patterns of gene gain and loss in the lineages leading to metazoans, choanoflagellates, and fungi (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). Gene families and protein domains of particular interest were also curated manually (see, for example, Figures S7 to S9, S13 and Tables S6 and S8 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Gene gains and losses preceding the origin of metazoans</bold>. Reconstruction of ancestral gene content (predicted number of ortholog clusters indicated at each node) reveals that metazoans evolved as many as 1,235 ortholog clusters since their divergence from choanoflagellates and as many as 1,995 following their divergence with fungi, off-setting the loss of 20% of the Uropisthokont gene content. In contrast, current genome data suggest that the choanoflagellate and fungal lineages were dominated by gene loss. Choanoflagellates lost 47% of the Uropisthokont gene content and 37% of the gene content present in the Urchoanimal. Similarly, the fungal linage has lost 33% of the Uropisthokont gene content. Predicted ortholog cluster gain (+) and loss (-) is indicated, respectively, above and below each branch. Colored ovals represent predicted ancestral ortholog cluster content: red, <italic>S. rosetta</italic>; purple, <italic>M. brevicollis</italic>; black, Urmetazoan; white, Urfungus; blue, Urchoanoflagellate; yellow, Urchoanimal; green, Uropisthokont (Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gb-2013-14-2-r15-2"/></fig><p>The genomes of the ancestors ('Ur-'; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>) of metazoans and opisthokonts (metazoans + choanoflagellates + fungi) were each predicted to have contained members of about 10,000 ortholog clusters. While nearly 20% (1,843) of the ortholog clusters from the Uropisthokont were lost along the lineage leading to the Urmetazoan, this lineage also experienced an equivalent amount of gene gain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In contrast, fungi and choanoflagellates apparently lost representation from 33% (3,372) and 47% (4,747) of the ancestral Uropisthokont ortholog clusters, respectively, but experienced only half as much gene gain. The <italic>S. rosetta </italic>genome also reveals that <italic>M. brevicollis </italic>has lost an additional 1,343 genes. Therefore, the <italic>S. rosetta </italic>genome sequence substantially clarifies the gene content of the Urchoanimal. Future sequencing of additional choanoflagellate genomes will further refine inferences about the gene content of the Urchoanimal, presumably by reducing the number of genes thought to be metazoan. Nonetheless, patterns of gene gain and loss based on currently sequenced genomes speak to the richness of the gene complement in the Uropisthokont [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and emphasize the role that gene birth may have played in the evolution of biological novelties such as metazoan multicellularity.</p><p>Therefore, we next characterized the 5,706 ortholog clusters that appear to have evolved along the stem lineage leading to metazoans (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). These metazoan-specific ortholog clusters include homologs of genes that regulate cell adhesion, including &#x003b4;-catenin and &#x003b2;-laminin, as well as genes involved in the transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2; and Wnt developmental signaling pathways. Many of the core components of the TGF-&#x003b2; and Wnt signaling pathways (for example, TGF-&#x003b2;, TGF-&#x003b2; receptor, Smad, Wnt, Wntless, &#x003b2;-catenin, and TCF) were identified in every metazoan genome included in our analysis, underscoring their early evolution and fundamental importance to metazoan biology.</p><p>Genes shared between choanoflagellates and metazoans were present in the progenitors of metazoans and may have contributed to the genomic foundations of the origin of metazoans. We find that the evolution of the monophyletic 'Choanimal' clade (which contains choanoflagellates and metazoans, and is not to be confused with the paraphyletic 'Choanozoa' (see Endnote a)), was marked by a disproportionate gain of genes with Gene Ontology terms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] for metazoan cell adhesion and cell-junction organization (Table S5 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), including cadherins, PATJ (a component of adherens junctions) and KANK/vab-19 (an ankyrin repeat protein required for proper embryonic epidermal elongation and muscle attachment to the epidermis in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]). Ortholog clusters involved in metazoan neuropeptide signaling and glycosphingolipid metabolism also increased in abundance (Table S5 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). In addition, the <italic>S. rosetta </italic>genome, like that of <italic>M. brevicollis</italic>, contains a diverse and abundant repertoire of TKs (see Endnote b) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>). Ninety percent of the <italic>S. rosetta </italic>cytoplasmic TKs are conserved in the <italic>M. brevicollis </italic>genome, and <italic>S. rosetta </italic>has homologs of two adhesion-associated cytoplasmic TKs, FAK and Fer, that were apparently lost in <italic>M. brevicollis </italic>(Table S6 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). In contrast, only 21% of receptor TKs (RTKs) from <italic>S. rosetta </italic>and <italic>M. brevicollis </italic>form orthologous pairs. The added sequence diversity provided by the <italic>S. rosetta </italic>genome also revealed that choanoflagellates may have divergent homologs of metazoan Eph RTKs that were not originally detected in the <italic>M. brevicollis </italic>genome. Eph RTKs are key regulators of cell migration during development, regulating cellular organization through differential cell repulsion and adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Their discovery in <italic>S. rosetta </italic>lays the foundation for investigating core and ancestral functions of these important receptors.</p><p>The <italic>S. rosetta </italic>genome now provides a platform for investigating the regulation of cell differentiation in choanoflagellates and the potential evolutionary connections between the cell biology of choanoflagellates and metazoans. Therefore, we analyzed the transcriptional profiles of samples enriched in each of four different <italic>S. rosetta </italic>cell types: thecate cells, swimming cells (a mix of slow and fast swimmers), chain colonies, and rosette colonies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>; Figure S1 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>). Using three independent analytical approaches we identified 480 <italic>S. rosetta </italic>genes that were consistently upregulated in colonies (chains and rosettes) compared to solitary cells (swimming and thecate) and 1,410 genes that were consistently upregulated in thecate cells relative to swimming solitary cells and colonies (Figures S2, S3 and S4 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>; Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref> to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S13">13</xref>). For example, in colonies and thecate cells distinct subsets of TKs, cadherins (notable for their roles in metazoan cell signaling and adhesion) and Hh-domain containing proteins (see Endnote c) were significantly upregulated (Figures S5, S6, and S12 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), although their functions in these contexts are unknown.</p><p>Perhaps most illuminating was the observation that all four members of the <italic>S. rosetta </italic>septin gene family were significantly upregulated in colonies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). Septins, conserved GTPases that regulate cytokinesis in fungi and metazoans, were first identified in yeast through a screen for cytokinesis defects; septin mutants frequently failed to undergo proper cytokinesis and therefore exhibited multicellular phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Metazoan septins also stabilize intercellular bridges such as midbodies and ring canals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. During metazoan cytokinesis and in intercellular bridges, a set of specific septin monomers polymerize to form cytoskeletal filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The four <italic>S. rosetta </italic>septins have conserved amino acid residues on predicted interacting surfaces, suggesting they may also form filaments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>; Figures S7 and S8 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>S. rosetta </italic>homologs of other midbody-associated proteins and septin regulators, including Aurora kinase, the scaffolding protein Anillin, and Polo kinase, are also significantly upregulated in colonies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). The coordinated upregulation of septins and septin regulators is notable because colony development in <italic>S. rosetta </italic>occurs by incomplete cytokinesis, such that neighboring cells remain physically linked by intercellular bridges (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Septins are upregulated in colonial cells</bold>. <bold>(a) </bold>Unlike the average for all genes in the genome, septins, the septin-associated Polo and Aurora kinases, and Anillin are each significantly upregulated in colonial cells.

Of the 11,628 genes in the <italic>S. rosetta </italic>genome, at least 57% were present in the Uropisthokont, 5% arose on the Urchoanimal stem, 6% are choanoflagellate-specific, and 31% are apparently unique to <italic>S. rosetta </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>; Table S7 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The evolutionary histories of genes upregulated in specific cell types deviated significantly from this distribution. For example, thecate cells disproportionately upregulated genes that evolved within choanoflagellates, after their divergence from the metazoan stem lineage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>; Table S7 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Therefore, the unusual morphology and transcriptional profile of thecate cells suggest that important aspects of their biology may be unique to choanoflagellates. Colony development, in contrast, has potential relevance for understanding the regulation of early metazoan multicellularity. Colonies develop from a subset of solitary swimming cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], so the most likely regulators of colony development are the 352 genes that are specifically upregulated in both solitary swimming cells and in colonies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>; Table S7 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Interestingly, this set is highly enriched in genes that are exclusively shared with metazoans and that presumably evolved along the Urchoanimal stem lineage. Genes involved in the maintenance of mature colonies, as opposed to those involved in regulating early colony development, would be expected to be specifically upregulated in colonies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>; Table S7 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), but not in the single cells from which they develop (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4e</xref>; Table S7 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). This set was enriched in genes unique to <italic>S. rosetta</italic>.

The <italic>S. rosetta </italic>genome refines the catalog of metazoan-specific genes and highlights the potential relevance of key gene families to the evolution of defining features of metazoan biology. Genes with a variety of evolutionary histories - including highly conserved genes with functions that are integral to eukaryotic cell biology, genes that evolved before the choanimals and that were subsequently co-opted to new metazoan-specific functions, and new genes whose evolution may have served as key innovations - shaped the evolution of metazoans from their protistan ancestors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. With this more complete gene catalog, it is now possible to reconstruct the ancestry of metazoan gene families in unprecedented detail (for example, Figures S6 and S9 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]). The <italic>M. brevicollis </italic>genome sequence previously revealed that diverse protein domains in metazoan signaling and adhesion genes, including cadherin, Hh, and TK, evolved before the origin of metazoan multicellularity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The <italic>S. rosetta </italic>genome now reveals that the Urchoanimal genome contained representatives of at least eight metazoan TK gene families (Table S6 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), including the developmentally important Eph RTKs, and raises questions about their ancestral functions in the Urchoanimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>In addition to expanding gene family representation, the <italic>S. rosetta </italic>genome also sheds light on the pathways in which these genes are traditionally thought to operate. For example, while some components of the TK and Hh developmental signaling pathways are conserved in choanoflagellates (for example, Src, Eph RTK, and Patched), others are not. Therefore, the evolution of these pathways along the metazoan stem lineage likely involved an as-yet undefined combination of protein domain shuffling, gene cooption, and evolution of new protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] that promises to be further elucidated by the continued study of diverse early-branching metazoans, choanoflagellates and other metazoan outgroups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In contrast, components of the Wnt pathway have not been identified in any sequenced non-metazoan genome, including those of <italic>S. rosetta </italic>and <italic>M. brevicollis</italic>, suggesting that the pathway did not evolve until after the divergence of metazoans and choanoflagellates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. A sponge classical cadherin has proven capable of binding <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] to its cognate &#x003b2;-catenin, a Wnt pathway effector, suggesting that at least a portion of the critical interactions in the Wnt pathway evolved before the Cambrian radiation. Given the ubiquity of Wnt pathway components in metazoans and their essential roles in regulating embryonic patterning in diverse animals, it is therefore possible that the evolution of the Wnt pathway was critical to the early evolution of metazoans.</p><p>Finally, the <italic>S. rosetta </italic>genome offers the opportunity to investigate whether choanoflagellate colony formation and metazoan development are regulated by conserved mechanisms. The upregulation of conserved genes and gene families in colonies, such as septins, cadherins, and Hh-related proteins, is intriguing and warrants further investigation to fully understand their current and ancestral functions. Taken together, the <italic>S. rosetta </italic>genome and transcriptome suggest that the genome of the last common ancestor of choanoflagellates and metazoans contained genes and domains that orchestrate development in modern animals but underwent important changes in gene content and regulation <italic>en route </italic>to the evolution of the first metazoan. Further refinement of ancestral genomes through comparative genomics with additional choanoflagellate genomes and functional efforts in choanoflagellates and sponges promises to reveal the minimal set of genes required for metazoan development and multicellularity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title><italic>Salpingoeca rosetta </italic>culture conditions</title><p><italic>S. rosetta</italic>, a colonial choanoflagellate originally isolated from Hog Island, Virginia, was cultured with co-isolated bacteria at 25&#x000b0;C in natural seawater infused with cereal grass media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].

Examination of the subtelomeric regions of these six supercontigs did not reveal genes that are shared at the other telomeres below, so they appear to be aberrant or newly formed telomeres without the subtelomeric repeated regions of most telomeres.</p><p>Additional telomeric supercontigs were identified by searching the raw reads from the approximately 40 kb insert fosmids with 1,000 bases of TTAGGG repeats. The mate pairs of the first 250 such hits, all of which were in plus/minus arrangement, indicating that they were from telomeres, were then searched against the supercontigs to identify telomeric supercontigs. This search revealed 41 such supercontigs (fifth column of Table S3 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), including four of the six with assembled TTAGGG repeats. Clearly this is an underestimate of the number of telomeres, both because only four of the six assembled ones were identified, and because this search yields a Poisson distribution of such hits (fifth column of Table S3 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), ten of which were only hit once. From the average positions of the mate-pair hits within each supercontig it was possible to estimate the length of DNA missing between the assembly and the TTAGGG repeats of the telomere, and this is shown in the sixth column of Table S3 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>.</p><p>Examination of these 37 telomeric supercontigs without assembled TTAGGG repeats revealed that all but a few of them have regions repeated on most of the others (seventh column in Table S3 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The few exceptions are instances where the gap between the end of the supercontig and the TTAGGG repeats is near the 40 kb insert size of the fosmids, so presumably the shared subtelomeric regions are within this missing part.

The 376 serine/threonine kinases are generally well conserved between <italic>M. brevicollis </italic>and <italic>S. rosetta </italic>(Table S6 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). In contrast, the TKs seem to be more rapidly evolving and show divergent sequences and large numbers of gains and losses (Table S6 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Comparison of the 93 <italic>S. rosetta </italic>and 135 <italic>M. brevicollis </italic>TKs suggests a core choanoflagellate tyrosine kinome of approximately 51 kinases, with extensive gains and some losses in the two species. The Fer and FAK kinases appear to have been lost in <italic>M. brevicollis</italic>, as they are found in <italic>S. rosetta</italic>, metazoans, and <italic>Capsaspora owczarzaki</italic>. Fer and FAK both regulate cell adhesion in metazoans, suggesting that <italic>M. brevicollis </italic>has lost some ancestral cell-adhesion functions.</p><p>The <italic>S. rosetta </italic>sequences allow an improved classification of both choanoflagellate tyrosine kinomes, resulting in six new families of RTKs (RTKN-T) and the creation of other families (UTKA-H) from many of the previously unique TKs. The additional sequences also indicate orthology between some choanoflagellate and metazoan RTKs: Eph RTKs are found in both species, and several other RTKs are weakly Eph-like. More tentatively, the new RTKS family may be orthologous to the insulin/IGF1R family, although it has only partial similarity to the extracellular regions of metazoan insulin receptors.</p><p>The cytoplasmic (non-receptor) TKs are evolutionarily stable between <italic>M. brevicollis </italic>and <italic>S. rosetta</italic>, with 90% of kinases in common, the only differences being one extra CTKA and FYTK in <italic>M. brevicollis</italic>, and the loss of FAK and Fer from <italic>M. brevicollis</italic>. The large family of 15 HMTKs is completely conserved between the two sequenced choanoflagellate species.</p><p>The receptor TKs are more evolutionarily dynamic, with eight families specific to <italic>M. brevicollis</italic>, three families specific to <italic>S. rosetta</italic>, and only 21% of all RTKs orthologous between the two sequenced choanoflagellates. Another eight TK families (UTKA-H) could not be classified as cytoplasmic or receptor, and the 'TK-Unique' kinases have no clear homologs between the two species.</p><p>As with other genes, we see that <italic>S. rosetta </italic>TKs that are conserved with <italic>M. brevicollis </italic>tend to be more highly expressed in attached cells, while those unique to <italic>S. rosetta </italic>are more highly expressed in rosette colonies (Figure S12 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><p><sup>c</sup><bold><italic>S. rosetta </italic>cadherin and hedgling protein diversity</bold></p><p>The <italic>S. rosetta </italic>genome is predicted to encode 29 proteins containing cadherin domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], a number that is comparable to the complement of cadherins found in the genomes of <italic>M. brevicollis </italic>and many animals (including 17 in <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>and 32 in <italic>C. intestinalis</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. While cadherins are well known for their roles in animal cell adhesion and intercellular signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>], their functions in choanoflagellates are unknown. Two <italic>S. rosetta </italic>cadherins, PTSG_06458 and PTSG_06068, are upregulated in colonies relative to single cells and an additional six are upregulated in thecate cells relative to colonies (Figure S5 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><p>Two of the six cadherins that are upregulated in thecate cells are homologs of Hedgling. Hedgling proteins are conserved in choanoflagellates, sponges, and cnidaria, and proposed to represent evolutionary antecedents of the metazoan developmental signaling protein Hh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Unlike canonical metazoan Hh proteins (which contain an amino-terminal Hh signal domain and a carboxy-terminal autocatalytic HINT domain), Hedgling proteins are large transmembrane proteins that contain an amino-terminal Hh domain, an adjacent VWA domain, and multiple cadherin repeats; some also contain tumor necrosis factor receptor, Furin, and epidermal growth factor domains, although these are not universally conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>]. Prior to the sequencing of the <italic>S. rosetta </italic>genome, the choanoflagellate Hedglings were the only known non-metazoan Hh-domain containing proteins. With the sequencing of the <italic>S. rosetta </italic>genome, we have discovered five additional non-Hedgling proteins that contain Hh domains. A unifying characteristic of these proteins and all Hedglings, including those from the sponge <italic>Amphimedon queenslandica </italic>and the cnidarian <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>, is the positioning of the Hh domain immediately adjacent to a VWA domain; this pairing may represent an ancient cassette that was also encoded by the genes from which metazoan Hh evolved. Four of the Hh signaling domain-containing proteins also have a predicted transmembrane domain and these proteins are all upregulated in thecate cells (Figure S6 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The remaining three Hh domain-containing proteins are relatively small, contain an amino-terminal signal sequence, and lack a transmembrane domain; these proteins are consistently upregulated in colonial cells where they may act as secreted ligands. Like <italic>M. brevicollis</italic>, the <italic>S. rosetta </italic>genome also encodes homologs of Patched, the Hh receptor in metazoans, allowing the possibility that the Hh-Patched interaction preceded the origin of metazoans.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation
