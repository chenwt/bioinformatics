However, a recent study challenged the OC by reporting a greater functional similarity, in terms of Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and expression profiles, among within-species paralogs compared with orthologs. These findings were taken to indicate that functional similarity of homologous genes is primarily determined by the cellular context of the genes, rather than evolutionary history. However, several subsequent studies suggest that GO annotations and microarray data could artificially inflate functional similarity between paralogs from the same organism. We sought to test the OC using approaches distinct from those used in previous studies. Analysis of a large RNAseq data set from multiple human and mouse tissues shows that expression similarity (correlations coefficients, rank&#x02018;s, or <italic>Z</italic>-scores) between orthologs is substantially greater than that for between-species paralogs with the same sequence divergence, in agreement with the OC and the results of recent detailed analyses. These findings are further corroborated by a fine-grain analysis in which expression profiles of orthologs and paralogs were compared separately for individual gene families. Expression profiles of within-species paralogs are more strongly correlated than profiles of orthologs but it is shown that this is caused by high background noise, that is, correlation between profiles of unrelated genes in the same organism. <italic>Z</italic>-scores and rank scores show a nonmonotonic dependence of expression profile similarity on sequence divergence. This complexity of gene expression evolution after duplication might be at least partially caused by selection for protein dosage rebalancing following gene duplication.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>duplicated genes</kwd><kwd>selection</kwd><kwd>neutral evolution</kwd><kwd>rebalancing dosage effect model</kwd><kwd>duplication&#x02013;degeneration&#x02013;complementation model</kwd><kwd>neofunctionalization model</kwd><kwd>subfunctionalization model</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The evolutionary history of genomes combines vertical descent with numerous gene duplications and lineage-specific losses. The genes that are related via vertical descent (speciation) are known as orthologs whereas genes that evolved via duplication in a certain lineage are called paralogs (<xref rid="evu051-B9" ref-type="bibr">Fitch 1970</xref>, <xref rid="evu051-B10" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). These definitions are straightforward in principle but the actual evolutionary relationships between genes are often complex and involve not only one-to-one but also one-to-many and many-to-many correspondence due to the complicated combinations of lineage-specific duplication and gene loss (<xref rid="evu051-B19" ref-type="bibr">Koonin 2005</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B20" ref-type="bibr">Kristensen et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B12" ref-type="bibr">Gabaldon and Koonin 2013</xref>).</p><p>Beyond the reconstruction of evolutionary scenarios, robust identification of orthologs is of central importance for comparative and functional genomics due to a rarely stated but almost universally implied concept that recently has been denoted ortholog conjecture (OC) (<xref rid="evu051-B29" ref-type="bibr">Nehrt et al. 2011</xref>). The OC holds that orthologous genes perform equivalent functions in the respective organisms and accordingly, experimentally determined functions of a gene can be transferred to its experimentally uncharacterized orthologs in other species (certainly, taking into account the biological differences between the organisms involved) (<xref rid="evu051-B19" ref-type="bibr">Koonin 2005</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B12" ref-type="bibr">Gabaldon and Koonin 2013</xref>). Thus, the OC effectively forms the foundation of all functional annotation of sequenced genomes given that experimental characterization of the functions of any sizable fraction of the genes in the numerous sequenced genomes remains unrealistic for the foreseeable future.</p><p>A key corollary of the OC is that orthologous genes are more functionally similar to each other that any of them is to its paralogs at the same level of sequence divergence, in the same or other species. The functional diversification of paralogs is a subject with a long, rather circuitous history of theoretical and experimental study (<xref rid="evu051-B23" ref-type="bibr">Lynch 2002</xref>, <xref rid="evu051-B24" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B25" ref-type="bibr">Lynch and Katju 2004</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B8" ref-type="bibr">Conant and Wolfe 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B46" ref-type="bibr">Zhang 2013</xref>). With the increasing availability of genomic data, it became clear that numerous gene families have diverged in function through series of duplications, including many lineage-specific expansions identified in each of the sequenced genomes (<xref rid="evu051-B16" ref-type="bibr">Hughes 1994</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B11" ref-type="bibr">Force et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B18" ref-type="bibr">Kondrashov et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B21" ref-type="bibr">Lespinet et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B19" ref-type="bibr">Koonin 2005</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B8" ref-type="bibr">Conant and Wolfe 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B17" ref-type="bibr">Innan and Kondrashov 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B46" ref-type="bibr">Zhang 2013</xref>). Gene duplications are considered to be a major evolutionary source of new protein functions (<xref rid="evu051-B31" ref-type="bibr">Ohno 1970</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B16" ref-type="bibr">Hughes 1994</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B11" ref-type="bibr">Force et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B8" ref-type="bibr">Conant and Wolfe 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B17" ref-type="bibr">Innan and Kondrashov 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B46" ref-type="bibr">Zhang 2013</xref>).</p><p>The importance of appropriately designed tests to disambiguate models of gene evolution between orthologs and paralogs was emphasized by <xref rid="evu051-B38" ref-type="bibr">Studer and Robinson-Rechavi (2009)</xref> who suggested that functional changes between orthologs might be as common as between paralogs (the uniform model), and that more studies should be designed to test the impact of different models. Recently, an attempt has been undertaken to directly and systematically test the OC by quantifying the functional similarity between orthologs and paralogs (<xref rid="evu051-B29" ref-type="bibr">Nehrt et al. 2011</xref>). Two independent metrics, namely experiment-based annotations in the Gene Ontology (GO) database (<xref rid="evu051-B4" ref-type="bibr">Ashburner et al. 2000</xref>) and microarray gene expression data (<xref rid="evu051-B39" ref-type="bibr">Su et al. 2004</xref>), were used as proxies for gene function, that is, to compare the functional and expression similarities of orthologs and paralogs in human and mouse (<xref rid="evu051-B29" ref-type="bibr">Nehrt et al. 2011</xref>). Unexpectedly, this comparison has shown that at the same level of protein sequence divergence, orthologs and between-species paralogs are much less functionally similar than within-species paralogs (<xref rid="evu051-B29" ref-type="bibr">Nehrt et al. 2011</xref>). Furthermore, it has been shown that functional and expression similarity between orthologs is (virtually) independent of the protein sequence identity. These results appeared inconsistent with the OC which prompted <xref rid="evu051-B29" ref-type="bibr">Nehrt et al. (2011)</xref> to conclude that the primary determinant of the evolutionary rate of gene function and expression is the cellular and organismal context in which the genes act. This cellular context hypothesis could explain why within-species paralogs were found to be more similar in function and expression than between-species paralogs and orthologs (<xref rid="evu051-B29" ref-type="bibr">Nehrt et al. 2011</xref>).</p><p>The purported refutation of the OC by <xref rid="evu051-B29" ref-type="bibr">Nehrt et al. (2011)</xref> stimulated further reassessment of the functional relationships among orthologs and paralogs. Several studies have suggested that GO annotations should be used to test the OC with extreme caution (<xref rid="evu051-B2" ref-type="bibr">Altenhoff et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B40" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et al. 2012</xref>) or even are unsuitable for this purpose (<xref rid="evu051-B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Zhang 2012</xref>). However, all the crudity and likely biases of the GO annotations notwithstanding, the emerging consensus appears to be that these annotations are generally compatible with the OC (<xref rid="evu051-B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Zhang 2012</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B40" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et al. 2012</xref>) or with the uniform model (<xref rid="evu051-B2" ref-type="bibr">Altenhoff et al. 2012</xref>). In addition, <xref rid="evu051-B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Zhang (2012)</xref> analyzed a large RNAseq data set from multiple tissues and found that the similarity of expression profiles between orthologs is significantly higher than that between within-species paralogs, supporting the OC and conversely refuting the cellular context hypothesis (<xref rid="evu051-B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Zhang 2012</xref>). These results are consistent with an earlier analysis of the differences in the tissue-specific expression among between-species paralogs in human and mouse (<xref rid="evu051-B15" ref-type="bibr">Huerta-Cepas et al. 2011</xref>). The results of this work indicate that expression divergence is most pronounced among relatively young paralogs, that is, those originating from duplications that postdate the primary divergence of mammals but antedate the divergence of primates and rodents, consistent with the notion that tissue specificity evolves shortly after duplication (<xref rid="evu051-B15" ref-type="bibr">Huerta-Cepas et al. 2011</xref>).</p><p>We decided to reanalyze these controversial results and hypotheses using approaches as different as possible from those used before and further to attempt to reconcile them with the existing models of paralogous gene evolution. Our analysis of a large RNAseq data set for multiple tissues from human and mouse shows that rank and <italic>Z</italic>-score measures of the expression similarity indicate significantly greater similarity between orthologs than that for either between-species or within-species paralogs, in agreement with the OC and the results of <xref rid="evu051-B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Zhang (2012)</xref>. In contrast, correlation coefficients between expression profiles of orthologs were found to be greater than those for between-species paralogs but lower than those for within-species paralogs. We conclude that the human/mouse gene expression data generally support the OC but deeper understanding of the evolution of expression also should invoke explicit models of gene evolution after duplication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Human and Mouse Protein-Coding Genes</title><p>The protein sets for human and mouse were from the genome division of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ftp-refseq/H_sapiens/mRNA_Prot/human.protein.faa">/am/ftp-refseq/H_sapiens/mRNA_Prot/human.protein.faa</ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ftp-refseq/M_musculus/mRNA_Prot/mouse.protein.faa">/am/ftp-refseq/M_musculus/mRNA_Prot/mouse.protein.faa</ext-link> (last accessed March 28, 2014)<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ftp-gene/DATA/gene2refseq.gz">, gene names /am/ftp-gene/DATA/gene2refseq.gz</ext-link> (last accessed March 28, 2014).

Low but significant correlations (Kendall &#x003c4; rank correlation coefficient or Pearson linear correlation coefficient of approximately 0.08) were detected among randomly shuffled within-species paralogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evu051-F2">fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). A weaker positive correlation (correlation coefficients of &#x0223c;0.04) was found among shuffled between-species paralogs and no significant correlation after shuffling the orthologs was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evu051-F2">fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). The shuffled genes showed no appreciable dependency of the expression profile correlation on the sequence divergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evu051-F2">fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). By default, the significant positive correlation among the shuffled within-species paralogs should be taken as resulting from conditions of sample preparation and other experimental conditions that are identical (or closely similar) for all genes from the same species but differ between the species. However, it cannot be ruled out that the identical cellular context, as per the hypothesis of <xref rid="evu051-B29" ref-type="bibr">Nehrt et al. (2011)</xref>, also results in some similarity between the expression profiles of within-species paralogs. In contrast to the correlation coefficients, no substantial background was observed for <italic>Z</italic>-scores and ranking scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evu051-F2">fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>).

This conclusion is consistent with recent studies showing that the comparison of across-tissue expression-profile similarities of different gene pairs using correlation can be problematic because it substantially underestimates the expression similarity between orthologous (or paralogous) genes with a conserved, uniform pattern of expression (<xref rid="evu051-B34" ref-type="bibr">Pereira et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Zhang 2012</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B35" ref-type="bibr">Piasecka et al. 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, we reasoned that different measures of expression similarity could reflect different salient features of gene expression, namely tissue-specificity in the case of the correlation coefficients, and relative abundance of individual mRNAs in the case of <italic>Z</italic>-scores and ranking scores. Therefore, here we employed each of these measures of expression similarity, with all the caveats that are associated with the use of correlation coefficients.</p><p>The plots of expression similarity measured using linear or rank correlation coefficients were qualitatively similar to the analogous plots reported by <xref rid="evu051-B29" ref-type="bibr">Nehrt et al. (2011)</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evu051-F2">fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>) in that the strongest correlation was observed among within-species paralogs, followed by orthologs and then by between-species paralogs. This result suggested that the details of orthology and paralogy identification had no major effect on the results. For the between-species paralogs, significant expression similarity was observed only at low sequence divergence whereas at higher divergence, the correlation coefficient values were indistinguishable from the noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evu051-F2">fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). Although the correlation among within-species paralogs was well above the noise level for all values of sequence divergence, it also dropped with increasing divergence. In a sharp contrast, highly similar orthologs tend to produce low values of correlation coefficients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evu051-F2">fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). This artifact has been noticed previously, the likely explanation being that many of the highly conserved orthologs are housekeeping genes that are broadly and (nearly) uniformly expressed across tissues which results in a severe underestimation of the expression similarity (<xref rid="evu051-B34" ref-type="bibr">Pereira et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Zhang 2012</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B35" ref-type="bibr">Piasecka et al. 2012</xref>). A dramatic difference was observed between the within-species and between-species measurements: the correlation among between-species paralogs was much lower than that between orthologs but within-species paralogs showed a greater correlation than orthologs, along with the greater background noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evu051-F2">fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). Thus, the OC appears to hold when the experimental conditions are comparable (between-species comparisons for orthologs or paralogs). However, the high positive correlation between paralogs for within-species comparisons cannot be explained by the background noise alone (discussed earlier) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evu051-F2">fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>) and is likely to reflect some features of evolution of duplicated genes.</p><p>For the <italic>Z</italic>-scores and ranking scores, our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evu051-F2">fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>) agreed with those of <xref rid="evu051-B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Zhang (2012)</xref>, with the greatest similarity consistently observed between orthologs, followed by within-species paralogs and then by between-species paralogs. However, the results obtained with <italic>Z</italic>-scores and ranking scores also showed an anomaly, namely the drop in the <italic>Z</italic>-scores and ranking scores for within-species paralog comparisons in the intermediate sequence divergence range and the seemingly paradoxical high scores in the high divergence range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evu051-F2">fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>). Collectively, these observations reveal the complexity of the dependencies between sequence and expression divergence, and further imply that different expression similarity measures capture distinct aspects of the functions of orthologous and paralogous genes. Later, we attempt to reconcile all these observations in the light of different models of the evolution of gene duplications.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of Expression Profiles of Orthologs and Paralogs within the Same Gene Family</title><p>The functional characteristics of orthologous genes and duplicated genes are not necessarily expected to be the same because paralogs are not a random subset of genes that have readily identifiable human&#x02013;mouse orthologs (<xref rid="evu051-B18" ref-type="bibr">Kondrashov et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B32" ref-type="bibr">Pal et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B45" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B27" ref-type="bibr">Marland et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B13" ref-type="bibr">He and Zhang, 2005</xref>, <xref rid="evu051-B14" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B36" ref-type="bibr">Prachumwat and Li, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B3" ref-type="bibr">Amoutzias et al. 2010</xref>). The set of recently duplicated paralogs appears to be enriched in genes coding for proteins involved in different aspects of the organism&#x02019;s interaction with the environment. In particular, a substantial fraction of these paralogs encode (predicted) membrane or secreted proteins (<xref rid="evu051-B18" ref-type="bibr">Kondrashov et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B45" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B32" ref-type="bibr">Pal et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B27" ref-type="bibr">Marland et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B13" ref-type="bibr">He and Zhang 2005</xref>, <xref rid="evu051-B14" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B36" ref-type="bibr">Prachumwat and Li 2006</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B3" ref-type="bibr">Amoutzias et al. 2010</xref>). To avoid this and other potential functional biases (<xref rid="evu051-B14" ref-type="bibr">He and Zhang 2006</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B36" ref-type="bibr">Prachumwat and Li 2006</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B42" ref-type="bibr">Vinogradov 2013</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B3" ref-type="bibr">Amoutzias et al. 2010</xref>), we compared expression of paralogs and orthologs from the same gene clusters (gene families). For the purposes of this analysis, we merged all paralogous gene pairs into one set, to increase the power of statistical analysis, and considering that the OC does not explicitly differentiate between within-species paralogs and other paralogs. The distances between orthologs and between paralogs were required to be similar (no statistically significant difference at the 0.95 level according to the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test). Altogether 14,242 pairs of orthologs and paralogs (<italic>N</italic> = 14,242) were analyzed; the numbers of within-species and between-species comparisons were approximately the same (7,020 and 7,222, respectively). For all measures of expression similarity, a greater similarity between orthologs than between paralogs was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evu051-F3">fig. 3</xref>). Although the standard error of these analyses was much higher compared with the initial data sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evu051-F2">fig. 2</xref>) due to the smaller sample sizes, the overall expression similarity between orthologs was significantly greater (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001 for all expression similarity measures according to the Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test). These findings indicate that the OC holds when comparisons between orthologs and paralogs are done with the family specificity of orthologs and paralogs taken into account.

A similar level of the background noise was detected in the original microarray data of <xref rid="evu051-B29" ref-type="bibr">Nehrt et al.

Thus, this background noise is a general property of expression data when a correlation coefficient (linear or &#x003c4;) is used as a measure of the expression similarity. We examined this issue in greater detail by incorporating the background noise directly into the model. To this end, the following sampling procedure was used.
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>A subset of size <italic>L</italic> is randomly sampled from the set of pairs of orthologs and paralogs described earlier (the size of the set is <italic>N</italic> = 14,242; <italic>L</italic> &#x0003c;&#x0003c; <italic>N</italic>). Various <italic>L</italic> values (<italic>L</italic> = 100, 300, and 500) were tested, and given that the results were similar (not shown), <italic>L</italic> = 300 was used for further analysis.</p></list-item><list-item><p>For the selected subset of size <italic>L</italic>, the expression profiles of orthologous gene pairs and paralogous gene pairs were separately, randomly shuffled 1,000 times.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Background correlation coefficients between expression profiles were calculated for each randomly shuffled version of the selected subset, and the mean value and variance of these coefficients were calculated for the 1,000 shuffled subsets.

If no significant difference was found, that is, the background noise was approximately the same for orthologs and paralogs, the given subset was accepted for further analysis (balanced subsets).</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Steps 1&#x02013;3 were repeated 1,000 times, and the resulting balanced subsets (72 for the Pearson linear correlation coefficient and 139 for the Kendall &#x003c4; correlation coefficient) were analyzed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="evu051-T1">table 1</xref>). Two approaches were used to compare the lists of balanced subsets. First, the number of cases when the mean expression similarity was greater for orthologs than for paralogs was compared with the number of reverse cases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="evu051-T1">table 1</xref>). Second, we tallied the cases when the mean expression similarity for orthologs was significantly greater (Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test, 0.95 significance level) than that for paralogs and vice versa (<xref ref-type="table" rid="evu051-T1">table 1</xref>). This analysis showed that the number of cases when the mean expression similarity was greater for orthologs than that for paralogs for both correlation coefficients was substantially and significantly greater than the number of reverse cases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="evu051-T1">table 1</xref>). Thus, the results of balanced subset analysis are fully compatible with the OC.

Even apart from additional tests that take into account gene families, all used measures of expression indicate that human&#x02013;mouse orthologs are more similar to each other than between-species paralogs at the same level of sequence divergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evu051-F2">fig. 2</xref>). This is the most relevant comparison for testing the OC because two between-species measurements are compared. In addition, when expression similarity is measured using <italic>Z</italic>-scores or ranking scores, orthologs appear more similar than within-species paralogs as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evu051-F2">fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>). Arguably, the comparison of expression profiles of orthologs and paralogs within gene families provide the strongest available argument in support of the OC because in this case only comparisons of functionally similar genes are taken into account.</p><p>In contrast, within-species paralogs show a significantly stronger correlation between expression profiles than orthologs at the same sequence distance, in agreement with the observations of <xref rid="evu051-B29" ref-type="bibr">Nehrt et al. (2011)</xref> that have been interpreted as a challenge to the OC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evu051-F2">fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). The strong correlation between the expression profiles of within-species paralogs is largely caused by the high background noise that becomes apparent when correlations are measured among randomly shuffled expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evu051-F2">fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evu051/-/DC1">supplementary fig.

When this noise is taken into account, a greater similarity between the expression profiles of orthologs compared with those of paralogs is observed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="evu051-T1">table 1</xref>), in accord with the OC.</p><p>The comparisons between expression profiles of orthologs and paralogs described here take account of multiple sources of bias and show that, once these biases are dealt with, profiles of orthologs are significantly more similar than profiles of paralogs, whether within or between species, in agreement with the OC. As shown here, the high similarity among within species paralogs reported by <xref rid="evu051-B29" ref-type="bibr">Nehrt et al. (2011)</xref> stems from the correlation between unrelated genes (background noise). Such correlation could be caused by the same experimental conditions that are used for sample preparation from the same organism, in contrast to unescapable differences between experimental procedures when different organisms are involved, by the same cellular context as suggested by <xref rid="evu051-B29" ref-type="bibr">Nehrt et al. (2011)</xref> or by a combination of both factors. In the absence of direct evidence, the appropriate null hypothesis is that experimental conditions are the main factor.</p><p>The dependency of the expression similarity on sequence divergence, regardless of the measure used, appears nonmonotonic for the within-species paralogs such that, somewhat paradoxically, the difference between orthologs and within-species paralogs nearly disappears at high divergence, in particular when <italic>Z</italic>-scores or ranking scores are used as measures of expression similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evu051-F2">fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>). This nonmonotonic dependency potentially can be explained by selection for balanced expression of recently duplicated genes in different tissues and environmental conditions. This scenario is consistent with several previous studies suggesting that rebalancing of expression after duplication, at least for some genes, could be subject to selection (<xref rid="evu051-B26" ref-type="bibr">Makova and Li 2003</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B37" ref-type="bibr">Qian et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B7" ref-type="bibr">Colbourne et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B15" ref-type="bibr">Huerta-Cepas et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B22" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evu051-B33" ref-type="bibr">Pegueroles et al. 2013</xref>). For example, <xref rid="evu051-B37" ref-type="bibr">Qian et al. (2010)</xref> have shown that yeast and mammalian genes often experienced a significant drop of the level of expression after duplication. Although the majority of the expression reduction is likely to be neutral, for some of the duplicated genes, it could be beneficial through the rebalanced gene dosage.</p><p>Taken together, the results of this work are fully compatible with the OC. However, the OC, all its importance notwithstanding, reflects only one aspect of gene evolution. The complete picture must integrate vertical descent encapsulated in the OC with the lineage-specific aspects of the evolution of paralogs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evu051/-/DC1">Supplementary figure S1</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evu051/-/DC1">table S1</ext-link> are available at <italic>Genome Biology and Evolution</italic> online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbe.oxfordjournals.org/">http://www.gbe.oxfordjournals.org/</ext-link>).</p>
