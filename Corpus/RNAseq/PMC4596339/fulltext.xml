Not only has our understanding of plant metabolism advanced using model systems and modern chromatography, but application of &#x02018;omics&#x02019;-based technology has been widely extended to non-model systems as costs have plummeted and efficiency increased. As a result, important fundamental questions relating to important horticultural crops are being answered, and novel approaches with application to industry are in progress. Here we review recent research advances on development and ripening of fruit crops, how next generation sequencing approaches are driving this advance and the emerging future landscape.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Impact of next-generation sequencing (ngs)</title><p>NGS has revolutionized biological research. Since the publication of the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> genome sequence in 2000,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> a deeper understanding of plant biology of both model and crop species has developed by the generation of genome, transcriptome, and epigenome data sets using NGS technology and new bioinformatics algorithms enabling the analysis of resulting data. The rate at which new genomes are being sequenced correlates with the rate at which the cost of the technology has declined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, software and algorithm development has to some extent lagged behind and shifted limitations from data generation to analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> The plant genomes that have been sequenced to date are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. Interestingly, the genomes sequenced in the last five or six years are mainly from species regarded as crops or non-model plants, in contrast with earlier sequencing efforts that concentrated on model plant systems. This change reflects the availability of new technologies and reduced costs as noted above allowing increased applied studies in crops of interest, in addition to more effective use of model systems. Excellent recent reviews focus on advances in genomics related to postharvest physiology and fruit ripening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> and impacts of genome sequencing on the research of crops and plants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> Here, we focus on NGS technology as a driving force in the advancement of the fields of -omics scale research in fruit crops.</p></sec><sec><title>Genome sequencing</title><p>A direct result of NGS technologies is that sequencing approaches employing BAC-by-BAC-based sequencing methodologies have been replaced by whole-genome shotgun, especially in the last few years with longer read lengths and improved assembly algorithms. It is important to note that the quality of genome sequences can vary depending on the depth of sequence coverage, combinations of sequence methods employed, heterozygosity and complexity of the genome in addition to annotation inputs and methodology, are among the most influential factors. Eighteen fruit genome sequences have been published to date, including grape,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> papaya,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> cucumber,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> apple,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> strawberry,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> date palm,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> tomato,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> melon,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> banana,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> Chinese plum,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> pear,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> watermelon,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> peach,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> kiwifruit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> and pepper.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> However, further progress on genome assembly as well as both physical and functional annotation, which greatly facilitates the use of the information, is needed. The tomato genome assembly is the most complete of all fruit species sequenced so far, but functional annotation of the gene models for this species remains incomplete. The assembly of the apple genome, which was sequenced using a similar strategy to tomato, initially BAC-by-BAC followed by whole-genome shotgun and NGS approaches, has been hampered by heterozygosity and recent gene duplications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> The assembly of this genome consists of relatively small contigs (averaging &#x0223c;7 kb for apple, <italic>vs.</italic> &#x0223c;28 kb for tomato), so building these into a scaffold which is routinely carried out during genome assembly has been difficult, and has led to a high level of redundancy. The estimated number of gene models for apple is relatively high, with 57&#x02009;386 predicted,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> but recent transcriptome analysis of apple using NGS has revealed an additional 17&#x02009;524 genes that were not predicted from the original genome assembly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> Further sequencing and genome assembly is required to better understand the real number of genes encoded in the apple and many plant genomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Map-based cloning</title><p>The availability of genome sequence enables the possibility for accelerated cloning of genes that characterize a mapped locus. Traditionally, map-based cloning utilizes DNA-based markers that have been mapped to fairly precise areas of plant genomes. Mutants are crossed into other backgrounds over many generations until a small area is fine mapped and can be sequenced using more traditional means, including Sanger sequencing. This approach has been successful for isolation of many ripening mutant loci, especially in tomato,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> as is covered in following sections of this review. In other fruit species, less progress has been made and such studies have focused on candidate genes responsible for ripening-related phenotypes based on their change in expression. The ACC synthase (ACS) alleles in apple have been extensively studied and appear to be involved in shelf-life periods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27 bib28 bib29">27&#x02013;29</xref></sup> However, polygenic mutations are the likely cause of these phenotypes, as the allelic diversity of ACS could not fully explain the full range of shelf-life attributes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup></p><p>As well as naturally occurring mutants and variants, collections of insertional, ethylmethane&#x000a0;sulfonate (EMS) and fast neutron mutants are available, particularly for tomato.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> The availability of new genomics resources enables identification of the genes responsible for mutant phenotypes at a much faster rate, with a sequenced genome, taking more advantage of fine mapping with fewer inputs due to increased marker diversity. One recent example was the cloning of a <italic>GOLDEN-LIKE2</italic> (<italic>GLK2</italic>) Myb super family transcription factor regulating plastid development and underlying the <italic>uniform</italic> ripening (<italic>u</italic>) mutant in tomato.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> When a normal <italic>U</italic> gene is expressed in tomato, dark green areas at the pedicel end of the fruit (shoulders), attributed to higher levels of chlorophyll and numbers of chloroplasts, are prevalent. This mutant has been bred into most commercial cultivars as it results in more even, or &#x02018;uniform&#x02019;, ripening. Interestingly, <italic>U</italic> gene expression manifests in a latitudinal gradient in the fruit (higher at the pedicel end compared with the stylar end) opposite to the gradient observed during ripening (from bottom to top) yet consistent with the green shoulder phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> Transcriptome analysis using RNAseq of these tissues has revealed ripening-related genes that follow a gradient pattern and some novel candidate genes for gradient control were identified, particularly in the more mature stages of ripening.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional genomics of fruit ripening</title><sec><title>Transcriptional control of ripening</title><p>The availability of mutants has been critical to elucidating gene function in plants, and tomato has one of the best collections of characterized fruit ripening-related mutants (maintained and accessible through the Tomato Genetics Resource Center at the University of Davis (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tgrc.ucdavis.edu/">http://tgrc.ucdavis.edu/</ext-link>)). Recent reviews describing some of these and the transcriptional control of ripening are available.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34 bib35 bib36">34&#x02013;36</xref></sup> In brief, several single locus mutations, resulting in ripening inhibition phenotypes have facilitated understanding of transcriptional control upstream of the required ethylene response for fruit ripening in tomato. Most notable are three ripening mutants, <italic>ripening-inhibitor</italic> (<italic>rin</italic>), <italic>non-ripening</italic> (<italic>nor</italic>) and <italic>colourless non-ripening</italic> (<italic>Cnr</italic>), which show severely inhibited ripening, do not produce elevated endogenous ethylene, or ripen in response to exogenous ethylene, and produce fruit that remain firm and green for extended periods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> However, these mutants show ethylene responsiveness at the level of gene expression indicating they normally control aspects of ripening control in addition to those mediated by ethylene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> The <italic>rin</italic> gene was the first cloned,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> and is important not only as a research tool but also commercially. <italic>RIN</italic>/<italic>rin</italic> hybrid tomato cultivars delay ripening and extend storage and shelf-life. <italic>RIN</italic> encodes a MADS-box transcription factor protein of the SEPALATTA clade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup>
<italic>Cnr</italic> is a rare epigenetic mutation, resulting from heritable hyper methylation in the promoter of the <italic>Cnr</italic> locus SQUAMOSA binding protein (SBP/SPL) causing greatly reduced transcription.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> The expression of <italic>CNR</italic> is reduced in the <italic>rin</italic> mutant indicating that it may act downstream of RIN-MADS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> and CNR is also required for RIN binding to target promoters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup></p><p>Global effects on ripening pathways, including ethylene independent metabolism, suggest that both RIN and CNR proteins are central to ripening regulation, and conserved through evolution in both climacteric and non-climacteric fruit species. Strawberry is probably the most studied non-climacteric fruit, and a ripening-related MADS-box sequence (<italic>FaMADS9</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> was silenced resulting in inhibition of fruit development and ripening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> This finding provides evidence that transcriptional regulators such as RIN are conserved in both climacteric and non-climacteric species. Furthermore, identification of ripening-related MADS-box genes in maturing banana peel and pulp tissue indicates that RIN function may also be conserved between fleshy fruited monocot and dicot species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Ripening control by ethylene</title><p>Ethylene is gaseous plant hormone playing roles in many response and developmental processes within plants. The role of ethylene in regulating fruit ripening in climacteric species is well documented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> The biosynthetic pathway, perception and signal transduction of ethylene has been described, and the associated genes cloned and characterized in many plant species. Most studies have relied on homology to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> sequences in identifying orthologs. This has been very successful, particularly in tomato. The biosynthesis of ethylene starts with the first dedicated and rate-limiting step of the pathway, the conversion of <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-<sc>l</sc>-methionine to ACC by activity of ACS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> Subsequently ACC is converted to ethylene by activity of ACC oxidase (ACO). The transcriptional regulation of <italic>ACS</italic> is a major control point of ethylene synthesis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46 bib47 bib48">46&#x02013;48</xref></sup> as it is encoded by a differentially expressed gene family of at least eight in tomato, two of which are upregulated during ripening (<italic>LeACS2</italic> and <italic>LeACS4</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> At least four family members have been isolated from apple,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref></sup> of which <italic>MdACS1</italic> and <italic>MdACS3</italic> have received most attention as they are expressed in fruit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> Suppression of <italic>ACS</italic> using an antisense construct for <italic>LeACS2</italic> was successful in tomato.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> ACO is also encoded by a differentially expressed gene family in both tomato and apple: at least four genes exist in tomato, two of which are expressed to high levels during ripening (<italic>LeACO1</italic> and <italic>LeACO3</italic>);<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup> and at least four genes exist in apple, two of which are expressed in fruit (<italic>MdACO1</italic> and <italic>MdACO2</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref></sup> Despite <italic>ACO</italic> genes being transcriptionally upregulated by ethylene and ripening, ACO activity is generally not rate limiting in ripening fruit. Although this is the case, suppression of <italic>ACO</italic> results in reduced ethylene and delayed ripening in a number of fruit species including tomato, melon, apple, papaya and kiwifruit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56 bib57 bib58 bib59 bib60">56&#x02013;60</xref></sup> Availability of the tomato genome sequence has led to <italic>in silico</italic> discovery of a further three putative <italic>ACS</italic> genes and another three putative <italic>ACO</italic> genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Functional attributes of these genes remain to be elucidated.</p><p>Ethylene signaling starts with its perception by receptors; a multigene family, of seven in tomato.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref></sup> These receptors are differentially expressed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref></sup> three are induced during ripening (<italic>LeETR3</italic>/<italic>Nr</italic>, <italic>LeETR4</italic> and <italic>LeETR6</italic>), and are negative regulators of ethylene. In the absence of ethylene, responses are repressed, but in the presence of the hormone, binding to receptors occurs and suppression of the response via a kinase cascade is reversed. Suppression of both <italic>LeETR3</italic>/<italic>Nr</italic> and <italic>LeETR4</italic> using a fruit-specific RNAi construct resulted in early ripening in transgenic tomato.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref></sup> It has also been shown that the receptors are targets of protein degradation via the 26S proteasome pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref></sup> and that LeETR4 protein is phosphorylated during ripening and exogenous ethylene application.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref></sup> Although the exact mechanisms of this protein turnover is not fully understood, it is tempting to speculate that phosphorylation of the receptor labels them for ubiquitination and degradation. Further, it has been observed that both ETR3/Nr and LeETR1 proteins interact with a tetratricopeptide repeat protein (SlTPR1) in a yeast two-hybrid assay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref></sup> These classes of proteins are involved with ubiquitination of targets during 26S proteasome mediated degradation. However, when overexpressed, increased levels of SlTPR1 protein did not cause any ripening-related changes, indicating the requirement of additional regulators in ethylene receptor turnover.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref></sup></p><p>The identification of the gene underlying the GREEN-RIPE (GR), a fruit-specific and ethylene-insensitive mutation of tomato was the first example of a novel ethylene signaling component discovered in a species other than <italic>Arabidopsis.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">68</xref></sup> Its homolog was also described in <italic>Arabidopsis.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">69</xref></sup> The function of GR is unknown, although its sequence suggests that it is membrane localized and has potential copper binding activities. It has been hypothesized that since the ethylene receptors are bound to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">71</xref></sup> and that copper ions are required for their activity, GR may influence copper binding to the receptors.</p><p>Following perception of ethylene, downstream signaling takes place via a <italic>CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1</italic> (<italic>CTR</italic>) map kinase kinase kinase family of three genes in tomato.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">72</xref></sup> It has been shown that ETR3/Nr in tomato interacts directly with multiple tomato CTR proteins,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">73</xref></sup> supporting the hypothesis that ethylene receptors directly transmit a signal to the downstream CTRs. Later steps of ethylene signaling are mediated by the positive regulators <italic>ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 2</italic> (<italic>EIN2</italic>) and <italic>ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3</italic> (<italic>EIN3</italic>). CTR negatively regulates EIN2 and there is just one <italic>EIN2</italic> gene in both <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tomato through which all ethylene processes are transmitted. In tomato, <italic>EIN2</italic> expression increases at the onset of ripening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">74</xref></sup> EIN2 then activates EIN3 encoded by a family of four <italic>EIN3</italic>-<italic>like</italic> genes in tomato. Antisense suppression of tomato <italic>EIL1</italic>, <italic>EIL2</italic> and <italic>EIL3</italic> reduces ethylene sensitivity. All of these genes are expressed throughout the plant suggesting there is some functional redundancy in tomato.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">75</xref></sup> A family of two EIN3 BINDING FACTOR (SlEBF1 and SlEBF2) FBOX proteins target the EIN3 protein for degradation via the 26S proteosome and are functionally redundant in tomato. Repression of SlEBF1/SlEBF2 resulted in constitutive ethylene responses and early ripening, indicating that ethylene signaling was activated by the stabilization of the EIL proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">76</xref></sup> The EILs transcriptionally activate a large family of ETHYLENE RESONSE FACTORS (ERFs), due to the large number of family members some degree of functional redundancy is likely.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup></p></sec></sec><sec><title>Transcriptomic studies reveal novel regulators of fruit development</title><p>There are numerous databases for fruit species where EST sequences have been deposited, and an inventory of these resources for horticultural crops is available.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">77</xref></sup> These EST sequences have been used for electronic gene expression data sets and for establishing microarrays for analyzing the expression of large numbers of genes in any given sample. However, the target sequence and hybridization limitations of microarrays, combined with the availability of NGS-based RNAseq technologies, has meant that this method has been largely replaced in most systems. Establishing a large-scale picture of gene expression during ripening, or in response to treatment or environmental stress, has become feasible. However, there are still relatively few reports in the ripening literature describing RNAseq, a situation that is likely to change rapidly, especially as no prior sequencing is required for a <italic>de novo</italic> build of a reference transcriptome, in the absence of an available genome sequence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">78</xref></sup> In addition, open access tools that provides users a platform for interactive large scale genome analysis further enable genome scale analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">79</xref></sup> Examples of how transcriptomics has driven the discovery of novel ripening regulators has been especially effective in tomato with numerous examples including <italic>LeHB1</italic>, <italic>TAGL1</italic>, <italic>FUL1</italic>/<italic>FUL2</italic>, <italic>SlAP2</italic> and <italic>SlERF6.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80 bib81 bib82 bib83 bib84">80&#x02013;84</xref></sup></p><p>Forward genetics has been useful in characterizing non-lethal mutants, but reverse genetics, has enabled the identification of many novel regulators of fruit ripening as noted above.

Unlike the effects of the DNA sequence (the genotype), changes in gene expression or cellular phenotype mediated by epigenetics are rooted in genome structure, packaging and non-sequence-based modifications. Examples of mechanisms that produce such changes are DNA methylation, acetylation and histone modifications, each of which can influence singularly and together, how genes are expressed without altering the underlying DNA sequence. Such changes may last through cell divisions for the duration of the cell&#x02019;s life, and may also last for multiple generations even though they do not involve changes in the underlying DNA sequence of the organism, instead, non-genetic factors cause the organism&#x02019;s genes to behave (or &#x02018;express themselves&#x02019;) differently. Recently, epigenome dynamics have been shown to occur during fruit development and impact ripening.</p><p>There is growing evidence that fruit ripening is influenced by the epigenome. The first evidence was reported by Manning <italic>et al</italic>.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> who showed the <italic>Cnr</italic> mutation in tomato is an epi-allele causing inhibition of ripening through heritable hypermethylation of cytosine residues within the <italic>CNR-SPL</italic> promoter. Epi-alleles are less stable and as such reversion to wild-type sometimes occurs which manifests as ripened sectors in otherwise non-ripened fruit. A number of whole genome/epigenome scale investigations have subsequently taken place in tomato indicating possible influences on development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> and sexual hybridization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96 bib97 bib98">96&#x02013;98</xref></sup> More recently, epigenome dynamics has been associated with ethylene response and ripening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">99</xref></sup> Ripening in climacteric fruit occurs by a developmental change in ethylene response described as System 1 to System 2 ethylene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">100</xref></sup> The transition to System 2 ethylene promotes ripening. Mature Green fruit, full size fruit harboring mature seeds, but still a week or so prior to ripening, are able to respond to exogenous ethylene and ripen. However, early during fruit development, System 1 ethylene production is auto inhibitory; fruit of these stages are unable to ripen in response to exogenous ethylene. Treatment of immature fruit with an inhibitor of methyltransferases resulted in ripening of immature fruits well in advance of seed maturation and normal ripening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">99</xref></sup> These results suggested that DNA methylation influences the System 1 to System 2 ethylene transition. Whole-genome methylome analysis of tomato fruit at four stages of development from immature to ripe indicated that distinct regions of demethylation were often localized upstream of ripening-related genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">99</xref></sup> In addition, it was observed that these same regions colocalized or were adjacent to the binding sites of the ripening associated transcription factor RIN-MADS protein, as determined by CHiP-seq analysis. In combination, demethylation of ripening gene promoters, RIN&#x02013;MADS binding and the early ripening of fruit inhibited for methylation, suggests an important role of the epigenome and its dynamics in contributing to ripening control and in particular the control of the transition from System 1 to System 2 ethylene response.</p></sec><sec><title>Investigation of the proteome during ripening</title><p>Commonly used techniques to identify proteins and map their interactions in a cellular context in plant-based proteomic research includes two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry (MS), matrix-assisted&#x000a0;laser&#x000a0;desorption&#x000a0;ionization&#x02013;time&#x000a0;of&#x000a0;flight (MALDI TOF), yeast two-hybrids screens, ELISA and western blots, complemented in varying degrees with computational prediction programs. Some of these methods have been used for years, but are now being adapted to high throughput screening techniques enabled for improved predictive power by annotated genome sequences and robust computational tools. It is the combined high-throughput screening and increased predictive ability that defines modern proteomics. The accurate quantitation of proteins and peptides in complex biological systems is one of the most challenging areas of proteomics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">101</xref></sup> MS-based methodologies have provided significant advances in accurate and sensitive quantitation and the ability to multiplex vastly complex samples through the application of robust bioinformatic tools.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">101</xref></sup> MS-based methodologies are relatively simple and address the issues of reproducibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">102</xref></sup> and under representation of low abundance,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">103</xref></sup> low mass and basic proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">104</xref></sup> Accordingly, MS-based methods have come into prominence compared with antibody-based methods due to their higher specificity, good reproducibility and precision, and ability to rapidly analyze hundreds of peptide transitions in a single assay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">105</xref></sup></p><p>Until recently, most proteomic studies of fruit had been carried out using two-dimensional electrophoresis to separate and identify proteins of interest.

The results of these studies highlight the need for improvements typically low numbers of proteins of interest have been identified and often with a high degree of contamination. These limited proteomes have provided initial proteome insights into fruit ripening and softening, and generally validate prior transcriptomic studies. Comparison of two ripening stages of peach revealed altered abundance of 53 proteins, among these, proteins involved in both primary and secondary metabolism, ethylene biosynthesis, and stress response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">106</xref></sup> In a fruit softening study of five peach and nectarine cultivars,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">107</xref></sup> it was revealed that 164 proteins were differentially changed.

Sucrose levels increased during development related to translocation from the leaf, and posttranscriptional mechanisms were important for metabolic regulation during early stages of development. Amino-acid levels decreased, coupled with the elevation of transcripts involved with amino acid and organic acid catabolism during ripening stage, consistent with the mobilization of amino acids to support respiration. Sucrose cycling also occurred during storage.</p><p>One of the more intriguing recent studies was a comparative investigation of three climacteric (peach and two tomato cultivars) and two non-climacteric species (strawberry and pepper).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">131</xref></sup> Using a principal component-based analysis, called STASIS, in combination with pathway over enrichment analysis, conserved dynamics of metabolic processes were observed using publically available metabolic profiles for the investigated species.

Such analyses have been made feasible through the availability of large-scale comprehensive data sets and ever increasing computational power. Typically metabolic, proteomic, transcriptomic, genetic and/or cell signaling networks are generated, making use of mathematical and computational models to find common themes such as correlation among large data sets. One of the major aims of systems biology is to use these models and networks to predict outcomes in the network when perturbed by an environmental cue, treatment, developmental transition or change in genotype. To date, much of this work in fruit has been done in tomato due to the genetic and genomic resources available for this system. As an example, targeted metabolic analysis, coupled with microarray transcriptome profiling, in the ethylene receptor mutant of tomato <italic>Nr</italic>, revealed multiple points of ethylene control during fruit development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">132</xref></sup> It was observed that 869 genes were differentially expressed during normal fruit development, and that the <italic>Nr</italic> mutation (i.e., ethylene) influenced 37% of these genes. <italic>Nr</italic> also influenced fruit morphology, seed number, ascorbate accumulation, carotenoid biosynthesis and ethylene evolution, consistent with the &#x02018;well known&#x02019; role of ethylene in ripening. Further, 72 of the differentially expressed genes are homologous to known transcription factors and genes involved in signal transduction, indicating complex regulatory control. In a subsequent study, the ripening mutants <italic>rin</italic> and <italic>nor</italic> were also compared (in addition to <italic>Nr</italic>) to wild-type tissues, at the transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic levels during development and ripening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">133</xref></sup> Shifts in primary metabolism were revealed by untargeted metabolic profiling, leading to a decrease in metabolic activity during ripening. Combining metabolomics, transcriptomic and proteomic data highlighted several aspects of metabolic control during ripening. Although expression level of transcripts and their corresponding proteins may not always correlate during earlier stages of ripening, much higher correlation was observed during the later stages of ripening, indicating complex posttranscriptional control at the onset and early stages of ripening. Strong correlations were also observed for ripening associated transcripts and specific groups of metabolites including sugars, cell wall-related metabolites and organic acids indicating their importance during the ripening process in tomato. Together these results confirm multiple ethylene-associated events during ripening in tomato. In a comparative systems biology-based study of a climacteric tomato and non-climacteric pepper fruits, both similarities and differences were observed in ripening regulation in these species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">130</xref></sup> While both species have similar ethylene-mediated signaling components, their regulation is different indicating possible ethylene insensitivity, or other non-ethylene-mediated regulators in pepper. Ethylene biosynthetic genes were not induced during ripening in pepper, yet genes downstream of ethylene signaling such as carotenoid biosynthesis, cell wall metabolism and the never-ripe receptor were induced in both pepper and tomato.</p><p>The use of systems biology in correlation or co-expression-based approaches, have been utilized successfully by the metabolic engineering field to fill gaps in biosynthetic pathways, or to discover novel regulators of biosynthetic pathways. One such example was reported in tomato, where the genetic diversity of the <italic>Solanum pennellii</italic> introgression lines was exploited to find regulators of carotenoid biosynthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">84</xref></sup> Transcriptome analysis using the TOM2 microarray and targeted metabolic profiling revealed 953 carotenoid-correlated genes, a subnetwork revealed 38 candidate transcription factors. One of these, <italic>SlERF6</italic> was functionally characterized by RNAi and it was revealed that suppression of this gene caused enhanced ethylene and carotenoid synthesis suggesting an important role for <italic>SlERF6</italic> in ripening connecting the ethylene and carotenoid pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Translational biology of ripening</title><p>As the number of sequenced genomes of fruit species grows, so do opportunities to exploit these genomics resources for translational experiments. The transcriptional regulation of ripening is well characterized in tomato as outlined in previous sections of this review providing opportunities for comparative genomics approaches to identify candidate genes from other fruit species taking advantage of leveraging functional studies performed in tomato. As an example, MADS-box transcription factors play a major role in the transition to and controlling ripening in tomato and other species. In a phylogenetic analysis of the kiwifruit MADS-box transcription factors, mined from the published genome,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> a total of 14 kiwifruit sequences were discovered, and were aligned with other known fruit and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>-predicted protein sequences as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">134</xref></sup> Their expression was confirmed by mining the RNAseq data that were released with the kiwifruit genome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows the phylogenetic relationship and the expression profiles of these 14 putative MADS-box transcription factors from kiwifruit. All were expressed in fruit tissues, however, half of these genes were expressed in low levels in maturing fruit, indicating a role more aligned with floral regulation and early fruit development rather than ripening. The other half of these genes increased during development, either at or following 120 days after pollination indicating a possible role in ripening control. Further, all of the main clades of the tree were represented with at least one kiwifruit gene that was expressed in mature fruit. This approach of mining regulators of ripening provides opportunities for biotechnological and marker-assisted breeding control of ripening.</p></sec><sec><title>Future prospects</title><p>The pace at which sequencing technologies, computer infrastructure and computational biology has developed has been staggering in the last 20 years. We now have the blueprints of how plants grow and undergo complex developmental processes through the rapidly expanding collection of plant genome sequences. However, interpreting these blueprints remains a challenge. These new &#x02018;omics&#x02019;-based research tools have already provided novel insights into the underlying biology of fruit development. Opportunities exist to expand this knowledge to postharvest systems, especially to responses of products to treatments such as temperature and modified atmospheres, as technology develops. Earlier this year, Illumina announced the release of their new generation of sequencing platforms, NextSeq 500 and HiSeq X Ten, both promising to lower sequencing costs and the time to generate sequence data.
