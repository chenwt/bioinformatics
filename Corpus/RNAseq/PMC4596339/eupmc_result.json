    "Next generation sequencing has revolutionized plant biology. Not only has our understanding of plant metabolism advanced using model systems and modern chromatography, but application of 'omics'-based technology has been widely extended to non-model systems as costs have plummeted and efficiency increased. As a result, important fundamental questions relating to important horticultural crops are being answered, and novel approaches with application to industry are in progress. Here we review recent research advances on development and ripening of fruit crops, how next generation sequencing approaches are driving this advance and the emerging future landscape."
