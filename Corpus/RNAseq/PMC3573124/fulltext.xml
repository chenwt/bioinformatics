Much research has been conducted on inhibitors for PKs, leading to a wealth of compounds that target PKs that have potential to be lead anthelmintic drugs. Identifying compounds that have already been developed to treat neglected tropical diseases is an attractive way to obtain lead compounds inexpensively that can be developed into much needed drugs, especially for use in developing countries. In this study, PKs from nematodes, hosts, and DrugBank were identified and classified into kinase families and subfamilies. Nematode proteins were placed into orthologous groups that span the phylum Nematoda. A minimal kinome for the phylum Nematoda was identified, and properties of the minimal kinome were explored. Orthologous groups from the minimal kinome were prioritized for experimental testing based on RNAi phenotype of the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> ortholog, transcript expression over the life-cycle and anatomic expression patterns. Compounds linked to targets in DrugBank belonging to the same kinase families and subfamilies in the minimal nematode kinome were extracted. Thirty-five compounds were tested in the non-parasitic <italic>C. elegans</italic> and active compounds progressed to testing against nematode species with different modes of parasitism, the blood-feeding <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> and the filarial <italic>Brugia malayi</italic>. Eighteen compounds showed efficacy in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and six compounds also showed efficacy in at least one of the parasitic species. Hypotheses regarding the pathway the compounds may target and their molecular mechanism for activity are discussed.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Parasitic nematode infection is a large global health and economic problem, infecting around 2 billion people and costing $100 billion in crops and livestock. People in developing countries often live on one dollar per day, so treatments cannot be expensive, therefore using pre-existing drugs as lead compounds provides an economical way to begin to develop affordable treatments. Protein kinases were chosen as the focus of this work due to the large number of pre-existing drugs that target them and their important role in regulating almost all activities in the cell. Herein we describe a set of protein kinases conserved in diverse nematode species and experimental screening results of pre-existing drugs that target these kinases. The compounds that show <italic>in vitro</italic> efficacy in both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and parasitic nematodes, <italic>H. contortus</italic> or <italic>B. malayi</italic> have potential to be optimized further.

Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins carried out by kinases and phosphatases regulate almost every activity in the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003149-Cohen2">[3]</xref>. Protein kinases (PKs) account for 2% of eukaryotic genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003149-Manning1">[4]</xref> and are considered viable drug targets because the catalysis mechanism and overall structure of PKs are conserved. Further, it is well established that small molecules can bind to their catalytic cleft <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003149-Zhang1">[5]</xref>. Hence, many kinase inhibitors have been developed to treat various human diseases, including drugs such as imatinib, trastuzumab, and lapatinib <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003149-Boyle1">[2]</xref>. Understanding PKs can enable a deeper understanding of how signaling pathways effect development, pathology and biochemistry of an organism and also lead to more efficacious drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003149-Cohen3">[6]</xref>. In fact, PKs are considered the second most important group of drug targets after G-protein coupled receptors and are the largest enzyme family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003149-Cohen2">[3]</xref>. Although toxicity has been a concern in some cases, many drugs that target PKs have been approved for treating various diseases, despite some lacking specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003149-Cohen2">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Given the importance of PKs in drug development, bioinformatics approaches and classification metrics have been developed to gain a greater understanding of PKs and PK inhibitors. PKs can be split into two diverse groups, with one group consisting of &#x0201c;conventional&#x0201d; PKs (ePKs) and the other comprised of &#x0201c;atypical&#x0201d; PKs (aPKs). The ePKs are the largest group and can be subdivided into 8 families and multiple subclasses using a multi-level hidden Markov model library <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003149-MirandaSaavedra1">[7]</xref>. The library consists of the following ePK classifications: the AGC family, CAMKs, the CK1 family, the CMGC family, the RGC family, the STE family, the TK family, and the TKL family. Proteins that do not fit into any of these classes are classified as other. The four aPK classifications consist of Alpha, PIKK, PHDK, and RIO. The multi-level library approach outperforms both BLASTP- and a Pfam HMMmodel-based approach in retrieving kinases and classifying them on a family level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003149-MirandaSaavedra1">[7]</xref>.</p><p>The World Health Organization estimates that over 2 billion people are infected with parasitic worms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003149-HoldenDye1">[8]</xref>. Further, parasitic worms also infect livestock and crops, which has deleterious effects on food production and has a negative economic impact worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003149-HoldenDye1">[8]</xref>. Nematodes are becoming resistant to currently available anthelminthics and pesticides, thereby creating an urgent need to develop new compounds to combat these parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003149-Prichard1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003149-vandenEnden1">[10]</xref>. Protein kinases in nematodes offer novel targets for new drugs that are desperately needed to fight parasitic nematode infections throughout the world. Targeting PKs in parasites that cause diseases with high mortality and morbidity, such as malaria, have recently generated much interest, as recent studies have indicated specific inhibition of the protozoan kinases can be achieved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003149-Doerig1">[11]</xref>. Like protozoan parasites, anthelmintic drug development for nematodes could also benefit from studying nematode kinases. Kinases are evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes, and the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, has kinase orthologs for over 80% of the human kinome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003149-Manning1">[4]</xref>. Given the large amount of information already existing for human PKs and kinase inhibitors and the overlap of kinases between <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, kinases in parasitic nematodes are attractive targets for finding lead anthelmintic compounds. This strategy of target repurposing has been explored for initiation and prosecution of neglected disease drug-discovery programs (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003149-Pollastri1">[12]</xref>). Furthermore, there are several examples in the literature where drugs have been also repositioned (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003149-Sundar1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003149-Pepin1">[14]</xref>).</p><p>By combining a variety of bioinformatics and cheminformatics approaches, along with laboratory screening on <italic>C. elegans</italic> and parasitic nematodes, we were able to learn more about kinomes of several nematodes spanning the phylum Nematoda. We identified kinases that are putative good targets, and experimentally test compounds that have been shown to interact with homologs of these kinases. Some of the compounds are already being used in the clinic or are in experimental phases of development for treating other diseases, making it possible to reposition this drug for use as a lead compound. For others, we have demonstrated anthelmintic potential, and due to their specificity, we also provide insight into pathways within Nematoda that might be important for drug targeting. Comparison of targets in nematodes and mammals also reveal opportunities for developing increased selectivity for nematodes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>The methodology comprised a multi-step process, which commenced with the predicted proteomes of parasites and their hosts and resulted in prioritized targets and compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003149-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="ppat-1003149-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1003149.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Methodology and pan-phylum kinome characteristics.</title><p>A.

To reduce the number of compounds and potential targets, only orthologous groups that had a protein conserved across all four nematode species that span the Phylum were considered because of their potential for broad control. Using the sixty-eight orthologous PK groups found in the previous section dramatically reduced compound search space. Out of 38 total kinase subgroups, only 28 kinase subgroups had orthologs in all four nematode species. 22 orthologous groups, spanning 13 kinase subgroups, had an RNAi phenotype in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Of the 22 orthologous groups, 14 (spanning 12 kinase subgroups) also have anatomical expression data in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. After considering RNAi phenotypes, nine orthologous groups were found which had expression in specific tissues known to be useful for drug targeting (i.e. pharynx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003149-Brownlee1">[18]</xref>, intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003149-Jasmer1">[19]</xref>, muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003149-Charvet1">[20]</xref> etc) and manifested a RNAi phenotype. These groups include: TK_sub2, AGC_sub4, CMGC_sub1, TKL_sub4, STE_sub1, CK1_sub2, TKL_sub2, and TKLK_sub5. Three other orthologous groups were identified because the groups had expression patterns conducive to being a drug target, but did not have an RNAi phenotype: CAMK_sub4, AGC_sub2, and AGC_sub4. The groups meeting these criteria, along with RNAi phenotypes, and stage and tissue expression, are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003149.s014">Table S5</xref>. RNAi phenotype and phenotype that resulted from the addition of compound could be different, depending on the region targeted by RNAi in multiple experiments. A similar phenotype obtained by the compound and the RNAi screen indicates that the compound has a mode of action that targets the same gene the RNAi targets; however, different phenotypes do not preclude a similar mode of action.</p><p>For our compound testing, we wanted to maximize the number of kinase groups tested with compounds, while also being cost effective. As a result, major kinase groups that appeared more than once in the top hit list were eliminated partially based on the number of compounds that target the subgroup: STE_sub4, TLK_sub2, and TLK_sub5. TLK_sub2 and STE_sub4 had only 3 and 5 compounds, respectively, associated with them in DrugBank. Based on the subgroup classification, 116 unique compounds that target kinases in eight kinase subgroups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003149.s015">Table S6</xref>) were investigated, 35 were prioritized based on cost and accessibility for experimental testing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003149.s016">Table S7</xref>). Specificity was not used to prioritize compounds.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Compound Screening in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>The compound screening began with L1-stage worms, which developed into adult worms over the course of the 72-hour experiment.

Thirteen compounds exhibited an EC<sub>50</sub>&#x0003c;20 ppm and 12 yielded a detectable phenotype.

Since helminth infections are endemic in developing countries, we explored possible repositioning of existing drugs for use as lead compounds, as using a pre-existing drug lowers substantially the cost of drug development. The nematode kinome is a rich resource for exploring compounds that may show anthelmintic activity due to the wealth of existing information on PKs and PK inhibitors. The lead compounds found via repositioning could be modified to increase efficacy. Using a pan-phylum compilation of nematode proteomes, kinases were identified and classified into groups and subsequently into subgroups. Kinases in DrugBank were also identified and classified into groups/subgroups. Compounds were linked to targets via the subgroup classification, and disparate information regarding the kinase targets was combined to prioritize the targets (and associated compounds) for experimental testing. A total of 35 compounds were tested in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and 18 exhibited a deleterious phenotype.</p><p>With our upfront prioritization and characterization, our study had a much higher hit rate with respect to <italic>C. elegans</italic> nematodes (51%), compared to a previous study where high-throughput screening of &#x0223c;14,000 compounds was done and resulted in 308 compounds yielding phenotypes (2.2% success rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003149-Kwok1">[22]</xref>). Out of the &#x0223c;14,000 compounds 483 are likely to be kinase inhibitors in the entire library based on a cheminformatic search using a Tanimoto score of 0.8 (3.45%), and of the 308 displaying phenotype (3.24%) 10 were kinase inhibitors. Our hit rate was 18/35 (&#x0223c;51%) compared to the HTS approach 10/483 (2.1%), resulting in a 25&#x000d7; enrichment. While the difference in the concentration used by the two studies (&#x0223c;25 &#x000b5;M versus 20 ppm (&#x0223c;25 to 60 &#x000b5;M, depending on the molecular weight of the compound)) could in part be responsible for the observed enrichment, our prioritization approach highly enriches for good potential candidates. Only two of our compounds tested overlapped with the high-throughput screening study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003149-Kwok1">[22]</xref>; <bold>2</bold> caused jerky and abnormal movements in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and the other (DB01953) did not produce a phenotype. Furthermore, our strategy used species that span the phylum, increasing the possibility of identifying candidate targets for broad control.</p><p>At the root of our study was i) identification of the kinome within each of the nematode species, and ii) identification and characterization of a minimal kinome, or group of kinases that are conserved among species that span the phylum Nematoda. The 68 pan-phylum nematode PK orthologous groups spanned 9 different PK groups (TK, AGC, CMGC, TKL, STE, CAMK, CK1, RIO, and RGC) and 28 subgroups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003149.s013">Table S4</xref>) out of a possible 12 groups and 38 subgroups. These kinases were linked to kinases in DrugBank based on their subgroup classification. A representative of each of the ePK groups is present in the minimal kinome, but some groups were more highly represented in the minimal kinome than others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003149-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), with CMGC being the most highly represented (21.6%). The highest reduction in parasitic nematodes versus free-living was detected in the Receptor Guanylate Cyclases (RGC) that has been shown to be expanded in several metazoans, most dramatically in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003149-Morton1">[23]</xref>. Based on our analysis, there is a drastic reduction of this class in the parasitic nematodes compared to <italic>C. elegans</italic>, especially in the human parasites <italic>T. spiralis</italic> (2%) and <italic>B. malayi</italic> (1.7%) vs <italic>C. elegans</italic> (5.1%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003149.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The nematode kinase groups had corresponding drug targets (by associations because drug targets were classified the same way) and drugs in DrugBank. DrugBank has nearly twice as many TK targets, most likely due to their prominence as cancer targets. However, DrugBank had nearly two fold more compounds that target CAMK proteins relative to the total number of compounds and targets, which is mainly caused by a large number of compounds targeting CAMK_sub1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003149.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>Over 65% of the minimal kinome that successfully maps to the major KEGG pathways are involved in Environmental Information Processing including the MAPK, Wnt, mTOR, or ErbB signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003149-g002">Figure 2B</xref>); however, only 34% of the minimal kinome can be mapped to the KEGG pathways. When the minimal kinome is mapped to KEGG pathways along with the proteins with which they interact, the vast majority are involved in genetic information processing or a combination of different pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003149-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The entire <italic>C. elegans</italic> minimal kinome maps to all five major KEGG pathways; however, individual kinase groups often lack a specific major pathway. For instance, TK and RGC are the only groups that map to metabolic pathways and CAMK and TK do not map to any genetic information processing pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003149.s006">Figure S6</xref>).</p><p>The second phase of our study involved linking compounds in DrugBank to kinases in nematodes that were conserved across the phylum. This study did not bias the results toward kinase inhibitors, rather all compounds in DrugBank were considered if the target made the appropriate cutoff. Thus, some compounds are not typical kinase inhibitors, but had experimental evidence for binding to a kinase. These compounds were tested so as to not throw away potential lead compounds, even though they were not typical kinase inhibitors. The 18 compounds that yielded a phenotype in <italic>C. elegans</italic> provide excellent lead compounds that could be developed into anthelmintic drugs. Further, 6 of the 18 compounds also showed efficacy against at least one of two very different nematode species, the blood-feeding <italic>H. contortus</italic> and the filarial <italic>B. malayi</italic>. The difference in lifestyle between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and the parasitic nematodes is quite large, making the finding that these 6 compounds are more broadly applicable to the entire phylum. However, differences in the species could also lead to a large difference in compound potency across the species, as the species have different uptake mechanisms. Further, the screening on the various species included different life stages, which could also lead to differences in compound potency. Several of these compounds that were hits in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are already FDA approved drugs used as antimicrobials and/or cancer drugs. One example is <bold>16</bold> (Dasatinib), an approved small molecule that targets BCR/Abl in chronic myloid leukemia, which exhibited deleterious effects on worms yielding an EC<sub>50</sub> of 22.3 &#x000b5;M. Flavopiridol, <bold>18</bold>, is an experimental treatment for cancer that also yielded an EC<sub>50</sub> of 48.3 &#x000b5;M. Neomycin, <bold>4</bold>, is an antibacterial compound that yielded an EC<sub>50</sub> of 9.7 &#x000b5;M. Etoposide, <bold>1</bold>, is an approved small molecule and has antitumor activity which caused jerky/abnormal movements in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. These compounds have already extensive toxicity data for humans associated with them (<bold>16</bold>

Within TK_sub2, 13 compounds were tested, and 7 of them yielded an EC50 &#x0003e;20 ppm and/or a phenotype in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Oftentimes, the compounds are able to target several different kinases within this group, making it particularly difficult to discern a precise targeted protein or pathway.</p><p>For all the compounds, additional studies need to be done to completely confirm the compounds' mode of action. However, three subgroups of kinases, which had compounds that were likely to specifically target a particular enzyme, provide useful hypotheses into the compound's mode of action for further study. The first group is CMGC_sub1, which is a kinase group that contains predominately CDKs (cyclin dependent kinase) and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase). Of the 14 <italic>C. elegans</italic> proteins in this group (cutoff 1e<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>), 4 were conserved among <italic>T. spiralis</italic>, <italic>B. malayi</italic>, and <italic>M. incognita</italic>. These conserved <italic>C. elegans</italic> kinases are B0285.1 (cdc2 kinase), B0205.7 (casein kinase II), F43C1.2 (ERK5), and B0478.1 (JNK). From DrugBank, there are 14 drug targets that are classified in CMGC_sub1. Out of the eight compounds tested that target this group, two compounds, <bold>12</bold> and <bold>15</bold>, showed efficacy and specifically target p38 based on literature searching and DrugBank listings.

However, <bold>15</bold> binds to the <italic>H. sapiens</italic> ortholog of B0218.3 (NP_620581.1) at a much higher affinity (0.45 nM), increasing the likelihood that B0218.3 is the main target in our <italic>C. elegans</italic> screen. The proteins with which B0218.3 interacts include those involved in organismal systems and environmental information processing and are also differentially over-expressed during stages in which the compound screening assay was carried out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003149-g006">Figure 6A &#x00026; C</xref>).</p><fig id="ppat-1003149-g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1003149.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>PPIs from MINT mapped using PPIs from <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologs from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</title><p>PPIs for A.

Out of the 3 compounds tested that target this group, 2 compounds, <bold>11</bold> and <bold>3</bold>, showed efficacy. Compound <bold>11</bold> specifically targets casein kinase 1 from CK1_sub2. Compound <bold>11</bold> did not yield an EC<sub>50</sub> value, but appeared to have jerky movement. Compound <bold>3</bold> binds casein kinase 1, as well as ser/thr protein kinase haspin and MAPK3, yielding an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 2.6 &#x000b5;M and resulting in worms that move slowly and are smaller and less developed.

Comparing their sequence to <italic>C. elegans</italic> proteins that were classified into CK1_sub2, the sequence of the X-ray crystal structure most closely resembles Y106G6E.6, making it likely that the compounds bind to this protein and its other casein kinase I gamma nematode orthologs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003149.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Further, Y106G6E.6 is also differentially over-expressed in late embryo, L2, and young adult stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003149-g006">Figure 6D</xref>), which include stages during which the screening experiment was done. The results from <italic>B. malayi</italic> further point to the compound targeting its CK1 alpha orthologs. Compound <bold>11</bold> did not pass the threshold for causing a 50% reduction in motility, but came very close in males with 41.6% reduction in viability in males at 100 &#x000b5;M concentration. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003149.s009">Figure S9</xref>).

Compound <bold>17</bold> is not in DrugBank, but was chosen for testing because of its similarity to DB01933 and the inability to obtain DB01933. DB01933 targets AGC_sub4, but <bold>17</bold> is a known inhibitor of PKA, which is in AGC_sub2. Not only did <bold>17</bold> yield an EC<sub>50</sub> when added to <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the worms also displayed jerky, slowed, and twitching movements on the test plate, in addition to being smaller. Interestingly, siRNA was used to knockdown a splice variant of PKA, causing paralysis in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> adult stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003149-Murray1">[47]</xref>.
