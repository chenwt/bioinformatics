However, pluripotent stem cell populations are heterogeneous and functional properties at the single cell level are poorly documented leading to inefficiencies in differentiation and concerns regarding reproducibility and safety. Here, we use non-invasive time-lapse imaging to continuously examine hPSC maintenance and differentiation and to predict cell viability and fate. We document dynamic behaviors and social interactions that prospectively distinguish hPSC survival, self-renewal, and differentiation. Results highlight the molecular role of E-cadherin not only for cell-cell contact but also for clonal propagation of hPSCs. Results indicate that use of continuous time-lapse imaging can distinguish cellular heterogeneity with respect to pluripotency as well as a subset of karyotypic abnormalities whose dynamic properties were monitored.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Previous studies demonstrated that non-invasive imaging of cell cycle parameters provides a useful tool to prospectively predict developmental success or failure that is linked to genetic stability in preimplantation human embryos<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.

Although recent advances in single cell analyses have demonstrated remarkable heterogeneity in hPSC populations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, our understanding of individual pluripotent stem cells remains limited. Limitations are largely due to technical hurdles that include invasive retrospective tests for stem cell function, low differentiation efficiencies and asynchrony in cell cycle progression. Long term live cell imaging and quantitative analyses of the dynamics of cell populations may help overcome current limitations and complement invasive analytical techniques<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we developed non-invasive methods to reliably predict fate of hPSCs and their differentiated progeny via time-lapse microscopy. We hypothesized that distinct stem cell behaviors are diagnostic of self-renewing cells, differentiated progeny and potentially, although not yet explored, disease, genetic and/or epigenetic status. We show here that hPSCs in culture display unique dynamic behavioral patterns that can be measured and quantified. We anticipate that observation of social and dynamic behavior of hPSCs may provide an additional means for routine assessment of stem cells for basic and pre-clinical applications to insure reproducibility, safety and/or efficacy.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Pluripotent cells exhibit dynamic behavior</title><p>To evaluate whether quantitative, non-invasive methods of analyzing cell behavior during self-renewal and differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) might allow prediction of cell state and outcomes, we began by focusing on the dynamics of colony formation. Single cells derived from hESC colonies were first labeled with CDy1, a fluorescent rosamine dye which specifically labels pluripotent cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, and then were plated on matrigel coated plates at different densities (150,000; 15,000 and 1,500&#x02009;cells/cm<sup>2</sup>). Cell image data was acquired continuously for over 96&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary movies 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">2</xref>, 3). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1c</xref>, poor survival of the cells was observed at low densities, as previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. We then used customized semi-automated tracking software termed the Cell Moment Tracker (CMT, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary movie 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">4b</xref>) to extract distinct changes in cell cycle lengths that depended upon seeding density. Cells seeded at higher density (were tracked manually), had shorter cell cycle times and higher mitotic rates relative to those seeded at mid- and low-density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1b</xref>). We also observed that cells seeded at low densities extended more cellular appendages towards neighboring cells, thus increasing both their cross-sectional (cellular) area and volume. In contrast, cells at high density were more compact and aggregated efficiently with neighbors, thus contributing to colony formation. Notably, cells at low densities (1,500cells/cm<sup>2</sup>) showed greater variability in cell behavior. Nonetheless, cell behaviors could be quantified and single cells were tracked. For the remaining experiments, we seeded cells at low density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary movies 3a</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">4a</xref>).</p><p>We scored cells based on their ability to form colonies. By manually counting and tracking cells, we observed that it is critical for survival that a small number of cells initiate colony formation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, when three or more cells associate closely and give rise to granddaughter cells, within the first 24&#x02009;hrs post-plating, a pluripotent colony is formed. If the cells fail to divide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>) or leave the group within this time period, then colony formation is unlikely. Based on these results, we analyzed the data generated via CMT and observed that the average distance between cells that form colonies is &#x0003c;50&#x02009;um. Cells that migrate and ultimately supplement colony formation are within 50&#x02013;200&#x02009;um and cells that fail to contribute to colonies are beyond 300&#x02009;um. We termed cells that contribute to colony formation as &#x02018;neighbor&#x02019; cells when within 100&#x02009;um of cells of interest. We also observed that the migration of individual cells differed between cells that contributed to colonies and those that did not. These observations corroborate the &#x02018;community effect&#x02019; as described theoretically by Saka <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. as an interaction among a group of nearby cells which is necessary to form or maintain a tissue.</p><p>Based on observations described above and data generated through CMT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 3b</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">4b</xref>), we concentrated analysis on the dynamic properties that cells exhibit during colony formation including speed of movement, mitotic events, total distance travelled, area and distance to nearest neighbors. We observed three types of distinct cell behaviors that define hPSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). Cells that form a colony by themselves (either by clonal propagation or by aggregating with nearby cells) are termed Type 1 (colony forming cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary movie 4b</xref>). Cells that extend appendages and demonstrate migratory behavior to ultimately fuse or join colonies are termed Type 2 (colony fusing cells) and single cells that do not form or supplement colonies are termed Type 3 (non-colony forming cells). Type 1 cells demonstrated directed migration patterns and less displacement in terms of speed relative to Type 2 cells which displayed random and selection-based movements or Type 3 cells which demonstrated random migratory patterns and traveled a large distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,d</xref>). Notably, Type 1 cells were characterized by greater cumulative migratory distance even though they traveled a shorter distance than Type 2 and 3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). This indicated that the cells involved in early colony formation are not stationary and may play a critical role in early colony organization.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Pluripotent cell interactions with neighbors</title><p>Given that survival of single cells is compromised at low density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>), we hypothesized that interactions between neighboring cells might be a key characteristic of pluripotent stem cells. We analyzed the initial number of neighbors (number of neighbors at plating or time 0) in the three population types and observed that Type 1 cells had more neighbors than Type 2 or Type 3 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3a</xref>). We then tested whether there was an effect of neighbors on cell survival and mitosis and found that survival is highly correlated with the initial number of neighbors, with survival rate increasing as density of the cells increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Mitotic events also correlated with initial number of neighbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>), indicating the importance of neighboring cells in the colony forming process. When average speed, number of mitotic events and number of initial neighbors were plotted, a clear segregation of the three types of cells was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p><p>To further investigate neighbor behavior and determine how neighbor size and mean distance from the cells could impact survival, we generated clustered heat maps of neighbor properties for cells that were tracked. We observed that Type 1, 2 and 3 cells clustered based solely on neighbor features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Interestingly we also observed that Type 3 cells show larger displacement than Type 1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2bi, iii</xref>), though their cumulative distance travelled is less than Type1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Hence their distance to neighbors is variable in time and when seen collectively over time, show shorter neighbor distances than Type1 cells. Type 2 cells demonstrated an intermediate phenotype in respect to neighbor properties. As a control, somatic cells (fibroblasts) were analyzed similarly and showed no evidence of neighbor dependence or similar dynamic behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary movie 5</xref>).</p><p>Neighbor interactions suggest that cells may sense their neighbors via cytokine or chemokine attractions with migration typified by chemotaxis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. In order to test this concept, we calculated the direction of each cell&#x02019;s nearest neighbor for every frame in the time-lapse sequence. We hypothesized that if every cell secretes cytokine or chemokine signals, then from the perspective of a lone single cell, the gradient would be strongest towards the nearest neighbor, thus biasing migration toward that neighbor. To determine if this is the case, we analyzed the distribution of the direction of the instantaneous displacement vector of every cell at every frame. The direction of displacement vectors was calculated with respect to the direction of the nearest neighbor. Thus, displacement in the direction of 0 [degrees] indicates movement towards the nearest neighbor. In order to determine if there was any bias in the direction of data points, we employed the Rayleigh test<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. The rejection of the null hypothesis by the Rayleigh test indicates unimodal clustering of cell directions. In addition, we used the V test which allows the <italic>a priori</italic> specification of an expected direction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Rejection of the null hypothesis in the V test would suggest that there is bias in a specific direction. As seen in the radial histogram plots, hESCs seeded at high density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>), displayed little or no chemotactic migration in any one direction. In contrast, cells that were seeded at lower density displayed directional migration toward the nearest neighbors (at 0 degrees in the plot) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref>). Notably, control fibroblasts showed no directional migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h</xref>), thus highlighting differences in pluripotent cells and differentiated cells.</p><p>Based on the above findings, we summarize likely early events of colony formation from single cells dissociated from a parent colony as follows: 1) Extracellular matrix (ECM) recognition and attachment. 2) Sensing of neighbors and surroundings via: i. attraction - cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, ECM-degrading proteases, haptotaxis (contact guidance) and ii. migration, typified by more directional and organized when cells fuse into colonies, biased when surrounded by neighbors, random with no sense of direction when isolated. 3) Aggregation of neighboring cells. 4) Expansion of colonies with an increase in cell cycle time indicative of growth of cell populations.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>E-cadherin/TRA160 dual positive single cells show clonal propagation</title><p>E-cadherin (ECAD), a transmembrane protein that plays an important role in cell adhesion, is known to have an important function in maintaining pluripotency of hPSCs and in reprogramming of fibroblasts into iPSCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. To explore whether ECAD might be implicated in propagation of hPSCs, we immunostained single hESCs for ECAD protein expression and observed that although most cells expressed membrane-bound ECAD, some cells exhibited intracellular ECAD localization (data not shown). Hence, we labeled single hESCs with TRA160 (a pluripotent marker) and ECAD and analyzed the sorted population. We observed that although ~80% of cells expressed TRA160, only half of that population had membrane bound ECAD protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref> (inset)). We sorted the cells based on their ECAD and TRA160 expression and seeded them at a density of 1,500&#x02009;cells/cm<sup>2</sup>, and followed them via time-lapse microscopy. Results indicated that the majority of cells that were ECAD<sup>+</sup>TRA160<sup>+</sup>, expressed membrane bound Ecadherin and nuclear OCT4; demonstrated ability to clonally propagate and form colonies within 4&#x02013;5 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary movie 6</xref>). In contrast, ECAD<sup><bold>&#x02212;</bold></sup>TRA160<sup><bold>+</bold></sup>cells demonstrated nuclear OCT4 along with Ecadherin localized either in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>) and were dependent on neighbors to form pluripotent colonies, whereas ECAD<sup><bold>+</bold></sup>TRA160<sup><bold>&#x02212;</bold></sup> cells failed to form any colonies. Dual positive cells also demonstrated greater numbers of mitotic events than the other two types of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). When we compared the dynamic properties of the ECAD<sup><bold>+</bold></sup>TRA160<sup><bold>+</bold></sup>, ECAD<sup><bold>&#x02212;</bold></sup>TRA160<sup><bold>+</bold></sup> and ECAD<sup><bold>+</bold></sup>TRA160<sup><bold>&#x02212;</bold></sup> cells with an emphasis on migration speed, we observed that these three phenotypes reflected migratory behavior of Type 1, 2 and 3 cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3b</xref>). These findings indicate that phenotypic and dynamic analysis of cell behavior relays information regarding molecular status with potential to predict fate of the cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>hPSCs can retain pluripotency and interact when cultured in somatic cell culture media</title><p>Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) can support feeder-independent growth of hESCs at high concentrations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Removal or reduced concentrations of bFGF results in loss of pluripotency. For example, in our studies, we used mTeSR1 media to culture hPSCs. This media contains 100&#x02009;ng/ml of bFGF, whereas, somatic cell growth media such as SMGS (Smooth Muscle cell growth supplement) contains only 2&#x02009;ng/ml bFGF. To examine behaviors of hPSCs in culture with different bFGF concentrations, we co-cultured single cells and small groups of 5&#x02013;7 hESCs with smooth muscle cells (SMCs) for a period of 8 days in SMGS. For ease of identification, we labeled the hESCs with CFSE dye. As shown, we tracked single and small clumps of hESCs and observed that single isolated hESCs showed very little cell survival in SMGS relative to hESCs in groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 7</xref>). We also observed that SMCs demonstrated greater migrational speeds than hESCs in SMGS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Relative gene expression data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>) of Day 0 and Day 8 co-cultured cells indicated that both the hESC population and SMC population expanded over the course of 8 days. Furthermore, in the co-cultured group, we observed that SMCs act like feeder cells to the small clumps of hESCs thereby increasing the expression of pluripotency markers. However the hESCs alone in SMGS medium show decrease in the expression of pluripotency markers due to spontaneous differentiation in low bFGF conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, hPSCs at Day 8 demonstrated strong expression of nuclear OCT4 and ECAD in cells that were tightly aggregated in small colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Expression of CD31 in the vicinity of the hESC colonies suggested that few cells spontaneously differentiated toward SMCs. These results demonstrated that hESCs with sufficient neighbors retained hallmarks of pluripotency and continued to proliferate even in somatic cell culture conditions. In contrast, groups of hESCs of less than 5&#x02013;7 cells were not observed and most likely differentiated or died. Thus, the presence of neighbors is an important dynamic parameter that modulates cell fate since hPSCs with sufficient neighbors retain pluripotency and continued to proliferate even in the presence of media optimized for culture of somatic cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell dynamics during early differentiation</title><p>We next examined cellular dynamics during early differentiation events by transferring cells to differentiation media and tracking morphological and behavioral changes for 72&#x02009;hours. We compared early differentiation to spontaneous differentiation of hESCs to fibroblasts, a common fate observed in routine culturing of hESCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5ai</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 8</xref>) and following exposure to 20% fetal bovine serum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5aii</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary movie 9</xref>). We observed that early differentiating cells behaved differently than hESCs. Rather than aggregating to form a tight colony, the cells accumulated cytoplasm, thereby increasing cell surface area (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5b</xref>) and displayed altered mitotic parameters and increased cell cycle times (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5c</xref>).</p><p>In order to investigate the dynamic properties of hPSCs undergoing targeted differentiation, we exposed small colonies of 50&#x02013;100 hESCs to chemically defined medium supplemented with factors that promote generation of vascular progenitors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref> (top panel, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 10</xref>), we observed phenotypic changes similar to those observed with spontaneous differentiation: namely, an increase in cell surface area relative to hPSCs and a rapid decrease in frequency of mitotic events from D0 to D2. TRA160/180 staining over the course of differentiation of the cells revealed that many cells do not reduce expression of these markers of pluripotency immediately upon differentiation. Indeed, a subset of cells continued to proliferate and remained pluripotent even after eight days of differentiation. When we assessed the dynamic properties of differentiated as well as undifferentiated cells for the first two days of differentiation, we observed that differentiated cells showed higher migration speeds as compared to the undifferentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). However, not all cells gave rise to vascular progenitors (CD31<sup>+</sup> cells) and some cells continued to express TRA160/180 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>a<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6"/>c (lower panel)).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Dynamic behaviors may reflect karyotype</title><p>hPSCs are prone to genetic instablity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. For example, trisomy of chromosome 12 is often seen with continuous culture of pluripotent stem cells and in certain cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Recent studies have shown that &#x0201c;adapted&#x0201d; cells that carry karyotypic abnormalities can display characteristic cell behaviors that differ from those of karyotypically normal hESCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. These adapted cells can proliferate without neighbor interactions and independent of migratory patterns. We hypothesized that karyotypic abnormality might be detected at the single cell level and quantified through altered dynamic properties relative to cells with normal karyotypes and quantified via use of the CMT. Thus, we compared karyotypically-normal hESCs (H1 and H9) and iPSCs (BJRiPCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>) to those with two abnormal karyotypes (iPSCs (TSC1c2 &#x02013; Turner Syndrome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>)) and HUF43c5 (Trisomy 12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). When we used a similar experimental protocol as above and analyzed the data via the CMT, we observed that cell survival and number of mitotic events were similar across normal karyotypic cells. In contrast, TSC1c2 cells that lack a second X chromosome showed reduced cell survival after 24&#x02009;hrs of plating and HUF43c5 cells, with an extra chromosome 12, showed higher cell survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). The number of mitotic events was also higher in HUF43c5 cells relative to TSC1c2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). Surprisingly, we observed that the single cells from abnormal karyotypic cells migrated over a larger distance, with enhanced motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>). Further, when we compared the velocities to single hESCs, as well as those in small colonies, we observed a significant difference between the hESCs and the HUF43c5-iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 11</xref>). In order to detect karyotypic abnormalities, we co-cultured hESCs and HUF43c5 iPSCs in a 5:1 ratio and tracked the cells using the CMT. For ease of tracking, we labeled HUF43c5 cells with CFSE dye. We documented similar differences in the speed of movement in the two types of cells in co-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 12</xref>). We stress that although this observation cannot be generalized to all abnormal karyotypic cells, it indicates that karyotypic abnormalities can alter dynamic characteristics and may be detectable and quantified via non-invasive methods.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Human development begins with a single cell embryo that gives rise to a variety of cell types in order to ultimately form a fully developed healthy individual. The behavior of cells in developing tissues and their interactions with other cell types define differentiation during development. Thus, documenting and quantifying behavior of individual cells may inform studies of fundamental human biology and provide methods to prospectively predict cellular responses of pluripotent stem cells and their differentiated progeny.</p><p>Our results suggest that hPSCs, both hESCs and iPSCs display dynamic behavioral patterns that can be measured through time-lapse imaging and use of automated, quantitative image analysis in order to predict the outcome of their next division via algorithmic statistics. Results indicate that migratory movement (directional to the neighbors) is a characteristic dynamic social behavior of hPSCs that is predictive of cell survival and maintenance of pluripotency. These results correlate well with previous studies that have shown that individual cell movement, asymmetric colony expansion, Rho-associated kinase, and ECAD may form a functional network that impacts hESC clonogenicity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Here, we demonstrate that heterogeneity within a pluripotent colony can be identified using continuous time-lapse microscopy and that behaviors are well-correlated with presence or absence of biochemical markers. These findings coupled with gene expression data and protein profiles can be used to monitor cellular heterogeneity in real time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>).</p><p>An application of the research described here may be in use in prospectively validating and isolating cells of a pre-determined developmental potential. Results are transferrable to both hESCs and iPSCs (for normal karyotype as indicated in our results) and examination of subtle behaviors that may ultimately influence cellular outcomes <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo.</italic> A major roadblock to the use of pluripotent stem cells is the limitation of diagnostics and predictive capabilities at this time, with most assays being invasive (RNAseq, marker analysis and genetic/epigenetic analyses) and population-based. Practical and effective cell-quality assurance methods might benefit from analysis of cell behaviors and be used in conjunction with invasive methods to minimize variability in growth and differentiation protocols prior to basic and clinical applications. Thus, time lapse and quantitative imaging of human pluripotent stem cells during growth and differentiation may contribute to our repertoire of tools to understand and predict cell fate.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>Undifferentiated pluripotent stem cell lines, hESC lines: H9 (46, XX) and H1 (46, XY) and human derived iPSC lines: BJRiPCs (46, XY), HUF43 (46+1, XX), TSC1c2 (46-1, X) were maintained in feeder free conditions with mTeSR1 (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada).
