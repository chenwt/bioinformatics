Currently, eukaryote transcriptomes are analyzed using deep short-read sequencing experiments of complementary DNAs. The resulting short-reads are then aligned against a genome and annotated junctions to infer biological meaning. Here we use long-read complementary DNA datasets for the analysis of a eukaryotic transcriptome and generate two large datasets in the human K562 and HeLa S3 cell lines. Both data sets comprised at least 4 million reads and had median read lengths greater than 500 bp. We show that annotation-independent alignments of these reads provide partial gene structures that are very much in-line with annotated gene structures, 15% of which have not been obtained in a previous <italic>de novo</italic> analysis of short reads. For long-noncoding RNAs (<italic>i.e.</italic>, lncRNA) genes, however, we find an increased fraction of novel gene structures among our alignments. Other important aspects of transcriptome analysis, such as the description of cell type-specific splicing, can be performed in an accurate, reliable and completely annotation-free manner, making it ideal for the analysis of transcriptomes of newly sequenced genomes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that long read sequence can be assembled into full-length transcripts with considerable success. Our method is applicable to all long read sequencing technologies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>Roche sequencing</kwd><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>splicing</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name> DJS Export </meta-name><meta-value>v1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Although genome sequencing has become commonplace, a significant challenge is to obtain an accurate annotation of each gene locus as well as a quantitative description of the transcript isoforms produced from it. This information is crucial for inferring biological meaning from each gene locus and, given the role of alternative splicing in diseases such as cancer (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">David and Manley 2010</xref>), will likely play a role in analysis of human disease. Currently, gene annotation is usually addressed using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction experiments (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Harrow <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Pruitt <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>) and a quantitative description is carried out using short read sequencing projects (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Mortazavi <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Nagalakshmi <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Djebali <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). Thus, quantitative description often relies on the presence and quality of existing annotations.</p><p>In contrast to lower eukaryotes such as yeast, human transcripts contain more introns on average. It has been estimated that between 74% and 100% of human multiexon genes are alternatively spliced (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Johnson <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Harrow <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Pan <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). These studies demonstrate that alternative splicing can be highly regulated. Therefore, proper interpretation of eukaryotic transcriptomes requires accurate detection and quantification of full transcripts with accurate assignment of transcription start site, poly-adenylation site, and splice junctions. Mapping short reads against a genome annotation (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Graveley <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Djebali <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>) and its junctions provides quantifications of single junctions and exons. Yet prediction of entire transcript structures requires advanced analysis tools (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Montgomery <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Roberts <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Despite recent advances in the field, it is not always clear how well they reconstruct full-length transcripts when used <italic>de novo</italic>.</p><p>Here, we sequence millions of complementary DNAs (cDNAs) in the human K562 and HeLa cell lines using the 454/Roche long-read sequencing technology. Although the reads are shorter than what can be achieved on the Pacific Biosciences platform (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Eid <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>), the presented data are considerably deeper than what can be achieved at this point on that platform at a reasonable cost. These 454 reads usually span multiple introns and therefore show a level of information that is not present in short read sequencing projects. We show that the partial, but long, gene structures provided by alignments of 454 reads correspond well with annotated transcript structures. In addition, we detected novel, unannotated spliceforms. These results show both the high quality of the annotation and of our sequenced cDNAs, and that the process of genome annotation and transcriptome quantification can be performed without <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge of transcript structures. Similarly, we show that high-quality cell type/condition/individual-specific splicing analysis can be achieved using this approach. The demonstrated approach is in principle applicable to all long-read sequencing approaches, including Pacific Biosciences (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Eid <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>), and its success will increase with sequencing depth and read length. Overall, this approach is ideal for transcriptome analysis in recently sequenced genomes that lack a detailed annotation or in cases where using an annotation could introduce a bias into the results.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Data access</title><p>The 454 reads (sff-files) are available at the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under accession no.

Read length rarely ever fell below 450 bp, whereas reads with lengths of longer than 800 bp could readily be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.112.004812/-/DC1/004812SI.pdf">supporting information</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.112.004812/-/DC1/FigureS1.pdf">Figure S1</ext-link>, A and B, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.112.004812/-/DC1/FigureS2.pdf">Figure S2</ext-link>A).</p><p>All reads were mapped to the hg19 version of the human genome sequence (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Lander <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Venter <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>) using the spliced aligner GMAP (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Wu and Watanabe 2005</xref>). For K562 cells, 94.3% of all reads could be mapped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The remaining 5.7% unmapped reads were on average of much lower quality and also longer than the mapped reads. A more detailed analysis of unmapped reads can be found in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.112.004812/-/DC1/FigureS3.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link> and its legend. Mapping numbers per chromosome broadly correlated with chromosome length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Chromosome Y received a very low number of read mappings (~19,000). These mappings are unlikely to reflect the true biological origin of the corresponding RNAs but rather homology between DNA sequences on chrY and other chromosomes, because K562 cells were created from a female donor. In contrast to short-read technologies such as Illumina, long-read technologies such as 454 usually obtain reads of varying length. The typical approach of fixing a number of mismatches, above which a mapping for a read is not considered, is therefore not suitable for long-read technologies.</p><p>Thus, we devised more flexible criteria (<italic>Materials and Methods</italic>) to define high-confidence mappings (or &#x0201c;well-mapped reads&#x0201d;), aimed at ensuring that the read mapping (1) consisted of a large number of identically matched nucleotides, (2) represented a large fraction of the read and (3) that any secondary mapping for the same read was clearly worse than the read mapping in question. More precisely, we only considered mappings for which at least three quarters of the aligned nucleotide-pairs were identical and the mapping length was at least two thirds of the read length. These criteria were very stringent to guarantee correctness, rather than completeness. A total of 83% (3.25 million) of the mapped reads were considered high confidence (see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>) and did not overlap ribosomal RNA genes. Thus, 17% the reads&#x02019; mappings were removed by our filter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). On chromosome Y, however, 33 of 34 reads were removed by our filter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This shows that our filter achieves what it intended to achieve, that is, to remove almost all mappings that we know to be false (<italic>e.g.</italic>, mappings to chromosome Y in a female cell-line) while removing few other mappings.</p><p>Using annotation projections (A. Tanzer and R. Guig&#x000f3;, unpublished data) defining regions without annotated transcription (WAT) [according to the gencode v7 annotation; these regions contain no protein coding genes, no long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), no small RNA genes, <italic>etc</italic>.], exonic, and intronic regions, we assessed how many mappings fell entirely within one of these nonoverlapping categories. Very few fell entirely within regions without annotated transcription (3.3%) or single intronic regions (6.3%). Hence, at least 9.6% (~310k) of the reads originate from transcription units that are not yet appreciated. A considerable portion (25.6%) fell entirely within single exonic regions and presumably most often represent single exon genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The remaining reads overlap regions of at least two different categories. Slightly more than two million reads were split-mappings and for almost all of these we found all split points to respect the intron consensus (GT-AG, GC-AG, or AT-AC) and to use at least one annotated splice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We conclude that in nearly all cases, it is possible to determine the location from which an RNA was transcribed as well as the precise location of all its introns, using nothing but the program GMAP and the genome. This entire collection of alignments contained a total of 5.9 million introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Annotated human introns are very infrequently shorter than 70 bps, but 70&#x02212;80 bps introns are frequently observed (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.112.004812/-/DC1/FigureS4.pdf">Figure S4</ext-link>), suggesting that this is a minimum length for introns to be appropriately processed. The distribution of intron lengths in our 454-mappings is highly consistent with the length-distribution of annotated introns(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).</p><p>We next monitored how many annotated spliced genes were covered by at least one read, limiting our analysis to genes and reads that contain at least one splicing event. Using only one lane (~90,000 reads), we found that approximately 20% of such genes were covered (defined by splice site identity; see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>) by at least one read, and this percentage increased gradually to 38% when we used more and finally all 32 lanes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). The coverage percentage began to approach a plateau after about 25 lanes, although saturation was not attained, even after 32 lanes. A similar analysis on exon level showed that about 23% of annotated exons could be found in at least one 454 read (requiring both splice sites to be precisely identified, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>).</p><p>For mappings in HeLa (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.112.004812/-/DC1/FigureS2.pdf">Figure S2</ext-link>), we generally observed similar trends, although both the numbers of mapped and highly confidently mapped reads were considerably lower. As in K562, unmapped reads tended to be longer and of lower quality (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.112.004812/-/DC1/FigureS5.pdf">Figure S5</ext-link>, A and B; see also <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.112.004812/-/DC1/FigureS3.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link> for an explanation in the K562 case), suggesting again that some longer reads contain very low-quality nucleotides. Consistent with this interpretation, we found a longer read-length median and a lower read quality in HeLa (than in K562, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.112.004812/-/DC1/FigureS5.pdf">Figure S5</ext-link>, C and D), coinciding with a lower number of mapped reads in this cell type.</p></sec><sec id="s19"><title>Comparison of multi-intron arrangements against annotated transcripts</title><p>We next assessed whether our read-mappings gave evidence for transcript structures that were not included in the annotation. To this end we transformed each transcript of the annotation into an ordered tuple of introns and then proceeded similarly for our read-mappings. We then asked how often the entire intron-structure (tuple) of one of our reads was contained in the intron-structure (tuple) of an annotated transcript, starting with the K562 cell-line (<italic>Materials and Methods</italic>). In other words, we asked whether an annotated transcript contained all the splice sites indicated by a 454-alignment, and no other splice site in between these splice sites. Note that for this analysis we used only the reads for which each intron respected the splice-site consensus without considering the annotation during the mapping in any way.</p><p>An example of such a novel mapping, in which three exons are simultaneously skipped, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. The ~2 million read-mappings we used in this analysis had at least one intron and more than half a million reads had four introns or more (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Very few (&#x0003c;13,000, 0.6%) had an aligned block with an alignment quality of less than 75%, which might indicate that the K562 genome might not be well represented in hg19 in these regions or that some details of these alignments might be questioned. The vast majority (~93%) of these 454-intron-structures corresponded to partial intron-structures of the annotation (that is, the annotation contains a transcript, that contains all the introns that the read contained and no other introns in between, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This result highlights three facts: First, the high quality of the intron&#x02212;exon structure in the annotation; second, the high quality of the intron&#x02212;exon structure in our 454-alignments; and third, although we have used the annotation here to check our results, we would not have needed to do so because our annotation-independent mapping approach finds, in large parts, the same gene structures. The fraction of read-mappings that contained novel elements with respect to the annotation increased quite strongly with the number of introns in the mapped reads and with length of the read from 400 bp on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2, D and E</xref>). Our results also indicate that there appear to be a class of longer gene structures, for which not all transcript structures are described in the annotation. 7% of reads (~133,000 reads) had intron structures that were not fully consistent with annotated intron structures. Only very few fell entirely into intronic or intergenic space (&#x0003c;3000 reads for each of these two categories) and supposedly represent novel genes. Of the aforementioned 133,000 aligned reads, 85% (~113,000) however, had at least one splice site in common with a spliced gene and supposedly represented novel isoforms (or in some cases partially processed transcripts) of these genes. These novel-isoform reads affected 9902 spliced genes and for 4961 spliced reads we could find at least six such reads (data not shown). This finding shows that the vast majority of our reads represent RNA products of known genes, although sometimes with unknown intron structure. In summary, these results show that sequencing long reads is of great use in the annotation of genomes. The simplicity of the RNAseq process in comparison to cloning techniques is a further advantage in this respect. Largely similar results (using HeLa cells; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.112.004812/-/DC1/FigureS6.pdf">Figure S6</ext-link>) show that transcript reconstruction can be achieved for multiple cells types using this approach.</p><fig id="fig2" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 2&#x02002;</label><caption><p>454-read mappings in the K562 cell-line.

The gencode v7 annotation already contains many thousands of such lncRNA genes, so that along with protein coding genes and small noncoding-RNA genes, the total number of genes in this annotation is approximately 50,000. The properties of long-noncoding RNAs in this annotation have recently been described in much detail (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Derrien <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). These authors provided a classification of &#x0201c;intergenic&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;intronic&#x0201d; (both with respect to protein coding genes) and also showed that lncRNA genes are on average shorter than protein coding genes and often consist of few exons only. It follows that long-read technologies, such as the 454 reads we employ here, are often able to capture the entire exon&#x02212;intron structure of such lncRNA genes. We therefore investigated how many of our reads described lncRNA genes. Despite the low and often nuclear expression of lncRNAs (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Derrien <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>), we could find spliced reads that mapped to 842 spliced intergenic lncRNAs (of 5774 defined by Derrien and coworkers; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and for many of these we could find multiple reads. Some of these were exclusively expressed in either in K562 or in HeLa S3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Similarly we could find reads for 193 intronic lncRNA genes and again some were expressed cell type specifically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3, C and D</xref>). Although protein-coding genes have been a topic of research for decades, lncRNA genes have captured attention only much more recently. We therefore investigated how many unknown isoforms our 454-reads could uncover for genes that encode lncRNAs (lnc) and for those that don&#x02019;t (non-lnc), the latter group being mainly protein coding genes. Although for non-lnc genes, only 6% of all reads supported novel isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, left bar), we found 37% of all reads mapping to lncRNAs to support isoforms that are not known in the gencode v7 annotation. These novel isoforms were given by 4486 spliced reads and affected 599 lncRNA genes.

These predictions were derived from approximately 470 million short reads and often contained exon-pairs separated by few base-pairs. In order to guarantee similar treatment (in comparison with the 454 reads), we joined exon-pairs separated by less than 25 bp within the same transcript. We then compared our 454 alignments against the short-read-cufflinks predictions. More precisely we performed a similar analysis as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> using all aligned 454-reads showing at least one intron and for which all introns respected the splice site consensus. The annotation was not considered in this process. Roughly 15% (compared with 7% in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) of the intron-structures generated by our alignments of 454 reads were not part of transcript structures predicted within the ENCODE project (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Although assessing differences in gene expression is relatively straight forward, analysis of cell type specific alternative splicing often is more complicated. Cell type&#x02212;specific alternative exons have been determined previously by mapping short reads to exon&#x02212;exon junctions and collecting for each exon the reads indicating inclusion and exclusion. One can then assess statistically whether the ratio of inclusion reads to exclusion reads is significantly different in two conditions(<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Graveley <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>).</p><p>To test whether this approach can be performed in an annotation-independent fashion, we considered all split reads for which the split-point respected the splice site consensus&#x02014;checks that can be performed in a newly sequenced genome.

Whenever category (c) is relatively small in comparison to category (a) and (b), the exon in question has few interfering factors such as alternative acceptors, donors, overlapping transcription start site or poly-adenylation sites that can confuse the analysis. Of these exons, ~47.000 showed minimal evidence of cell type specific splicing (<italic>Materials and Methods</italic>) and were subjected to two one-sided Fisher tests, in which we controlled for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Benjamini and Hochberg 1995</xref>) (false discovery rate &#x02264; 0.05).</p><p>A total of 146 exons were found to exhibit cell-type specifically increased inclusion levels. Note that sometimes two or more exons are part of one splicing event, such as double exon-skipping or mutually exclusive exons. The inclusion level or &#x003a8;-value (&#x0201c;percent-spliced-in&#x0201d;) under these circumstances can be defined as the ratio of (a) and (a) + (b) and the definition of the &#x00394;&#x003a8; between the two cell types follows directly (<italic>Materials and Methods</italic>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> shows the &#x00394;&#x003a8;-values for all alternative exons more highly included in HeLa cells and those more highly included in K562 cells. Of these exons, 86% showed a &#x00394;&#x003a8;-value equal or higher than a threshold of 10% (corresponding for example to 40% inclusion in one cell type and 50% inclusion in the other, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), which has been suggested to guarantee increased biological significance(<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). A total of 40% of the aforementioned alternatively skipped exons showed corrected <italic>p</italic>-values that ranged from 0.05 to 0.005, but the majority had far lower <italic>p</italic>-values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Because most sequencing technologies have intrinsic biases, it is of utmost importance to independently assess the results and rule out technical artifacts. In the case of alternative splicing, a large body of research has established that alternatively spliced exons exhibit properties that can be readily determined from the genome. Alternatively spliced exons have been shown to exhibit lower splice-site strength and shorter exon length relative to constitutive exons (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Zheng <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). In addition, when coding, alternative exons tend to show a length divisible by three (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Magen and Ast 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Zheng <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>), thus keeping the reading frame unchanged when in-/excluded. Consistently, the exons our approach found as alternative showed shorter exon length and increased divisibility of their length by 3 than tested exons that did not pass the significance threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5, C and D</xref>). We then calculated acceptor and donor scores for all exons using geneid (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Parra <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>). As expected, the exons our approach found to be alternatively included between the two cell types showed lower acceptor and donor strength than exons whose inclusion did not differ significantly between the two cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5, E and F</xref>).

This resulted in a total of 9488 predicted full-length structures. We also downloaded all cufflinks predicted gene structures that were obtained from short read sequencing within the ENCODE project (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Djebali <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>) (<italic>Materials and Methods</italic>), focusing only on those that overlapped our long-read-cufflinks gene structures.

The absolute number of predicted transcripts was twofold greater in the case of the short-read-cufflinks approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Note, that in both cases many more transcripts may still have considerably similar intron structures in comparison to annotated transcripts, and the difference may be limited to one or two splice sites. Because of the greater number of predicted transcripts when using short-reads, this however resulted in almost as many transcripts for which an intron-identical annotated transcript existed for the short-read-cufflinks approach as for the long-read approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Almost 2500 annotated transcripts were identified by both approaches.

A total of 30% of these alternative exons were however not alternative according to the annotation; hence, our approach can complete the annotation in a cell type specific manner. The defined alternative exons show characteristics that correspond perfectly to what is known about alternative exons: They show weaker splice sites and are shorter in terms of exon length&#x02014;and above all, in roughly two-thirds of the cases, they keep the reading frame of the encoded protein.</p><p>The dataset we present here comprises millions of reads that span multiple exon-exon junctions. However, it falls short of sequencing entire transcripts. Therefore, the question of whether one can accurately predict full-length transcripts from these reads becomes important. We show that based on our 454 reads we can predict ~9500 full-length transcripts and that for more than half of these an annotated transcript with identical introns exists. This is contrasted by the &#x0003c;25% of all transcripts predicted from short reads that fulfill this criterion. Furthermore, despite the extreme sequencing depth of short reads, more than 2300 annotated full-length transcripts can only be predicted correctly (that is correctness of each single splice site) using 454 reads. Conversely, there are also almost 1900 annotated full-length structures in the regions covered by 454 reads whose exact exon-intron-structures are only found based on short-read-sequencing. This shows, that the length of long-read sequencing and the depth of short-read sequencing complement each other and that their combination can be used to obtain an accurate description of transcriptomes. Importantly, new advances in sequencing technology could help reduce the cost of long read sequencing in comparison to the approach employed here. Coupling isolation of ~450-bp cDNA fragments with 250-bp paired-end MiSeq sequencing could lead to ~450 bp reads and to results that come close to ours. Assuming that Illumina continues to increase read length (from 25 or 36 initially to 150 bp paired-end at the time of writing) this could also be true for that platform as well. Finally, using the Pacific Biosciences platform, we could obtain much longer reads. Due to the lower throughput of this platform, it might be worth to couple this platform with capturing techniques in order to represent all genes independently of their expression level.</p><p>In summary, these results show that long-read cDNA sequencing is ideal for transcriptome analysis in species for which an annotation is not available or in cases in which relying on an annotation can introduce biases. In species in which an annotation is available, long-read cDNA analysis can successfully complete the annotation and complement short read sequencing analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material">
