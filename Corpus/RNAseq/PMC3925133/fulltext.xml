To be economically competitive, producer strains need to be established that synthesize the targeted product at high yield and over a long time. Engineering cyanobacteria into forced fuel producers should considerably interfere with overall cell homeostasis, which in turn might counteract productivity and sustainability of the process. Therefore, in-depth characterization of the cellular response upon long-term production is of high interest for the targeted improvement of a desired strain.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The transcriptome-wide response to continuous ethanol production was examined in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC6803 using high resolution microarrays. In two independent experiments, ethanol production rates of 0.0338% (v/v) ethanol d<sup>-1</sup> and 0.0303% (v/v) ethanol d<sup>-1</sup> were obtained over 18 consecutive days, measuring two sets of biological triplicates in fully automated photobioreactors. Ethanol production caused a significant (~40%) delay in biomass accumulation, the development of a bleaching phenotype and a down-regulation of light harvesting capacity. However, microarray analyses performed at day 4, 7, 11 and 18 of the experiment revealed only three mRNAs with a strongly modified accumulation level throughout the course of the experiment. In addition to the overexpressed <italic>adhA</italic> (<italic>slr1192</italic>) gene, this was an approximately 4 fold reduction in <italic>cpcB</italic> (<italic>sll1577</italic>) and 3 to 6 fold increase in <italic>rps8</italic> (<italic>sll1809</italic>) mRNA levels. Much weaker modifications of expression level or modifications restricted to day 18 of the experiment were observed for genes involved in carbon assimilation (Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase and Glutamate decarboxylase). Molecular analysis of the reduced <italic>cpcB</italic> levels revealed a post-transcriptional processing of the <italic>cpcBA</italic> operon mRNA leaving a truncated mRNA <italic>cpcA</italic>* likely not competent for translation. Moreover, western blots and zinc-enhanced bilin fluorescence blots confirmed a severe reduction in the amounts of both phycocyanin subunits, explaining the cause of the bleaching phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Changes in gene expression upon induction of long-term ethanol production in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC6803 are highly specific. In particular, we did not observe a comprehensive stress response as might have been expected.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Biofuel</kwd><kwd>Cyanobacteria</kwd><kwd>Ethanol production</kwd><kwd><italic>Synechocystis</italic></kwd><kwd>Metabolic engineering</kwd><kwd>Synthetic biology</kwd><kwd>Transcription</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Cyanobacteria are considered to be important and promising resources for the production of biofuels, such as hydrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], ethanol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], isobutyraldehyde and isobutanol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], ethylene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], volatile isoprene hydrocarbons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and alkanes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Several commercial companies have begun working toward the metabolic remodeling of genetically modified cyanobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. To achieve economically feasible production rates, the following two goals need to be addressed: (i) the yield of the intended product is to be maximized, and (ii) the producer strains should be of considerable robustness to tolerate the product, which is frequently alien to their metabolism.</p><p>Indeed, genetic instability and the onset of severe stress responses have been reported. Thus far, two unicellular model strains of cyanobacteria have mainly been used in these studies, <italic>Synechococcus</italic> sp. PCC7942 and <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC6803 (from now on <italic>Synechocystis</italic> 6803). A depressed growth rate and a yellow-green phenotype interpreted as severe metabolic stress was reported for an ethylene-producing strain of <italic>Synechococcus</italic> sp. PCC7942 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. A substantial and unspecific general stress response was found upon the external application of ethanol both at proteome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], as well as transcriptome level in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> 6803 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>To be meaningful for the optimization of biofuel production from cyanobacteria, the actual response to the internal production of a metabolite should be analyzed. Here we focused on an engineered strain of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> 6803, which synthesizes ethanol from pyruvate by the sequential activity of overexpressed pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) from <italic>Zymomonas mobilis</italic> and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) from <italic>Synechocystis</italic> 6803. Employing high-resolution microarrays we identified a remarkably focused remodeling of the transcriptome in the course of 18&#x000a0;days of continuous ethanol production. The response included a discoordinated operon expression between the phycocyanin <italic>cpcB</italic> and <italic>cpcA</italic> genes, fully consistent with the observed bleaching phenotype.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Characterization of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> 6803 upon long-term ethanol production</title><p>Engineering cyanobacteria to produce ethanol from pyruvate is accomplished by coupled overexpression of the cytosolic enzymes PDC and ADH. The synthesized ethanol further accumulates in the growth medium, most likely as a result of diffusion from the interior of the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Appreciable intra- or extracellular ethanol concentrations, however, appear to be a rather unlikely stress parameter in the course of cyanobacterial evolution. Therefore, examination of long-term ethanol-related stress responses requires particular care with respect to experimental design and data validation. That is to minimize the chance of detecting non-ethanol effects resulting from imbalances in, for example, nutrient availability or physical parameters (pH, temperature, oxygen) that may arise upon long-term cultivation between producer and wild type. Therefore, and for accuracy of data validation and interpretation, two identical cultivation experiments were performed, comprising the ethanol producer strain #309 (Pr) and the empty vector control strain #621 (Co), each cultivated in triplicate in photobioreactors (PBRs). Temperature, pH and oxygen saturation of the cultures were monitored computationally using Crison MultiMeter units; CO<sub>2</sub> supply was automatically controlled in dependence of the pH of the medium, which was thereby kept constant within the range between 7.25 and 7.35. As cultivation was performed in 12&#x000a0;h/12&#x000a0;h&#x000a0;day/night cycles, samples were consistently taken at the same time point in the middle of the photoperiod, to exclude phase-dependent effects. RNA from cultivation A was used for microarray hybridization, whereas cultivation B was conducted as the validation run for northern blot hybridization, and where appropriate, protein analysis. Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> provides an overview of the general growth parameters, demonstrating highly aligning growth dynamics between both cultivations.

The physiological effects of high ethanol production include a delay in biomass accumulation, downregulation of light-harvesting capacity and the development of a bleaching phenotype. Microarray-based RNA profiling revealed a highly specific stress response, involving differential accumulation levels of only 31 mRNAs and a small number of non-coding RNAs. The molecular basis for the observed physiological effects of ethanol overproduction consists of a specific RNA processing event in the major light-harvesting operon encoding the phycocyanin subunits &#x003b1; and &#x003b2;.
