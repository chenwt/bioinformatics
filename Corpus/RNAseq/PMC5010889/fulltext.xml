As a consequence, some evolutionary trends observed in venom proteins that underpinned the evolutionary histories of snake toxins were based on data from a minor parcel of the clade. Here, we investigated the proteins of the totally unknown venom from <italic>Phalotris mertensi</italic> (Dipsadinae subfamily), in order to obtain a detailed profile of its toxins and to appreciate evolutionary tendencies occurring in colubrid venoms. By means of integrated omics and functional approaches, including RNAseq, Sanger sequencing, high-resolution proteomics, recombinant protein production, and enzymatic tests, we verified an active toxic secretion containing up to 21 types of proteins. A high content of Kunitz-type proteins and C-type lectins were observed, although several enzymatic components such as metalloproteinases and an L-amino acid oxidase were also present in the venom. Interestingly, an arguable venom component of other species was demonstrated as a true venom protein and named svLIPA (snake venom acid lipase). This finding indicates the importance of checking the actual protein occurrence across species before rejecting genes suggested to code for toxins, which are relevant for the discussion about the early evolution of reptile venoms. Moreover, trends in the evolution of some toxin classes, such as simplification of metalloproteinases and rearrangements of Kunitz and Wap domains, parallel similar phenomena observed in other venomous snake families and provide a broader picture of toxin evolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>snake</kwd><kwd>venom</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>proteome</kwd><kwd>acid lipase</kwd><kwd>molecular evolution</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="22"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The protein and peptide composition of the venoms from a number of dangerous snake species have been extensively studied by means of high-throughput technologies such as transcriptomics, proteomics, and peptidomics (<xref rid="evw149-B15" ref-type="bibr">Durban et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B76" ref-type="bibr">Tashima et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B1" ref-type="bibr">Aird et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B68" ref-type="bibr">Rokyta et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B30" ref-type="bibr">Hargreaves et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B41" ref-type="bibr">Lomonte et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B46" ref-type="bibr">Margres et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B47" ref-type="bibr">Mcgivern et al. 2014</xref>, 2015; <xref rid="evw149-B8" ref-type="bibr">Chapeaurouge et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B35" ref-type="bibr">Junqueira-de-Azevedo et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B58" ref-type="bibr">Petras et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B78" ref-type="bibr">Viala et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B65" ref-type="bibr">Reeks et al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B75" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al. 2016</xref>).</p><p>By extension, the compositions and general activities of venoms of snakes belonging to the same genus or to the same families of the most medically relevant ones become more predictable. Most of the recent efforts to characterize these venoms resulted in the identification of species-specific versions of proteins already known and rare are the recent examples where new types of venom molecules are described in these groups, such as the case of a novel Kazal-type protein in the venom of <italic>Bothriechis schlegelii</italic> (<xref rid="evw149-B40" ref-type="bibr">Lomonte et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B19" ref-type="bibr">Fern&#x000e1;ndez et al. 2016</xref>). However, an unknown universe of toxins may be hidden in the venomous secretions of snakes more distantly related to the medically important species.</p><p>Although the families comprising species hazardous to humans, that is, Viperidae, Elapidae, and Atractaspididae, represent only about 30% of snake species (<xref rid="evw149-B83" ref-type="bibr">The Reptile Database 2016</xref>), the majority of snake biodiversity in the World (&#x0223c;65% of species) is spread within a group generally called &#x0201c;colubrid.&#x0201d; This group can be considered paraphyletic or monophyletic, according to the (sub)families included within the clade, but we will adopt the recent classification proposed by <xref rid="evw149-B63" ref-type="bibr">Pyron et al. (2013</xref>), who considered Colubridae as a monophyletic family that includes Dipsadinae, Colubrinae, Natricinae, among other subfamilies. Colubridae species are highly heterogeneous, however a ubiquitous feature of them is the presence of cephalic glands (venom gland, Duvernoy&#x02019;s gland, supra-, and infralabial glands), which may produce toxin secretions used to capture and kill preys. Their bites are, with few exceptions, nonlethal to humans mainly due to the inability to deeply inject the venom, once they have rear fangs (opistoglyph dentition) or no specialized fangs (aglyph). Nevertheless, human injuries have been reported (<xref rid="evw149-B44" ref-type="bibr">Mackinstry 1983</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B50" ref-type="bibr">Minton 1990</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B13" ref-type="bibr">Datta and Tu 1993</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B71" ref-type="bibr">Sawai et al. 2002</xref>). Particularly, the Dipsadinae subfamily, which comprises some of the most commonly observed colubrids in South America, has been reported in a large number of epidemiological studies related to snake bites (<xref rid="evw149-B59" ref-type="bibr">Prado-Franceschi and Hyslop 2002</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B62" ref-type="bibr">Puorto and Fran&#x000e7;a 2003</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B69" ref-type="bibr">Salom&#x000e3;o et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>Over the past years, the venom proteomes (and venom gland transcriptomes) of a few colubrid species have been reported (<xref rid="evw149-B23" ref-type="bibr">Fry et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B9" ref-type="bibr">Ching et al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B43" ref-type="bibr">Mackessy et al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B54" ref-type="bibr">OmPraba et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B57" ref-type="bibr">Peichoto et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B47" ref-type="bibr">McGivern et al. 2014</xref>), bringing important contributions to the knowledge of venom composition in the group. These studies also provided insights into the molecular evolution of snake toxins, including the recruitment of new toxin types (<xref rid="evw149-B54" ref-type="bibr">OmPraba et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B10" ref-type="bibr">Ching et al. 2012</xref>), and into the adoption of different venom strategies in different subfamilies, paralleling the different specializations observed in traditionally venomous snakes of Elapide and Viperidae families (<xref rid="evw149-B47" ref-type="bibr">McGivern et al. 2014</xref>). However, the specific examples provided by these works may not reflect the full diversity of venom compositions and protein types existing in colubrid snakes. Consequently, the trends in snake venom evolution largely discussed in the literature are mostly based on observations from a minority of species, though of high medical relevance.</p><p>In order to obtain a comprehensive profile of an unknown colubrid venom from the Dipsadinae subfamily and to evaluate whether known trends in the evolution of snake toxins occur in the group, we investigated the venom activities, the proteome and the venom gland transcriptome of the species <italic>Phalotris mertensi</italic> in an integrated way. The genus <italic>Phalotris</italic> (Dipsadinae) occurs from Central Brazil down to the Patagonia region. The singular pattern of body colors of <italic>P. mertensi</italic> resembles that verified in some members of the Elapidae family (e.g., coral snakes belonging to <italic>Micrurus</italic> genus) and it is likely an evolutionary mimicry strategy adopted in order to avoid predation (<xref rid="evw149-B5" ref-type="bibr">Brodie 1993</xref>). <italic>Phalotris mertensi</italic> is a fossorial snake, with diurnal and nocturnal activity. The diet of this particular species is poorly known, however, due to its fossorial habit, it is believed that it feeds mainly on amphisbenids and other elongated vertebrates (<xref rid="evw149-B72" ref-type="bibr">Sawaya et al. 2008</xref>). To date, there are no data concerning venom characterization of any member of <italic>Phalotris</italic> genus, although there is an interesting report of human envenomation (<xref rid="evw149-B39" ref-type="bibr">Lema 1978</xref>) by <italic>P. trilineatus</italic>. The symptoms observed were cephalea, local and oral mucosa hemorrhage, edema, and severe renal insufficiency, suggesting the presence of various classes of toxins in the venomous secretion of the snake.</p><p>Our investigation shows that <italic>P. mertensi</italic> venom, besides harboring toxin types commonly observed in other snakes, contains an unusual acid lipase similar to mammalian lysosomal lipases. It also revealed particular structural features of <italic>P. mertensi</italic> toxins that evidence more general trends in the molecular evolution of snake toxins. These findings reinforce previous examples in the literature about the potential of unexplored venoms to reveal novel biomolecules and important information for understanding the evolution of venoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental Section</title><sec><title>Venom</title><p>Venom was extracted from specimens of <italic>P. mertensi</italic> after injection of pilocarpin (10 mg/kg in 0.15 M NaCl), which was used to stimulate venom secretion, since colubrids produce minimum amounts of venom.

Prior to running the second dimension, the IPG strip was placed in a rehydration tray and the proteins were reduced and alkylated by sequential incubation in the following solutions: 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS); 30% glycerol (equilibration buffer-EB), 20 mg/ml dithiothreitol in EB for 12 min; and then a solution of 30 mg/ml iodoacetamide in EB, for 10 min. Afterwards, it was directly applied onto a 12% SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gel (20 cm &#x000d7; 26 cm &#x000d7; 1.5 mm) for the second dimension electrophoresis.

Excess of iodoacetamide was quenched by the addition of dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 15 mM. Proteins were then precipitated with 8 volumes of ice cold acetone and 1 volume of ice cold methanol and the mixture was incubated for 3 h at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C.

Enzymatic characterization may provide initial clues regarding the functional role of toxins, whereas a shotgun proteomic characterization is a powerful approach for a more descriptive analysis. However, given the phylogenetic distance of <italic>P. mertensi</italic> to other species and the lack of a comprehensive public database regarding colubrid proteins/toxins, the generation of a species-specific venom gland transcriptomic data set is a step required for the accurate identification of proteins by mass spectrometric analysis, besides a way of knowing the primary sequences of putative toxins. Since most of the assemblers for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data tend to fail in resolving the multiple isoforms of abundantly expressed toxins, as extensively discussed in the literature (<xref rid="evw149-B79" ref-type="bibr">Wagstaff et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B67" ref-type="bibr">Rokyta et al. 2015</xref>), the correctness of these transcriptomic sequences could be checked by the use of cloning-based approaches such as EST survey or RT-PCR. On the other hand, the proteomic analysis of the venom secretion is important to confirm if the possible venom proteins predicted from the cDNAs are present or not in the venom. Finally, due to the very low amounts of venom produced by colubrids, a more detailed characterization of particularly interesting proteins could be only feasible by obtaining recombinant proteins. And this is facilitated by the availability of physical clones from the cloning-based approaches, which is not obtainable in NGS-only transcriptomics. In this study, we applied this combined strategy, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw149-F1">figure 1</xref>, to characterize a totally unknown venom from a rear-fanged snake.

Sequencing of the cDNA library resulted in around 3 million raw paired-end reads of 150 nt, which were filtered for high quality sequences yielding a final data set of 2,470,539 reads. The paired-end reads were merged for elongating the sequenced fragments and then assembled using NGen software under stringent parameters to allow the distinction between toxin isoforms, resulting in 8,390 contigs. According to the similarity searches using a BLASTX algorithm against Uniprot database and against a compiled data set of representative sequences of known snake toxin classes, these contigs were initially separated into three categories: transcripts coding for putative venom components, transcripts coding for nonvenom proteins, and transcripts not identified. The putative venom components were subcategorized in protein classes according to the most similar protein they match, which could be classical snake toxins or proteins suggested but not stablished as venom components. By using downstream analytical steps, the contigs identified as coding for putative toxins had their sequences curated and validated in order to reduce the redundancy, to improve the completeness and to correct the protein prediction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw149-F2">Figure 2</xref> shows the RNAseq transcriptomic profile of the venom glands, considering the relative expression of each transcript in the category.

It was interesting to note that both EST and RNAseq profiles were similar regarding the proportion of majorly expressed toxins. However, some relevant but less expressed classes of toxins, such as SVSP (snake venom serine proteinase) and CRISP (cysteine-rich secretory protein), were absent in the EST-based analysis due to the expected low coverage of the transcriptome. This was also evidenced by the high number of singlet sequences, most of them corresponding to transcripts involved in cellular functions. For the most expressed toxin genes, however, there was a reasonable correspondence and a quantitative equivalence in both profiles, that is, the most abundant venom genes were the same in both analyses. As far as we know, this is the only comparison between the results of the two methodological approaches for snake venom glands, especially considering that they were based on the exact same RNA sample. Moreover, it indicates that the EST-based profiles of many snake venom glands performed in the early 2000's may have provided a fair quantification of the majorly expressed venom genes and pointed out the most relevant transcripts, however, they may have missed less represented toxin categories, as expected. This might be one of the explanations as to why previous venom gland transcriptomic analyses based on ESTs sometimes provided very simple toxin profiles, whereas venom proteomic analyses, including two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometric identification, suggested a rather complex picture (e.g., <xref rid="evw149-B9" ref-type="bibr">Ching et al. 2006</xref>). Regardless of the sequencing technology employed and sequence coverage achieved, other levels of protein modifications, such as protein processing, glycosylation, complex formation, etc., probably contribute significantly to the differences observed between proteome and transcriptome profiles.</p></sec><sec><title>Proteomic Characterization of <italic>P. m</italic><italic>ertensi</italic> Venom</title><p>The first approach used for the proteomic characterization of the venom was 2-D electrophoresis (2-DE) and in-gel trypsin digestion coupled to mass spectrometric protein identification based on searches against a database of proteins predicted from the <italic>P. mertensi</italic> venom gland transcriptome generated in this study. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw149-F3">figure 3</xref>, the 2-DE image of <italic>P. mertensi</italic> venom is composed of spots within a broad range of isoelectric points (p<italic>I</italic> from 3 to 10) and molecular masses of &#x0223c;10&#x02013;70 kDa. The total number of spots, however, is much lower than that observed with viperid venoms under similar electrophoretic conditions. The overall proteomic pattern showed that high molecular mass spots are composed of groups of approximately 45 and 70 kDa with p<italic>I</italic> ranging from 4 to 5.5. On the other hand, low molecular mass spots (of &#x0223c;15 kDa and below) seem to have widespread isoelectric points, ranging from 4 to 10. The identification of proteins present in 27 selected spots (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw149/-/DC1">supplementary table S2</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw149/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online) revealed that <italic>P. mertensi</italic> venom contains some of the typical toxin classes of viperid venoms (Kunitz type protein [KUN]; L-amino acid oxidase [LAAO], C-type lectin [CTL], snake venom metalloproteinase [SVMP]) and also snake venom matrix metalloproteinases (svMMP), as the venom of <italic>T. strigatus</italic> (<xref rid="evw149-B10" ref-type="bibr">Ching et al. 2012</xref>). Among the identified proteins there were some cellular and plasma components, which were likely contaminants from the milking process, and, interestingly, a peptide corresponding to an acid lipase was identified in spot #21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw149-F3">fig. 3</xref>A).

This approach allowed a comprehensive qualitative analysis of the venom proteome, whereas the values for spectral count for each protein were used to calculate their approximate relative abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw149-F3">fig. 3</xref>B and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw149/-/DC1">supplementary table S3</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw149/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). The MS/MS spectra resulted in the identification of 67 proteins of which 37 are annotated as putative toxins. As it was observed in the protein identification of 2-DE spots, the presence of various nonvenom proteins, derived from cellular components and plasma, suggests the damage of venom gland tissue upon venom extraction. Besides, it may be relevant to consider that, in order to improve the yield of venom production, the animals used in this study were treated with pilocarpine, which is an agonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (<xref rid="evw149-B22" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al. 2001</xref>), and may have enhanced the production of other buccal fluids, possibly contributing to the presence of such proteins, though the venom was collected using capillaries attached to the rear fags.</p><p>More importantly, toxin classes that had not been detected by spot identification, such as SVSP, CRISP, svVEGF (snake venom Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor), Ohanin-like, CVF, phospholipase B, and defensin, were identified in the shotgun analysis. According to the relative abundance evaluation, SVMPs were the most abundant toxins in <italic>P. mertensi</italic> venom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw149-F3">fig. 3</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>An Integrated View of <italic>P. m</italic><italic>ertensi</italic> Venom Composition</title><p>The curated set of possible venom components of <italic>P. mertensi</italic> is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="evw149-T1">table 1</xref>, and, in general, it revealed a composition of typical toxin classes found in other snake venoms. It includes some toxin types more abundantly found in the Viperidae family, such as SVMP and SVSP, other more typical of the Elapidae family, such as 3FTx, CVF, WAP, and KUN (Kunitz-type peptide), and one exclusive from Colubridae: svMMP. Some other identified toxin types are relatively abundant in both families (Viperidae and Elapidae), such as CTL, LAAO, and CRISP. The transcriptomic and proteomic analyses also revealed some other known venom constituents that occur in minor amounts in many snake venoms, such as 5NUCLEO (5&#x02032; nucleosidase), defensin, cystatins, svVEGF, Ohanin-like protein, PLB, and inhibitors of PLA<sub>2</sub>, whose occurrences in <italic>P. mertensi</italic> venom transcriptome were also at low transcriptional levels. Almost all the potential toxin classes identified in the transcriptome were detected in the venom proteomic analysis (except for WAP and KUWAFUS [ku-wap-fusin], which are potentially small proteins and whose corresponding tryptic fragments may have fallen out of the lower mass limit of the mass spectrometric analysis conditions used herein), confirming a very rich composition of this venom.

according to their expression levels (RPKM), showing the corresponding sequence features and proteomic identification in the venom.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>A recent investigation on the venom and venom glands of two colubrids from different subfamilies showed that each species had a trend to be more similar to one of the families of front-fanged snakes (<xref rid="evw149-B47" ref-type="bibr">McGivern et al. 2014</xref>). Specifically, while the venom of <italic>Boiga irregularis</italic> (Colubrinae) shows a marked Elapidae-like profile due to the prevalence of 3FTx, <italic>Hypsiglena</italic> sp, which is within the same subfamily of the <italic>P. mertensi</italic> (Dipsadidae), has a Viperidae-like venom profile (<xref rid="evw149-B47" ref-type="bibr">McGivern et al. 2014</xref>). For the present study, the overall predominance of SVMPs and diverse CTLs, and the low expression of 3FTx in <italic>P. mertensi</italic> venom suggest a more Viperidae-like venom, though the high content of Kunitz-type inhibitors indicates a rather mixed toxin pattern.</p><p>Other previous investigations on the venoms of nonfront fanged snakes have shown that despite being rich in classical snake toxins found in venoms of Viperidae and Elapidae families, some of them contain new and unexpected molecules that make them unique. For example, veficolins and svMMPs were proposed as new venom classes from <italic>Cerberus rynchops</italic>
<xref rid="evw149-B54" ref-type="bibr">OmPraba et al. (2010)</xref> and <italic>T. strigatus</italic> (<xref rid="evw149-B10" ref-type="bibr">Ching et al. 2012</xref>), respectively. In the present work, a particular finding was the presence in the venom gland transcriptome of an abundant transcript coding for an enzyme similar to lysosomal acid lipases from vertebrates, which was previously argued to be a possible new toxin (<xref rid="evw149-B6" ref-type="bibr">Casewell et al. 2009</xref>) without further confirmation. Here, however, the presence of the protein in the venom was confirmed by proteomic identification and further characterization, as presented in detail later.</p><p>Some other transcripts coding for secreted proteins, such as lysozyme and phospholemman, were also found as highly represented in <italic>P. mertensi</italic> venom gland transcriptome, but they were not detected in the venom proteome. It is particularly interesting to mention two novel full-length transcripts for lysozyme highly expressed in the venom glands. In humans, the major expression sites of this enzyme are the parotid and submandibular salivary glands (<xref rid="evw149-B16" ref-type="bibr">EMBL-EBI. 2015</xref>), which are homologous to venom glands. The production of lysozyme could be easily associated with a protective function of the secretory apparatus against microbial infection transmitted by preys, but its fate in the snake oral cavity remains an interesting point to be studied, since it is not apparently secreted to the venom.</p></sec><sec><title>Kunitz-Type Proteins: Key Proteinase Inhibitors Evolving Alone or Combined with WAP Domains</title><p>The most expressed group of transcripts in the <italic>P. mertensi</italic> venom gland, considering the RPKM value, encodes Kunitz-type proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="evw149-T1">table 1</xref>), which usually function as serine protease inhibitors. There were three distinct transcripts encoding classical venom Kunitz-type protein precursors, which have a signal peptide and one copy of the BPTI/Kunitz inhibitor domain containing an Arg residue after the second Cys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw149-F4">fig. 4</xref>). This residue was shown to be the S1 site necessary for plasmin and trypsin inhibition in the Textilinins-1 and -2 from the Australian elapid <italic>Pseudonaja textilis</italic>. Its substitution by nonpositively charged residues in naturally occurring isoforms of many toxin is a marker of chymotrypsin inhibitors or noninhibitory Kunitz-type proteins that act as neurotoxin active on Ca<sup>2+ </sup>channels (<xref rid="evw149-B73" ref-type="bibr">Schweitz et al. 1994</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B21" ref-type="bibr">Filippovich et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B49" ref-type="bibr">Millers et al. 2009</xref>). This fact indicates that these <italic>P. mertensi</italic> proteins are more likely to function as true protease inhibitors than to act as neurotoxins.

One of them is similar to a papilin-like protein, which is conserved in reptiles, and contains a WAP domain surrounded by two Kunitz domains (<xref rid="evw149-B17" ref-type="bibr">Fessler et al. 2004</xref>); the other is similar to ku-wap-fusin toxins described in some viper venoms (<xref rid="evw149-B56" ref-type="bibr">Pahari et al. 2007</xref>) and more recently in a colubrid (<xref rid="evw149-B47" ref-type="bibr">McGivern et al. 2014</xref>), in which a N-terminal Kunitz domain is followed by a C-terminal WAP domain and a short C-terminal tail. Nevertheless, we also found waprin-like toxins (<xref rid="evw149-B25" ref-type="bibr">Fry et al. 2008</xref>) in the transcriptome of <italic>P. mertensi</italic> venom glands, in which WAP domains occur solely (without the Kunitz domain). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw149-F4">Figure 4</xref> illustrates a comparison of the structural arrangement of these domains in proteins expressed in other snake venom glands with those of the proteins found in this work. It is interesting to observe that differently from the original viperid ku-wap-fusin proteins, the <italic>P. mertensi</italic> one retains the second Cys residues of the WAP domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw149-F4">fig. 4</xref>B), while it lacks the acquired extra C-terminal tail and the dibasic residues in the linker region, which is believed to provide cleavage between the two domains (<xref rid="evw149-B14" ref-type="bibr">Doley et al. 2010</xref>). It thus seems that this colubrid sequence is a more bona fide combination of the two domains, which may occur together in the mature protein. Nevertheless, this protein was not detected in the venom proteome.</p><p>The evolutionary relationship between the toxins having these two domain types (Kunitz-type and WAP), alone or conjugated, was investigated by <xref rid="evw149-B74" ref-type="bibr">St Pierre et al. (2008)</xref> and <xref rid="evw149-B14" ref-type="bibr">Doley et al. (2010)</xref>, who proposed that they arose from a common ancestral gene (Kunitz-like) with subsequent duplication and diversification through a recombination of the flanking introns. This process led to the insertion of WAP domain in ku-wap-fusin followed by the loss of the Kunitz domain in the generation of the waprin gene (<xref rid="evw149-B14" ref-type="bibr">Doley et al. 2010</xref>). From the transcriptomic analysis of <italic>P. mertensi</italic> venom glands it is now possible to add two players that may improve this story: a nonviper ku-wap-fusin, holding more conserved features from the WAP domains, and a papilin-like protein, containing a Kunitz domain after the WAP domain. At this point, without any genomic information about the gene structure of these transcripts, it is not possible to adequately revisit the evolutionary process that resulted in the emergence of the venom proteins, however, our findings illustrate the plasticity of domain recruitments and rearrangements in snake venom toxins.</p></sec><sec><title>A Trend in Metalloproteinases Evolution toward Structure Simplification</title><p>SVMPs are the most representative class of toxin, in terms of diversity, and are also highly abundant in <italic>P. mertensi</italic> venom. We were able to identify 12 different SVMP transcripts, which were all confirmed as present in the venom (<xref ref-type="table" rid="evw149-T1">table 1</xref>). All but one was identified as P-III class SVMP, that is, they possess a catalytic domain followed by disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domains. This is in agreement with the current hypothesis for the evolution of this toxin class, which assumes that the acquisition of P-I and P-II types of enzymes occurred within the Viperidae family, after its differentiation from other snake clades (<xref rid="evw149-B25" ref-type="bibr">Fry et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B7" ref-type="bibr">Casewell et al. 2011</xref>). This process is supposed to have happened through mutations in key residues and losses of some introns (<xref rid="evw149-B3" ref-type="bibr">Bazaa et al. 2007</xref>), which occurred in several independent events on different species within the Viperidae family (<xref rid="evw149-B7" ref-type="bibr">Casewell et al. 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our results, however, showed a notable exception to the canonical domain organization of the P-III class SVMPs, since one transcript (PMERREF_SVMP01) encodes a P-III SVMP truncated at the middle of the disintegrin-like domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw149-F5">fig. 5</xref>). This truncation was caused by the existence of a stop codon after the 58th residue of the disintegrin-like domain, and the replacement of the remaining 3&#x02032;-UTR portion of the cDNA, shortly after this stop codon, by a sequence of unknown origin lacking similarity to any sequence in the databases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw149-F5">fig. 5</xref>B). This unknown sequence begins shortly after the position of the 11th intron&#x02013;exon boundary described for a P-III SVMP gene (<xref rid="evw149-B70" ref-type="bibr">Sanz et al. 2012</xref>), thus indicating that the exon 11 of P-III SVMP gene was substituted with a new sequence that generated a new 3&#x02032;-UTR.

Initially, we verified that the contig containing this feature (PMERREF_SVMP01) was highly expressed and the region containing the truncation was highly covered by the Illumina reads (data not shown), which is a good indication that it is a truly expressed transcript rather than a rare one or an artifact of the assembly. To confirm this, we checked for Sanger-based ESTs covering this region and identified 15 independent clones (from the primary and unamplified library) confirming this sequence (one clone exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw149-F5">fig. 5</xref>B). We also designed specific primers and PCR amplified the primary cDNA pool to obtain a single full-length cDNA clone coding for this product, which again confirmed the originally assembled contig. In order to check if the specific protein product of this transcript existed in the venom, we carefully analyzed the peptides sequenced by MS/MS and found seven unique peptides matching only this predicted protein. Particularly, one of these peptides (LQHGAQCDS) is a specific marker of the existence of this protein, since it ends in the last residue of the shortened protein encoded by transcript PMERREF_SVMP01 (before the inserted stop codon) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw149-F5">fig. 5</xref>C and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw149/-/DC1">supplementary table S3</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw149/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). Indeed, since trypsin was used during sample preparation, this semitryptic peptide could only be generated from the C-terminal portion of this protein (whose precursor terminates with this unusual stop codon position). None of the normal (nontruncated) SVMPs of <italic>P. mertensi</italic> could generate a tryptic peptide ending at this position since they do not have Arg or Lys residues in this region. Taken together, the confirmation of the sequence of this cDNA, its the high expression level in both the transcriptome and the proteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw149-F3">fig. 3</xref>B) and the sequencing of its unique peptides, including the unusual C-terminal region, indicate a functional gene encoding a new type of SVMP in this venom.</p><p>An evolutionary significance of this finding is that it suggests a convergent evolution of multidomain SVMP genes in two different snake families toward a similar simplified form. Although in viperids it may have occurred through a domain loss process associated with intron losses (<xref rid="evw149-B3" ref-type="bibr">Bazaa et al. 2007</xref>), in the <italic>P. mertesi</italic> case it seems to be caused by the insertion of a new exon of an unknown origin, shortening the original protein sequence. Since viperid P-I SVMPs, which lack noncatalytic domains, are generally less hemorrhagic than P-III SVMPs (<xref rid="evw149-B53" ref-type="bibr">Moura-Da-Silva et al. 2009</xref>), it was hypothesized that, in viperids, evolution is convergently producing multiple independent generations of P-I class SVMPs, perhaps as a response to dietary selection pressures for different prey types (<xref rid="evw149-B7" ref-type="bibr">Casewell et al. 2011</xref>). The extrapolation of this idea to colubrids depends first on knowing if this is an apotypic character of this species or a synapotypic character shared with more colubrids, which remains to be elucidated when data from related species become available.</p><p>It is interesting to observe that a similar case of a trend toward a simplification in a colubrid protease structure was noted with the svMMPs, a different type of metalloproteinase recently shown to be a new toxin component exclusive of colubrid venoms (<xref rid="evw149-B10" ref-type="bibr">Ching et al. 2012</xref>). They can occur as a MMP-9 like structure (including hemopexin and fibronectin domains) or as a derived form such as those from <italic>T. strigatus</italic> venom where the ancillary domains were lost but the functional activity of the shortened protein was kept (<xref rid="evw149-B10" ref-type="bibr">Ching et al. 2012</xref>). In this study, we found a svMMP transcript encoding a protein with the classical MMP-9 arrangement, that is, including one hemopexin and three fibronectin domains, whose sequence was confirmed by proteomic analysis with a high spectral count in the venom. (PMERREF_MMP01, <xref ref-type="table" rid="evw149-T1">table 1</xref>) The gene for this cDNA thus represents the presimplification state, whereas the <italic>T. strigatus</italic> one represents the apotypic (derived) character, extending the notion that the evolutionary trend through simplification of metalloproteinases (svMMP or SVMP) may happen in a species-specific manner.</p></sec><sec><title>An Acid Lipase as True Venom Component</title><p>The transcriptomic analysis revealed an unexpected and highly expressed transcript coding for a lysosomal acid lipase-like protein. The expression level dictated by 6,931 reads (RPKM = 8,582) was comparable to that of the most abundant SVMPs and Kunitz-type toxins, and far above the major venom gland house-keeping genes, such as protein disulfide-isomerase and calreticulin, which use to be the most expressed nonvenom transcripts in venom gland transcriptomes (<xref rid="evw149-B36" ref-type="bibr">Junqueira-de-Azevedo and Ho 2002</xref>). The EST analysis also indicated the high expression of the transcript coding for the acid lipase-like protein and confirmed the sequence of the assembled contig with an overlap of 100% and an average coverage of five times. One of the EST clones was resequenced showing a full-length cDNA of 2,055 bp with a 1,200 bp open reading frame (ORF) and a 3&#x02032;-UTR containing a classical poly adenylation signal and a poly A+ tail (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw149/-/DC1">supplementary fig. S3</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw149/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). The encoded protein precursor, named PMERREF_LIPA01, contains 400 amino acids, with a predicted signal peptide of 17 residues followed by a mature protein chain of a 383 amino acids. The molecular mass of the mature protein was predicted to be 39.9 kDa but it includes three potential N-glycosylation sites that may increase the observed protein molecular mass.</p><p>Comparison of the PMERREF_LIPA01 precursor sequence against confirmed and curated proteins form the UniProt database revealed best similarity (&#x0223c;66% identity) to mammalian lysosomal acid lipases (cholesteryl ester hydrolase&#x02014;EC: 3.1.1.13). However, a broader search against the TSA_nr database (containing predicted proteins derived from TSA) revealed several predicted Acid Lipases from Squamate reptiles, including snakes, which share around 80% of sequence identity. In fact, an acid lipase transcript was firstly detected in the EST based transcriptome of the African viper <italic>Echis coloratus</italic> (<xref rid="evw149-B6" ref-type="bibr">Casewell et al. 2009</xref>), summing 2% of the venom-related transcripts, whereas it was not detected in the three other species of the same genus investigated in that study. The authors proposed that it could represent a new toxin type, however, since the work did not involve protein analysis, the protein was not found in the venom. In the venom gland transcriptome of the South American Elapidae <italic>Micrurus altirostris</italic>, a partial transcript for an acid lipase representing 0.4% of venom-related transcripts was also identified and, in this case, one single peptide was detected by MS/MS analysis of the HPLC-fractionated venom (<xref rid="evw149-B12" ref-type="bibr">Correa-Netto et al. 2011</xref>). Some of the other snake species, including two colubrids, for which transcripts coding for acid lipase were available in TSA also had their crude venoms analyzed by MS/MS but none of them revealed this protein as a venom component. The absence of protein detection in these species suggests that the acid lipase may not be regularly secreted to their venoms or it is secreted at very low levels, making difficult to identify it at the protein level.</p><p>The existence of this protein, among many other protein types, in venoms was in fact questioned by <xref rid="evw149-B30" ref-type="bibr">Hargreaves et al. (2014)</xref>, when they put in check the recruitment of several proposed minor snake toxins because of their relative widespread expression in nonvenom tissues. The authors concluded that the acid lipase should not be a toxin due to its coexpression in the other tissues of <italic>Echis colloratus</italic> tested in the same study, although its expression level in the venom gland of that species was much higher than in the other tissues. They preferred to associate the higher expression of acid lipase in the venom glands to a possible role in the high cell turnover of this tissue than to a potential function as a toxin. They also ignored other previous evidences in favor of this protein as a venom component, such as its elevated expression levels in <italic>M. altirostris</italic> venom gland transcriptome and its detection in the venom proteome of this species and they did not look further for the presence of this protein in the venoms of the species studied. Thus, the arguable proposition of acid lipase as a new toxin would benefit from a clear demonstration of its occurrence in a snake venom secretion.</p><p>Here, the venom proteomic characterization by in-solution trypsin digestion and MS/MS analysis provided the identification of 18 unique peptides matching the mature sequence of the acid lipase, corresponding to a coverage of approximately 71% of the protein sequence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="evw149-T1">table 1</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw149/-/DC1">supplementary table S3</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw149/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). The spectral count of 42 for unique peptides of this protein indicates that it is relatively abundant in the venom (<xref ref-type="table" rid="evw149-T1">table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw149-F3">fig. 3</xref>B). The identification of a 2-DE spot of approximately 55 kDa provided another evidence of the presence of the acid lipase in the venom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw149-F3">fig. 3</xref>A).</p><p>In order to get a proteomic-independent confirmation of its occurrence in the venom of <italic>P. mertensi</italic> (and other snakes) and to further characterize it, we first obtained a recombinant acid lipase in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw149-F6">fig. 6</xref>A). The purified protein was refolded in solution and its enzymatic activity was tested. The 4-MUO assay showed the recombinant protein to be active, producing a fluorescence emission comparable to that of control human acid lipase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw149-F6">fig. 6</xref>B). Using a colorimetric assay to measure glycerol release, the activity was determined as 0.165 milliunits/ml, corresponding to a specific activity of 1.65 nmol.min <sup>&#x02212;</sup>
<sup>1</sup>.<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.mg <sup>&#x02212;</sup>

After the immunization scheme, the mouse serum was used to immunostain the protein in a pooled preparation of venom from <italic>P. mertensi</italic> individuals and of other snake species. A marked band of 55 kDa was observed in the venom of <italic>P. mertensi</italic> (the same molecular mass of the spot identified as an acid lipase in the 2-DE analysis), followed by a less reactive one of approximately 39 kDa (the expected mass for the nonglycosylated protein) and a weakly immunostained band of approximately 10 kDa that may be the result of partial protein degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw149-F6">fig. 6</xref>). Interestingly a protein band of the same mass (&#x0223c;55 kDa) was detected in the venom of <italic>Micrurus corallinus</italic> (Elapidae), a species closely related to <italic>M. altitrostris</italic>, the one we first obtained proteomic evidence of the occurrence of acid lipase in the venom (<xref rid="evw149-B12" ref-type="bibr">Correa-Netto et al. 2011</xref>).

We thus performed a phylogenetic analysis with acid lipase-related sequences from all reptiles in the context of similar orthologues from other vertebrates. The phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw149-F7">fig. 7</xref>) indicates that there are up to four paralogues of acid lipase in the squamata reptiles. Although the snake paralogue genes recognized as equally expressed in nonvenom and venom producing tissues (<xref rid="evw149-B30" ref-type="bibr">Hargreaves et al. 2014</xref>) form several independent clades containing orthologues from <italic>Anolis</italic> lizard and other vertebrates, the snake paralogue transcripts with a differential (but not exclusive) gene expression in the venom glands form a single robust clade. In other words, all the acid lipases evidenced or suggested as venom components, as previously discussed, form a unique monophyletic group distinct from the physiological (nonvenom) sequences. This includes <italic>P. mertensi</italic> (this work), <italic>Ech. colloratus</italic> (<xref rid="evw149-B6" ref-type="bibr">Casewell et al. 2009</xref>), and <italic>Micrurus</italic> spp sequences (note: since <italic>M. altirostris</italic> had only a partial sequence available, we included in the phylogeny a <italic>Micrurus fulvius</italic> sequence (<xref rid="evw149-B45" ref-type="bibr">Margres et al. 2013</xref>). The tree topology was actually in a general agreement with that elaborated by <xref rid="evw149-B30" ref-type="bibr">Hargreaves et al. (2014)</xref>, though we recognize the clade containing the venom gland differentially expressed transcripts as a result of a recruitment to the venom. A calculation of rates of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions among nucleotide sequences in the &#x0201c;venom&#x0201d; clade of lipases indicated that these proteins are not under diversifying selection (average dn/ds = 0.4274), as observed in some but not all toxin classes.

The protein sequences are referred by their accession numbers. *JAB53942 is from <italic>M. fulvius</italic> but the proteomic evidence was obtained from similar sequence from <italic>M. altirostris</italic> (<xref rid="evw149-B12" ref-type="bibr">Correa-Netto et al. 2011</xref>) and the immunochemical evidence is from <italic>M. corallinus</italic> venom (this work). Numbers on the nodes represent Bayesian posterior probabilities. Bayesian inferences was obtained by MrBayes software version 3.1.1 <sup>30</sup>, utilizing 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> numbers of generations for the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm in four chains, sampled every 100 and using the aamodelpr prior set to mixed models.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="evw149f7p"/></fig></p><p>We thus conclude that acid lipase is most likely a venom constituent considering: 1) the reliable identification of this protein in the venom <italic>P. mertensi</italic> by proteomic and immunochemical analyses (this work); 2) the presence of lipase activity in the venom of <italic>P. mertensi</italic> (this work); 3) its previous suggestive identification in the venom of the Elapidae <italic>M. corallinus</italic> (<xref rid="evw149-B12" ref-type="bibr">Correa-Netto et al. 2011</xref>); 4) its high representation in <italic>P. mertensi</italic> venom gland transcriptome (this work); 5) its wide transcription in the oral glands of other snakes (including a Viperidae, Elapidae, and Colubridae), where expression levels are generally high or higher than in other tissues (<xref rid="evw149-B6" ref-type="bibr">Casewell et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B30" ref-type="bibr">Hargreaves et al. 2014</xref>); and 6) the predicted common origin of the venom gene in all the suggested species (this work). Thus we propose the name svLIPA for this venom component, avoiding the use of the term &#x0201c;lysosomal&#x0201d; because of the evidences of its secretion to the venom solution rather than its sorting to the organelle. The confirmation of this venom component as a toxin, and not only a venom component, depends on more complex tests about its biological function and pathophysiological effects, especially in ecological context of the species. Unfortunately, a strong limitation for such investigations is the low amount of venom obtained from colubrid specimens, making the use of the recombinant protein a useful alternative for future investigations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In order to obtain a complete picture of the venom from <italic>P. mertensi</italic>, we adopted complementary omics and functional approaches involving: 1) the evaluation of some of the enzymatic activities commonly observed in snake venoms, 2) the generation of a de novo NGS transcriptome based on Illumina technology, 3) the cloning and sequencing of random ESTs to validate transcript assemblies, 4) the primer-walking sequencing of specific full-length toxin cDNAs, 5) the proteomic analysis of the venom using the venom gland transcriptome as a reference database, and 6) the production of a recombinant protein to characterize a possible new toxin.</p><p>This combined approach allowed us to trace the components of this venom, observing an enzyme-rich secretion resembling a Viperidae venom, however with an unusual high content of Kunitz-type inhibitors that may play a role in the hemostatic disturbance of the prey. Nevertheless, the presence in the venom of three-finger toxins, which are usually found in the venom of Elapidae snakes, the presence of svMMPs, a colubrid-specific protein type, and the identification of a novel acid lipase that may be a new toxin with an unknown role, underscore the complexity of <italic>P. mertensi</italic> venom and evidence its unique characteristics.</p><p>The finding of the acid lipase in the venom could also be considered in the context of the debate about a single versus a multiple origin of reptilian venom systems (<xref rid="evw149-B24" ref-type="bibr">Fry et al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid="evw149-B30" ref-type="bibr">Hargreaves et al. 2014</xref>). Although far from providing a considerable contribution to solve this question, we demonstrated that one minor putative component (acid lipase) previously suggested (and contested) in some species could actually be a true venom component in other species. Thus, some care should be taken in assuming a nonvenom related function of a certain protein simply because of its (or its complement) coexpression in other tissues. The investigation of the presence of the protein in the actual secretion, claimed to be venom, seems to be a critical requirement to foster this discussion.</p><p>Moreover, a detailed view of the structural features of the toxins investigated here suggested that some evolutionary tendencies observed in more studied venoms from medically relevant families also occur in colubrids. As an example of protein simplification, domain losses were observed in the two types of colubrid metalloproteinases (SVMP and svMMPs), paralleling the evolution of SVMPs in Viperidae. As an example of protein rearrangement, distinct domains such as wap and kunitz-type were found rearranged in multiple configurations across the snake families. These findings reinforce the importance of investigating colubrid venoms to achieve a more complete picture of the evolutionary history of snake toxins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw149/-/DC1">Supplementary figures S1&#x02013;S3</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw149/-/DC1">tables S1 and S2</ext-link> are available at <italic>Genome Biology and Evolution</italic> online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbe.oxfordjournals.org/">http://www.gbe.oxfordjournals.org/</ext-link>).</p>
