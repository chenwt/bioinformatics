Many challenges still exist in detecting these changes, particularly in the context of a complex, developing tissue. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) allows relatively high-throughput evaluation of multiple genes and developmental time points. Proper quantification of gene expression levels by qRT-PCR requires normalization to one or more reference genes. Traditionally, these genes have been selected based on their presumed &#x0201c;housekeeping&#x0201d; function, with the implicit assumption that they are stably expressed over the entire experimental set. However, this is rarely tested empirically. Here we describe the identification of novel reference genes for the mouse mammary gland based on their stable expression in published microarray datasets. We compared eight novel candidate reference genes (<italic>Arpc3, Clock, Ctbp1, Phf7, Prdx1, Sugp2, Taf11</italic> and <italic>Usp7)</italic> to eight traditional ones (<italic>18S, Actb, Gapdh</italic>, <italic>Hmbs</italic>, <italic>Hprt</italic>, <italic>Rpl13a</italic>, <italic>Sdha</italic> and <italic>Tbp</italic>) and analysed all genes for stable expression in the mouse mammary gland from pre-puberty to adulthood using four different algorithms (GeNorm, DeltaCt, BestKeeper and NormFinder). <italic>Prdx1, Phf7</italic> and <italic>Ctbp1</italic> were validated as novel and reliable, tissue-specific reference genes that outperform traditional reference genes in qRT-PCR studies of postnatal mammary gland development.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>One of the challenges in developmental biology is to understand how subtle changes in gene expression drive growth and differentiation of complex tissues. The mouse mammary gland serves as a prime example of a dynamic and complex tissue that harbours many different cell types. During embryonic development, the mammary placode develops into a rudimentary mammary epithelial tree<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. After birth, this epithelial tree remains relatively quiescent until the onset of puberty, when the epithelium grows out via branching morphogenesis and invades the surrounding fat pad. By the time the mouse reaches adulthood, the ducts have reached the end of the fat pad. However, dynamic growth and differentiation do not stop at this stage. Adult mice undergo a complete estrus cycle every 4&#x02013;5 days, and during this time the epithelium also expands and regresses. Furthermore, during pregnancy the gland forms large alveolar structures that will produce milk during lactation once fully differentiated. After lactation, the mammary gland involutes and is reshaped back to a virgin-like state. This cycle can repeat itself multiple times throughout the reproductive life of an animal. As a result, during postnatal development the mammary gland does not only dramatically change in size, but also in cell type composition and differentiation status<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p><p>Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is a highly sensitive method for measuring changes in gene expression across multiple experimental conditions. However, even with current technologies it remains challenging to compare different developmental timepoints<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, due to changes in tissue composition. To control for technical errors, individual samples are typically normalized against the expression of one or more internal reference genes. The ideal reference gene shows stable expression across the entire experimental dataset and is not influenced by any of the experimental parameters. This ensures that changes in reference gene expression are only due to technical variation such as pipetting errors and differences in sample input. When analysing genes that show subtle expression differences, as is the case for many developmental regulators, even small changes in reference gene expression can lead to aberrant results. It is therefore important to use the most stably expressed reference possible. Including more than one reference gene for the analyses further minimizes the effect of individual reference gene expression variation. While not yet commonplace, the use of at least three <italic>bona-fide</italic> reference genes is advised for proper normalization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p><p>Reference genes have historically been picked based on their presumed &#x0201c;housekeeping&#x0201d; function, ensuring that they would be abundantly expressed and easily detectable. However, traditionally used reference genes such as <italic>Gapdh, 18S</italic> and <italic>Actb</italic> can change expression in response to experimental treatment and might therefore not be appropriate to use under all circumstances<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Attempts have been made to identify universal reference genes, which could be applied to any sample of interest irrespective of its developmental origin, by comparing published datasets of multiple different human tissues and cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. However, so far this has failed to yield a consistent list of candidate genes, raising the question whether such universal references exist at all<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Therefore, finding the best performing reference genes requires a dedicated effort focussing on the specific tissue or organism of interest<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p><p>Because of the dynamic growth and differentiation properties of the mammary gland, it is particularly challenging to find genes that can serve as reliable reference genes across different stages of postnatal development. In 2010, Han and colleagues ranked the stability of eight commonly used reference genes for qRT-PCR studies of the mouse mammary gland<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. However, their study focussed on the pregnancy and lactation stages in the adult only. Moreover, a single algorithm was used to rank the genes, while several algorithms are currently available to provide a more comprehensive overview of reference gene stability and sensitivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>.</p><p>Here we describe the identification of novel candidate reference genes for the mouse mammary gland based on their stable expression in multiple microarray datasets. We validate <italic>Ctbp1</italic>, <italic>Phf7</italic> and <italic>Prdx1</italic> as tissue-specific reference genes. They show stable expression across multiple stages of postnatal mammary gland development and allow the detection of subtle changes in <italic>Wnt</italic> gene expression in whole mammary gland RNA preparations. As such, they outperform traditionally used reference genes and are exquisitely suited for comparative qRT-PCR analyses in this complex developing tissue.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Selection of novel candidate reference genes from published microarray data</title><p>The mammary gland is composed of multiple different cell types, including basal and luminal epithelial cells, stromal fibroblasts and adipocytes, as well as cells contributing to other structures in the gland such as nerves and blood vessels. In addition, the gland shows dynamic growth and differentiation during puberty, pregnancy and lactation, as well as extensive tissue remodelling during involution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). To date, no dedicated attempt has been made to determine whether suitable reference genes exist for use in qRT-PCR studies of whole mammary gland preparations across all stages of postnatal development. Therefore, we set out to identify novel, tissue-specific candidate reference genes that are stably expressed from pre-puberty through puberty and adulthood by analyzing published expression datasets.</p><p>We identified two gene expression profiling studies in the NCBI gene expression omnibus (GEO, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</ext-link>) that compared different stages of mammary gland development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Both datasets (GSE5831<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> and GSE6453<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>) used microarrays to analyse the whole mammary gland transcriptome, but the studies were performed by different labs, on different mouse strains (C57BL6/J and CD-1, respectively) and using different array platforms. Furthermore, one experiment (GSE5831) compared adult stages (6 week old virgins, pregnancy day 14, lactation day 10 and involution day 4), whereas the other (GSE6453) compared pubertal time points (3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 week old females). We hypothesized that any gene that would be stably expressed across all of these arrays could qualify as a suitable reference gene. To identify these genes, we compared physiologically divergent stages using GEO2R, an interactive webtool that allows gene expression analysis of published microarray datasets using the GEOquery and limma R packages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>.</p><p>First, we performed differential gene expression analysis of GSE5831 for the virgin and lactating, terminally differentiated gland. We selected genes with a log fold change (logFC) between &#x02212;0.1 and 0.1, thus reflecting stable expression between the two conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Next, we performed a similar analysis for the pregnant (actively growing) and involuting (regressing) gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Of the 852 and 1754 genes that showed stable expression in the virgin/lactating and pregnant/involuting comparisons, respectively, only a subset (194 genes) approached a logFC of 0 in both.</p><p>To narrow down the number of potential candidate reference genes, we then performed differential gene expression analysis of GSE6453 for different pubertal stages, comparing the start and end of puberty (3-week versus 7-week old mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>) as well as early and late puberty (4-week versus 6-week old mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). This resulted in a list of 37 genes that showed stable expression across all of the tested conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). From this list, we selected a final set of 8 putative reference genes (<italic>Arpc3</italic>, <italic>Clock</italic>, <italic>Ctbp1</italic>, <italic>Phf7</italic>, <italic>Prdx1</italic>, <italic>Sugp2</italic>, <italic>Taf11</italic> and <italic>Usp7</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>). We made certain that the resulting candidates represented a variety of expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>) and divergent functions as predicted by gene ontology analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), and ensured that gene-specific qRT-PCR primers with unique, intron-spanning sequences and sufficient amplification efficiency could be designed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Variation in expression levels of candidate reference genes</title><p>Previously, Han and colleagues investigated the stability of eight commonly used reference genes in the pregnant and lactating mouse mammary gland<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. To determine whether any of these genes are also stably expressed over a larger developmental timeframe, we selected four of the most stable genes identified in this study (<italic>Rpl13a, Hprt, Gapdh</italic> and <italic>Actb</italic>) as well as four additional commonly used reference genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> (<italic>18S, Hmbs, Tbp</italic> and <italic>Sdha</italic>) as a &#x0201c;traditional reference gene set&#x0201d;.</p><p>To test the variation in expression levels of the traditional and novel candidate reference genes over a large developmental time course, we performed qRT-PCR analyses on cDNA synthesized from whole mouse mammary gland RNA preparations ranging from pre-puberty (P14) to early, mid- and late puberty (P28, P35 and P42) and adult virgin FVB mice (P56). When the expression levels (Ct values) of all sixteen (candidate) reference genes are compared, variable expression patterns across the different stages of development emerge for both the traditional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>) and the newly identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>) genes. Some genes show a relatively stable pattern throughout, with all Ct values clustering closely together irrespective of the developmental time point. For instance, across pre-puberty and adulthood the Ct values for <italic>Prdx1</italic> and <italic>Ctbp1</italic> show a total spread of only 2.0 and 1.9 cycles, respectively. Other genes show more variation and are therefore probably less suitable as reference genes for our purpose. As an example, the expression of <italic>Hmbs</italic> and <italic>Actb</italic> shows a spread of 8.0 and 7.7 cycles, respectively. The 3<sup>rd</sup> thoracic gland was analysed as a biological replicate and shows a similar pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>GeNorm stability analysis of candidate reference genes</title><p>Reference genes can be ranked based on their expression stability over all samples using the GeNorm algorithm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. The underlying principle of this algorithm is that ideal reference genes show stable expression patterns regardless of the experimental parameters (in our case: different developmental time points). When multiple <italic>bona-fide</italic> reference genes are analysed, their average expression should best represent the &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; normalisation factor. Therefore, GeNorm not only scores for stable expression per candidate, but also for gene expression variation of each individual reference compared to the average reference gene expression. By performing a pairwise variation of any candidate reference gene compared to the average expression of the entire pool, a so-called M-value is calculated for each gene, which serves as a measure for gene stability: the lower the value, the more stably a gene is expressed. Next, the genes are ranked based on M-value, by performing stepwise exclusion of the gene with the highest M-value (i.e. poorest stability). M-value calculation and stepwise exclusion are repeated until only two genes remain. These final two genes are ranked based on their individual stability value.</p><p>M-values should be as low as possible. However, they strongly depend on the complexity of the experimental samples and fixed criteria or cut offs do not exist<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. For homologous samples, such as cell lines, the M-value can drop below 0.2. In contrast, for complex tissues M-values of 0.5 or even &#x0003e;1.0 have been reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>.

GeNorm analysis for the novel candidates revealed <italic>Phf7, Prdx1</italic> and <italic>Ctbp1</italic> as best performing references in this set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). The M-values for these genes (0.49, 0.51 and 0.53, respectively) are lower than the best M-value for the traditional gene set.

DeltaCt ranks genes based only on the spread in Ct values (similar as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>), considering the gene with the least variation to be the best ranking reference. BestKeeper performs pairwise variations for all possible pairs of reference genes and calculates a geometric mean to determine which genes have highly similar expression profiles, creating a ranking based on the fit of the geometric means. NormFinder analyses the variance in expression data of all given candidate reference genes, with the assumption that an ideal reference gene should only differ mildly from the overall estimate.</p><p>The different approaches from the above mentioned algorithms lead to small differences in their respective reference gene rankings, but ideally the overall trend should be the same. <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> shows the comprehensive ranking of all novel candidates and traditional reference genes for the different algorithms. Indeed, the results confirm the GeNorm analysis: <italic>Arpc3, Hmbs, Actb</italic> and <italic>Sdha</italic> rank poorly for all algorithms and are thus considered to be less suitable reference genes in all tests. In contrast, <italic>Prdx1, Phf7</italic> and <italic>Ctbp1</italic> are ranked in the top four in all tests, complemented with either <italic>Tbp</italic>, <italic>Hprt</italic> or <italic>Rpl13a</italic> depending on the algorithm.

For this purpose, we focused on <italic>Wnt</italic> gene expression. Wnt signalling is crucial for mammary gland development and function, and Wnt-responsive stem cells reside in the mammary gland from an early time point on refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>.

Furthermore, <italic>Wnt</italic> genes are typically expressed at relatively low levels, making it challenging to detect expression level changes in RNA preparations from the whole mammary gland. <italic>Wnt4</italic> is known to be expressed in the adult mammary gland, where it plays a role in the estrus cycle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> and in side-branching during pregnancy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. A recent study also revealed a role for <italic>Wnt4</italic> in branching morphogenesis during puberty<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, but if and how <italic>Wnt4</italic> expression levels change during postnatal mammary gland development remains incompletely understood. To this end, we quantified <italic>Wnt4</italic> expression across pre-puberty, puberty and adulthood. Only when <italic>Prdx1, Phf7</italic> and <italic>Ctbp1</italic> (our set of novel and preferred reference genes) are used for normalization, a steady increase in <italic>Wnt4</italic> levels is revealed between P14 and P56 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>).

Using a set of even slightly less stable reference genes (<italic>Rpl13a, Hprt</italic> and <italic>Gapdh</italic>) already obscures this trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Finally, when we normalized <italic>Wnt4</italic> expression to the three commonly used reference genes that were least stable in our analysis (<italic>Actb, Hmbs</italic> and <italic>Sdha</italic>), no statistically significant changes can be detected between the different developmental stages at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). This underscores the importance of using properly validated reference genes for the tissue of choice and confirms that the new reference gene set comprised of <italic>Prdx1</italic>, <italic>Phf7</italic> and <italic>Ctbp1</italic> allows small changes in developmental gene expression to be detected with high precision in a complex mammary tissue preparation.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Traditionally, reference genes used for normalization purposes in qRT-PCR experiments have been chosen based on their supposed role in cellular housekeeping processes.

We compared the performance of these genes to eight traditional reference genes (<italic>Actb, Gapdh, Hprt, Rpl13a, 18S, Hmbs, Sdha</italic> and <italic>Tbp</italic>) using the GeNorm, DeltaCt, BestKeeper and NormFinder algorithms to determine the most stably expressed reference genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Out of the traditional reference gene set, <italic>Tbp</italic>, <italic>Rpl13a</italic> and <italic>Hprt</italic> perform better than the previously suggested combination of <italic>Gapdh</italic>, <italic>Rpl13a</italic> and <italic>Hprt</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. However, our newly identified genes <italic>Prdx1, Phf7</italic> and <italic>Ctbp1</italic> rank as most stable overall. In addition, they are also in the top four of most stable reference genes in terms of their individual rankings (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>) and show a small spread in Ct values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>), further supporting their suitability as reference genes in the mouse mammary gland. Interestingly, <italic>CTBP1</italic> and <italic>PRDX1</italic> have previously been found to be stably expressed in a variety of human samples, suggesting they may be more widely applicable<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. In fact, <italic>PRDX1</italic> was recently shown to be the only reference gene commonly identified in fifteen published human reference gene studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p><p>By using <italic>bona-fide</italic> and highly stable reference genes, even subtle changes in developmental gene expression can be picked up by qRT-PCR on a complex tissue sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). Furthermore, in concordance with published guidelines for performing qRT-PCR experiments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> the use of three reference genes minimizes errors. Most qRT-PCR software programs accept the use of multiple reference genes for normalization. Alternatively, the geometric mean of three (or more) reference genes can be used for normalization, making this a feasible approach for most researchers today<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. However, our validation experiment stresses the importance of selecting the most stable reference gene set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). In this respect, <italic>Prdx1, Phf7</italic> and <italic>Ctbp1</italic> perform better over a large developmental time series than previously identified reference genes for the mouse mammary gland<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p><p>The fact that <italic>Prdx1, Phf7</italic> and <italic>Ctbp1</italic> outperform traditionally used reference genes, demonstrates the feasibility of our strategy to select tissue-specific, stably expressed genes based on existing microarray data. However, it should be noted that not all candidates showed stable expression upon further testing. In fact, <italic>Arpc3</italic> is one of the less well performing reference genes. One explanation is that our experimental samples contain an earlier developmental time point than the microarray datasets used to identify candidate genes. <italic>Arpc3</italic> expression in 2-week old mice (P14) deviates from the expression values at the other time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Another explanation is that strain-specific differences could play a role. Candidates were identified based on microarray experiments on C57BL/6 and CD-1 tissues, but our experimental validation was performed on FVB tissues. This further underscores the importance of testing and validating candidate reference genes, even if they are tissue-specific.</p><p>In conclusion, large datasets such as microarray or RNAseq analyses allow the selection of tissue-specific reference genes, although these should always be tested experimentally for stability in the biological samples of interest. Using this approach, we have identified <italic>Prdx1</italic>, <italic>Phf7</italic> and <italic>Ctbp1</italic> as novel, tissue-specific reference genes for qRT-PCR studies of the postnatal mouse mammary gland, and validated that this reference gene set is suitable for detecting subtle gene expression changes that occur during the pre-pubertal, pubertal and adult stages.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Animals</title><p>FVB/N mice were purchased from Envigo.

Before puberty, the fat pad only contains a rudimentary epithelial tree that starts from the nipple. During puberty, the epithelial tree invades the surrounding fat pad. This process is driven by highly proliferative structures called terminal end buds (TEBs). At the start of adulthood, the epithelial tree has fully invaded the fat pad and the TEBs regress. During each pregnancy, the gland forms alveoli for milk production during lactation. After weaning of the pups, the epithelial tree reverts back to a virgin-like state in a process called involution.
