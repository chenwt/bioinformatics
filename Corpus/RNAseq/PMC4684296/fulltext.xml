In our investigation we demonstrate successful mapping of the locus for primary open angle glaucoma in the Petit Basset Griffon Vend&#x000e9;en dog breed with 12 cases and 12 controls, using a novel genotyping by exome sequencing approach. The resulting genome-wide association signal was followed up by genome sequencing of an individual case, leading to the identification of an inversion with a breakpoint disrupting the <italic>ADAMTS17</italic> gene. Genotyping of additional controls and expression analysis provide strong evidence that the inversion is disease causing. Evidence of cryptic splicing resulting in novel exon transcription as a consequence of the inversion in <italic>ADAMTS17</italic> is identified through RNAseq experiments.

The development of most modern breeds within the last 200 years from small numbers of founding individuals has led to high levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) within breeds. These high levels of LD lead to very strong signals of association being produced from GWASs for autosomal recessive diseases, even with very modest sample numbers [<xref rid="pone.0143546.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Closed breeding populations, high levels of inbreeding and the extensive use of popular sires (dogs that closely fit the standard for a particular breed) can lead to rapidly emerging autosomal recessive disorders, as rare deleterious alleles are rapidly amplified. An example of an emerging autosomal recessive disorder is primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) in the Petit Basset Griffon Vend&#x000e9;en (PBGV).</p><p>The first recognised case of POAG in the PBGV was identified in the United Kingdom in 1996 and recent survey work completed in 2014 has demonstrated a 10.4% prevalence for the disease (personal communication, Peter Bedford). The initial clinical features of POAG are usually seen in 3 to 4 year old dogs of either sex, the disease being characterised by a small, sustained rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) and lens subluxation. In approximately one third of affected dogs phacodonesis and the appearance of the aphakic crescent associated with lens subluxation are seen before a noticeable rise in IOP (<xref rid="pone.0143546.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). There is no pectinate ligament abnormality and the iridocorneal angle remains open until the late stages of the disease, when globe enlargement has developed. Retinal degeneration and a cupping deformation of the optic papilla are only seen in late disease. Pain is not a feature and the quiet, chronic clinical nature of this disease means that often owners only become aware of the presence of POAG when either the globe enlargement or a vision problem becomes noticeable.</p><fig id="pone.0143546.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0143546.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>POAG case eye image.</title><p>Left eye, 4 year old male PBGV: The eye is normotensive (18 mm.

The major potential advantage of this approach is that a causal variant for a single gene disease could be identified in a single step, and would theoretically be the most strongly disease segregating variant with the lowest associated p-value (top SNP). Although the causal variant for POAG was not directly found by this method, due to the non-exonic location, a genome-wide significant locus was identified, enabling a disease-associated interval to be determined.</p><p>The causal mutation for POAG was eventually identified through a genome sequencing approach. Genome sequencing is an increasingly cost effective method of following up disease-associated intervals identified through GWAS. In contrast to other approaches such as exome sequencing and target enrichment, coverage is near to 100%, enabling identification of causal mutations in repetitive regions of the genome. Genome sequencing has recently been adopted to directly identify causal mutations in the dog [<xref rid="pone.0143546.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0143546.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and is being used in human studies through projects such as the 100,000 genomes project, studying cancers and rare diseases [<xref rid="pone.0143546.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, structural variants still often present a challenge to smaller laboratories using genome sequencing as part of an investigation, making GWAS in many cases the most appropriate method of locus identification for single gene diseases, before using genome sequencing or other approaches to interrogate disease-associated intervals.</p><p>Although the <italic>ADAMTS17</italic> gene was majorly disrupted by the inversion, qPCR analysis on a limited number of samples showed little evidence of nonsense mediated decay, as expression of exons outside of the inverted region was not majorly affected. Analysis of RNAseq data revealed novel exon expression for <italic>ADAMTS17</italic> due to cryptic splicing occurring 3&#x02019; of the exons located immediately upstream of the inversion event. The unavailability of suitable antibodies targeting the 5&#x02019; region of <italic>ADAMTS17</italic> prevented western blot analysis to determine whether protein is still produced from the modified transcript sequence. Visual analysis of RNAseq data aligned to the genes flanking and within the inversion region suggested gene expression for these genes was not affected. We speculate that a mobile element (SINE) which spans the 3&#x02019; inversion breakpoint is likely to have been involved in the inversion mechanism, although there is no similar mobile element in the 5&#x02019; region. There is one previous report of a gene rearrangement involving <italic>ADAMTS17</italic> found in a patient with pregnancy-related acute promyelocytic leukemia [<xref rid="pone.0143546.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This rearrangement resulted in a novel transcription product with the insertion of exon 15 of <italic>ADAMTS17</italic> between the PML and RARA genes. As the breakpoint within <italic>ADAMTS17</italic> identified in this study was within intron 12, it is unlikely that the mutation mechanism was shared between these two independent events.</p><p>Genotyping of an extended sample set was used to determine whether the identified inversion was fully concordant with POAG. Of the 212 PBGV assayed for the POAG associated inversion there was one discordant case. A single dog was reported as having clinical signs of POAG but was homozygous for the reference sequence. It could be speculated that POAG for this case is due to another clinical or genetic cause, or is a secondary form of glaucoma.</p><p>A Weill-Marchesani like syndrome (WMS) in humans was the first disease phenotype to be associated with mutations in the <italic>ADAMTS17</italic> gene. Clinical signs of WMS include glaucoma, ectopia lentis (lens luxation), lenticular myopia, spherophakia, and short stature [<xref rid="pone.0143546.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is interesting to speculate that as the PBGV is a miniature version of the Grand Basset Griffon Vend&#x000e9;en, artificial selection pressure for small size may have contributed to an increase in mutant allele frequency, assuming mutations in <italic>ADAMTS17</italic> could be contributing to small stature. An <italic>ADAMTS17</italic> splice donor site mutation has been associated with hereditary primary lens luxation in several breeds of dog [<xref rid="pone.0143546.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143546.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The range of phenotypes associated with <italic>ADAMTS17</italic> mutations suggests that the exact phenotypic presentation is dependent on the positioning and nature of the mutations within the <italic>ADAMTS17</italic> gene. The <italic>ADAMTS17</italic> gene is a member of the ADAMTS family of extracellular proteases [<xref rid="pone.0143546.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Domains which are characteristic of the ADAMTS family include an N terminal protease domain and a C-terminal ancillary domain [<xref rid="pone.0143546.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The inversion in intron 12 of <italic>ADAMTS17</italic> is within the proteolytic domain and is therefore likely to disrupt the enzymatic function of the protein. Phenotypic similarities between ADAMTS associated disease and Fibrillin1 (<italic>FBN1</italic>) associated disease, and functional evidence, suggest ADAMTS family members have a role in microfibril assembly and function [<xref rid="pone.0143546.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It could be speculated that disruption of the maintenance of microfibrils in the eye are likely to lead to development of disease phenotypes such as lens luxation and glaucoma [<xref rid="pone.0143546.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The role of the ADAMTS family members in glaucoma pathogenesis is further highlighted by the identification of a mutation in <italic>ADAMTS10</italic> as the cause of glaucoma in the Beagle and Norwegian Elkhound dog breeds [<xref rid="pone.0143546.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143546.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Functional work would be required to further understand the roles of the ADAMTS family in glaucoma disease pathogenesis.</p><p>In summary, we have used a novel GWAS approach and genome sequencing to identify an inversion associated with POAG in the PBGV dog breed. The approach further highlights how the increasing availability and cost effectiveness of massively parallel sequencing are facilitating studies into inherited disease in the dog.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Collection of DNA samples was performed by buccal swabbing, which is a non-invasive technique that does not require a United Kingdom Home Office License.

Vision assessment is based on history, the menace and dazzle reflexes and, where possible, maze performance.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>DNA extraction and genotyping</title><p>DNA was extracted from buccal swabs using the QIAamp Midi kit (Qiagen). Genotyping of the POAG associated inversion was performed by analysis of a fragment length polymorphism generated by PCR. Primers for PCR were as follows: POAG_F, <monospace>6FAM-AGGCTCAGAGGAGGGTGACT</monospace>; POAG_R1, <monospace>ACAAGGACAAAGCTGTCTGTGA</monospace>; POAG_R2, <monospace>ACACAAAGCACCCATGACAG</monospace>. PCRs were carried out in 12 ul volumes consisting of 1.5 mM dNTPs, 1x Qiagen PCR buffer, 0.5 &#x003bc;M of each primer, 0.6U of Qiagen HotStarTaq polymerase and template DNA. Thermal cycling consisted of 5 minutes at 95&#x000b0;C, followed by 35 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds, 57&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds, and 72&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds, with a final elongation stage of 72&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes. Products of PCR were analysed using the fragment analysis module of an ABI3130xl genetic analyser. Sequencing of the <italic>ADAMTS17</italic> gene was carried out as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0143546.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Exome sequencing and allelic association analysis</title><p>Libraries for exome sequencing of 12 POAG cases and 12 breed matched controls were made using the Illumina Nextera Exome Enrichment kit according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Libraries were quantified by qPCR using the KAPA library quantification kit. Sequencing of libraries was performed using two runs on the Illumina MiSeq platform, generating paired-end reads of 250 bp in length. The sequence reads generated were aligned to the canine reference genome build, CanFam3.1 using BWA [<xref rid="pone.0143546.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Variants were called using the GATK [<xref rid="pone.0143546.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Variants were converted to PLINK format for use in allelic association analysis using VCFtools [<xref rid="pone.0143546.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Allelic association analyses were carried out using the whole genome data analysis toolset, PLINK [<xref rid="pone.0143546.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].
