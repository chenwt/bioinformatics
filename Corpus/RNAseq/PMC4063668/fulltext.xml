Here, we demonstrate the utility of Nanostring technology as a targeted approach to perform accurate measurement of tandem repeats even at extremely high copy number, and apply this technology to genotype 165 HapMap samples from three different populations and five species of non-human primates. We observed extreme variability in copy number of tandemly repeated genes, with many loci showing 5&#x02013;10 fold variation in copy number among humans. Many of these loci show hallmarks of genome assembly errors, and the true copy number of many large tandem repeats is significantly under-represented even in the high quality &#x02018;finished&#x02019; human reference assembly. Importantly, we demonstrate that most large tandem repeat variations are not tagged by nearby SNPs, and are therefore essentially invisible to SNP-based GWAS approaches. Using association analysis we identify many <italic>cis</italic> correlations of large tandem repeat variants with nearby gene expression and DNA methylation levels, indicating that variations of tandem repeat length are associated with functional effects on the local genomic environment. This includes an example where expansion of a macrosatellite repeat is associated with increased DNA methylation and suppression of nearby gene expression, suggesting a mechanism termed &#x0201c;repeat induced gene silencing&#x0201d;, which has previously been observed only in transgenic organisms. We also observed multiple signatures consistent with altered selective pressures at tandemly repeated loci, suggesting important biological functions. Our studies show that tandemly repeated loci represent a highly variable fraction of the genome that have been systematically ignored by most previous studies, copy number variation of which can exert functionally significant effects. We suggest that future studies of tandem repeat loci will lead to many novel insights into their role in modulating both genomic and phenotypic diversity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Here we utilize Nanostring digital assays and show their utility for estimating copy number of 186 multicopy genes and tandem repeats. By analyzing patterns of single nucleotide variation around these variants, we show that copy number variation at the vast majority of tandem repeat variations is not effectively tagged by nearby SNPs, and thus standard genome-wide association studies that focus on SNPs provide little or no information about such variants. By comparing patterns of tandem repeat copy number with variation in local gene expression and DNA methylation, we also identify extensive functional effects on local genome function. This includes an example of a non-coding macrosatellite repeat, expansion of which exerts a repressive effect on a nearby gene accompanied by accumulations of local DNA methylation. Finally, comparison of diverse human populations with a number of primate genomes shows that many of these sequences have undergone extreme changes in copy number during recent human and primate evolution, and show signatures that suggest possible selective effects. Overall, we conclude that multicopy genes and macrosatellites represent a highly variable fraction of the genome with important functional effects that has been systematically ignored by previous studies.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>AJS is supported by NIH grants R01DA033660, R01HG006696 and R03HD073731 and grants from the Alzheimer's Association (69983) and March of Dimes (6-FY13-92).

This includes tandem repeats, defined as stretches of DNA comprising two or more contiguous copies of a sequence of nucleotides arranged in head-to-tail pattern, for example CAG-CAG-CAG-CAG-CAG. Many tandem repeats are composed of repetitions of a short motif 1&#x02013;6 bp, termed microsatellites, and these can often be highly polymorphic in copy number. However, some tandem repeats can be very large, with unit sizes of tens or even hundreds of kilobases <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Warburton1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Macrosatellites are defined as repeats with unit sizes &#x02265;100 bp (also known as Variable Number of Tandem Repeats or VNTRs), and in some cases these large tandem repeats can include functional elements such as exons or entire genes within each repeat unit, resulting in potentially polymorphic multicopy genes.</p><p>Despite representing a significant source of genomic variation <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Mills1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, tandem repeats were once labeled as mere &#x02018;junk DNA&#x02019; and as a class of sequence variation remain very poorly studied. In part this has been due to the inherent technical difficulties in characterizing non-unique portions of the genome. For example, repetitive regions are typically excluded from microarray designs due to their high-copy nature. Even where they are targeted, techniques such as array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) typically do not perform well in repeats, as their high copy nature means that array signals often saturate at higher copy numbers <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Sharp1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Unless specialized approaches are used <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Alkan1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004418-Highnam1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, even whole genome sequencing approaches tend to ignore tandem repeats due to the difficulty of mapping and interpreting reads in non-unique and highly variable parts of the genome. Finally, due to their multi-allelic nature and high mutation rate <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Ellegren1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, most tandem repeat variants are thought to be poorly tagged by nearby SNPs <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Burgner1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Recent estimates derived from studies of &#x0003e;1 million transmissions in large Icelandic pedigrees have shown the mutation rate for microsatellites to vary between 2.5&#x02013;3.5&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> for dinucleotide repeats, and 8.5&#x02013;15&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> for tetranucleotide repeats <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Similar estimates for the mutation rate of SNPs suggest between 1.2&#x02013;2.3&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>
<italic>de novo</italic> mutations per site per meiosis <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Kondrashov1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, several orders of magnitude lower than that of tandem repeats. As a result, it is likely that genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that typically rely on SNP genotyping approaches have yielded very little information for tandem repeat polymorphisms. Thus, tandem repeats represent a highly variable fraction of the genome that has been largely ignored by most high-throughput genomic technologies to date.</p><p>While microsatellite repeats have found common usage in linkage studies and forensics, several human disorders are known to be caused by extreme expansions of tandem repeats located within or near protein-coding genes <xref rid="pgen.1004418-LopezCastel1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This includes progressive myoclonus epilepsy involving <named-content content-type="gene">CCCCGCCCCGCG</named-content> expansions upstream <italic>CSTB</italic> [OMIM# 601145], Huntington disease caused by a CAG expansion within the coding region of <italic>HTT</italic> [OMIM# 143100], and Fragile X syndrome caused by a CGG expansion in the 5&#x02032;UTR of <italic>FMR1</italic> [OMIM# 300624]. In addition to causing disease, changes in the length of microsatellites can exert effects on gene function and quantitative traits <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Borel1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004418-Fondon1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and transcriptional plasticity <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Vinces1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Gemayel1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>In contrast to microsatellites, macrosatellites and multicopy genes are less well studied. Although the functions of most multicopy genes located in tandem arrays are poorly characterized, recent studies have begun to associate copy number variation (CNV) of several of these with human traits. For example, CNV of the antimicrobial <italic>&#x003b2;-defensin</italic> genes at 8q23 is associated with susceptibility to psoriasis <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Hollox1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Stuart1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and dynamics of HIV infection <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Hardwick1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, increased copy number of C4 protects against systemic lupus erythematosus <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, while copy number of tandemly repeated salivary amylase genes among different human populations is correlated with dietary starch consumption <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Perry1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In these cases, alterations in gene copy number apparently operate directly on phenotype via a proportionate change in the resulting mRNA and protein levels. However, due to technical problems in reliably genotyping high copy number sequences, there is significant controversy regarding the contribution of multicopy genes to common disease susceptibility <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Aldhous1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004418-Urban1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The conservation of some non-coding macrosatellites among primates, such as the DXZ4 repeat in Xq23, is suggestive of biological function <xref rid="pgen.1004418-McLaughlin1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. When combined with their extreme variability and high mutation rate, this has led to the notion that CNV of tandemly repeated loci represents a rich reservoir of genomic variation that allows for rapid adaptive evolution in response to environmental change <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Jansen1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004418-Vinces2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>In some cases, CNV of tandem repeat arrays has also been associated with epigenetic effects. For example, the promoter expansions of the CGG repeat that causes Fragile X are associated with silencing of <italic>FMR1</italic> via hypermethylation <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Verkerk1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. On a larger scale, contractions of the D4Z4 macrosatellite that contains the <italic>DUX4</italic> gene, in combination with a permissive haplotype background, underlie facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Statland1" ref-type="bibr">[reviewed in 40]</xref>. Reduced D4Z4 copy number is associated with a loss of DNA local methylation and heterochromatic histone marks <xref rid="pgen.1004418-vanOverveld1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, and is accompanied by an upregulation of local gene expression, although the mechanism causing this is unclear <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Gabellini1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. A similar phenomenon termed repeat induced gene silencing has been observed in several transgenic organisms <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Assaad1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004418-Garrick1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Repeat induced gene silencing was first observed when transgenes that were integrated into a target genome in large tandem arrays were expressed at very low levels, despite being present at high copy number. In contrast, a reduction of transgene number to just a few copies paradoxically often resulted in high transgene expression. Repeat induced gene silencing apparently operates via an epigenetic mechanism in which repeat sequences are converted to a heterochromatic state <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Ye1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.</p><p>In this study we have adapted Nanostring technology, a multiplexed digital counting method based on fluorescent barcodes initially developed for gene expression analysis <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Geiss1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, to study copy number variation of 173 multicopy genes, 2 intragenic coding repeats and 13 non-coding Macrosatellites. Here, we demonstrate the utility of Nanostring assays as a targeted approach that allows accurate tandem repeat genotyping even at extremely high copy number, and apply this technology to genotype 165 HapMap samples and five species of non-human primates. These data provide many novel biological insights into tandem repeat variations, including patterns of variation and linkage disequilibrium among different populations and evidence of selection during recent evolution. Our studies also identify strong correlations of macrosatellite copy number with local epigenetic marks and to a lesser extent with nearby gene expression, providing new evidence suggesting that repeat induced gene silencing might operate as a natural mechanism of gene regulation in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Probe Design and Validation of Data Quality</title><p>In order to identify multicopy genes with potential tandem architecture we utilized the &#x0201c;Join two Datasets&#x0201d; command in Galaxy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://usegalaxy.org/">https://usegalaxy.org/</ext-link>), using the complete list of RefSeq genes as the two input files, with gene name as the joined field. We filtered the output to only retain genes that had &#x0003e;1 copy at a non-overlapping position on the same chromosome or chr_random, identifying 180 putative multicopy genes in the hg18 reference assembly. We designed a custom Nanostring probe set targeting 173 of these genes, in addition to 13 non-coding macrosatellites and 2 intragenic coding repeats (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004418.s006">Table S1</xref>), and used this to genotype copy number in 165 HapMap individuals derived from three different ancestries (European, African and Asian) and five species of primates (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004418.s007">Table S2</xref>). Based on manual curation of the genome assembly, we estimate that 102 of the 188 loci assayed (54%) show a clear tandem structure, 28/182 (15%) show a dispersed architecture where the multiple copies are interspersed with unique sequence, while the remaining 31% of sites have a genomic organization that is unclear or is not well assembled (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p><p>We observed a strong association between features of poor genome assembly and these targeted loci. 33% (62 of 188) of our probes have one or more BLAT alignments of &#x02265;95% identity on a chr_random, and 34% (60 of 175 genic probes) lie within 50 kb of an assembly gap, representing a &#x0003e;27-fold enrichment compared with all RefSeq genes. In total, 86 of the 337 (26%) euchromatic assembly gaps in the hg18 assembly lay within 50 kb of a multicopy gene, suggesting that the highly repetitive and polymorphic nature of multicopy genes are a significant source of genome assembly errors. As a result, the true copy number of such regions is often highly under-represented in the genome assembly. While the mean number of BLAT alignments of our probes in the haploid hg18 was 5.4 (median&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3), the estimated mean diploid copy number of these loci in the 165 HapMap individuals was 22 (median&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;21.5).</p><p>To assess the reproducibility of Nanostring assays we first compared data generated from two independent probes, each of which target different parts of five genes that show highly variable copy numbers (<italic>CT47</italic>, <italic>TBC1D3</italic>, <italic>PRR20A</italic>, <italic>REXO1L1</italic>, and <italic>CCL3/CCL4</italic>).

We identify many interesting biological insights at these loci. This includes (i) extremely high levels of CNV among both different human populations and primate species; (ii) an almost universal lack of LD between CNV of these regions and nearby SNP markers, meaning that CNV of the vast majority of multicopy genes and macrosatellites is not tagged by flanking SNP markers, and that effective interrogation of these loci requires specific methods capable of effectively assaying these regions; (iii) significant associations between tandem repeat copy number and local gene expression and epigenetics; and (iv) signatures suggestive of positive selection acting at many of these loci. Thus, despite being largely ignored by most genome-wide studies, this class of genomic variation shows many features that suggest important functional effects.</p><p>Of particular note, our analysis identifies an example consistent with repeat induced gene silencing operating in normal human genomes associated with increased copy number of MSat10, a GC-rich 5.4 kb tandemly repeated motif located in 9q32 (chr9:114,862,000&#x02013;114,893,000). We observed a strong positive correlation between copy number of MSat10 and local DNA methylation level (R<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.76), together with a weaker but significant inverse correlation between MSat10 copy number and expression of the adjacent gene <italic>ZFP37</italic>, which lies 2 kb proximal to the repeat. ChIP-seq analysis also showed the presence of heterochromatic marks associated with MSat10 which extend proximally to <italic>ZFP37</italic>. Thus our data suggest heterochromatinization of the MSat10 locus at high repeat copy number with a resulting suppression of local gene expression. A similar inverse relationship was also observed between MSat12 copy number in 19p13.2 and expression of the adjacent gene <italic>ZNF558</italic>, which lies 24 kb distal to the repeat, although we did not detect any significant inter-individual variation of DNA methylation at this locus. Based on transgenic studies, it has been proposed that repeat induced gene silencing represents a system for the protection of eukaryotic genomes against hostile sequence elements that can integrate into the genome in high copy numbers, such as viruses and transposons <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Henikoff1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. However, our study suggests that repeat induced gene silencing also operates as a natural mechanism of gene regulation associated with tandem repeat tracts in normal genomes. While this study has focused only on the very largest tandem repeats present within the human genome, the high prevalence of tandemly repeated sequences in mammalian genomes means that repeat induced gene silencing may represent a more common mechanism of genetic regulation than is currently appreciated. In particular, as we have utilized gene expression data obtained from a single cell type (lymphoblastoid cell lines), our conclusions are limited to those genes that are expressed in this system. This fact likely underlies the relatively small number of genes that we observe that show auto-correlations of copy number and gene expression level. For example, for all other macrosatellites we profiled apart from MSat10 and MSat12, the closest genes expressed at measurable levels in lymphoblastoid cells were located &#x0003e;100 kb from the repeat. In contrast, <italic>ZFP37</italic> and <italic>ZNF558</italic> lie just 2 kb and 24 kb from the macrosatellites whose copy number they are inversely correlated with, respectively.</p><p>Notably we observed that the true copy number of many tandem repeat arrays is significantly under-represented even in the high quality &#x02018;finished&#x02019; human reference assembly. Most likely this is a result of mis-assembly artifacts which tend to result in the collapse of repeat sequences <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Bailey1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. One of the most extreme cases is that of the <italic>REXO1L1</italic> tandem array. The hg18 assembly contains eight assembled copies of this gene in 8q21.2, in addition to an 87.3 kb assembly gap and a further two unassembled copies on chr8_random. In contrast, our studies show that the &#x0223c;12.2 kb repeat containing the <italic>REXO1L1</italic> gene has a mean of 173 diploid copies in HapMap individuals. Our data therefore indicates that the true mean length of each haploid <italic>REXO1L1</italic> tandem array is therefore on the order of &#x0223c;1 Mb.

As such, we propose that genes present in highly variable tandem arrays represent strong candidates for variations in human phenotypes, including disease susceptibility. Our analysis demonstrates that the vast majority of such variants are not effectively tagged by nearby SNP markers, and thus CNV of multicopy genes and macrosatellites represents a class of genetic variation that is essentially invisible to conventional SNP-based GWAS. Such variants therefore represent an attractive candidate to account for a portion of the so-called &#x02018;missing heritability&#x02019; of the genome <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Eichler1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Manolio1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. Indeed, increased copy number of antimicrobial <italic>&#x003b2;-defensin</italic> genes has already been implicated as a risk factor for both psoriasis <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Hollox1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Stuart1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and HIV load <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Hardwick1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, associations which were only detected after targeted studies of <italic>&#x003b2;-defensin</italic> copy number were used. Although most are poorly studied, we note that many other genes present in multicopy arrays also have links with immune function, suggesting that CNV of these loci represents a potential candidate contributing towards the heritable risk of diseases with infectious or autoimmune components <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. We suggest that association studies that focus specifically on CNV of multicopy genes as risk factors for human phenotypes will be a fruitful line of future research. While the use of read depth from whole-genome sequencing can provide accurate estimates of gene copy number <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Sudmant1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, this approach is still expensive and the analysis time consuming. In contrast, Nanostring technology represents an attractive alternative for performing such studies, as it is a simple single tube assay that is capable of providing digital relative copy number estimates for dozens of loci at relatively low cost per sample, with a potential throughput of hundreds of samples per week. While Nanostring assays alone only give relative, and not absolute copy number counts, this information is not necessary for association studies, and inclusion of just a few samples of known copy number allows simple calibration to be performed.</p><p>Our analysis shows Nanostring assays represent a novel method that allows accurate estimation of high copy number sequences over a wide dynamic range, making this technology well suited for studies of high-copy sequences such as large tandem repeats. One limitation of this technology is that like many other methods it does not provide allelic copy number, instead simply giving a composite measure of total genomic copy number. As a result, our study likely under-estimates the true extent of allelic diversity at many tandemly repeated loci. Much more laborious methods such as PFGE <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Warburton1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, fiber FISH <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Perry1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> molecular combing <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Tessereau1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, or optical mapping approaches <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref> are currently the only reliable methods of estimating allelic copy numbers. Another limitation is the lack of information on genomic location. While many multicopy genes occur as tandem arrays at a single genomic locus, others are dispersed at different genomic locations. This fact could explain the lack of LD with neighboring SNP markers observed for some loci. Finally assay design for Nanostring probes requires prior knowledge of the sequence(s) to be targeted, and as it is based on hybridization, is unable to distinguish between highly identical paralogs. Because of the targeted nature of our probe design and the inherent limitations of the genome assembly, it is difficult to accurately assess what fraction of large tandem repeat arrays present in the human genome we have assayed in this study. While we have probably captured the majority of assembled large tandem repeats, it is also clear that there are other macrosatellites that we did not assay, e.g. the RNU2 locus <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Tessereau1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, and likely others that are not correctly represented in current genome assemblies. The future development of very long read sequencing technologies will be required in order to fully resolve the true structure of many tandemly repeated loci.</p><p>Our studies revealed multiple signatures that might indicate positive selection operating on multicopy genes. Firstly, among European, African and Asian populations we observed unusually high levels of divergence of copy number at many of the loci studied. Second, many multicopy genes also show highly divergent copy numbers among different primate species, with many loci showing &#x0003e;3-fold increases compared to the average in human. Of note, this in fact likely represents an under-estimate of the true human-primate divergence given the reduced hybridization efficiency of some probes that contain mismatches against different primate genomes. Third, we observed a significant excess of non-synonymous amino-acid changes in recent primate evolution at multicopy genes. Although when considered individually these signatures do not provide conclusive proof of altered selection, the fact that all three analyses yielded concordant results is suggestive of altered evolutionary pressures operating on both the copy number and protein sequence of many multicopy genes, which is consistent with either reduced selective constraint, or selection for proteins with altered functions. We note that previous studies of multicopy genes included in our analysis have also identified strong signatures of selection at several of these loci <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Perry1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Hardwick2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004418-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>. However, it should also be noted that measurements of amino acid divergence at many of the genes we included in our study could be confounded by the presence of multiple paralogs, and thus this requires future confirmation.</p><p>One further consequence of the presence of genes with multiple copies is that they readily provide a mechanism for acquiring divergent functions through the occurrence of subsequent coding or regulatory mutations in different copies <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Samonte1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>. For example, evolution of polychromatic color vision in primates occurred as a result of sequence divergence among different members of the tandemly arranged opsin gene family <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Nei1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Yokoyama1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>, and structural variation of the opsin gene cluster underlies red-green color blindness <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Jagla1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004418-Neitz1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. Thus, tandem gene arrays can both provide a substrate for the evolution of novel protein functions, and act as a reservoir of significant phenotypic variation within a population.</p><p>Although often ignored in genome-wide analyses, our data show that many large tandem repeats are extremely variable, and CNV even of non-coding tandem repeat loci can be associated with significant functional effects on the genome. We suggest that more detailed studies of tandem repeat loci will lead to many novel insights into their role in modulating both genomic and phenotypic diversity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Selection of Multicopy Genes</title><p>180 multicopy genes were identified by performing a self-join operation using RefSeq to identify genes that had &#x0003e;1 copy at a non-overlapping position on the same chromosome or chr_random.

Macrosatellites represented large tandem repeat regions, with repeat unit sizes varying from 1.8&#x02013;7.7 kb, each annotated with multiple copies in the reference genome. For each locus included on our probe design we performed visual assessment in the UCSC Genome Browser, comparing to annotations such as segmental duplications, RepeatMasker and gene structures. Based on this assessment we classified the local architecture as either (i) tandem (the multiple copies showed a clear serial arrangement), (ii) dispersed (no clear evidence of tandem structure), or (iii) the true architecture is unknown, (e.g. genes that had one mapped copy and a second unassembled copy on the corresponding chr_random). In total, we estimate that 102 of the 188 loci assayed (54%) show a clear tandem structure, 28/182 (15%) show a dispersed architecture, while the remaining 31% of sites have a genomic organization that is unclear or is not well assembled. Thus, overall, while the majority of sites we assayed represent tandem repeat variations, a significant fraction has a dispersed architecture, with multiple copies separated by large segments of intervening sequence.</p><p>We designed a custom Nanostring probe set targeting these 186 multicopy genes and macrosatellites, and included additional probes for <italic>SRY</italic> and an invariant X chromosome locus as gender controls.

Two probes (<italic>SCXB</italic> and <italic>TAF9B</italic>) yielded mean counts &#x0003c;100 across all HapMap individuals and were excluded from further analysis. Background subtraction was first performed on raw counts by subtracting the mean count of the eight negative control probes in each sample from the raw count of all test probes. The ten invariant autosomal probes were then used to derive a normalization factor for each sample to account for technical variables such as varying amounts of input DNA or hybridization efficiency between assays. The normalization factor per sample was derived by calculating the mean count of the ten invariant control probes in that individual divided by the mean count for all normalization probes across all samples. Raw counts for each of the 195 probes in each individual where then multiplied by the normalization factor for that sample to produce normalized probe counts, which were used in all downstream analysis. We defined copy number variable probes as those with either a coefficient of variation (CV) &#x02265;0.1 among the 165 HapMap samples, or those that had counts &#x02265;30% higher or lower than the population mean in &#x02265;2 individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Derivation of Absolute Copy Numbers</title><p>Each Nanostring probe provides a count that is directly proportional to copy number of the target sequence in that individual.

For each gene we extracted the corresponding copy number estimates from read depth data based on 85 individuals that were common to both studies. Where a gene or individual had more than one entry in read depth data we used the mean copy number. To ensure our approach was robust to noise in the individual estimates of copy number in read depth data, we calculated the median value for each Nanostring probe and the corresponding median copy number from read depth data in the 85 individuals tested. To convert Nanostring counts to absolute copy number, each NS count was divided by the corresponding median read depth value and multiplied with the corresponding median of the copy number estimate from the read depth data (as shown in the formula below), (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004418.s008">Table S3</xref>).<disp-formula id="pgen.1004418.e001"><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1004418.e001.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>Where, gi: a NS probe i, si: a NS sample i, CNreaddepth: estimated copy number from read depth data</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Linkage Disequilibrium Analysis</title><p>To assess the degree of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between copy number of loci targeted by each probe and flanking SNP markers, we performed correlation analyses between probe counts and SNP genotypes.

In the analysis considering CEU and YRI as a single group, we corrected the significance of the correlations for multiple testing through permutations.
