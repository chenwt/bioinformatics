Specifically, gain of function mutations in which the 600 valine residue of the BRAF kinase is substituted with glutamic acid (BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>) are present in ~40&#x000a0;% of patients presenting with malignant melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Survival is enhanced if detection, treatment and surgical excision occur when the tumor burden is restricted to a primary site; however, once the disease has metastasized to distant organs such as the lung, brain, bone, and liver, prognosis is poor, with a median survival of&#x02009;~&#x02009;9&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These dismal statistics are in part due to the intrinsic resistance of melanoma to platinum-based chemotherapeutics and its rapid acquisition of resistance to initial therapeutic interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Present treatment strategies involve small molecule inhibitors of this mutant BRAF kinase, such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, these therapies are only effective in a subset of patients: those that harbor the more prevalent BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and the less common BRAF<sup>V600K</sup> mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. While drugs targeting this specific isoform are among the most promising melanoma treatments, patients eventually relapse due to reactivation of the MAPK signaling cascade, specifically ERK activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. To overcome <italic>de novo</italic> resistance, a combinatorial treatment of vemurafenib with a MEK inhibitor is administered in an effort to combat reactivation of the MAPK pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, mechanisms that underlie acquired resistance after treatment with multiple inhibitors of this pathway remain elusive.</p><p>Drug resistance has been shown to be mediated by tissue architecture and cell-adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In particular, cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR) is an emergent phenotype associated with cell-cell adhesion or 2D adhesion to extracellular matrices. Myeloma cells cultured as monolayers that had adhered to fibronectin were resistant via upregulation of &#x003b1;4 &#x003b2;1 integrin compared to cells treated in suspension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Similarly, tumor cells grown as spheroids show increased resistance to therapy compared to the same cells that are dissociated and grown as monolayers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, the observed acquired drug resistance following multiple targeting of the MAPK pathway is not readily explained by CAM-DR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Because this reactivation attenuates drug response, it may also contribute to the development of acquired resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>The tumor microenvironment is emerging as a critical factor in malignant progression, metastasis and tumor etiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. To explore mechanisms that drive tumors to overcome and survive under unfavorable conditions, we aimed to delineate tumor-induced microenvironmental responses to the stress induced by drug therapeutics. Tumor cells actively modulate the host environment by secreting cytokines that reprogram stromal cells to change the extracellular matrix (ECM) milieu, thus creating a <italic>de novo</italic> microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. While immunotherapy and monoclonal antibodies targeting tumor angiogenesis have shown promising results, many microenvironmental targets remain underexplored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. For example, overexpression of secreted ECM proteins such as fibronectin (FN) has been found in several solid carcinomas, and postulated to be beneficial for tumor growth and instrumental in the establishment of an ideal microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, heterogeneous expression of ECM components within tumors has been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Pathologists have long associated the presence of abundant ECM proteins in tumors with poor prognosis and an expected dismal response to therapeutic intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Recently, a study showed that non-small cell lung cancer cells induced FN biogenesis via p38 MAPK in response to treatment with cetuximab (targeting the EGF receptor upstream of the MAPK signaling pathway) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This response was found to blunt the cytotoxic effects of cetuximab and reduced sensitivity to radiotherapy in in vitro and in vivo murine models. FN biogenesis may also reduce the efficacy of drugs targeting the BRAF kinase. Earlier observations found that a cocoon of ECM proteins, including FN, laminin, collagen IV and Tenascin C, protect small lung cancer cells from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. We hypothesized that melanoma cells modulate secretion of not only FN, but also other ECM molecules to survive drug treatment. An important question is whether baseline ECM expression per se can predict cell survival and drug resistance. Furthermore, is upregulation of ECM proteins a reaction to evolutionary pressure following drug treatment, the result of selection for pre-existing resistant subpopulations, or a combination of both? Seeking to identify and determine the temporal regulation of the secreted ECM proteins, we focused on two isogenic cell lines to mimic intratumoral heterogeneity. Our results indicate that tumor cells adjust their 3D microenvironment by modulating secretion of FN and Tenascin-C (TNC), thereby blunting the effects of MAPK pathway inhibition. We show that only clones that can modulate their ECM secretion in response to pharmaceutical stress survive. Mechanistically, FN biogenesis via p38 MAP kinase via &#x003b2;1 integrin is induced following pharmaceutical treatment of the MAPK signaling pathway. Also, our data suggests that biogenesis of TNC is an possible alternative to impaired FN production. This study indicates a critical role for <italic>de novo</italic> ECM biogenesis as a mechanism driving acquired resistance to drugs targeting MAPK signaling in cutaneous melanoma.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>Human melanoma cell lines, A375 (cat.

In addition, a scramble control (Scr) was made. These three cell lines were cultured in 3D using soft agar for 21&#x000a0;days before protein extraction. Immunoblots revealed that an approximately 80&#x000a0;% reduction of FN protein was found in shFN1 and shFN2 cell lines, compared to the Scr cells. However, the shFN1 and shFN2 cells did not show significant difference in ERK activation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). To determine if cell-ECM crosstalk was impaired with reduced FN biogenesis, we examined expression of integrins that facilitate cross talk with FN, and modulate cellular attachment to the ECM in vivo.

Cells grown in the presence of &#x003b2;1 integrin-blocking antibody, BRAF and p38 inhibitors produce drastically less FN (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). p38 MAPK and &#x003b2;1 integrin inhibition prevented malignant melanoma cells from modulating FN expression, which was shown to be essential in surviving pharmaceutical stress.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>FN assembly and Tenascin-C are mediated by p38 MAPK and &#x003b2;1 integrin. <bold>a</bold> Immunoblots reveal no change in FN levels (cell lysate and conditioned media) when p38 MAPK is inhibited. <bold>b</bold> Immunoblots reveal that &#x003b2;1 integrin modestly affects FN secretion, but significantly increases TNC in both cell lines (Scr and shFN2)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12885_2016_2211_Fig7_HTML" id="MO7"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Discussion</title><p>Treatment strategies for metastatic malignant melanoma have significantly improved due to our current understanding of the molecular basis of tumor etiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Targeted therapy based on BRAF V600E status has yielded dramatic results and disease regression has been observed. In spite of recent progress, the stark reality is that current treatments do not yet achieve durable responses due to melanoma intratumoral heterogeneity. The remodeling of the ECM results in changes within the microenvironment adding further complexity to the determinants of drug efficacy and the likelihood of acquired resistance. We present a novel mechanism by which cells tune their ECM secretion, namely FN via p38 MAPK &#x02013;&#x003b2;1 integrin, in response to pharmaceutical inhibition of the MAPK signaling pathway in cutaneous melanoma cell lines, especially in 3D culture system. Here we show that when FN biogenesis is impaired, increased TNC expression is observed, suggesting a compensatory mechanism to attenuate drug treatment. By using the A375 cell lines that mimic tumor heterogeneity, we determined that only clones that can modulate FN biogenesis survive pharmaceutical intervention. These results, in conjunction with similar observations in patient data, suggest a role for ECM biosynthesis in the emergence of <italic>de novo</italic> resistance.</p><p>Extracellular matrix proteins (ECMs) are often observed to be abundantly expressed by tumor cells in comparison to their normal counterparts. Analysis of patient data confirmed that overexpression of ECM proteins such as FN and TNC are likewise observed in patients that had acquired <italic>de novo</italic> resistance from initial drug therapies. Similar outcomes have been noted for breast, laryngeal, urothelial and non-small-cell lung cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Using proteomics and immunofluorescence, we determined a distinct temporal distribution of secreted ECM components and visualized the assembled ECM scaffold for two isogenic malignant melanoma clones. We determined that melanoma cells modulate the secretion of many ECM proteins that are also implicated as potential biomarkers for patients suffering from metastatic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Recently, ECM signatures were assigned to breast and ovarian tumors of differing metastatic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. These ECM signatures were not solely derived from the stromal cell secretions, but also included contributions from the tumor cells themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Here, we go a step further to follow the evolution of a melanoma-derived ECM signature. In particular, the secretion patterns of the two clones were significantly different with respect to relative amounts of FN, periostin, TNC, laminins and vitronectin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). FN also differed architecturally; fibrils were predominantly observed in one clone vs. globular scaffolds for the other (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). FN fibril assembly is regulated by tensional reorganization of actin via stress fibers for cells cultured in 2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Actin structures convey different mechanical properties based on spatial organization in 2D, and regulate specific motilities in 3D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Furthermore, cell motility regulates ECM remodeling and plays a role in the final architecture of the ECM scaffold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. These two cell lines show differential adhesion forces when placed in a 2D biomimetic platform simulating cell-ECM interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Additionally, differences in FN conformation dictate the availability of binding sites that affect signaling cascades associated with growth, migration and adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In our system, it remains to be seen if there is a difference in tensional regulation and whether globular vs. fibril conformations show differential drug sensitivity.</p><p>In this study, we observed that FN was differentially secreted and assembled when tumor cells harboring the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutation were cultured in 2D vs. in a biomimetic 3D platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In vivo, tumor cells have access to various sources of fibronectin, namely the plasma and stroma. As a surrogate basement membrane gel, the laminin-rich ECM contains several ECM proteins and cytokines, including minute amounts of FN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], However, previous studies have shown that FN-null cells poorly assemble FN fibrils when exogenous FN is added to them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. We confirmed that a reduced number of shFN cells assembled exogenous FN compared to Scr cells in in vivo and in vitro 3D culture (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Growth inhibition when FN has been compromised has also been observed for other types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. This was due in part to reduced expression of &#x003b2;1 integrin and alterations of the cell cycle; however, in our system the short hairpin did not alter the cell cycle or reduce &#x003b2;1 integrin levels. Melanoma-derived conditioned media was shown to stimulate in vivo FN expression in target organs preceding future metastatic lesions. This phenomenon was also attributed to resident fibroblasts that create the &#x0201c;pre-metastatic niche&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Our data suggests that metastatic melanoma also modulates its &#x0201c;tumor niche&#x0201d; by secreting and assembling its own ECM scaffold to survive drug treatment. Our results suggest that modulation of FN secretion serves as a response to external stress and may be separate from the remodeling of stromal components observed during initial malignant transformation.</p><p>Melanoma is largely resistant to platinum treatments since several factors such as drug uptake, increased efflux, extracellular interaction via cell adhesions and slow cycling cells may contribute to intrinsic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. In our system 3D architecture did mitigate drug efficacy, as only a partial killing was achieved for FN-null tumor aggregates and minimal FN secretion was observed in response to cisplatin.</p><p>It has been previously reported that activation of the ERK/MAP kinase in melanoma cells stimulates FN biogenesis via the early growth response-1 transcription factor (Egr-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. High FN and Egr-1 levels were found in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutant cells and patient tumors. However, stimulation of the ERK pathway was insufficient to induce FN biogenesis in normal melanocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Here, inhibition of the ERK pathway activates FN biogenesis via p38MAPK and &#x003b2;1 integrin signaling in melanoma cells but not in melanocytes. In a previous study, &#x003b2;1 integrin inhibition targeting FN has increased radio sensitization of breast tumor cells in 3D culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. However, non-malignant breast cells undergo apoptosis following treatment with a &#x003b2;1-integrin function-blocking antibody, whereas the malignant counterpart cells appear resistant to this treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Integrin blocking treatment is successful only if there is a differential response between normal tissue and its malignant counterpart. Thus, in addition to multiple targets of MAPK signaling, concomitant treatment with a p38 inhibitor may be a better strategy to prevent acquire drug resistance due to FN biosynthesis. However, in the case of metastatic disease, acute treatment with integrin-blocking antibodies may be useful to overcome <italic>de novo</italic> resistance. Nevertheless, alternative strategies to overcome FN mediated cell adhesion mediated drug resistance have been reported that could reverse drug resistance in leukemia and solid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p><p>In normal cells during early embryogenesis, FN provides a scaffold for the assembly of other ECM proteins to direct organ specificity and fate, so we reasoned that other ECM proteins would be altered when FN biogenesis is affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. In fact, we observed an increase in Tenascin-C biogenesis by shFN melanoma cells. Here, we show that drug treatment may induce ECM biosynthesis, contributing to <italic>de novo</italic> resistance. This must be considered when designing therapeutic interventions. Our findings suggest that modulation of tumor ECM biogenesis mimics the behavior of bacteria that assemble a biofilm in response to nutrient deficiencies, antibiotics and oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. This biofilm acts as a physical barrier and signaling reservoir to communicate sensing of deleterious conditions. Tumor cells may use this secreted &#x0201c;biofilm&#x0201d; to communicate and communally enter a state of dormancy until environmental conditions are more favorable. If we can understand the mechanisms underlying tumor biofilm assembly, we may be able to seize a novel opportunity for therapeutic intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we observed an increase in Tenascin-C biogenesis in melanoma cells expressing reduced level of fibronectin, suggesting a compensatory mechanism in response to drug treatment.
