We used mRNA sequencing to analyze genome-wide gene expression patterns in brain frontal cortex in three pairs of domesticated and wild species (dogs and wolves, pigs and wild boars, and domesticated and wild rabbits). We compared the expression differences with those between domesticated guinea pigs and a distant wild relative (<italic>Cavia aperea</italic>) as well as between two lines of rats selected for tameness or aggression towards humans. There were few gene expression differences between domesticated and wild dogs, pigs, and rabbits (30&#x02013;75 genes (less than 1%) of expressed genes were differentially expressed), while guinea pigs and <italic>C. aperea</italic> differed more strongly. Almost no overlap was found between the genes with differential expression in the different domestication events. In addition, joint analyses of all domesticated and wild samples provided only suggestive evidence for the existence of a small group of genes that changed their expression in a similar fashion in different domesticated species. The most extreme of these shared expression changes include up-regulation in domesticates of <italic>SOX6</italic> and <italic>PROM1</italic>, two modulators of brain development. There was almost no overlap between gene expression in domesticated animals and the tame and aggressive rats. However, two of the genes with the strongest expression differences between the rats (<italic>DLL3</italic> and <italic>DHDH</italic>) were located in a genomic region associated with tameness and aggression, suggesting a role in influencing tameness. In summary, the majority of brain gene expression changes in domesticated animals are specific to the given domestication event, suggesting that the causative variants of behavioral domestication traits may likewise be different.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Over the millennia, humans have turned a range of wild animal species into what we today know as domesticated animals. Domestication has greatly influenced human history and evolution. The changes in the animals are even more drastic. Domesticated animals differ from their wild relatives in appearance, physiology, and behavior. Although these differences are mostly genetically encoded, little is known about which genes contribute to these domestication traits. Changes in gene expression have long been proposed to lead to phenotypic changes in evolution. In this work, we therefore compared gene expression in brains of dogs and wolves, pigs and boars, and domesticated and wild rabbits and guinea pigs. For each of the four domesticated species, we identify gene expression differences that could correlate with behavioral differences compared to wild animals. The majority of expression differences are unique to each domestication event, suggesting that domestication has proceeded through different genetic routes in different species.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the Max Planck Society and a European Research Council grant (233297, TWOPAN) to SP.

Gene expression differences between domesticated and wild animals could therefore be important contributors to domestication-specific features.</p><p>As a first step towards identifying such changes, we set out to characterize gene expression in four pairs of domesticated and wild mammals: dogs and wolves, pigs and boars, domesticated and wild rabbits, and domesticated guinea pigs and a relatively distant ancestor (<italic>Cavia aperea</italic>), making use of recent advances in transcriptome sequencing (&#x0201c;RNA-seq&#x0201d; <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Mortazavi1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Nagalakshmi1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>). Because our interest is primarily in behavioral aspects of domestication, we analyzed mRNA levels in the brain. We also study brain gene expression in two lines of rats that have been selected for more than 60 generations for tame and aggressive behavior towards humans <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Albert1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.

At a nominal significance cutoff of p&#x0003c;0.05, hundreds of such genes were found (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002962-t005">Table 5</xref>). However, because thousands of genes are analyzed, some fraction of genes is expected to meet the above criteria simply by chance. Therefore, random permutations are typically used to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR). A complication arises in estimating FDR for the apparent domestication-related genes. Most random permutations of the domestication factor reduce the expression differences between domesticated and wild animals within each species pair that are present in the real data. For the across-pair domestication p-value, random permutations are therefore biased towards larger p-values, resulting in an anticonservative test. The complication can in principle be overcome by only using &#x0201c;extreme&#x0201d; permutations where all domesticated and wild animals within a species pair are exchanged. The magnitude of within-pair differences then remains intact, while only their direction is permuted relative to the other species pairs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002962.s013">Note S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002962.s008">Figure S3</xref> provide a detailed discussion of this effect.

We asked if apparent domestication-related genes from the joint dog, pig and rabbit analyses predict expression change in domesticated guinea pigs. We selected the 209 genes that had nominally significant (p&#x0003c;0.05) p-values for the domestication factor in the three models in the joint analyses of dogs, pigs and rabbits, and whose expression differs from wild animals in the same direction in these three domesticated species. At 150 of the 202 orthologues that were expressed in guinea pigs, <italic>C. porcellus</italic> differed from <italic>C. aperea</italic> in the same direction as the other domesticated animals differed from their respective wild relatives (one-sided FET: odds ratio&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;11.4, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;7e-14). This degree of overlap was stronger than in gene sets of the same size derived from the three possible extreme permutations (odds ratios&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.6, 2.7 and 3.0). Similar expression of these 150 genes in domesticated compared to wild animals (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002962.s004">Dataset S4</xref> for a complete list) was not an artifact caused by transcript sequence differences between wild animals and the reference genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002962.s014">Note S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002962.s010">Figure S5</xref>).

As expected given the large differences between the two cavy species, their addition increased the magnitude and significance of the fraction of variance explained by domestication (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002962-t005">Table 5</xref>). Adding a fourth pair doubles the number of possible extreme permutations to seven. The real data produced more domestication-related genes than these permutations, but again to a small degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002962-g003">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002962.s011">Figure S6</xref>).</p><p>In sum, there is suggestive and tentative evidence for some degree of shared gene expression differences associated with domestication in these four domesticated species. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002962-g004">Figure 4</xref> shows the four most extreme genes with shared expression among domesticated dogs, pigs, rabbits and guinea pigs.

These quantitative trait loci (QTL) are large and contain many genes. Genes with expression differences in the brain in these QTL may contribute to tameness. A major tameness QTL on chromosome one contained two DE genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002962-g005">Figure 5C</xref>): delta-like protein 3 (<italic>DLL3</italic>) is the most significant DE gene with higher expression in the aggressive rats, while dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (dimeric) (<italic>DHDH</italic>) is the third-most significant of these genes. <italic>DLL3</italic> in particular has drastically lower expression in the tame rats, corresponding to a 45-fold expression difference. We next asked whether these two genes are located in regions of the QTL that may have experienced positive selection during the artificial selection for tameness and aggression. For this comparison, we used published DNA sequence data from all exons in the QTL region from the four tame and the four aggressive founder animals of the pedigree used to identify the QTL <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Albert3" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. <italic>DLL3</italic> is close to a region where the tame, but not the aggressive founders have no sequence diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002962-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). <italic>DHDH</italic> is directly on the border of a similar region.

Gene expression differences between domesticated animals and their close wild ancestors were overall small in magnitude, and only a few dozen genes were differentially expressed. We aimed to put these expression differences in context by comparing them to those between domesticated guinea pigs and a more distantly related wild species of cavy and to two lines of rats that were selected for tame and aggressive behavior towards humans as a model for animal domestication <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Albert2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The dog, pig and rabbit comparisons fell in between these two extremes, as expected given most gene expression change accumulates over evolutionary time in parallel with sequence divergence <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Khaitovich1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1002962-Brawand1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. The most parsimonious explanation for this correlation is that most observed gene expression differences between species are selectively neutral or nearly neutral <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Khaitovich2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> or constrained by negative selection <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Gilad1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Most of the gene expression changes between domesticated and wild animals are therefore unlikely to have been individually positively selected. In line with this view, expression changes in dogs, pigs and rabbits did not significantly overlap with regions under positive selection associated with domestication, suggesting that the expression changes were not individually driven by positive selection at <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sites. The expression changes may be caused by genetic differences in <italic>trans</italic>, neutral differences in <italic>cis</italic>, and/or physiological correlates of domestication. We suggest that at present, the differentially expressed genes are best described as domestication phenotypes, i.e. consequences rather than cause of other domestication traits.</p><p>The correlation between expression divergence and evolutionary distance was further corroborated by the sequence variation data we extracted from the RNASeq data, an increasingly common strategy <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Cnovas1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1002962-Carneiro1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. For this paper, we have chosen to focus our sequence analyses on genome-wide summary statistics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002962-t002">Table 2</xref>). More detailed analyses of these sequence data are reported elsewhere (<xref rid="pgen.1002962-Carneiro1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref> and Carneiro, Albert <italic>et al.</italic>, submitted). For all comparisons but the distantly related guinea pigs, there was allele sharing at more than 41% of the identified SNVs, illustrating the very recent population splits between domesticated and wild animals. The sequence data also showed reduced genetic variation in domesticated compared to wild dogs, rabbits and guinea pigs, as expected from domestication-associated bottlenecks <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Carneiro2" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1002962-LindbladToh1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. By contrast, the pigs had higher genetic diversity than the boars (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002962-t002">Table 2</xref>). While counterintuitive at first glance, this result is consistent with the literature <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Ojeda1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Specifically, the domesticated pigs we sampled derived from a three-breed cross population from breeds Hampshire&#x000d7;Yorkshire&#x000d7;Swedish Landrace. Some European domesticated pigs (including Landrace <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Amaral1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>) derive from historical admixture between Asian and European pigs <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Giuffra1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. In addition, European wild boars have lower genetic diversity than Asian wild boars <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Larson2" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, possibly due to historical population bottlenecks <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Amaral1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. Therefore, the hybrid origin of our domesticated pig samples explains their relatively high nucleotide diversity. Finally, the sequence data clearly show that <italic>C. aperea</italic> is too divergent from domesticated guinea pigs to be the direct wild ancestor. This finding supports earlier studies of the mitochondrial <italic>cytochrome b</italic> gene in cavies <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Dunnum1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Spotorno1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, while being based on a much larger set of genetic markers across the entire genome.</p><p>The domesticated species we analyzed are separated from each other by millions of years of evolution and have been domesticated at different times, on different continents, and probably for different purposes. Today, dogs are primarily kept as companion or working animals, pigs for meat production, while rabbits and guinea pigs serve both purposes. These different uses likely entailed different selection pressures acting on each of these domesticated species. At the same time, all domesticated animals, including those sampled here, share a range of similarities. These include variation in coat color and morphology, reduced cranial capacity, and gracile skeletons as well as a suite of behavioral traits including reduced aggression and tolerance of human presence. We therefore examined whether parallel patterns in brain gene expression exist among different domesticated species.</p><p>The results show that on a gene-by-gene level, the overlap of genes that differ between the species pairs is minimal, and for the most part not predictive of the direction of expression change. The correlations between the gene expression differences across all genes were, although always positive, not stronger than expected by chance (with the exception of dogs and guinea pigs where there were marginal similarities). In the joint ANOVA, less than 5% of gene expression variance across genes was explained by domestication. Because all comparisons between species pairs were performed exclusively on 1&#x02236;1 orthologues (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), the results are restricted to genes that have not experienced gene duplication events during the long evolutionary timescales that separate the domesticated species studied here. If domestication has similarly affected the expression of a gene in two species where the ancestral gene was duplicated along one or both lineages, we would miss this instance of sharing. Similarly, we relied on publicly available gene annotation that very likely is of variable quality in the species we studied. Some real instances of sharing between domesticated animals may be missed if the corresponding gene is wrongly or not at all annotated in one or both species.</p><p>Two observations prevent a complete rejection of shared gene expression differences among domesticates. First, apparent &#x0201c;domestication-related&#x0201d; genes identified among dogs, pigs and rabbits did significantly predict the direction of expression differences between domesticated guinea pigs and <italic>C. aperea</italic>. Second, more genes reached significant domestication p-values in the actual data than in extreme permutations where only the direction of the differences in each species pair is switched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002962-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Because only few extreme permutations are possible with the four pairs studied here, this result does not constitute a stringent significance test. Unfortunately, adding more pairs is currently not practical since high-quality tissue samples from close wild relatives of many domesticated animals are difficult or impossible to obtain because the wild animals are extinct, endangered, and/or live in remote areas. From the presently available data, we conclude that there is at most suggestive evidence for shared expression differences.</p><p>Nevertheless, the potential role of expression change at genes with the strongest evidence for sharing appears interesting. For example, the genes <italic>SOX6</italic> and <italic>PROM1</italic> have different expression in the same direction in all four domesticated species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002962-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Both genes play roles in brain development, suggesting that their altered expression in domesticates may reflect differences in the development or maturation of the frontal cortex in domesticated animals. This possibility is especially intriguing since one feature of animal domestication is &#x0201c;neoteny&#x0201d;, the retention of juvenile traits and behaviors into adulthood <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Trut1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Price1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The altered expression of development-related genes may reflect anatomical differences between domesticated and wild animals that are in turn due to delayed or arrested cortical development in domesticated animals. It would be interesting to study how brain anatomy and gene expression develop during ontogeny in domesticated and wild species.</p><p>So far, we considered the hypothesis that the expression levels of a common set of genes have changed in animal domestication. There is a possibility that expression change at different genes may still affect the same or similar biological pathways or functions. However, the DE genes in the different domestication events were enriched for a variety of functional categories that did not show obvious overlap among the species comparisons. One possible exception are functional categories related to the immune system, which showed enrichment in genes with higher expression in dogs, pigs, guinea pigs and the tame rats. As the individual animals used here were matched for environment wherever possible, it is unlikely that these similarities are simply due to similar exposure to infectious agents in these individuals. Genes involved in the immune system generally evolve rapidly <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Nielsen1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, making the immune system a likely target of modification during the relatively short time span of domestication. In addition, animal domestication entailed shifts towards more crowded living conditions in herds and/or increased exposure to humans and other domesticated species <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Diamond1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Domesticated animal species are therefore likely to have become exposed to particularly strong selection pressures on their immune systems, perhaps resulting in elevated expression of some immune-system genes.</p><p>In spite of the lack of strong overlap between domesticated events, some of the genes that differ in just one of the pairs were interesting. For example, the <italic>KIT</italic> gene was more highly expressed in pigs than in boars. Genetic variants in <italic>KIT</italic> cause coat color differences in a wide range of species, including domesticated pigs <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Marklund1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, horses <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Haase1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and cattle <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Hayes1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Differential expression of this coat color locus in the brain is noteworthy because genetic variants that influence coat color are sometimes thought to also influence aggression <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Cottle1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1002962-Keeler1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>, leading to the idea that selection for tameness may have caused the rich variation in coat color in domesticated animals as a side effect <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Trut1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Although such a genetic link between tameness and white coat spotting was not found in the tame and the aggressive rats <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Albert2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, there remains a possibility that coat color and behavioral differences between pigs and boars may be connected via differential expression of the <italic>KIT</italic> gene.</p><p>We identified 28 genes that differ in expression between the tame and the aggressive rats. The rats have been selected for more than 60 generations for their behavioral response towards humans, with the goal of modeling the early steps of animal domestication in an experimentally controlled fashion <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Albert2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Today, the rats differ drastically in their behavior. Tame rats show no fear towards humans and can easily be handled, while the aggressive rats vigorously attack humans at any attempts of handling. In the context of the present study, the tame rats are therefore of particular interest as they provide a model where only one of the traits that characterize domesticated animals was selected, and where environmental influences were strictly controlled both in the actual animals used in the study and during the entire course of selection. The only DE gene that overlapped between the rats and any domesticated species is <italic>PDILT</italic>, which encodes an enzyme that acts as a chaperone in the endoplasmatic reticulum in testis <xref rid="pgen.1002962-vanLith1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>. Its function in the brain is not known. Further, <italic>PDILT</italic> has lower expression in the tame rats than the aggressive rats, but higher expression in domesticated than in wild rabbits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002962-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002962.s002">Dataset S2</xref>), whereas an expression difference causing tameness in the rats and rabbits would be expected to be in the same direction. The nearly complete absence of overlap between the genes that differ in expression between domesticated and wild animals and the tame and aggressive rats suggests that a simple universal relationship between tameness and cortical gene expression does not exist. We can however not rule out that expression differences in brain regions other than cortex (e.g. the thalamus/hypothalamus <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Saetre1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Ntt1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref> or the amygdala <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Saetre1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>) may be more correlated between the rats and domesticated animals, and among other domesticated animals.</p><p>Notably, two of the most differentially expressed genes between the tame and the aggressive rats were located in a previously identified QTL that influences tameness and aggression in these rats <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Albert2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. <italic>DLL3</italic> is an orthologue of the <italic>Drosophila Delta</italic> gene, the ligand of the Notch protein which is involved in developmental patterning of the embryo <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Bulman1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>. The function of <italic>DLL3</italic> in adult brain is not known. <italic>DHDH</italic> is a member of the family of dihydrodiol dehydrogenases, which catalyze reactions in the metabolism of xenobiotics and sugars <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Carbone1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. Within the QTL region, both of these two genes were either close to (<italic>DLL3</italic>) or inside (<italic>DHDH</italic>) regions where the tame founder animals of the pedigree used to map the QTL have no sequence variation <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Albert3" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. This pattern of no sequence variation in tame but not aggressive rats may indicate that these regions could have experienced positive selection for tameness during the artificial selection <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Albert3" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, . Stronger selection in tame than in aggressive rats is consistent with the fact that the tame rats differ more in behavior from wild-caught controls than the aggressive rats <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Konoshenko1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. Further, the causative variant at this tameness QTL was estimated to be fixed among the tame founder rats, but to segregate among the aggressive rats <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Albert3" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. In sum, <italic>DLL3</italic> and <italic>DHDH</italic> are good candidates for influencing tameness and aggression in the rats based on their differential expression in brain and their location in the major tameness QTL in the rats. Future work will need to clarify whether the expression differences at these two genes are heritable, and whether altered expression of these two genes in the brain has functional consequences. Similarly, the gene <italic>SNCG</italic>, while not located in a tameness QTL, was previously linked to aggressive behavior in rats <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Pinhasov1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. <italic>SNCG</italic> is a member of the synucleins, a group of proteins that influence dopamine and glutamate release in the brain <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Pinhasov1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>.

The respective differences were mostly independent from each other. An important question for future research will be if the genetic variants that cause similar traits in different domestication events (e.g. in behavior or physiology) are similarly species-specific.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals and tissue collection</title><p>Brain frontal cortex tissue was obtained from dogs, wolves, domesticated and wild pigs, guinea pigs and rabbits, and from genetically tame and aggressive rats.

Second, for each gene a dispersion parameter is determined that takes into account biological variation between samples. The dispersion parameter is either estimated from a function first fit to all genes that relates the abundance of a gene to its expected dispersion, or directly from the variation observed between replicates. Third, a negative binomial distribution is fit to the counts for each gene.

For each gene, the median expression level across all samples was used to control for both transcript length and mRNA abundance differences between genes. GO annotation was extracted from Ensembl version 59 using Biomart. For each gene, Biomart by default only reports the terminal (i.e. most specific) GO terms of the GO graph, potentially leading to a loss of power to detect enrichment in terms higher up in the GO hierarchy. Therefore, custom scripts were used to supplement the GO annotation with all GO terms that are parents of the terms provided by Ensembl. For dogs, pigs, rabbits and rats, genes with a nominally significant (p&#x0003c;0.05) expression difference were tested versus all expressed genes.

The resulting gene numbers are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002962.s015">Table S1</xref>. First, for each pair of domestication events, one-sided FET was used to ask if DE genes were shared between domestication events. The underlying contingency table for the FET was constructed by dividing the genes into those genes that are 1) DE in both events (<italic>e.g.</italic> differed significantly both between dogs and wolves as well as between pigs and boars), 2) and 3) DE in one event but not the other, and 4) DE in neither event.</p><p>The first test is blind to the direction of expression change: a gene that is significantly higher in dogs than in wolves but significantly lower in pigs than in boars would be counted as &#x0201c;shared&#x0201d;. To take into account the direction of expression change, FET was used to test if genes that are DE in one domestication event are more likely to change in the same direction in a second event than all expressed genes. Whether a gene was also DE in the second species was not a criterion for this test. The contingency table for this test was constructed by dividing all 1&#x02236;1 orthologues for the given domestication events as follows. The first group comprises genes that are DE in event 1 and have expression change in the same direction in the two events (<italic>i.e.</italic> up in dogs and up in pigs, or down in dogs and down in pigs). The second group comprises genes that are DE in event 1, but have expression change in the second species in the opposite direction (<italic>i.e.</italic> up in dogs but down in pigs or <italic>vice versa</italic>). The third group comprises genes that are not DE in event 1, but changed in the same direction in the two events. Finally, the fourth group comprises the genes that are not DE in event 1, and changed in different directions in the two events. For this test, an odds ratio of one indicates that DE genes in event 1 are as likely to have changed in the same direction in the two events as genes that are not DE in event 1. Odds ratios larger than one indicate that DE genes in event 1 predict the direction of expression change in event 2. Note that this test takes into account overall differences in expression direction, <italic>i.e.</italic> if more genes are more highly expressed in domesticates in both events, the test asks if being DE in event 1 provides additional information about expression direction in event 2. Further note that this test is asymmetric: while DE in event one may predict expression direction in event 2, the inverse is not necessarily true because different genes can be DE in event 2 than in event 1. We therefore conducted this test twice for each pair of domestication events, once with each event serving as &#x0201c;event 1&#x0201d; (e.g. the test was run once using dog DE genes to test for shared direction in pigs, and once using pig DE genes to test for shared direction in dogs). <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002962-t003">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002962-t004">Table 4</xref> report only the result from the more significant of these two test directions.</p><p>Finally, the third test for pairwise similarities among pairs of domestication events were Spearman rank correlations between median expression differences across all expressed 1&#x02236;1 orthologues, irrespective of whether or not the genes were DE.

The resulting set comprised 6,901 genes. To assess the significance of the influence of species pair, sex and domestication on gene expression, we performed 1,000 random permutations separately for each factor. The p-value for the influence of a given factor is the fraction of permutations where the median variance explained in the non-permuted data is matched or exceeded. When testing the species pair effect, we randomly assigned each individual to a species. For the sex and domestication effects, we permuted the samples <italic>within</italic> their respective species pair. This strategy was chosen because the differences between species pairs were much larger than the other effects; if domestication and sex effects were permuted randomly across all samples, they would by chance in some permutations be correlated with the species pair factor, which results in artificially high estimates of that factor's effect in the permuted data.

The observed odds ratios were compared to those obtained from the &#x0201c;extreme&#x0201d; permutations described above. To ensure equally sized gene sets irrespective of the significance cutoff in the extreme permutations, we ranked the genes according to domestication p-value in the edgeR, variance-stabilized and FPKM-based analyses, and selected genes with 1) the highest summed ranks among either or both of these models (<italic>i.e.</italic> the most significant genes), 2) common direction of expression among the domestics in the given permutation, and 3) an expressed orthologue in the target comparison. The number of selected genes was set to match those found in the real data (e.g. 209 genes for comparing guinea pigs to the other pairs).</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Obtaining sequence polymorphism data from RNA&#x02013;seq data</title><p>Given RNA-seq data consists of cDNA sequences, we reasoned that it would be possible to identify single nucleotide variants (SNVs) that segregate in the respective populations, and, where sequence coverage is high, call diploid genotypes for individual samples. To ensure high quality of the genotypes, we applied a series of filters. First, we mapped all reads against the respective genomes using BWA <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>, an alignment program that reports mapping quality scores and is able to identify small insertions/deletions (indels) (but is not able to detect spliced reads, making it less ideal for gene expression quantification). Second, to avoid PCR duplicates, we collapsed molecules with identical mapping coordinates, keeping only the read with the highest mapping quality. Third, we trimmed the first and last six bases from each aligned molecule, to avoid sequence errors that can be caused by nonrandom composition of the hexamer pools used during cDNA synthesis, and consequent overwriting of the transcript sequence <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Hansen1" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>. Fourth, we kept only alignments with mapping quality &#x0003e;30 and &#x02264;2 mismatches to the reference.</p><p>Lists of SNV positions were extracted from merged filtered alignment files from all individuals per species pair (combining domesticated and wild animals), excluding sites with &#x0003c;8 supporting reads, with &#x02265;2 SNVs within a window of 10 bp and within 10 bp of an indel, and sites within repetitive regions (as identified by the repeat masker track from the UCSC genome browser). The individuals were then separately interrogated for their genotypes at these SNV positions. We accepted genotypes produced by samtools <xref rid="pgen.1002962-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref> if sequence coverage for the given individual was &#x02265;8, consensus quality &#x02265;30, RMS mapping quality &#x02265;25, a maximum of 2 SNVs were present within 10 bp, and the distance to an indel was at least 10 bp. Otherwise, the respective genotype was set to be unknown.</p><p>In addition to extracting genotypes at specific SNV positions (referred to as &#x0201c;SNV data&#x0201d;), we also called consensus sequences at all positions in ensembl-annotated exons for each individual, using the same set of filters (referred to as &#x0201c;exome data&#x0201d;).</p></sec><sec id="s4k"><title>Sequence analyses</title><p>Only data from sequence positions where all samples in the given comparison had high-quality consensus genotypes were used. Population divergences were calculated from the exome data as the fraction of nucleotides that differ between any two members of the two populations. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002962-t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002962-g002">Figure 2B</xref> show the median of these fractions per comparison. Nucleotide diversity (&#x003c0;) was calculated using the program &#x0201c;compute&#x0201d;. Principal component analysis was performed using the R function &#x0201c;prcomp&#x0201d; on SNV data converted to numerical values (e.g. AA&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0; AT&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1; TT&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1002962.s001"><label>Dataset S1</label><caption><p>Full details on samples and sequencing runs performed for this study.</p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1002962.s001.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1002962.s002"><label>Dataset S2</label><caption><p>Differentially expressed genes.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1002962.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1002962.s003"><label>Dataset S3</label><caption><p>GO enrichment results.</p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1002962.s003.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1002962.s004"><label>Dataset S4</label><caption><p>Domestication-related genes.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1002962.s004.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1002962.s005"><label>Dataset S5</label><caption><p>Gene expression values used in the analyses, stored as R objects.</p><p>(ZIP)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1002962.s005.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1002962.s006"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>PCA of gene expression variation.
