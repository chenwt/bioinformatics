These pro-sequences play multifunctional roles including the capacity to specifically inhibit their own as well as other C1A protease activities from diverse origin. In this study, it is analysed the potential role of C1A pro-regions from barley as regulators of cysteine proteases in target phytophagous arthropods (coleopteran and acari). The <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibitory action of these pro-sequences, purified as recombinant proteins, is demonstrated. Moreover, transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing different fragments of <italic>HvPap-1</italic> barley gene containing the pro-peptide sequence were generated and the acaricide function was confirmed by bioassays conducted with the two-spotted spider mite <italic>Tetranychus urticae</italic>. Feeding trials resulted in a significant reduction of leaf damage in the transgenic lines expressing the pro-peptide in comparison to non-transformed control and strongly correlated with an increase in mite mortality. Additionally, the analysis of the expression levels of a selection of potential mite targets (proteases and protease inhibitors) revealed a mite strategy to counteract the inhibitory activity produced by the C1A barley pro-prodomain. These findings demonstrate that pro-peptides can control mite pests and could be applied as defence proteins in biotechnological systems.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Financial support from the Ministerio de Econom&#x000ed;a y Competitividad of Spain (project AGL2011-23650) is gratefully acknowledged.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Among 20&#x02013;30,000 genes encoded by a plant genome, almost one thousand correspond to proteases, and more than one hundred belong to the 15 known families of cysteine-proteases (CysProt) [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The papain C1A family is the most abundant and its members are divided in cathepsin L-, B-, H- and F-like subgroups [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. C1A protease group is extensively present in land plants, with members ranking from 32 in Arabidopsis to 45 in rice. In barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>), the whole CysProt C1A family encoding 41 non-redundant genes has been identified and its participation in different physiological processes has been reported [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Individual C1A protease members are involved in a variety of proteolytic and physiological processes in plants such as senescence, abscission, programmed cell death, fruit ripening, pollen development, and the mobilization of proteins accumulated in seeds and tubers [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Besides, their implication in local and systemic defense responses against pathogens and pests has been also published [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. All C1A proteins contain several disulphide bonds and share a conserved catalytic triad formed by a cysteine, a histidine and an asparagine. C1A peptidases from plants are synthesized as pre-proenzymes in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the signal peptide is removed. Then, via the trans-Golgi network they are transported to lytic vacuoles, senescent-associated vacuoles and lysosomes, or externally secreted [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128323.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Alternatively, C1A protease precursors are stored in ER-derived organelles (endosperm-cotyledon-embryo ricinosomes and protein bodies) from where they are released upon acidification of the cytoplasm [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128323.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128323.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The relatively acidic pH of these compartments provides the optimal conditions for protease processing and activation by removing of the N-terminal pro-peptide.</p><p>The C1A N-terminal pro-peptides, of 130&#x02013;160 amino acids long, are involved in the inhibition of their cognate enzyme, participate in the correct subcellular location of the protease and assist in folding of the mature enzyme [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128323.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The pro-peptides contain the non-contiguous ERFNIN signature found in cathepsin L- and H-like or the ERFNAQ variant in cathepsin F-like, while cathepsin B-like proteases lack this motif [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128323.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Interestingly, C1A pro-peptides from different species, including plants, have the capacity to inhibit several exogenous C1A peptidases [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Molecular modelling of three-dimensional protein structures has shown that most of the specific inhibitory properties of barley pro-peptides are determined from their interactions with the mature proteases [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic> assays and artificial diets using the recombinant pro-region of the papaya proteinase IV have demonstrated a selective inhibition of digestive CysProt from several phytophagous beetles [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Similarly, pro-regions from two plant pest species, the nematode <italic>Heterodera glycines</italic> and the bean bruchid <italic>Acanthoscelides obtectus</italic>, efficiently inhibited their own CysProt and proteases from other herbivory species [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128323.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the CysProt pro-region from <italic>H</italic>. <italic>glycines</italic> expressed in soybean roots conferred protection against the cyst nematode infestation [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In this context, the development of protease inhibitors with strong specific inhibitory effects to the targeted organism represents a worthwhile but challenging task. The specificity of the pro-peptide inhibition is a crucial feature to be applied as regulators of CysProt in biotechnological systems. Therefore, plant protease pro-regions can be powerful tools for pathogen and pest control acting in similar way than the specific inhibitors of CysProt known as cystatins [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128323.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Phytophagous insect and acari rely on digestive proteases, carbohydrases and lipases to become macromolecules in absorbable end-products. The pH and redox potential of insect/acari guts determine the optimal conditions for enzyme activity and the quality and quantity of nutrients that can be digested. Among arthropod pests the gut pH is in the slightly acidic to neutral range, with the exception of the alkaline midgut of lepidopteran or the acidic specific regions of midgut of hemipteran and dipteran [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Accordingly, the proteolytic activity profile in phytophagous coleopteran and acari species have shown the presence of CysProt as the most important digestive enzymes in their guts with a 5.0&#x02013;7.0 pH range [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Focusing on phytophagous acari, the polyphagous two-spotted spider mite <italic>Tetranychus urticae</italic> (Acari: Tetranychidae) is one of the most devastating agriculture pest worldwide. It feeds on more than 150 crop species, including a wide range of greenhouse and annual and perennial field cultivars [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The fight against <italic>T</italic>. <italic>urticae</italic> is affected by: its quick development of pesticide resistance due to its short generation time and high population rate [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]; the scarce existence of resistant plant cultivars, and their resistance to Bt toxins expressed in transgenic plants [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The recent annotation of the spider mite genome has allowed identifying a large proliferation of gene families associated with digestion and detoxification of plant secondary compounds [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The proteolytic digestion of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>urticae</italic> is based mostly on CysProt activities, which is consistent with the strong proliferation of the C1A papain and C13 legumain CysProt gene families found in its genomic sequence [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>In this study, it is analyzed the <italic>in vitro</italic> insecticidal/acaricide capabilities of CysProt pro-regions purified as recombinant proteins against important phytophagous coleopteran and acari.

Now, to obtain further insights on the protective role of these C1A pro-sequences, we selected phytophagous coleopteran and acari species, whose CysProt are the main digestive enzymes in their guts [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128323.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128323.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Pro-peptides showed specific inhibitory action against cathepsin B-and L-like activities in all crude extracts from the arthropods tested. However, differences in susceptibility of target enzymes of mite and coleopteran and even among the three mite species and the three coleopteran species were found. Our results suggest that the most appropriated pro-peptide should be specific and dependent on the target arthropod to be controlled. This represents a potential tool and allows the design of accurate strategies using specific rather than general inhibitors to combat specific pests.</p><p>Our previous findings identified a proliferation of C1A CysProt in the spider mite <italic>T</italic>. <italic>urticae</italic> genome [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128323.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and demonstrated their susceptibility as targets of cystatins [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128323.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. For this reason, we selected this arthropod to perform bioassays and we chose the <italic>HvPap-1</italic> gene pro-peptide based on the high capability to equally inhibit cathepsin L- and B-like activities in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>urticae</italic> extracts. Transformed plants expressing the entire <italic>HvPap-1</italic> gene, the <italic>HvPap-1</italic> gene without signal peptide and the <italic>HvPap-1</italic> pro-peptide sequence were generated to analyze their putative acaricide effects on <italic>T</italic>. <italic>urticae</italic>. The presence of the transgene transcripts and the corresponding proteins in Arabidopsis lines seemed to be parallel to a reduction in their CysProt proteolytic profiles, particularly in the transgenic lines overexpressing the pro-peptide sequence (P: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 lines). This data suggested that the HvPap-1 pro-peptide had higher affinity to inhibit C1A cathepsin B-/L-like enzymes when expressed in heterologous systems. Some scenarios can be presented in the <italic>HvPap-1</italic> overexpressing lines: i) inhibition of the expression/activity of other proteases from the same or different class as a result of adapting mechanisms; ii) induction of specific/non-specific protease inhibitors (cystatins) to control protease activity; iii) production of processed pro-peptide with higher affinity to other proteases than its cognate enzyme. This wide range of responses is particularly frequent in protease genes belonging to a multigene family and may produce unexpected results, probably due to their redundant functions.</p><p>A key point to compare the pro-peptide effects among transgenic lines is the different location of the specific GFP-constructs used to generate each transgenic line. While SPM and PM lines, containing the <italic>HvPap-1</italic> gene with or without signal peptide, showed similar protein location with differences in the fluorescence intensity, the pro-domain expressed in P lines was located at the nuclei and cell cytoplasm. The protease precursor activation requires appropriated cellular environment for the protease processing [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Once the inhibitory pro-domain was claved off from its cognate enzyme, it is ready to specifically bind to other proteases and in consequence inhibit their activities. Thus, differences in specific enzymatic activities found among Arabidopsis lines could be also supported by their different environmental conditions of their sub-cellular location, as was demonstrated in the <italic>ex vivo</italic> processing study performed for maturation of certain Arabidopsis KDEL-CysProt [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Feeding trials conducted with the two-spotted spider mite resulted in a significant reduction of leaf damage observed in most of the transgenic lines in comparison to non-transformed control that strongly correlated with an increase in mite mortality. These results demonstrated the susceptibility of mite CysProt to be inhibited by the HvPap-1 pro-peptide and corroborated the crucial role of these enzymes in the mite physiology. The inhibition of the proteolytic processes mediated by this specific pro-peptide may reduce mite access to essential amino acids. Consequently, protein function can be impaired disrupting mite physiological events and, in consequence, increasing mortality. Similar results were shown after performing mite feeding bioassays on double transformed Arabidopsis lines expressing simultaneously cysteine- and serine-protease inhibitors (barley cystatin 6 plus CMe inhibitor). In this case, a parallel retardation tendency in the larvae development corroborated the role of the serine proteases in the spider mite growth [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In contrast, no effects of transgenic plants were observed on mite developmental process determined as time needed by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>urticae</italic> larvae to reach the adult stage <italic>in planta</italic>. Probably, the HvPap-1 pro-peptide preferentially inhibited CysProt involved in mite digestion. Additionally, our data are in agreement with the results described by Visal et al. [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] which demonstrated that the pro-region of papaya proteinase IV inhibited digestive CysProt of the Colorado potato beetle (<italic>L</italic>. <italic>decemlineata</italic>), and particularly with the protection against nematode infestation conferred by the transgenic expression of the CysProt pro-region from <italic>H</italic>. <italic>glycines</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Furthermore, not only phytophagous mites or insects can be controlled by inhibitory peptides, in previous works have been shown that pro-domains of other protease families from different origin efficiently inhibited enzymes of parasites and pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128323.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128323.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In this scenario, we decided to analyze mite responses after feeding on transgenic lines by analyzing the expression levels of a selection of potential mite targets. Curiously, we found that mites fed on PM-2.1 and P-3.3. lines (that presented less foliar damage but produced the highest mite mortality) showed a high induction of the four selected cathepsin L-like genes. Additionally, mite genes encoding cathepsin B-like, legumain and cystatin were also up-regulated after feeding on PM-2.1, 2.3 and P-3.3 lines. The over-expression of targeted proteases, the induction of other non-targeted enzymes or even the activation of protease inhibitors have been described as a common strategy to counteract inhibitory activities [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128323.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128323.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>It is well documented that C1A CysProt have performed crucial defence roles in pathogen/pest interactions through different mechanisms of action [<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128323.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128323.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].

Samples were maintained under controlled conditions at 25&#x000b0;C, 70% relative humidity and 16h/8h day/night photoperiod. Next day, neonate larvae were counted to start the development experiment. During the following 10 days, larvae become neo-nymph or death larvae were counted day by day, in order to calculate both developmental and mortality rates. New fresh leaf from new plants was added every 2 days of assay. Results are represented as percentages of mortality and days needed for larvae to become neo-nymph. Six replicates per transgenic line and non-transformed control were done.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Differences in inhibitory and enzymatic activities, leaf damage, mite mortality and gene expression levels were compared by one-way ANOVA, followed by studentized range distribution of Tukey's HSD (honest significant difference) test using R statistic software.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0128323.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Alignment of the amino acid pro-peptide sequences.</title><p>Putative pro-peptides of HvPap-1, -4, -6, -10, -12, -16, -17 and -19 proteins were aligned by MUSCLE program.</p><p>(PPTX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0128323.s001.pptx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0128323.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>PCR analysis of T2 transgenic and non-transformed Arabidopsis lines.</title><p>Genomic PCR was performed using specific primers described in the Table S2.
