Although several published microarray studies of clinical melanomas have provided valuable information, we found only limited concordance between these studies.

Analysis of this data using unsupervised hierarchical clustering and Bayesian gene networks identified proliferation-association RNA clusters, which were co-ordinately expressed across the A375 cells and also across melanomas from patients. The abundance in metastatic melanomas of these cellular proliferation clusters and their putative upstream regulators was significantly associated with patient prognosis. An 8-gene classifier derived from gene network hub genes correctly classified the prognosis of 23/26 metastatic melanoma patients in a cross-validation study. Unlike the RNA clusters associated with cellular proliferation described above, co-ordinately expressed RNA clusters associated with immune response were clearly identified across melanoma tumours from patients but not across the siRNA-treated A375 cells, in which immune responses are not active. Three uncharacterised genes, which the gene networks predicted to be upstream of apoptosis- or cellular proliferation-associated RNAs, were found to significantly alter apoptosis and cell number when over-expressed <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>This analysis identified co-expression of RNAs that encode functionally-related proteins, in particular, proliferation-associated RNA clusters that are linked to melanoma patient prognosis. Our analysis suggests that A375 cells <italic>in vitro</italic> may be valid models in which to study the gene expression modules that underlie some melanoma biological processes (e.g., proliferation) but not others (e.g., immune response). The gene expression modules identified here, and the RNAs predicted by Bayesian network inference to be upstream of these modules, are potential prognostic biomarkers and drug targets.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="19"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="s1a"><title>Clinical aspects of melanoma</title><p>Malignant melanoma is a devastating form of cancer with a particularly high incidence in New Zealand (NZ) and Australia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-New1">[1]</xref>. Although early-stage melanoma is curable, advanced melanoma is very difficult to treat and is comparatively resistant to chemotherapy. Very few agents (e.g. interferon-alpha2b) are useful as adjuvant chemotherapy after primary tumours have been excised. For disseminated melanoma there are currently only a small number of chemotherapeutic agents in general use (e.g. temozolomide and dacarbazine), which are not effective in all patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Avril1">[2]</xref>. Emerging approaches such as BRAF inhibition (PLX4032, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Bollag1">[3]</xref>) and immune-based therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Ribas1">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Chowdhery1">[8]</xref>) hold great promise, but are unlikely to be effective for all melanoma patients. We urgently need to improve our understanding of the complex and variable molecular pathogenesis of melanoma, and based on this understanding, develop biomarkers to allow better matching of patients to therapeutic approaches. This study attempts to address this challenge.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Melanoma molecular pathways</title><p>The molecular pathways that underlie melanoma are complex. The roles of twenty-five molecules strongly associated with malignant melanoma are summarised as briefly as possible below, so that when functional genomic approaches based on mRNA data are used later in this study, we can assess whether these molecules and the molecular pathways they constitute are identified.</p><p>Inherited mutations cause a genetic predisposition to melanoma, including mutations in cell cycle genes such as <italic>CDKN2A</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Goldstein1">[9]</xref>, <italic>CDK4</italic>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Meyle1">[13]</xref>. Somatic mutations in other genes are thought to play a role in disease progression. For example, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K) and their downstream targets of the protein kinase B (Akt) family are constitutively activated in many melanomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Dai1">[14]</xref>. The gene encoding the phosphatase PTEN is also commonly mutated in melanoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Wu1">[15]</xref>, which reduces PTEN's ability to dephosphorylate phosphoinositides and to inhibit PI3K-Akt signalling pathways, and therefore increases proliferation and decreases apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Stambolic1">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Other molecules commonly involved in melanoma progression include NRAS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-vanElsas1">[17]</xref> and BRAF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Dong1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Dhomen1">[19]</xref>, which appear to occur in mutually exclusive sets of tumours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Akslen1">[20]</xref> and lead to constitutively active MEK&#x02013;ERK signalling. This causes up-regulation of p38/Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity and activation of c-Jun, which promotes the transcription of Jun targets including <italic>MMP2</italic>, <italic>RACK1</italic> and <italic>CCND1</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-LopezBergami1">[21]</xref>.

The overall expression of <italic>MITF</italic> in melanoma is associated with clinical outcome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Salti1">[27]</xref>, however, melanomas are heterogeneous, appearing to contain individual cells with different phenotypic and gene expression patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Hoek1">[28]</xref>. When <italic>MITF</italic> expression in melanomas is examined on a cell by cell basis, the slow-growing stem-cell-like melanoma-initiating cell population appears to have low <italic>MITF</italic> expression, and in accord with this, inhibition of MITF in B16 mouse melanomas reduces proliferation and up-regulates the stem cell marker Oct4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Cheli1">[29]</xref>.

This principle has been used to identify molecular pathways associated with the transformation of melanocytes into melanomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Hoek3">[43]</xref>, and contributes to <italic>in silico</italic> models of gene-to-gene relationships known as gene networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Bansal1">[44]</xref>. In a gene network, a connection between two RNAs (sometimes referred to as an &#x0201c;edge&#x0201d;) implies either co-expression of the two RNAs or the regulation of the abundance of one RNA by the abundance of the other, either directly or via intervening signalling molecules and transcription factors. In gene networks RNAs are usually referred to as &#x0201c;nodes&#x0201d;, connections between them referred to as &#x0201c;edges&#x0201d; and groups of RNAs that are highly correlated with one other are referred to as &#x0201c;clusters&#x0201d;. There are several types of gene networks that model RNA-to-RNA relationships using different assumptions, ranging from simple non-directional correlation-based methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Stuart1">[39]</xref>, sometimes referred to as relevance networks, to complex Bayesian gene networks, which can model directional and synergistic relationships between molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Butte1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Imoto1">[46]</xref>. Until recently, due to computational limitations, most directional gene network methods could only model interactions between a few hundred genes at a time. However, in 2010, a method to identify whole-genome-scale Bayesian gene networks using massively parallel supercomputers was developed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Tamada1">[47]</xref>, which is used in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Combination of cell line and tumour gene expression data in this study to understand melanoma pathways</title><p>In this study we find that the association of tumour clinical features with either individual RNAs or inferred molecular pathway activity is not consistent across published melanoma microarray datasets.

We generate microarray data from the melanoma cell line A375 exposed to a set of targeted siRNA disruptions, and used these data to identify co-expressed clusters of genes that are strongly conserved between siRNA-treated A375 cells and melanomas from patients.

This involved multiple siRNA knockdown experiments in the A375 melanoma cell line, in which the abundance of specific target mRNAs were reduced in separate cultures of melanoma cells before Affymetrix U133plus2 microarray analysis. The principle of this study was that each siRNA experiment would alter the activity of a subset of signalling pathways and consequently the abundance of mRNAs downstream of those pathways, allowing clustering and gene network analysis to identify the strongest statistical relationships between any of the 54,000 probe sets, across the siRNA-treated cells. We selected 45 siRNAs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0034247-t002">Table 2</xref>) that targeted molecules known to be important in melanoma cell biology and were able to produce &#x02265;2 fold reduction in the abundance of their target mRNAs. Additional selection criteria were: (i) that the target molecules were recorded in the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) systems biology database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ingenuity.com/">http://www.ingenuity.com/</ext-link>) to influence the expression of &#x02265;50 downstream mRNAs, and (ii) they were relatively abundant in A375 cells (on average &#x02265;50<sup>th</sup> percentile of abundance in the microarray data). RNA from A375 cultures transfected with these 45 siRNAs, along with control inactive fluorescently-labelled siRNAs, were analysed using Affymetrix microarrays. The distribution of target &#x02018;knock-down&#x02019; efficacy is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034247-g002">Figure 2</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0034247-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0034247.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Frequency distribution of &#x00025; &#x02018;knock-down&#x02019; of target mRNA abundance.</title><p>X-axis represents the percentage knock down in mRNA target abundance that was induced by the specific siRNA, as reported by microarrays (calculated based on mRNA abundance in the siRNA-targeted array/median mRNA abundance in all other arrays).

Hierarchical clustering was performed in R using Ward's method and the dendrogram cut to identify 200 clusters of probe sets (see Methods). Each cluster was then analysed using the GATHER web tool accessed through an R script to identify any GO or TRANSFAC gene sets for which clusters were significantly enriched. 66 clusters with at least one enriched gene set were identified; eight of these were significantly enriched for the targets of specific transcription factors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0034247-t003">Table 3</xref>) and five were significantly enriched for cell cycle-associated GO gene sets (GO paths GO:0007049 {3 clusters} and GO:0008283 {2 clusters}). GO paths for which other clusters were enriched included: DNA recombination (GO:0006310), transcription (GO:0006350), protein folding (GO:0006457), intracellular apoptosis induction (GO:0008629) and regulation of phosphorylation (GO:0042325).

Therefore, at the start of this study we attempted a meta-analysis of published microarray data related to melanoma <italic>progression</italic>, <italic>metastasis</italic> and <italic>prognosis</italic>, hoping to identify consistent gene signatures for these clinical features. However, we found there was very little concordance between the different studies, despite the fact they appeared to have been carried out to a high standard. We noted that each of the published studies contained different patient groups, different tumour sites, and different histopathological tumour types. These differences may be in part responsible for the distinct gene signatures produced by the different microarray studies. A recently published review of melanoma microarray studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Timar1">[61]</xref> has reached similar conclusions about discordance between melanoma microarray studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>siRNA-treated A375 cells appear to model some but not all transcriptional relationships present in melanoma tumours</title><p>Given the diversity of melanomas in patients discussed above, we proposed that rather than perform a meta-analysis of patient tumours, a more effective way to obtain new insights into melanoma biology could be to generate a microarray dataset in A375 cells, in which transcription factors and signalling molecules were targeted using siRNAs. We hoped that this approach would generate a dataset with controlled differences between siRNA-treated cultures, to increase our sensitivity for revealing meaningful molecular pathways. Similar approaches have been used successfully in other cancers to understand oncogenic signalling pathways. For example, Bild <italic>et al</italic>. transfected cultures of quiescent primary mammary epithelial cells with specific oncogenes and performed microarray analysis to identify clinically relevant oncogenic pathways in breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Bild1">[62]</xref>, and the connectivity map project <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Lamb1">[63]</xref> also takes the approach of deeply studying cancer cell lines placed into in a large number of different &#x0201c;states&#x0201d; <italic>in vitro</italic>. The dataset produced by this experiment was analysed using whole genome Bayesian networks, and since this method is relatively new, in parallel using a simple hierarchical clustering method. Reassuringly, both methods identified similar co-expression clusters. It was interesting that eleven of the molecules previously implicated in melanoma pathogenesis (described in the introduction) were identified as hubs in the Bayesian gene networks generated from our A375 cell dataset, including: <italic>BRAF</italic>, <italic>CCND1</italic>, <italic>RB1</italic>, <italic>PTEN</italic>, <italic>TYR</italic>, <italic>CDKN2A</italic>, <italic>and SOX10</italic>. However, the interactions between these molecules that are known experimentally (at the level of either transcription or post-translational signalling) were in general not identified by the gene networks. It is possible that these interactions simply do not operate in cultured A375 cells, or that the 45 siRNA disruptions used in this study did not introduce sufficient variability in the expression of these molecules to allow latent relationships between them to be identified.</p><p>Like all <italic>in vitro</italic> cell work, our use of A375 cells, cultured in the laboratory potentially comes at the cost of losing biological validity. To assess the similarity between A375 cells and melanomas in patients at a transcriptional pathway level, we compared the RNA correlations within biologically-relevant gene sets identified across A375 cells with those identified across both primary and metastatic melanomas. We found that several gene sets (e.g. those related to the cell cycle) were approximately equivalently correlated across both the A375 cells and the clinical data. We identified other gene sets that were more frequently correlated in the clinical microarray data than in the A375 cell data, such as gene sets associated with immune response. Immune response plays a major role in melanoma biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Chng1">[64]</xref> and has prognostic implications for melanoma patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Bogunovic1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Neagu1">[65]</xref> and, as described in the introduction, therapies that modify immune pathways in melanoma hold great promise for a subset of melanoma patients. However, the fact that the transcriptional pathways associated with melanoma immune response and inflammation are not apparent in our A375 cell data limits our ability to study these biological processes using melanoma cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic>. This limitation is not surprising, given that the immune cells that participate in these pathways in tumours are absent from the A375 cell cultures. Other gene sets that were more frequently correlated in the clinical microarray data than in the A375 cell data include heparin sulphate proteoglycan synthesis and amino acid acetylation, as well as targets of the transcription factors MYC/MAX, POU3F2 and GCNF. It is possible that these processes/transcription factors are highly active in tumour stromal cells, and therefore are not identifiable in cultured A375 cells.</p><p>Hub genes are predicted by the Bayesian gene network to be regulators of the expression of their children. Experimental evaluation of the directional gene expression relationships between gene network parents and their children is beyond the scope of this study. Nevertheless, we followed up three hubs from the A375 cell gene networks that were not well characterised. These were chosen based on the enrichment of their downstream network children for functions (cell cycle and apoptosis) that could be easily examined in our laboratory and that were clinically relevant. It was encouraging that in the pilot experiments presented here, overexpression of RNAs encoding these hubs appeared to alter the specific functions associated with hub children. Further studies are now needed to confirm the levels of plasmid expression achieved and to define the mechanisms by which hub overexpression alters cell biology.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Associations between the abundance of genes highlighted by the A375 gene networks and patient survival</title><p>We found that in metastatic tumours, the abundance of gene network hub RNAs enriched for children with cell cycle and DNA repair functions, but not several other functions, were frequently associated with patient survival. Some of the hub genes we identified had previously been associated with survival in the original Bogunovic <italic>et al.</italic> study of this dataset <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Bogunovic1">[57]</xref>. These findings fit well with the known role of cell proliferation pathways in melanoma progression. For example, mitotic incidence is the second most powerful prognostic factor after thickness for primary melanoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Balch1">[66]</xref>, and many of the inherited melanoma predisposition genes encode proteins involved in the cell cycle (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref>). The cell cycle clusters identified by the gene network, and the hubs that are predicted by the network to drive the expression of these clusters, may in the future assist selection of biomarkers for the prognosis of metastatic melanoma lesions, to supplement the assessment of histological grade as a prognostic indicator.</p><p>Our choice of the 45 siRNAs transfected into the A375 cells was in fact biased towards RNAs encoding proteins with specific functions. The GO database indicated that of the 45 siRNAs used, 21 were associated with regulation of the cell cycle (GO:0000074), 22 with regulation of transcription (GO:0045449), and 24 with regulation of metabolism (GO:0019222). Since gene network inference depends upon variation in gene expression between the siRNA-targeted cell cultures, large numbers of siRNAs related to proliferation may have increased the resolution of our gene networks for proliferation-associated transcriptional pathways, and therefore contributed to our identification of survival-associated cell cycle clusters. However, the effect of siRNA choice on gene network results may be complex, since we did not see dominant network clusters associated with the functions of metabolism and transcription, for which our siRNA set was also enriched. We are unsure why no strong relationship was seen between abundance of hub RNAs enriched for children with cell cycle functions and patient survival in the <italic>primary</italic> tumour data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Winnepenninckx1">[58]</xref>. It is possible that the effect of cell cycle pathways on tumour biology is only significant in metastatic tumours. However, this seems unlikely since our supervised clustering analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034247-g005">Figure 5</xref>) showed similar correlations of cell cycle-associated gene sets in primary and metastatic melanomas. To clarify this issue, annotation of other previously published Affymetrix studies of primary melanomas with patient survival data would be useful.</p><p>Given the clear association between cell proliferation transcriptional modules identified in this study and patient prognosis, these modules have potential clinical usefulness. For example, an 8-gene classifier developed from Bayesian gene network hubs correctly classified the prognosis of 23/26 metastatic melanoma patients in a pilot cross-validation study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034247.s001">Figure S1</xref>). While this is very encouraging, given the very small number of patients that could be used for this class prediction, and the cross-validation strategy that therefore had to be employed, further studies using large independent test sets are now needed to validate this classifier. As another potential use, gene expression modules associated with specific drug targets may provide biomarkers to allow patient stratification. For example, the cell cycle-associated gene network hub <italic>TYMS</italic> is a target of 5-fluorouracil, a drug that has been studied in melanoma in the past <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Ryan1">[67]</xref> but has not proved generally successful in melanoma patient populations. It is possible that those melanoma patients with high expression of RNAs that are clustered with/downstream of <italic>TYMS</italic> in our analysis, indicating active molecular pathways involving <italic>TYMS,</italic> may be better candidates for topical 5-fluorouracil treatment than other patients.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Assessment of the effects of cross-hybridisation</title><p>As described in the methods, we showed that, for one cluster of co-regulated RNAs in the A375 melanoma cell dataset, the highly correlated gene pairs were not conserved in a similar dataset generated in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034247.s002">Figure S2</xref>A). This analysis was then repeated for all probe sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034247.s002">Figure S2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034247.s002">S2</xref>C). This implies that cell type-specific transcriptional pathways, and not cross-hybridisation, are the dominant driver of the RNA-to-RNA relationships on which this study was based. However, the extent of cross-hybridisation in Affymetrix data remains an area of debate, with some researchers suggesting that cross-hybridisation may cause problems for correlation-based analysis of microarray data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Okoniewski1">[68]</xref>, while others conclude that this is not the case, and that &#x0201c;the observed long-range correlations in microarray data are of a biological nature rather than a technological flaw&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Klebanov1">[69]</xref>.

We identified several gene sets that were correlated both across siRNA-treated A375 cells <italic>and</italic> across melanomas from patients (e.g. gene sets associated with the cell cycle), as well as other gene sets that were correlated only across the clinical melanomas (e.g. gene sets associated with immune function). Several clusters enriched for cell cycle functions and the hubs upstream of these clusters in the gene networks were significantly associated with patient survival, suggesting new prognostic biomarkers, and underlining the importance of the transcriptional pathways that control the cell cycle for melanoma biology. Our analysis also illustrated the frequent co-expression of functionally-related RNAs. We hope that bioinformatic methods like those used here can work alongside traditional tumour biology studies to improve our understanding of melanoma and to derive new biomarkers and drug targets suited to the tumours of individual patients. In addition, we hope that the methods described here for estimating the correlation of genes that share the same biological functions will be useful to estimate the validity of cell culture models for specific aspects of other human diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>A375 melanoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034247-Giard1">[70]</xref> and HEK293T (293T) embryonic kidney epithelial cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, USA).

Clusters were chosen so that: cluster size was &#x0003e;5 probe sets, the minimum correlation between any two probe sets within a cluster was &#x02265;0.4, and the median correlation of all possible combinations of the members of each cluster was &#x02265;0.5. The 200 clusters selected contained in total 1,753 probe sets; 35&#x00025; of the clusters contained 5&#x02013;10 probe sets, 9&#x00025; contained 10&#x02013;20 probe sets, with 13 clusters containing &#x02265;30 probe sets. For over-representation analysis using the GATHER web tool, significant enrichment of cluster members was said to have occurred when: Bayes Factor&#x02265;5 and permutation p&#x02264;0.05. For this descriptive investigation of the A375 cell data, the cutting of the dendrogram into 200 clusters and the parameters used for cluster membership filtering were arbitrary choices. However, trials using different cluster numbers and parameters for cluster filtering did not produce clusters that were significantly enriched for any additional gene sets. When we repeated this clustering using only those probe sets with median expression of &#x02265;1.5x the 3&#x02032; BioB probe set (a probe set that can be used as an indicator of the noise threshold), five clusters associated with the cell cycle and seven associated with transcription factor targets were identified but no additional GO paths or transcription factor motifs for which clusters were enriched were identified.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Evaluation of cross-hybridisation artefacts</title><p>It has been suggested that a fraction of the probe sets in Affymetrix microarrays may cross-hybridise with multiple mRNA transcripts, which could lead to spurious clustering and gene network relationships. Therefore, we calculated the Spearman's correlation coefficients between all possible combinations of probe sets from the cluster shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034247-g003">Figure 3</xref> across: (i) our A375 siRNA Affymetrix Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 dataset and (ii) an unpublished Affymetrix Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 dataset from our laboratory, in which we have used a set of 70 siRNAs to target MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Given that the identical microarray platform was used in the A375 and MCF-7 siRNA datasets, if cross-hybridisation was the dominant driver of the clustering observed in the A375 cells, then we would expect to see similarly high correlations between the same probe sets in the MCF-7 cells. In fact, we found that the high correlations observed between probe sets in the A375 cells were largely absent from the MCF-7 data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034247.s002">Figure S2</xref>A). We then repeated this on a whole-genome scale, by calculating the Spearman's &#x003c1; in the MCF-7 data for the 54,681 probe set pairs that had Spearman's |&#x003c1;|&#x02265;0.8 in the A375 data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034247.s002">Figure S2</xref>B), and by calculating the Spearman's &#x003c1; in the A375 data for the 184,911 probe set pairs that had Spearman's |&#x003c1;|&#x02265;0.8 in the MCF-7 data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034247.s002">Figure S2</xref>C).

Although this analysis was by necessity performed on the same data set from which networks were inferred, the Bayesian gene network inference method used does not utilise information about the effects of the siRNA treatments on individual probe sets. Correlations between these parents and their children are significantly larger then correlations between randomly chosen nodes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034247.s003">Figure S3</xref>A). These children show a trend to be down-regulated by parent knockdown when parent and child correlate positively across the dataset, and to be up-regulated by parent knockdown when parent and child correlate negatively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034247.s003">Figure S3</xref>B&#x02013;D). The regulation of child abundance after parent knockdown was generally small in magnitude, consistent with the expected dilution of the effect of knocking down any single parent by the undiminished effects of the remaining parents that were not knocked down. This Bayesian network method was primarily used in this study to identify co-expressed clusters rather that directional regulation. Future experimental evaluation of directional network predictions will be interesting but this is beyond the scope of this study.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Cloning</title><p>Coding regions were amplified using Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) from cDNA that had been reverse transcribed from A375 cell RNA, then cloned directly into the pcDNA3.3-TOPO-TA expression vector.
