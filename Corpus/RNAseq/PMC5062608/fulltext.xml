Breast cancers can be divided into several subtypes, mainly based on expression of oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Using global gene expression profiling, breast cancers can be further categorized into molecular subtypes including the basal-like and luminal subtypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Triple-negative breast cancers (ER<sup>&#x02212;</sup>PR<sup>&#x02212;</sup>HER2<sup>&#x02212;</sup>; TNBC) constitute a heterogeneous group of breast cancers that largely coincide with the basal-like subtype. TNBCs are highly metastatic tumours with a poor prognosis and there are few treatment options for patients with these cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Infiltration of inflammatory cells or the presence of a stroma with reactive, invasive properties, have been associated with poor prognosis in patients with TNBC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Furthering our understanding of the role of the tumour stroma and inflammatory cells in TNBC will help elucidate how the tumour microenvironment may contribute to disease progression, drug resistance or may enable treatments to be tailored to patients more effectively.</p><p>The tumour microenvironment is composed of extracellular matrix (ECM) and non-malignant stromal cells including fibroblasts, pericytes, immune cells and endothelial cells. The cells of the tumour microenvironment communicate via soluble mediators or intercellular receptor-ligand interactions. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), pericytes and innate immune cells, especially tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs), are the main cell types constituting the tumour stroma. It is generally thought that CAFs are recruited from resident fibroblasts or bone marrow-derived progenitor cells (BMDCs), or trans-differentiated from mesenchymal or tumour-derived cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. These cells are then activated by factors in the tumour microenvironment, such as TGF-&#x003b2;, to become myofibroblasts (&#x003b1;SMA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/vimentin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) that promote invasion and metastasis. How CAFs are recruited and activated is still under intense investigation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p><p>Monocytes are immune cells of the myeloid lineage that are plastic by nature and can give rise to macrophages, dendritic cells and probably also monocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells, particularly TAMs and MDSCs negatively affect survival in breast cancer patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. This negative effect has been ascribed to their immunosuppressive roles and their effects on tumour cell invasion and angiogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Both monocytes and BMDCs can promote metastasis to distant sites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. We have previously shown that a subpopulation of anti-inflammatory myeloid cells (CD163<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) is present in the tumour stroma of TN breast tumours and is associated with unfavourable clinicopathologic features<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. However, the effects of myeloid cells on stroma formation in TN breast tumours have not been investigated in detail.</p><p>Stroma interactions and the effects on tumour development and progression are complex, and it is therefore important to understand the intricate networks within specific tumour types and the cells of their particular tumour microenvironment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. In 2011, Elkabets <italic>et al</italic>. showed that mouse BMDCs could promote stroma formation in TNBCs, specifically by recruitment or activation of non-bone marrow-derived fibroblasts via secreted granulin (GRN)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Using the same human breast cancer cohort as Elkabets <italic>et al</italic>., we have shown that the presence of myeloid CD163<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in the stromal areas of human TN breast tumours specifically correlates with these GRN expressing cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we investigated whether myeloid cells could affect stroma formation in breast cancer. We show that primary human monocytes, co-transplanted with either luminal A or TNBC cells in highly immunodeficient NSG-mice, differentiated into CD163<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> myeloid cells and promoted an increased stroma formation in both tumour types. However, only the TNBC/monocyte co-transplants developed immunosuppressive CD163<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> myeloid cells, and were able to activate fibroblasts. The findings were validated in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) as well as syngeneic breast cancer models of luminal and TNBC. Interestingly, we also found that the monocyte chemoattractant CXCL16 was induced in primary fibroblasts cultured under TNBC/monocyte conditions <italic>in vitro</italic>. In line with these data, primary CAFs isolated from TN tumours specifically expressed CXCL16, a finding that was supported by analysis of a human breast cancer RNAseq data set and a human breast cancer tissue microarray. Our data indicate that in a TNBC environment, myeloid cells can activate the stromal fibroblasts to express CXCL16 that, in turn, recruits more myeloid cells and fibroblasts. On the basis of these findings, we propose that drugs targeted at immunosuppressive myeloid cells, or the circuits mediated by them, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors or immunomodulatory drugs, should be investigated to treat TN breast tumours. Our findings will be important for predicting drug resistance and outcome in patients treated with drugs targeting tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells in the future.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Immunosuppressive myeloid cells in TNBC xenografts</title><p>To investigate whether myeloid cells can promote stroma formation in TN tumours, or if the stroma of TN tumours secretes factors that attract CD163<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> myeloid cells, we first generated breast cancer xenograft models. To that end, we co-xenotransplanted primary human monocytes (Mo; the proposed precursors of CD163<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> myeloid cells) from healthy blood donors together with human breast cancer cells of the luminal A (MCF-7 or T47D cells) or TN (MDA-MB-231 or SUM-159 cells) subtypes in highly immunodeficient NSG-mice. These cell lines were chosen since they lack endogenous expression of the myeloid-derived suppressor cell marker, S100A9 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), and the NSG-mice were chosen since they are deficient in T-, B- and NK-cells and also have defective macrophages and dendritic cells, but allow engraftment of functional human myeloid cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p><p>Tumours that formed were excised, and their biological characteristics, their myeloid cell content and stroma formation were analysed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 1 and 2</xref>). Grafted monocytes (expression of human myeloid markers CD11b and CD163 and very weak expression of human macrophage marker CD68; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 1 and 2A</xref>) were present in the xenografts at the time of dissection (day 21 for MDA-MB-231, T47D and SUM-159 grafts; day 21 and day 90 for MCF-7 grafts). The presence of CD163<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or CD68<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells was significantly higher in TN as compared with luminal A xenografts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>). The luminal T47D/monocyte grafts showed the lowest density of CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells and lacked CD163<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, whereas the TN SUM-159/monocyte grafts had the highest density of CD163<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). In addition, mouse macrophages (F4/80 staining <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2B</xref>), human myeloid dendritic cells (CD208) and human fibroblasts (CD90) were all absent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2B</xref>). Gr-1, a mouse myeloid cell marker, was present only at low levels in some xenograft sections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2C</xref>). Of importance, the myeloid-derived suppressor cell marker S100A9 was expressed solely in the myeloid cells that had been co-transplanted with TNBC cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>), indicating that these transplanted myeloid cells had acquired an immunosuppressive character<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 1 and 2A</xref>).</p><p>Vimentin is normally expressed by MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, but not by MCF-7 cells. In the MCF-7 co-transplants, the vimentin staining is predominantly in the co-transplanted myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>), as supported by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref>), IHC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3B</xref>) and western blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3C</xref>). Both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 monocyte co-transplants had slightly increased levels of the mouse endothelial marker CD34, suggesting that monocytes promote angiogenesis equally well in luminal A and TN breast xenografts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that grafted monocytes survive transplantation in both luminal A and TN breast xenografts. However, myeloid cells were numerous in the TN xenotransplants and expressed the myeloid immunosuppressive marker, S100A9, only in the TN xenotransplants.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Monocytes survive and proliferate in a TNBC environment</title><p>We next investigated why the proportion of CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD163<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> myeloid cells was high in the TN co-transplant tumours. In general, the monocyte co-transplanted tumours were smaller than the corresponding tumour cell-only transplants, and in one case even failed to grow (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>) with the exception of the TN SUM-159 co-transplants that increased significantly in size in the presence of monocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). We used the Ki67 proliferation marker to show that the monocytes in the TN, but not the luminal tumours, were actively proliferating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). This observation was supported by the fact that primary human monocytes proliferated when cultured in conditioned medium from MDA-MB-231 or SUM-159 cells, but did not proliferate in MCF-7- or T47D-conditioned medium as compared with control medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Conditioned medium from a third TN cell line (MDA-MB-468 cells) did not induce monocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). To evaluate monocyte survival in different tumour microenvironments, we cultured primary human monocytes in conditioned medium from five different breast cancer cell lines; three TN (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and SUM-159) and two luminal A (MCF-7 and T47D). Indeed, survival of monocytes was significantly increased in the TNBC supernatant cultures, as measured by staining with the apoptosis markers annexin V and 7AAD, compared with in the luminal A breast cancer conditioned medium cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4A</xref>). As we have shown previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, both primary human monocytes and M2 macrophages migrated significantly more towards conditioned medium from TN cells than from luminal A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4B</xref>). Hence, our data indicate that the TN tumour microenvironment promotes increased survival and proliferation of co-transplanted myeloid cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Soluble mediators in monocyte and TNBC cell co-cultures</title><p>To search for soluble factors that might be critical for the increased monocyte survival and proliferation in the TN grafts, we compared proteome arrays conducted on supernatants collected before and after co-culture with monocytes, using either TN (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and SUM-159) or luminal A (MCF-7 and T47D) breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4C&#x02013;E</xref>). The TNBC cell line supernatants collected before monocyte co-cultures showed a typical expression pattern of chemokines, angiogenesis and invasion related proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4C</xref>; purple box), whereas the luminal A breast cancer cells (blue box) expressed fewer factors. The proteins that were more upregulated in TNBC cell lines/monocyte co-cultures than in luminal A/monocyte co-cultures were GM-CSF, MMP9, endothelin-1 and CXCL4 (platelet factor 4), and as shown previously, levels of IL-8 and CCL2 increased when monocytes were added to the TN breast cell lines and T47D cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4D,E</xref>; green and pink box). Thus, the TN tumour cell environment, alone or together with monocytes, harbour important myeloid cell survival, proliferation and differentiation factors.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Monocytes induce stroma formation</title><p>To examine whether co-transplanted monocytes would affect stroma formation or activation, we next analysed the stromal component of the tumour xenografts. Recruited cells of mouse origin were present in all xenografts (mouse &#x003b2;2-microglobulin staining; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>), but the TN co-transplants had the highest number of recruited mouse cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The recruited cells were of fibroblast origin since they expressed the fibroblast marker PDGFR&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p><p>As activated fibroblasts are central players in the tumour microenvironment we also analysed whether the stromal fibroblasts were activated in the tumours using the marker &#x003b1;SMA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). MCF-7 and T47D tumours that had been co-transplanted with monocytes showed a very modest, if any increase in fibroblast &#x003b1;SMA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>). By contrast, the MDA-MB-231 and SUM-159 tumours that had been co-transplanted with monocytes showed a major increase in fibroblast &#x003b1;SMA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>). These fibroblasts also showed the typical spindle shaped morphology in the TN reactive stroma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). Since the &#x003b1;SMA antibody recognizes both human and mouse &#x003b1;SMA, we co-stained with the human myeloid cell markers CD163 as well (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>). Most &#x003b1;SMA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were CD163 negative and therefore of mouse origin (black arrows), although a few of the &#x003b1;SMA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were of human origin and stained positive for CD163 (green arrows; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>). The &#x003b1;SMA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells did not stain for the mouse myeloid marker Gr-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2C</xref>). Altogether, this indicates that the majority of &#x003b1;SMA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells are activated mouse fibroblasts, and that they are significantly increased in the TN xenografts co-transplanted with monocytes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The tumour stroma in TN PDX and syngeneic models</title><p>To verify that our findings were applicable in other preclinical models, we next generated PDXs using tumour tissue from one luminal (HCI-011) and four TN (HCI-001, 002, 004 and 010) breast cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). We also generated syngeneic mouse tumours from one luminal (67NR) and one TN (4T1.13) breast cancer cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5B,C</xref>). As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, there were significantly more myeloid cells of mouse origin (Ly6C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>), significantly more S100A9-expressing cells of mouse origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>) and significantly more activated fibroblasts as indicated by the increased &#x003b1;SMA staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>) in the TN PDX grafts as compared with the luminal PDX graft.</p><p>Similarly, Ly6C, mouse S100A9 and &#x003b1;SMA expression were increased in the TN as compared with the luminal grafts in the syngeneic model systems (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5B,C</xref>).

Neither MDA-MB-231 nor SUM-159 cells express S100A9, thus making it possible for us to investigate the myeloid S100A9 expression, in a TN environment <italic>in vivo</italic>. More myeloid cells were present in the TN tumours and this was due to their increased survival and proliferation. Hence, the TN tumour environment is crucial for myeloid cells and their effect on fibroblasts. We also showed that monocytes are preferentially attracted to TN breast tumours by secreted factors, such as GM-CSF, CCL2 and IL-8, confirming the findings of Hollm&#x000e9;n <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> and Su <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. In addition, S100A9 is probably one of the major MDSC chemoattractants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Even though expression of the mouse myeloid differentiation antigen Gr-1 was scarce, a potential infiltration of immature BMDCs cannot be excluded as NSG-mice still have normal numbers of immature myeloid cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Furthermore, the xenograft models used in this study represent a situation where the myeloid cells are present in the tumours from initiation and hence, these models do not address the question how these cells are recruited to the tumours or which cells of the microenvironment that arrive first. Therefore, we confirmed our data in mice grafted with TN as compared with luminal patient-derived tumour tissue (PDX), where we could see that more myeloid cells infiltrated the TN tumours, and although the infiltrating myeloid cells were located closer to the borders of the tumours, these areas did show more S100A9 expression and activated fibroblasts (&#x003b1;SMA) in the TN, as compared with the luminal graft. We observed a similar pattern using syngeneic mouse models of luminal (67NR) as compared with TN (4T1) breast tumours, grafted in immunocompetent mice. The effect of myeloid cells on tumour stroma formation was seen in the borders of grafts in general, and therefore might be underestimated in human tumour pathology. In our model where the myeloid cells were mixed with the tumour cells prior to injection, a clear effect was seen throughout the tumour, on both activated fibroblasts and myeloid cells <italic>per se</italic>. In the future, we suggest validating our findings in spontaneous breast cancer models with transplanted circulating human myeloid cells, but also in models using novel drugs against tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells.</p><p>Monocytes have been previously shown to promote metastasis but evidence is lacking on how they affect the tumour stroma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. We showed that the myeloid cells in both luminal A and TN tumours enhanced recruitment of fibroblasts of mouse origin, but promoted their activation into myofibroblasts only in the context of TN tumours. Monocytes <italic>per se</italic> had the potential to activate the fibroblasts in the TN tumours and to induce an alternative collagen (collagen VI) formation. Hence, monocytes can promote stroma formation in both luminal A and TNBCs, but the type of stroma potentiated by the myeloid cells might depend on the tumour type. It is intriguing to note that in 3 out of 4 xenograft-groups, the monocyte co-transplanted tumours were smaller in size, a finding that might be explained by a different ECM in these tumours and the levels of MMPs (for example, MMP9) that can dictate the thickness of collagen deposition and also the orientation of collagen fibres<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Collagen VI, which is induced by TGF&#x003b2; in macrophages, is not preferentially degraded by MMPs.

In this study we show that monocyte-induced fibroblast activation involves expression of the chemoattractant CXCL16 in a TN context primarily. This observation is supported by our findings that primary human CAFs from TN breast tumours specifically expressed CXCL16 and that a high CXCL16 expression in fibroblasts correlates with a TN breast tumour type in a breast cancer tissue microarray. The CXCL16 expression levels varied, and not all TN breast tumours expressed CXCL16 in their fibroblasts, an observation that might be explained by the heterogeneity within the TN subgroup and indeed when analysed using the TCGA breast cancer RNAseq data, only the basal breast cancer subgroup showed a significantly higher expression level of <italic>CXCL16</italic>. We also found that CXCL16 could be expressed by the malignant cells of both luminal A and TN tumours, a finding that might explain why CD163<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/GRN<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> myeloid cells are located in the tumour nests of luminal A tumours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.

This is the first study to address the particular effects of myeloid cells on tumour stroma, and also specifically with regards to breast cancer subtype. These findings are of particular importance for the design of trials concerning novel drugs being developed against tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells. In addition, our data add valuable information to aid management decisions concerning which drugs to be used in different breast cancer subtypes and also to predict drug resistance since anti-PD1/L1 resistant tumours might develop immune resistance in the presence of infiltrating anti-inflammatory myeloid cells. Our data suggest that patients with TNBCs, in particular, might benefit from treatment with novel immunomodulatory drugs or chemotherapeutics that target immunosuppressive cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Permission for the study was obtained from the Regional Ethics Committee at Lund University.

Myeloid cells are recruited to TN breast tumours by proteins including CCL2, GM-CSF, IL-8, S100A9 and CXCL16, where they are induced to express CD163 and the immunosuppressive factors S100A9 and collagen VI. Furthermore, in a TN environment, the myeloid cells activate CAFs and induce expression of CXCL16 by the fibroblasts, which, in turn, can recruit more myeloid cells and fibroblasts. The activated stroma in combination with the presence of anti-inflammatory myeloid cells, will render the TN tumours a more aggressive behaviour.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ncomms13050-f7"/></fig><table-wrap position="float" id="t1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Analysis<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="t1-fn1">a</xref></sup> of CXCL16 and Collagen expression in a breast cancer tissue microarray.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x000a0;</th><th align="center" valign="top" charoff="50"><bold>Sirius Red</bold></th><th align="center" valign="top" charoff="50"><bold>Low birefringent Sirius Red (PL)</bold></th><th align="center" valign="top" charoff="50"><bold>CXCL16 malignant cells</bold></th><th align="center" valign="top" charoff="50"><bold>CXCL16 fibroblasts</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td colspan="5" align="left" valign="top" charoff="50"><italic>TNBC</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x02003;Correlation coefficient</td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x02212;0.142</td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">0.178<xref ref-type="fn" rid="t1-fn1">&#x0002a;</xref></td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x02212;0.025</td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">0.231<xref ref-type="fn" rid="t1-fn1">&#x0002a;&#x0002a;</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x02003;Sig.
