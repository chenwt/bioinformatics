However, their functional mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we identified a <italic>Phytophthora sojae</italic> CRN effector PsCRN108 which contains a putative DNA-binding helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) motif and acts in the plant cell nucleus. Silencing of the <italic>PsCRN108</italic> gene reduced <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sojae</italic> virulence to soybean, while expression of the gene in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> enhanced plant susceptibility to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>capsici</italic>. Moreover, PsCRN108 could inhibit expression of <italic>HSP</italic> genes in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> and soybean. Both the HhH motif and nuclear localization signal of this effector were required for its contribution to virulence and its suppression of <italic>HSP</italic> gene expression. Furthermore, we found that PsCRN108 targeted <italic>HSP</italic> promoters in an HSE- and HhH motif-dependent manner. PsCRN108 could inhibit the association of the HSE with the plant heat shock transcription factor AtHsfA1a, which initializes <italic>HSP</italic> gene expression in response to stress. Therefore, our data support a role for PsCRN108 as a nucleomodulin in down-regulating the expression of plant defense-related genes by directly targeting specific plant promoters.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p><italic>Phytophthora</italic> is a genus of plant-damaging oomycetes and contains over 100 species, most of which can cause enormous economic losses on crops and environmental damage to natural ecosystems. <italic>Phytophthora</italic> pathogens produce hundreds of effectors that act inside host cells during interaction with their host organisms. Some of these effectors may target distinct host proteins to suppress host defense and promote infection. In this study we discovered a <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sojae</italic> effector PsCRN108 that suppresses plant basal defense and reprograms expression of many host genes. Among them, ~45% of total <italic>Heat Shock Protein</italic> (<italic>HSP</italic>) genes were down-regulated. Using a GUS expression assay, we found that the effector suppressed the induction of genes driven by the <italic>AtHSP90</italic>.<italic>1</italic> promoter or a synthetic Heat Shock Element (HSE). We found that PsCRN108 preferentially targets conserved HSE&#x02019;s, and can interfere with their binding to a plant heat shock transcription factor AtHsfA1a. Thus, we conclude that the effector directly targets host DNA, which is a novel mechanism by which <italic>Phytophthora</italic> pathogens overcome host defense responses.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by: National Natural Science Foundation of China (31371894; 31301613), Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK2012027), and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (KYTZ201403).

In oomycete pathogens, two groups of intracellular effectors (RxLR, Arg, any amino acid, Leu, Arg; CRN, Crinkler or crinkling- and necrosis-inducing protein) have been identified [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, their biochemical activities and molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. By identifying host targets, some oomycete effectors have been shown to target important intracellular processes controlling disease resistance. For example, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>infestans</italic> PiAVR3a manipulates plant programmed cell death (PCD) by interacting with and stabilizing the host E3 ligase CMPG1 [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>infestans</italic> PITG_03192 targets plant NAC transcriptional factors to prevent their accumulation in the host nucleus [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, we recently found that two effectors (PsIsc1 and PsAvr3b) in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sojae</italic> act as enzymes to suppress accumulation of the essential defense compounds salicylic acid and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Several effectors in bacterial plant pathogens have been identified as &#x02018;nucleomodulins&#x02019; [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Among these, <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> VirD2 was the first described bacterial effector and may mediate integration of mobile single-stranded DNA (T-DNA) into the host genome by binding to host importin alpha [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The bacterial nucleomodulins may benefit pathogens by targeting host chromatin or its regulatory factors, modifying nuclear regulators, disrupting the DNA integrity or affecting epigenetic regulation [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Transcription Activator-Like (TAL) effectors are well-known nucleomodulins produced by <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> species and secreted via the type III secretion apparatus (T3SS) [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. TAL effectors bind to TAL-specific DNA sequences and manipulate gene expression in host cells. For example, <italic>X</italic>. <italic>campestris</italic> AvrBs3 increases host susceptibility by binding directly to the plant <italic>upa20</italic> promoter and inducing host cell hypertrophy [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], although this mechanism is exploited by the plant resistance gene <italic>Bs</italic>3 whose transcription is stimulated by AvrBs3, triggering host hypersensitive responses [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, manipulation of the nuclear compartment is likely a strategy used by multiple pathogen species, rendering the nuclei of host cells a major battlefield in pathogen-host interactions.</p><p>Some oomycete effectors also act inside host cell nuclei. An RxLR effector from <italic>H</italic>. <italic>arabidopsidis</italic> (HaRxL44) localizes to the nucleus of plant cells and interacts with the host mediator subunit MED19a, an important regulator of gene transcription, to reduce expression of genes regulated by SA [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Bioinformatics and localization studies have showed that a number of oomycete CRN effectors target host cell nuclei to cause cell death and/or mediate virulence [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. CRN effectors were initially identified based on their cell death-inducing activity in plants [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. They form highly expanded gene families in oomycete genomes and diversify via gene duplication and chimeric recombination [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The functional mechanisms of only three CRN effectors have been discovered to date. The <italic>P</italic>. <italic>infestans</italic> effector CRN8, which has high sequence similarity with serine/threonine kinases, may suppress plant defense and cause cell death [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sojae</italic> effector pair, CRN63 and CRN115, manipulate host H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> homeostasis and promote pathogenicity by interacting with plant catalases [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. All three CRN effectors localize to plant cell nuclei to exert their functions [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This study focuses on another <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sojae</italic> CRN effector that reduces expression of plant heat shock protein (Hsp)-encoding genes by directly targeting their promoters.</p><p>Hsp&#x02019;s are widely conserved in eukaryotic organisms and play diverse roles in maintaining normal cellular functions by preventing mis-folding and aggregation of nascent polypeptides and/or by facilitating protein folding [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In mammalian cells, Hsp&#x02019;s exhibit dual roles in immune responses; <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., functioning as danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) to stimulate innate immunity or participating in induction of acquired immune responses [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. They also play critical roles in the innate immune systems of plants. <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> encodes a large number of Hsp&#x02019;s of the Hsp20, Hsp70, Hsp90 and Hsp100 protein families [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Hsp90 complexes regulate disease resistance directly by assisting in R protein-mediated disease resistance in various plants [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Rice Hsp90 and its chaperone complex are critical for defense against the rice blast fungus through interaction with a chitin receptor (OsCERK1), suggesting their involvement in the PTI pathway [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Hsp90s also participate in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>infestans</italic> INF1- or Avr3a-triggered immune responses and are important for non-host resistance of <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>infestans</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Hsp70 is required for plant defense against divergent pathogens [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> effector (HopI1) might directly target Hsp70 to interfere with plant immunity [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>The expression of <italic>HSP</italic> genes in plant cells is finely tuned by binding of heat shock transcription factors (Hsf&#x02019;s) to heat shock elements (HSE&#x02019;s; 5&#x02032;-GAAnnTTC-3&#x02032;), which are conserved in the promoter regions of <italic>HSP</italic> genes [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The genome of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> encodes 21 Hsf&#x02019;s, which can be assigned to 3 classes (HsfA, HsfB and HsfC) and 14 groups (HsfA1-9, HsfB1-4 and HsfC1). The Hsf&#x02019;s contain several highly conserved functional regions, including a DNA binding domain, oligomerization domain, nuclear localization signal (NLS), C-terminal activation domains and a nuclear export signal [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. During heat or other stresses, free cytoplasmic Hsf&#x02019;s may oligomerize in dimers or trimers, translocate to the nucleus, undergo phosphorylation and then bind to HSE&#x02019;s to activate expression of <italic>HSP</italic> genes [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Thus, plant Hsf&#x02019;s form a complex regulatory network that mediates the flexible responses of plants to both biotic and abiotic stresses.</p><p>Here, we describe PsCRN108, a novel nucleomodulin effector from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sojae</italic>, and show that it contributes to virulence in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sojae</italic>.

Although the three PsCRN112 copies (PsCRN112a, b and c) are nearly identical to PsCRN108, specific primers could be identified within a variable region near the middle of their encoding genes (<xref rid="ppat.1005348.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>).

First, PsCRN108:Avr1bCt secretion from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sojae</italic> was demonstrated by detecting the protein in culture supernatants of the transgenic lines by western blotting with an anti-His-tag antibody; an Avr1b:mRFP fusion line was used as a positive control and wild type (P6497) as a negative control. PsCRN108:Avr1bCt and Avr1b:mRFP proteins were detected in culture supernatants, as well as in the hyphae of the respective transformants (<xref rid="ppat.1005348.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). However, the control cytoplasmic protein, actin, was found only in the hyphae (<xref rid="ppat.1005348.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). The results support that PsCRN108 is secreted from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sojae</italic>. Second, the translocation into host cells of the PsCRN108 effector was evaluated by analyzing the avirulence/virulence phenotype of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sojae</italic> transformants on a soybean cultivar (HARO13) carrying the <italic>Rps1b</italic> resistance gene. Successful translocation into the cells of Rps1b plants is expected to prevent infection, as recognition of Avr1b by Rps1b inside the cell results in a successful defense response [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This method has previously been used successfully to determine host translocation by oomycete effectors [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The fusion proteins were expressed at the expected size in the transgenic <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sojae</italic> lines (<xref rid="ppat.1005348.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>) and were also detected during infection (<xref rid="ppat.1005348.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). The transformants expressing PsCRN108:Avr1bCt were unable to infect hypocotyls of soybean cultivar HARO13, but could infect soybean cultivar Williams which lacks the <italic>Rps1b</italic> gene (<xref rid="ppat.1005348.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). Similarly, the positive control line expressing Avr1b:mRFP fusion proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] was avirulent on HARO13 but virulent on Williams, while the recipient WT strain (P6497) and the transgenic lines expressing Avr1bCt:mRFP (as negative controls) were virulent (<xref rid="ppat.1005348.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). The results indicate that PsCRN108 could functionally replace the host cell entry domain of Avr1b. Taken together, these results indicate that PsCRN108 can be secreted from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sojae</italic> and enter host cells during infection.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>PsCRN108 is targeted to the nuclei of plant cells</title><p>To evaluate the localization of PsCRN108 in plant cells, we used <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>&#x02013;mediated transient expression assays to express GFP and GFP:PsCRN108 fusion proteins (lacking a signal peptide) in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> (<xref rid="ppat.1005348.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>).

CRN effectors exhibit several important features. First, they represent an ancient effector family that is widely distributed in oomycete pathogens [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and CRN-like proteins are found even in <italic>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</italic> (a fungal chytrid pathogen of amphibians) [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In contrast, RxLR effectors have been identified only in plant pathogens of the Peronosporaceae lineage [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Second, most CRN effectors are highly expressed. For example, ~50% of CRN-encoding genes are among the top 10% of most highly expressed genes in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>infestans</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and the average expression levels of CRN genes in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sojae</italic> were higher than those of RXLR genes and many housekeeping genes [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Third, the CRN effectors are more conserved than the RXLR effectors, and most of those characterized appear to function within the nucleus of host cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These features together suggest that this effector family plays important roles during pathogen&#x02014;host interactions. The mechanisms by which they act are however largely unknown. Here, we have demonstrated that PsCRN108, a CRN effector from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sojae</italic>, targets specific host promoters to manipulate plant defense responses.</p><p>We demonstrated that PsCRN108 could be translocated into plant cells, where it was targeted to the nuclei. It is a modular protein that contains a conserved N-terminal domain that may mediate translocation of its C-terminal effector domains into host cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A yeast secretion assay indicated that its predicted signal peptide was functional, and detection of this protein in culture supernatants of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sojae</italic> lines using Western blotting confirmed that PsCRN108 was secreted by the pathogen into the culture supernatnants, and presumably therefore into apoplastic space during infection. Furthermore, the protein could deliver the C-terminal region of Avr1b into soybean cells, demonstrating that PsCRN108 is translocated into host cells during infection. In this respect, it is similar to other characterized host intracellular effectors from <italic>Phytophthora</italic> pathogens, including <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sojae</italic> Avr1b [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and Isc1 [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>infestans</italic> Avr3a [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and CRN2/8/16 [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the mechanisms of CRN effector translocation into host cells remain unknown.</p><p>PsCRN108 contributes to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sojae</italic> virulence. Its expression was induced during the early stages of infection, whereas the paralogs <italic>PsCRN112a/b/c</italic> and <italic>PsCRN114</italic> were not. Furthermore, silencing of <italic>PsCRN108</italic> (together with <italic>PsCRN112a/b/c</italic>) led to a dramatic reduction in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sojae</italic> virulence towards soybean. It has been reported that joint silencing of <italic>PsCRN63/115</italic> also reduced virulence [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]; and that silencing of <italic>Avr3a</italic> or <italic>PITG_03192</italic> compromised the pathogenicity of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>infestans</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Despite the fact that the genome of this pathogen contains 100 <italic>CRN</italic> genes and 102 pseudogenes [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], silencing of PsCRN108 and <italic>PsCRN112a/b/c</italic> indicates that these closely-related effectors likely play an essential role during infection. Thus, future screening of diverse soybean cultivars to find <italic>R</italic> genes that can detect this effector to trigger ETI might result in generation of durable resistant cultivars for breeding applications.</p><p>We demonstrated that PsCRN108 suppressed plant defenses and increased susceptibility to <italic>Phytophthora</italic> pathogens by inhibiting induction of plant <italic>HSP</italic> expression. Unlike PsCRN63 from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sojae</italic> and PiCRN8 from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>infestans</italic> that also contribute to virulence [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], PsCRN108 did not trigger visible cell death following expression in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> or <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>. PsCRN63 can disturb plant H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> homeostasis by interacting with plant catalases, while PiCRN8 is a kinase-like effector protein that may interfere with the plant kinase-signaling network [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Using RNAseq analysis, we found that the expression level of ~45% of <italic>Arabidopsis HSP</italic> genes was significantly reduced in <italic>PsCRN108</italic>- expressing transgenic lines. Suppression of <italic>HSP</italic> expression by PsCRN108 was also observed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> and soybean using qRT-PCR. Thus, we inferred that PsCRN108 acts to repress induction of <italic>HSP</italic> gene transcription. Many oomycete RxLR effectors interfere with host gene expression. For example, eight of 33 <italic>P</italic>. <italic>infestans</italic> RxLR effectors suppressed flg22-induced <italic>pFRK1-Luc</italic> activation [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], although the underlying mechanisms were not identified. The <italic>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</italic> effector HaRxL44 induced expression of JA/ET-responsive genes and suppressed expression of SA-responsive genes by interacting with plant mediator subunit 19a [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, manipulating host gene expression is a major mechanism used by oomycete intracellular effectors to interfere with host immune responses.</p><p>Importantly, we found that PsCRN108 could specifically target plant <italic>HSP</italic> promoters. Its C-terminal effector domain contains a NLS and an HhH motif. We demonstrated these two motifs are required for PsCRN108 to promote pathogen growth <italic>in planta</italic> and to inhibit induction of <italic>HSP</italic> gene expression. HhH motifs have been documented to have sequence-non-specific DNA-binding activity and are widely distributed in DNA repair and DNA synthesis proteins, such as polymerases [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The well-defined hydrophobic core of HhH motifs mirrors the symmetry of the DNA-double helix. Thus, we hypothesized that suppression of plant <italic>HSP</italic> gene expression by PsCRN108 might be mediated by DNA-binding activity. Indeed, using ChIP, Y1H and EMSA assays, we found that PsCRN108 could interact with <italic>HSP</italic> promoters. Substitutions of three key residues in the HhH motif abolished its DNA-binding activities and attenuated suppression of <italic>HSP</italic> gene suppression and plant defense, suggesting that associations with plant <italic>HSP</italic> promoters likely mediated PsCRN108-triggered susceptibility. Furthermore, PsCRN108 preferentially targeted promoter regions containing HSE&#x02019;s in ChIP assays, and mutations in the HSE compromised the ability of PsCRN108 to target HSE-containing promoters in yeast one-hybrid assays. These results indicate that targeting of these promoters by PsCRN108 is sequence-specific and dependent on the HSE. Previous reports have shown that the HhH motif is involved in sequence-non-specific DNA binding [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. One possible explanation is that PsCRN108 may interact with HSFs <italic>in vivo</italic>, gaining their specificity from the HSF. However, the <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA binding data, especially the EMSA assays, suggest that the sequence specificity is intrinsic to PsCRN108. If this is correct, then possibly other domains of PsCRN108 may be responsible for the relative specificity of the interaction of PsCRN108 with HSEs, while the HhH domain may be essential for non-specific stabilization of binding to the double helix. Alternatively, the HhH motif found in PsCRN108 may have evolved sequence specificity. Although PsCRN108 preferentially targeted HSE-enriched regions in the promoters we tested and could directly bind to HSE but not HSEm <italic>in vitro</italic>, we cannot exclude the possibility that PsCRN108 may also bind to other DNA sequences. Future studies addressing the structure of this effector and identification of potential other DNA-binding sites in plants may provide insights into the mechanism of specific interactions of PsCRN108 with HSE&#x02019;s and other promoter elements.</p><p>It has been shown that transcription activator-like (TAL) protein effectors produced by <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> genus, Ankyrin A (AnkA) of <italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</italic>, Ank200 and several tandem-repeat containing proteins (TRPs) from <italic>Ehrlichia chaffeensis</italic> may enter host nucleus to directly bind DNA [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> AnkA contains multiple ankyrin repeats that facilitate protein&#x02014;protein or protein&#x02014;DNA interactions and was confirmed to bind to the host AT-rich <italic>CYBB</italic> promoter region, leading to silencing of both this gene and other defense genes clustered on chromosomes [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. <italic>E</italic>. <italic>chaffeensis</italic> TRP120 may activate inflammatory chemokine genes by binding directly to a G+C rich motif in human DNA [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], and Ank200 targets specific sites in promoter regions to reprogram host cell gene expression [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], therefore promoting survival of the pathogen. TAL effectors of the genus <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> are another important group of host DNA-targeting effectors. Recognition of host DNA sequences by TAL effectors is usually specific and mediated by their tandem repeat domains [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The above studies suggest that host DNA targeting is an important common strategy utilized by various human and plant bacterial pathogens. Here, we showed that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sojae</italic>, an oomycete plant pathogen, uses a similar strategy to reprogram host gene expression and that PsCRN108 targeted promoters within the nucleus of plant cells. Therefore, PsCRN108 could represent an oomycete &#x02018;nucleomodulin&#x02019;, a term proposed by Bierne and Cossart [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Based on both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, the interaction of PsCRN108 with HSE&#x02019;s and HSE-containing promoters could suppress the interaction between HSE&#x02019;s and a heat shock transcription factor (AtHsfA1a), which is an important mediator of abiotic stress responses and a major transcriptional activator of <italic>HSP</italic> genes [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].

Both human and plant HSP70s may interact directly with HSE: Hsf1 complexes, resulting in negative feedback regulation of Hsf activity [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The mechanism by which HSP70 interferes with transcriptional activation of AtHsfA1a is unclear. Here, we found that PsCRN108 might interfere with the regulation of AtHsfA1a in plant cells by suppressing its binding to HSE&#x02019;s and/or by inhibiting the action of HSE-bound AtHsfA1a. This ability of a pathogen effector to prevent host proteins from binding to their target gene promoters has been reported in only a few bacterial pathogens [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For example, the human pathogen <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> produces outer-membrane protein F (OspF), which interferes with binding of NF-&#x003ba;B to its target gene promoters [<xref rid="ppat.1005348.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p><p>Together our results provide evidence that PsCRN108 is a nucleomodulin effector that targets host promoters, possibly by binding host DNA promoter elements directly (<xref rid="ppat.1005348.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>). Due to its sequence similarity with PsCRN108, PsCRN112 may also have this property, and make an additional, smaller, contribution to virulence through binding host DNA. Therefore, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sojae</italic> has evolved a novel strategy to down-regulate the expression of key plant defense genes during infection.
