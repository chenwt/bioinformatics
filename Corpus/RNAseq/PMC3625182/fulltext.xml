To investigate the roles that 24 nt-siRNAs played in the poor grain filling of rice inferior grains, dynamic variations of 24 nt-siRNAs in inferior grains were compared with those of superior grains by using small RNA deep sequencing technology. The results showed that 24 nt-siRNAs derived from multiple regions of rice genome, and the maintenance of the two strands of 24 nt-siRNA duplex was a non-random process. The amounts of 24 nt-siRNAs declined with the process of grain filling in both superior and inferior grains, but 24 nt-siRNAs in inferior grains was much higher than that of superior grains in each period we sampled. Bioinformatics prediction indicated that 24 nt-siRNAs targeted on more genes involved in most of the known KEGG rice pathways, such as the starch and sucrose biosynthesis pathway. Combined with digital gene expression profiling of target genes, 24 nt-siRNAs mapped on the antisense strands of exons were specifically investigated, but the abundance of 24 nt-siRNAs did not show negative correlations with their corresponding target genes. The results indicated that 24 nt-siRNAs were not involved in down-regulation of target genes. The potential biological meanings for this inconsistency were probably the results of methylation directed gene expression activation, or competition for small RNA stability methylation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant No. 31200973to HS), National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant No. 31271651 to QZ), and Supported Program for Innovative Research Team (in Science and Technology) in University of Henan Province (grant No 2010IRTSTHN005 to QZ).

The filling rate difference between cultivars is controlled by qualitative trait loci (QTLs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Wang1">[1]</xref>. While, aside from genotype reasons, grain filling rates in the same cultivar and the same panicle vary due to the position of grains on the panicle. In the architecture of rice panicle, the earlier flowered spikelets on apical primary rachis branches are defined as superior spikelets, from which grains fill faster and are heavier. In contrast, the later flowered spikelets on lower secondary rachis branches are defined as inferior spikelets, which have a slower grain filling rate and produce poor quality grains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Ishimaru1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Yang1">[3]</xref>. It was found that poor grain filling of inferior spikelets was a key factor limiting the yield potential of current rice varieties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Yang2">[4]</xref>. Thus, investigation on the mechanism of grain filling is essential to improve rice yield for the production of &#x0201c;super&#x0201d; high-yield rice cultivars that have numerous spikelets on the panicle to provide sufficient staple food for more than half of the world&#x02019;s population.</p><p>Previous studies investigated the physiological difference of auxins and enzyme activities between the superior and inferior grains, and found a higher enzyme activity and auxin concentration in superior spiklets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Tang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Zhang1">[6]</xref>. Researches based on gene expression profile and protein 2-D electrophoresis profile also found genes or proteins expressed differentially between the two kinds of tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Yang2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Zhu1">[7]</xref>. But how those genes are regulated is still an elusive question to investigators.</p><p>In recent years, plant small RNAs are found to regulate genes involved in plant development, maintenance of genome integrity, and biotic and abiotic response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Carrington1">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-RuizFerrer1">[10]</xref>. Of these small RNAs, two kinds of them are found abundant in plants: microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Mallory1">[11]</xref>. miRNAs derive from single-stranded RNA precursors which form a hairpin structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Reinhart1">[12]</xref>, while siRNAs are generated from long double-strand RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Kim1">[13]</xref>. Both of them can cause translational inhibition or cleavage of target mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-He1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Liu1">[15]</xref>.

Peng <italic>et al.</italic> (2011) studied the expressional difference of miRNAs between superior and inferior grains and found that differentially expressed miRNAs might participate in regulating hormone metabolism, carbohydrate metabolic pathways, and cell division during rice grain development. However, numerous siRNAs were also identified in rice grain development. Previous investigations suggest that endogenous siRNAs were also important in regulation of gene expressions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Bonnet1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Mallory1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-He1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Seitz1">[19]</xref>. In this study, we focused on the most abundant siRNAs of 24-nt in length in rice grain development to investigate their dynamic variations and the regulation of their target genes during grain filling process. The putative functions of 24 nt-siRNAs during grain filling were discussed.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Analysis of siRNA Reads from Deep Sequencing</title><p>Small RNA deep sequencing of the developing grains resulted in a total of 131,888,453 clean reads from the 10 sample libraries, varying from 10,658,388 to 17,702,636 reads in each library. In the small RNA population, 12,148,038 were identified as siRNAs that have predicted perfect match duplex and two bases 3&#x02032;-overhanging structure, representing 765,268 unique siRNA sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0061029-t001">Table 1</xref>). About one fourth of these siRNA sequences could not be mapped on the japonica rice reference genome (Rice Genome Annotation Project, release 6.1), which might come from sequencing error or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genotype we used. In order to increase the reliability of the analysis, the siRNAs were further filtered to eliminate sequences that could not be mapped to the reference genome. As a result, 604,868 unique siRNA sequences were retained for further analysis. Since siRNAs were generated from double strand RNAs, two siRNA duplex strands should be from the same genomic loci. Nevertheless, 192,313 of these retained siRNAs were mapped to more than one position on the reference genome, which may generate false identification due to genome complexity, and thus removed. Finally, 412,555 unique siRNA sequences with unambiguous positions on the genome and characteristic of double strand duplex structure were used for subsequent analyses (<xref ref-type="table"

In our digital gene expression profile data, OsDCL3b was expressed at negligible level, and the OsDCL3a was found expressed much higher than OsDCL3b in each period in both superior and inferior grains.

In rice, there are 116 known pathways in KEGG database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.jp/">http://www.genome.jp/</ext-link>). KEGG analysis indicated that these predicted target genes were involved in 106 of the 116 known pathways in rice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0061029.s008">Table S4</xref>). The 24 nt-siRNAs and their target genes were investigated individually in each stage sample. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0061029.s008">Table S4</xref>, 24 nt-siRNAs targeted more genes in each of the stage of the inferior grains than that in superior grains. This trend was observed in most of the 106 pathways involved, and the differences of 75 pathways between five stages of superior and inferior grains were significant as indicated by pair-wise T test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0061029.s008">Table S4</xref>).</p><p>Starch is the primary and main component of rice grains. Therefore, the starch and sucrose pathway genes were investigated in detail. Of the 4215 24 nt-siRNAs with frequency greater than 10 TPM, 138 were predicted to target genes related with starch and sucrose pathway. In superior grains of 10DAF, 23 genes in the starch and sucrose pathway were predicted to be the target of siRNAs. Whareas, in inferior grains at 10DAF, 99 target genes were predicted. This result was consistent with previous studies that the inferior grains had lower expression level of starch and sucrose synthesis genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Zhu1">[7]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Correlation between 24 nt-siRNAs and their Target Genes Revealed by Digital Gene Expression Profile</title><p>The expression of predicted 24 nt-siRNA target genes was validated by digital gene expression profile by using deep sequencing technology. Of the 8270 predicted target genes, 4,114 were detected as expressed in at least one of the ten libraries. Frequency of 24 nt-siRNAs were linked with their corresponding predicted target genes in 5,538 pairs. It was found that in superior grains, 436 siRNAs and their target genes were significantly positively correlated as indicated by pearson correlation index, and only eight pairs were significantly negative. While, in inferior grains, 636 siRNAs were significantly positively correlated with their corresponding target genes, and 54 pairs were significantly negative (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0061029.s009">Table S5</xref>). To avoid the possibility of false positive prediction of the target genes, 38 siRNAs which could be perfectly mathched on the anti-sense strand of cDNA transcripts were chosen and subjected to pearson correlation analysis. The results showed that in superior grain, none was detected as significantly negatively correlated and only five pairs were significantly positive. In inferior grain, only three 24 nt-siRNAs and their target genes were significantly positive, and no pairs was significantly negative. These results indicate that the 24 nt-siRNAs are probably not involved in the down regulation of the target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0061029.s010">Table S6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In plants, 24 nt-siRNAs were found to be the most abundant small RNAs in all kinds of species and tissues studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Kasschau1">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Grigorova1">[25]</xref>. The same trend was found in rice grains, but the inferior grains contained much more 24 nt-siRNAs than superior grains in each of the development stages.

The target gene prediction results indicated that in inferior grains, 24 nt-siRNAs interfered more genes involved in most known rice metabolism pathways, especially in starch and sucrose biosynthesis pathways. These results were consistent with previous studies that poor grain filling of inferior grains was caused by low expression level of starch synthesis genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Tang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Zhu1">[7]</xref>. It was hypothesized that if the 24 nt-siRNAs could also down regulate expressions of target genes, the 24 nt-siRNAs and their targets should be negatively correlated. However, in the target genes expression data, most of the targets were not negatively correlated with 24 nt-siRNAs. The half-life of targeted mRNAs degradation was quite short as demonstrated in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Jung1">[28]</xref>. So, the inconsistency between 24 nt-siRNAs and target genes implicated that 24 nt-siRNAs were not involved in cleavage of target genes.</p><p>It was reported that 24 nt-siRNAs bound to Argonaute 4 (AGO4) protein, could direct <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-HwanLee1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Cho1">[30]</xref>. The asymmetric retention of 24 nt-siRNAs and 24 nt-siRNA*s might be caused by the binding with AGO4, which protect the bound 24 nt-siRNAs from degradation. Conventional views claimed that DNA methylation causing down-regulation of gene expression, but more and more studies showed that gene expression can also be up regulated by DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Xu1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Costinean1">[32]</xref>. In addition, examples of gene expression activated by dsRNA or RNA-directed DNA methylation were found in both mammals and plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Wollmann1">[33]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Zhu3">[35]</xref>. Therefore, the higher retention frequency of inferior 24 nt-siRNAs may be a potential reason for higher target gene expression in inferior grains.</p><p>The biogenesis of 24 nt-siRNA is delineated as nascent single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) transcription by PolIV, dsRNA synthesis by RDR2, and dsRNA process by DCL3 to form mature 24 nt-siRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Xie1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Pontes1">[36]</xref>. Because the synthesis of ssRNA and dsRNA is an energy consuming process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Ketting1">[37]</xref>, more 24 nt-siRNAs in inferior grains need more energy for their synthesis compared with superior grains, which might be a disadvantage for the accumulation of starch during grain filling.</p><p>On the other hand, 24 nt-siRNA competes with miRNAs for 2&#x02032;-OH methylation on the 3&#x02032; end of small RNAs. Plant miRNAs and siRNAs carry a 2&#x02032;-O-methyl group on the 3&#x02032;-terminal nucleotide catalyzed by HEN1 to increase the stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Zhu4">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Yu2">[39]</xref>. As the common substrates, both siRNAs and miRNAs are methylated by HEN1. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, miRNAs methylation in <italic>hen1</italic> partial loss of function lines was rescued by <italic>rdr2</italic> mutant, which indicated that reduction of 24 nt-siRNAs could increase the methylation chance of miRNAs in shortage of HEN1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061029-Yu1">[24]</xref>. This competition might also occur in rice grains, given the fact that inferior grains contained fewer miRNAs than superior grains in each period we sampled (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0061029.s011">Table S7</xref>). In contract, the 24 nt-siRNAs were higher in all the inferior grain samples. Higher frequency of 24 nt-siRNAs may reduce the methylation chances of miRNAs, resulting in a faster degradation rate of miRNAs in inferior grains, which is consistent with the previous conclusions that miRNAs play crucial roles in regulation of genes during grain filling.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>24 nt-siRNAs are the most abundant small interfering RNAs in rice grains aside from microRNAs. In rice superior and inferior grains, the amounts of 24 nt-siRNAs declined with the process of grain filling in both types of grains, but the amount of 24 nt-siRNAs in inferior grains was much higher than that of the superior grains. Bioinformatics prediction indicated that 24 nt-siRNAs targeted on more genes involved in most of the known KEGG rice pathways, such as the starch and sucrose biosynthesis pathway. But combined with digital gene expression profiling of target genes, the majority of 24 nt-siRNAs did not show negative correlations with their corresponding target genes, which might be caused by gene expression activation of DNA methylation. The potential biological meanings for the inconsistency were probably the results of methylation directed gene expression activation, or competition for small RNA stability methylation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant Materials and Sample Treatments</title><p><italic>Oryza sativa</italic> spp. <italic>japonica</italic> cv.
