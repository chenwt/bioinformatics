Over the last 30 years, White Band Disease (WBD) alone has killed up to 95% of the Caribbean`s dominant shallow-water corals&#x02014;the staghorn coral <italic>Acropora cervicornis</italic> and the elkhorn coral <italic>A</italic>. <italic>palmata</italic>. Both corals are now listed on the US Endangered Species Act, and while their recovery has been slow, recent transmission surveys indicate that more than 5% of staghorn corals are disease resistant. Here we compared transcriptome-wide gene expression between resistant and susceptible staghorn corals exposed to WBD using <italic>in situ</italic> transmission assays. We identified constitutive gene expression differences underlying disease resistance that are independent from the immune response associated with disease exposure. Genes involved in RNA interference-mediated gene silencing, including Argonaute were up-regulated in resistant corals, whereas heat shock proteins (HSPs) were down-regulated. Up-regulation of Argonaute proteins indicates that post-transcriptional gene silencing plays a key, but previously unsuspected role in coral immunity and disease resistance. Constitutive expression of HSPs has been linked to thermal resilience in other <italic>Acropora</italic> corals, suggesting that the down-regulation of HSPs in disease resistant staghorn corals may confer a dual benefit of thermal resilience.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by National Science Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nsf.gov">http://www.nsf.gov</ext-link>) Grant 0963010, as part of the Academic Research Infrastructure Recovery and Reinvestment Program and by the NSF Biological Oceanography program to SVV (OCE 0751666).

Corals and their cnidarian relatives possess the key components of the RNAi machinery [<xref rid="pone.0146636.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and a diverse repertoire of miRNAs [<xref rid="pone.0146636.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Argonaute proteins have been linked to pathogen resistance and immunity in animals and plants. For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, AGO2 mutants are more susceptible to viral infection [<xref rid="pone.0146636.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In plants, AGO2 expression is elicited by bacterial exposure and promotes the production of antimicrobials via miRNA-dependent gene regulation [<xref rid="pone.0146636.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Data directly linking Argonaute expression to disease resistance is limited. Yet, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, AGO4 regulates resistance to pathogens via RNA-directed DNA methylation [<xref rid="pone.0146636.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], an epigenetic mechanism of transcriptional gene regulation.</p><p>NLRC5 is a Pathogen Recognition Receptor (PRR) in the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family that detects intracellular pathogens and regulates inflammatory cytokines production [<xref rid="pone.0146636.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In vertebrates, NLRC5 can mediate antiviral defences [<xref rid="pone.0146636.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], regulate inflammation and immunity via NF-kB signalling in the cytoplasm [<xref rid="pone.0146636.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and even act as transcriptional regulator of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes [<xref rid="pone.0146636.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. While NLRs are broadly considered to be important innate immune regulators [<xref rid="pone.0146636.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], relatively little is known about their roles in invertebrates, in part because they are absent in model organisms like <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0146636.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In plants, nucleotide-binding site&#x02013;leucine-rich repeat (NBS&#x02013;LRR) proteins, which are structurally similar to NLRs, detect pathogens and can confer disease resistance [<xref rid="pone.0146636.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Interestingly, two genetic examples of host disease resistance (R) genes in plants involve endogenous siRNA-mediated gene silencing and miRNA-mediated regulation of auxin signalling [<xref rid="pone.0146636.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Corals and other cnidarians possess an unusually high diversity of NLRs compared to other invertebrates [<xref rid="pone.0146636.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], but no direct evidence for their immune function has been reported until now. Up-regulation of NLRs in resistant staghorn corals suggests they play an important role in pathogen detection and immunity, possibly even allowing resistant corals to avoid pathogen infection.</p><p>One surprising feature of the gene expression patterns in the resistant staghorn corals was the down-regulation of 70 kDa heat shock proteins, specifically heat shock 70 kDa protein 12B (HSPA12b) (6.9 fold down) and heat shock 70 kDa protein 12A (HSPA12a) (N = 2; 8&#x02013;5.8 fold down) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146636.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are ubiquitous molecular chaperones that regulate inflammation and immunity [<xref rid="pone.0146636.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Members of this family, in particular Hsp70, are also induced during thermal stress to protect proteins and cell membranes from the damage caused by incorrect protein folding and aggregation [<xref rid="pone.0146636.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In corals, increased HSPs expression has been documented in response to thermal stress during coral bleaching and due to increasing acidification [<xref rid="pone.0146636.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], but not yet due to pathogen exposure [<xref rid="pone.0146636.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. While it is not clear why HSP70 would be down-regulated in disease resistant corals, recent transcriptomic data from thermally resilient <italic>A</italic>. <italic>hyacinthus</italic> corals living in high temperature environments have been shown to exhibit less change in HSPs expression in response to heat stress compared to heat sensitive colonies [<xref rid="pone.0146636.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This reduced heat stress reaction may be a result of lower levels of intracellular stress in heat-tolerant colonies, suggesting that that the down-regulation of HSPs in disease resistant staghorn corals may indicate increased thermal resilience as well.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec007"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Transcriptome-wide analysis of the gene expression patterns underlying disease resistance in the staghorn coral <italic>A</italic>. <italic>cervicornis</italic> demonstrates that resistance to WBD infection is conferred by the constitutive expression of multiple gene pathways, including up-regulation of RNAi-mediated gene silencing and down-regulation of HSPs. How the up-regulation of Argonaute and NLRC5 confers disease resistance in staghorn corals is unknown. Recent research indicates that WBD infection can be blocked by antibiotic treatment, indicating that the pathogen is bacterial [<xref rid="pone.0146636.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146636.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is possible that WBD infection involves both bacterial and viral pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0146636.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and that the up-regulation of Argonaute in resistant corals is being used to respond to exogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) via siRNA. However, NLRC5 and Argonaute were constitutively up-regulated and not up-regulated due to pathogen exposure. Thus, a second and more intriguing possibility is that the up-regulation of Argonaute transcripts in disease resistant corals is used for miRNA-based post-transcriptional regulation. This suggests a novel role for miRNA-directed gene silencing in cnidarian immunity, which would be similar to the links between miRNA and pathogen resistance in plant immunity. Down-regulation of HSPs in disease resistant staghorn corals indicates a possible link between lower HSP expression and coral disease resistance. This finding, coupled with recent evidence for constitutive HSPs expression in thermally resilient pacific <italic>Acropora</italic> corals [<xref rid="pone.0146636.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], suggests the intriguing possibility that disease resistant corals may show increased thermal resilience as well. The ability to identify resistant staghorn corals in remnant populations across the Caribbean using these strong, constitutive differences in gene expression at Argonaute and HSP transcripts could also serve as a valuable conservation tool and aid on-going nursery and out-planting efforts that are currently underway for this endangered species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec008"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0146636.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Expression values of significantly differentially expressed transcripts in resistant corals.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0146636.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Elisabeth Hemond, Carmel Norman and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute for field and logistical support; Tarik Gouhier, Gonzalo Giribet and members of the Vollmer lab for comments.
