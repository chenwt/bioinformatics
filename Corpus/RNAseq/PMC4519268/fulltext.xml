The independent network inference illustrated the top 1,000 vital fungus-poplar relationships, which contained 768 fungal genes and 54 poplar genes. These genes could be classified into three categories: a fungal gene surrounded by many poplar genes; a poplar gene connected to many fungal genes; and other genes (possessing low degrees of connectivity). Notably, the fungal gene M6_08342 (a metalloprotease) was connected to 10 poplar genes, particularly including two disease-resistance genes. These core genes, which are surrounded by other genes, may be of particular importance in complicated infection processes and worthy of further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We provide a clear framework of the interaction network and identify a number of candidate key effectors in this process, which might assist in functional tests, resistant clone selection, and disease control in the future.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work is supported by National High-tech R&#x00026;D Program (863 Program, Grant No. 2012AA020409), National Basic Research Program (973 Program, Grant No. 2011CB111610), National S&#x00026;T Basic Work Program (Grant No. 2009FY120100), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 11322111 and 61273014), Shanghai Postdoctoral Sustentation Fund (Grant No. 13R21420700), and Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (Grant No. 11JC1400900 and 12ZR1421300).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All the RNAseq data (fastq format) are available from NCBI SRA database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/</ext-link>, Accession Number: SRP042102).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All the RNAseq data (fastq format) are available from NCBI SRA database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/</ext-link>, Accession Number: SRP042102).</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec004"><title>Introduction</title><p>Host-pathogen interactions and co-evolution often involve complicated invasion and defense mechanisms and may exhibit a sophisticated network at the molecular level [<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Understanding these underlying interaction networks helps to elucidate the entire infection process and focus on certain vital events, which is a promising approach for improvement of disease control and selection of treatment strategy [<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>In general, simultaneously investigating the transcriptional profiles of a host and a pathogen in time course experiments is an efficient method of deciphering important changes and correlating each change with the response of its counterpart. However, traditional microarray technologies have the disadvantage of utilizing mixed RNA samples (host and pathogen) or applying a compromised method that extracts RNA from separate parts using different protocols, a process that inevitably increases noise [<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The emergence of high-throughput parallel sequencing technology (RNA-seq), a species-independent platform, provides us with an appropriate solution [<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Based on the known genomes of hosts and pathogens, expression profiles for the host and pathogen can be accurately constructed from a mixed RNA sample [<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

A number of data-mining approaches, such as Pearson&#x02019;s correlation, principal component analysis (PCA), and independent component analysis (ICA), have been introduced or established to unravel the direct or indirect relationships of genes by inferring a biological topology network composed of nodes and edges, where the nodes represent interesting genes and the edges show the relationships[<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Gene co-expression analysis (correlation analysis) based on the so-called &#x02018;guilt-by-association&#x02019; principle is frequently used in transcriptome data modeling to identify target genes[<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The success of this approach has been summarized in an article by Tohge and Fernie; however, it is important to note that candidates obtained this way require a &#x0201c;fair trial&#x0201d; because assuming &#x0201c;guilt&#x0201d; is dangerous, as summarized by Usadel et al.[<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, whole-genome expression datasets obtained from the visualization of complex, temporally, and/or spatially resolved experiments help find &#x0201c;the meaning within the noise&#x0201d;[<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Nevertheless, time series analyses can suffer from missing data or bias at certain time points due to technical problems such as RNA degradation, which limits the application of algorithms requiring strict sequential sampling.</p><p>In this study, we sought to perform a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptomes of a host and a pathogen using RNA-seq data from a time-course infection experiment of poplar leaf and <italic>Marssonina brunnea</italic>. <italic>M</italic>. <italic>brunnea</italic>, a filamentous fungus with a relatively narrow host range, is a causal pathogen of Marssonina leaf spot, which devastates poplar plantations by defoliating susceptible trees and severely reducing the growth and productivity of hybrid poplars[<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

An expression profile was generated from a mixed RNA sample extracted from an infected leaf of poplar (clone NL895) that is highly resistant to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>brunnea</italic>. Based on our poplar-fungus infection model, in this study, we performed a comprehensive time series analysis on host-pathogen transcriptomes to dissect the regulatory network underlying the transcriptional response to the infection.

No biological replications were performed in subsequent sequencing part. RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Genomic DNA was removed by DNase I (TaKaRa, Japan), and libraries were constructed using the Illumina standard kit (TruSeqTM DNA Sample Prep Kit), as described in the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. All sequencing was performed using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). All the RNAseq data (fastq format) were submitted to NCBI SRA database (SRP042102, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRP042102">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRP042102</ext-link>).</p><p>The RNA-seq reads were mapped onto the genomes of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>brunnea</italic> and <italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic> separately (v2.10, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.jgi-psf.org/poplar/poplar.home.html">http://genome.jgi-psf.org/poplar/poplar.home.html</ext-link>) using TopHat (v2.0.8, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu/">http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu/</ext-link>, allowing 2 mismatches per read as the default). The Samtools rmdup function was used to eliminate the bias introduced by PCR amplification, and paired reads that mapped to different chromosomes were discarded. Shared mapped reads (that could be mapped to the fungus and poplar genomes) were excluded from our gene expression profile analysis. The numerical measure of the mapped fragments (a fragment means a paired read) was used to evaluate the relative expression level of a certain gene. The value for a multi-mapped read, one that mapped to multiple positions, was divided by the number of positions. For instance, each position of a read that mapped to 10 positions will count as 0.1. In an individual library, the gene expression measure was normalized using the total number of mapped fragments. The reads count normalization was performed on each organism separately. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two libraries were identified using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to explore the overall expression pattern (poplar genes) of these samples during infection.

Here, we introduce another efficient method using independence test to infer an independent network.</p><p>Briefly, given a set of n genes, G = {g1, g2,&#x02026;, gn}, with D as a set of observations at different time points (k) on the expression profiles of the total genes, the relevance between two genes, gi and gj, could be evaluated using their profiles at different time points: [gi1, gi2,&#x02026;, gik] and [gj1, gj2, &#x02026;, gjk]. For every two observations, we considered the differential expression (P&#x0003c;0.01, ratio&#x0003e;2 or &#x0003c;0.5) and classified the varieties of gene expression into nine possible conditions, which resulted from the combination of three trends (up-regulation &#x02191;, down-regulation &#x02193;, and unchanged-) of the expression of the two genes (<xref rid="pone.0134246.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). The frequency for every condition was calculated and assigned to the appropriate cells of a 3*3 grid. To decrease the influence of inactive genes (e.g., stably expressed genes), we excluded the gi(-)gj(-) condition and split the 3*3 grid into four fourfold tables; independence was assessed using these tables (Fisher&#x02019;s exact test) [<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A smaller p value reflected a higher relevance (lower independence); therefore, we defined the smallest p value of the four tables as the pij relevance [<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. All relevance p-values were calculated for the genes. The paired genes were sorted by their relevance p-value in ascending order, and the top 1,000 were imported into the Cytoscape software to perform a visual network analysis.

Comprehensive gene expression profiles of the pathogen and host were generated using RNA-seq technology. Depending on the proliferative and infectious capacities of the fungus, we classified the samples into two groups (<xref rid="pone.0134246.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>): highly active (containing two subgroups, 214/highly active and 895/highly active) and weakly active (214/weakly active and 895/weakly active). The leaves infected with highly active fungi showed many obvious Marssonina leaf spot several days later (<xref rid="pone.0134246.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>), whereas those infected with weakly active fungi did not (or show sporadic spots occasionally). Increasing the initial inoculum of weakly active fungi did not significantly increase the number of disease spots. In addition, the biomass of weakly active fungi rapidly decreased during infection, which was different from gradual proliferation of highly active fungi. The initial spores were adjusted to a level at which the number of leaf spot reached the peak at later stage (NL 895 leaves infected with highly active fungi), and this inoculum concentration was also used in other experiments. In this study, we did not set zero time point, because it was hard to detect the expression of fungal genes in mixed samples using realtime PCR, due to the small number of spores sprayed on the leaves. Additionally, the most of fungi were still in the form of spore at zero time point, which was different from the free living status on the leaves during infection. Thus, we chose &#x0201c;12h&#x0201d; as the first time point, &#x0201c;48h&#x0201d; as intermediate, and &#x0201c;96h&#x0201d; as last for highly active fungi according to their infection period, and harvested the infected leaves at these time point for RNAseq.

A higher sequencing depth (NL214 24 h library) did not significantly increase the number of detected genes. When focusing on the NL 895 clones, we found that the number of detected poplar genes was similar between the highly active (12, 48, and 96 h) and weakly active groups (6, 24, and 72 h), sharing 27,345 expressed genes (<xref rid="pone.0134246.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>).

Moreover, 19 glycosyl hydrolases, which are related to host cell wall degradation, were significantly differentially expressed. The expression levels of two metalloproteases and four pectate lyases were also altered during the infection. These enzymes are critical for pathogen invasion and cause damage by digesting structural components of the host cell [<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Three DEGs were from the LysM family, which functions as effectors to suppress plant basal immunity during plant colonization. In addition, the gene expression of a chitin-associated enzyme and ABC transporter genes was also significantly altered. In contrast, no sugar transporter, glycosyl hydrolase, metalloprotease, chitin, or LysM domain genes were found in the 895/weakly group-specific DEGs, except for two ABC transporter genes. In particular, this group contained two Hsp proteins (Hsp 70 and Hsp 90) and a senescence-associated protein. Interestingly, none of the preceding types of genes were found in the 214/highly active group. The characteristics of these group-specific DEGs implied varied mechanisms and strategies in the fungus-poplar interactions of highly and weakly active fungi when fighting against a powerful or weak rival.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Populus transcriptomes revealed specific expression patterns of disease-resistance genes during infection</title><p>We adopted the same comparison patterns for the poplar transcriptome analysis as we did for the fungal analysis.

Conversely, in the 895/highly active group, the gene expression levels of half of the DE-DR genes increased from the early to late stage. In particular, from 12 to 48 h, the up-regulated DE-DR genes far exceeded the down-regulated genes (<xref rid="pone.0134246.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). When suffering from infection caused by highly active fungi, more DR genes might be activated (up-regulated) to induce the immune response in highly resistant 895 clones. However, weakly active fungi might be unable to trigger many immune responses due to their different influence on the host. The 214/highly active group only had 15 DE-DR genes (48 vs. 96 h), and most overlapped with other two groups.

The different appearances of highly and weakly active fungi provided another opportunity to inspect the mechanisms of the intrusion at the level of gene expression. Highly active fungi possess a powerful proliferation potential. During infection, they regulate glycosyl hydrolases and metalloproteases to degrade the host&#x02019;s cell wall. Glycosyl hydrolases are extremely common enzymes with roles in nature that include the degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose, which are important components of the cell wall of a leaf[<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Moreover, cellulose was degraded into glucose, providing sufficient nutrients to support the growth of the invader. In the 895/highly active group in our study, 10 sugar transporter genes were overexpressed, which suggested that the pathogen might utilize and compete for host nutrition.</p><p>Our preceding observations had demonstrated that many genes from the Lys M domain family were up-regulated in infected samples compared with uninfected leaves[<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Chitin is widely present in fungal cell walls and can be recognized by the Lys M receptor in plants[<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]; this recognition can trigger the PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) response in host cells[<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The LysM family of proteins function as effectors to suppress plant basal immunity during plant colonization, possibly through competitive combination with fungal chitin. In the 895/highly active group, the expression levels of the 4 Lys M family genes, as well as certain chitin-associated enzymes, were significantly altered (2 up-regulated, 2 down-regulated). These results again accentuate the importance of chitin in the pathogen-host interaction. Moreover, we did not find any sugar transporter, glycosyl hydrolases, metalloprotease, chitin, or LysM domain genes in the specific DEGs of the 895/weakly active group; however, certain Hsp proteins and senescence-associated proteins were found, which could explain the &#x0201c;weak&#x0201d; activity of these fungi. Intriguingly, the highly susceptible clone NL214 expressed none of these specific DEGs when infected with highly active fungi. These genes might be up-regulated at an early stage but show no significant changes from 48&#x02013;96 h because the NL214 clone leaves lacked an efficient counterattack.</p><p>This dynamic transcriptome analysis revealed an intense rivalry at the pathogen and host gene expression levels in the 895/highly active group. Many critical fungal genes, especially certain well-known, infection-associated genes such as glycosyl hydrolases were found to be significantly regulated during infection. More poplar genes were up-regulated in the 895/highly active group at the early stage (from 12 to 48 h), and the number of up-regulated DE-DR genes was far greater than in the other two groups. Therefore, if the opponent is weak, the interaction between the pathogen and host would also show a low frequency.</p><p>The interaction between a host and pathogen is a complicated process. The DEG analysis only demonstrated the varied events during the infection, whereas network inference could determine the relationships between the changes in expression in the fungi and poplar and accurately framed the details of these interplays. That might be the reason why the overlapping gene between them only took a small proportion (<xref rid="pone.0134246.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). However, these &#x0201c;elites&#x0201d; would be good candidates in further functional research. In the top 1000 relationship network, the fungal DEG M6_08342 (metalloprotease) was connected to 10 poplar genes, including 2 DR genes. In fact, the pathological actions of metalloproteases have been widely investigated in human pathogenic microorganisms but scarcely investigated in plant pathogenic fungi [<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, in our study, the accumulated findings (DEGs analysis, network inference, and effector prediction) demonstrated that this metalloprotease gene might be a pivotal effector during infection and could be recognized by these two intracellular receptors (DR proteins). The most exciting findings were the five core poplar genes that were surrounded by many fungal genes. One of them was a disease-resistance gene, and none of the other four genes, including secretory carrier 3, NAD(P)-binding Rossmann-fold superfamily protein, and two hypothetical proteins, has been reported as associated with host defense. Despite their unknown functions, genes with high degrees (linked to many other genes) are also worthy of further investigation. Moreover, the well-known elicitor-activated gene ELI3 [<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], which was down-regulated during the late stage, was linked to five fungal genes, especially the protein farnesyltransferase/geranylgeranyltransferase type I alpha subunit, which suggests an influence on signal transduction in the host-pathogen interaction. These relationships provide more reliable candidate genes for future functional validation.</p><p>The independent network implemented was suitable to join the fungal and poplar profiles because it exclusively considered the frequency of significant changes. Unlike the traditional relevance network[<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], which often uses a correlation measure such as Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient, the independent network introduces &#x02018;independence&#x02019; to reflect the association. This simple and non-parametric method will not be affected by the number of largely varied gene expressions, but their tendency, which may show better the core essence of the gene relationship. In addition, this strategy does not require strict time point sampling but works well with a flexible time course experiment, which is similar to the true environment and easier to apply. In our study, considering the shorter infection period of lowly active fungi and inappropriate T0, we tentatively chose three time points for each condition. The sample size is an important element in network analysis, and larger sample sizes typically yield better estimates [<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. More time points sampling in our assay would give a better performance. We are eager to assess the robustness of this network inference in future work, when more infected samples have been collected. It is not very rational to prove the relationship by just detecting the gene expression levels between different samples using realtime PCR. In addition, biological replicates of RNA-Seq are planned to ensure the reliability of our data and findings. It is recommended that the vital genes suggested in our findings should be given further validation, e.g. qPCR, before further study. Experiments such as gene knockout or knockdown (RNA silencing) will be performed to validate the confirmed candidate genes [<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], which will also provide feedbacks for refinement of the network analysis algorithm.</p><p>In our independent network analysis, we excluded the gi(-)gj(-) condition to decrease the influence of inactive genes (e.g., stably expressed genes). In general, if the expression levels of genes A and B are not significantly altered in any of the observations, the relevance of the two genes should be high in the correlation analysis (e.g., Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient), which interferes with the assessment of the relevance between active genes. Consequently, we produced a corresponding test and improvements to address this problem. The limitation of this independent strategy is that the fourfold table does not have direction. For example, the 70/1/2/3 arrangement is completely equal to 3/1/2/70 and to 70/2/1/3. If the fourfold table was designed as A&#x02191;B&#x02191;/A-B&#x02191;/A&#x02191;B-/A-B-, we might expect a significant result, such as 70/1/2/3 (P&#x0003c;0.001), which means that A&#x02191; is often accompanied by B&#x02191;. However, the 3/1/2/70 arrangement, which means that, in most cases, A and B show no significant alternation, also leads to a conclusion that the expression of gene A is highly correlated with that of gene B. Thus, in our study, we neglected the&#x02014;cell and split the 3*3 grid into 4 fourfold tables (<xref rid="pone.0134246.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p><p>We compared our independent network with the widely used Pearson&#x02019;s correlation analysis by inputting the same gene sets and expression values. All of the correlation coefficients between the fungal and poplar genes were calculated and sorted in descending order. The top 1000 relationships (R&#x0003e;0.9975) contained 102 fungal and 266 poplar genes and included 5 DR genes. However, all of these 5 DR genes showed low expression values in all samples, and the visualized network was quite scattered (data not shown). In contrast, the 3 DR genes in our network displayed higher expression values and were significantly regulated during infection. Furthermore, the web tool PlaNet (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aranet.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/">http://aranet.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/</ext-link>) was used to identify the co-expression of the 3 DR genes in our network [<xref rid="pone.0134246.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, only one DR gene (Potri.008G220200) could be found in this database, and its node vicinity network contained 55 co-expression genes that were significantly enriched in lipid and amino acid metabolism, signaling receptor kinases, and protein degradation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study provides a new host-pathogen profile investigation technology that has higher expression accuracy (RNA-seq, high-throughput) and higher time point accordance (simultaneous sequencing). A corresponding, large time course RNAseq dataset (42.6 Gbps) for poplar-fungi interactions is provided for further network inference and functional analyses. The simple and useful independent network strategy determined the relationships between fungus and poplar expression changes and accurately framed the details of these interplays. Taken together, we provide a clear framework of the interaction network and identify a number of candidate key effectors in this process, which might assist in functional tests, resistant clone selection, and disease control in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0134246.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of P relevance calculation for the independent network analysis.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0134246.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0134246.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>The NL895 leaves infected with highly active fungi: (A) 96 h and (B) after 96 h.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0134246.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0134246.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>The P:M proportion between the 895/highly active and 895/weakly active groups.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0134246.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0134246.s004"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>The detected genes between the 895/highly active and 895/weakly active groups.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0134246.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0134246.s005"><label>S5 Fig</label><caption><title>The top 1,000 relationships contained 768 fungi that shared several genes with the preceding DEGs.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0134246.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0134246.s006"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Statistics for mapped reads and detected genes.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0134246.s006.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0134246.s007"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>The distribution of DE-DR genes in sub-categories between the 895/highly active and 895/weakly active groups.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0134246.s007.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge the genomic data that was provided by JGI (Joint Genome Institute, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jgi.doe.gov/">http://www.jgi.doe.gov/</ext-link>), including the data for <italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic> (v1.1).
