This pause occurs normally when the nascent chain reaches an average of 70 amino acids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. As CD24 has an open-reading frame of 76 or 80 amino acids in mouse and human, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, translation of <italic>CD24</italic> may have occurred before translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum. Thus, unless degraded, a significant population of CD24 may reside intracellularly, by default. In addition, intracellular CD24 may accumulate in cancer samples because of widespread disruption of genes involved in the processing of GPI-anchored molecules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. For example, in colon cancer, intracellular CD24 is associated with cancer prognosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. The significance and mechanism of intracellular CD24 in tumour progression has not been studied.</p><p>The <italic>p19Arf(p14ARF)/p16INK4a</italic> locus is unique in cancer biology as it encodes two potential tumour-suppressor genes by using different open-reading frames and a distinct exon 1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). ARF and p16 act through the p53 and Rb pathways, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. ARF promotes p53 function by inactivating MDM2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>), the E3 ligase that ubiquitinates p53 and targets it for degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. The significance of the individual gene products in human tumorigenesis is unclear as selective genetic inactivation of either <italic>ARF</italic> or <italic>INK4a</italic> is rare in human cancer samples<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Given the strong cancer phenotype in mice with selective inactivation of <italic>Arf</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>), it is surprising that genetic inactivation of <italic>p14ARF</italic> alone rarely occurs in human cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. The scarcity of mutations in <italic>p14ARF</italic> has roused scepticism of the significance of ARF as a tumour suppressor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. However, it is also possible that other mechanisms are responsible for ARF inactivation. In this context, it is of note that the nucleolar protein NPM/B23 interacts with ARF and protects it from degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>.</p><p><italic>TP53</italic> is the most frequently mutated tumour-suppressor gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Unlike <italic>APC</italic>, another frequently mutated tumour suppressor in intestinal cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, most <italic>TP53</italic> mutations are missense and thus allow production of full-length mutant p53 proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Perhaps due to reduced expression of the p53 target gene <italic>MDM2</italic>, mutant p53 often accumulates at higher levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Although most <italic>TP53</italic> mutations are presumed loss-of-function, some p53 mutants have oncogenic function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, whereas others exhibit a temperature-sensitive phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Understanding the cellular context of p53 mutant function may help restore its tumour-suppressor function while disabling its oncogenic activity. Here we provide a missing link between CD24 overexpression and functional inactivation of the tumour-suppressor genes <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>ARF</italic>.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>Cd24</italic> deletion retards development of prostate cancer</title><p>To test Cd24 function in a spontaneous cancer model, we crossed the <italic>Cd24</italic>-null allele<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> into TRAMP mice, a transgenic model that develops spontaneous prostate adenocarcinoma due to the expression of the SV40 T antigen under control of the rat probasin promoter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, the onset of palpable tumour development in the prostate of TRAMP mice was significantly delayed by deletion of either one or two alleles of the <italic>Cd24</italic> gene. When the prostate size was measured at 30 weeks by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the prostate volume was significantly reduced in a gene dose-dependent manner (<italic>P</italic>=0.0026, analysis of variance trend test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>). At 35 weeks, the mice were killed and their prostates were weighted. CD24 deficiency also decreased the prostate weight at 35 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> and summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>, the majority of cancer in wild-type (WT) TRAMP mice had progressed to poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas (7/12) and distal metastases (8/12) into the kidneys, lungs and liver. In contrast, only 1 mouse in the <italic>Cd24</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> (1/9) and <italic>Cd24</italic><sup><italic>+/&#x02212;</italic></sup> (1/12) cohorts developed poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas, whereas 1/12 <italic>Cd24</italic><sup><italic>+/&#x02212;</italic></sup> and 0/9 <italic>Cd24</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice had metastasis. Therefore, in addition to reduced tumour size, inactivation of a single allele of <italic>Cd24</italic> significantly reduced the malignancy of the tumours.</p><p>Cd24-deficient mice have a normal prostate morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>) with comparable numbers of luminal and basal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>) and prostate weights (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). In addition, SV40 T antigen was expressed in both normal and malignant cells of the CD24-deficient prostate in TRAMP mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>), consistent with normal expression of probasin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>), the promoter used to drive expression of SV40 T antigen. These data suggest that the reduction in prostate cancer incidence was not due to a lack of SV40-expressing cells.</p><p>Probing Oncomine.com database revealed that <italic>CD24</italic> mRNA is overexpressed in prostate cancer tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). In the TRAMP model, Cd24 was expressed in cancer cells but not in the normal prostate gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Heterozygous deletion of <italic>Cd24</italic> resulted in a quantitative reduction of Cd24 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). As Cd24 is highly expressed in haematopoietic cells and plays important roles in both adaptive and innate immunity, we sought to determine whether the <italic>Cd24</italic> status in the haematopoietic cells contributes to tumorigenicity. To achieve this goal, we lethally irradiated <italic>Cd24</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> TRAMP mice and transplanted them with bone marrow from either <italic>Cd24</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> or <italic>Cd24</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Tumour development in the prostate was measured by MRI at 30 weeks and confirmed by histology. In the chimera mice, all leukocytes expressed Cd24 according to the genotype of donor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>), confirming complete replacement of the haematopoietic system. However, in two independent experiments, the genotype of bone marrow-derived cells had no impact on prostate size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Thus, prostate tumorigenesis was independent of <italic>Cd24</italic> status in the haematopoietic cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Intracellular CD24 promotes growth of cancer cells</title><p>As the first step to assess the function of CD24 in the growth of human prostate cancer cell lines, we analysed the expression of <italic>CD24</italic> mRNA and protein from three cell lines, DU145, LNCaP and PC3. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, DU145 expressed the highest levels of <italic>CD24</italic> mRNA, whereas LNCaP did not express detectable levels. A moderate level of <italic>CD24</italic> mRNA was observed in the PC3 cell line. To determine the function of <italic>CD24</italic> in DU145 proliferation, we used two independent shRNAs to silence <italic>CD24</italic> expression. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>, both shRNAs reduced <italic>CD24</italic> mRNA levels by approximately fourfold and CD24 protein levels to barely detectable levels. In both 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>) and colony formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>) assays, a significant reduction in DU145 growth was observed after silencing CD24. Consistent with this observation, the growth rates of the DU145 tumour in immunodeficient <italic>Il2Rg</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup><italic>Nod.Scid</italic> (NSG) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>) and <italic>nu/nu</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>) were substantially reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>). The role for CD24 in tumour growth is further substantiated by a significant reduction in terminal tumour weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref>).</p><p>To understand the molecular mechanism by which CD24 silencing causes growth suppression, we compared the gene expression profiles of scrambled, non-silenced control (Scr) versus CD24 shRNA-silenced DU145 cells by gene array analysis. Using <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001 and less than 66% or greater than 150% of control levels as a cutoff, we found that as a result of <italic>CD24</italic> gene silencing, 408 genes were downregulated, whereas 618 genes were upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data set 1</xref>). The top ten pathways affected are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. Among them, the most significantly affected pathway was cell cycle regulation (<italic>P</italic>=2 &#x000d7; 10<sup><italic>&#x02212;</italic>5</sup>). For example, the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> mRNA, which encodes p21, was significantly elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). This increase in p21 corresponded with elevated levels of p53 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Given the function of p21/CDKN1A in G1 arrest, we evaluated the role of CD24 in cell entry into S phase and beyond. We starved DU145 cells under serum-free conditions for 48&#x02009;h, which arrested the cells at the G0-G1 phase. After 24&#x02009;h of serum stimulation, more than 70% of the scrambled shRNA-transduced DU145 cells were at either S or G2-M phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). In contrast, only 39&#x02013;49% of the CD24 shRNA-transduced cells entered S or G2-M phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Therefore, <italic>CD24</italic> contributes to cell re-entry into cell cycle following starvation. To determine whether CD24 overexpression is sufficient to promote tumour cell growth, we ectopically expressed CD24 in the LNCaP cell line that does not express CD24. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>, CD24 expression reduced p53 and p21 without marked effect on p27. Consistent with reduced expression of tumour-suppressor genes, CD24 increased LNCaP cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, cell surface staining by flow cytometry revealed that only DU145 cells expressed cell surface CD24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). To determine whether CD24 is expressed intracellularly, we fixed the cells with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized them with detergent to allow antibody access to intracellular CD24. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>, permeabilization increased the levels of CD24 detected in a cell by an average of fivefold in DU145 cells. Thus, the majority of CD24 must reside intracellularly. To determine whether CD24 resides in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus, we compared the amount of CD24 in 0.1% NP-40 soluble (cytoplasmic and plasma membrane) and insoluble (putatively nuclear) fractions. The 0.1% NP-40 insoluble fraction was incubated in 3&#x02009;mM EDTA and 0.2&#x02009;mM EGTA to isolate the nucleoplasm. CD24 was detected in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). As membrane-bound GPI-anchored molecules may be insoluble because of its association with caveolae<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>, we used confocal microscopy to confirm the intracellular distribution of CD24 relative to that of microtubules and DNA. We observed increased CD24 levels and alterations in CD24 distribution during mitosis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>, compared with interphase, increased levels of CD24 were found in prophase and metaphase. Also during metaphase, CD24 seemed to distribute itself more evenly with less staining of CD24 in the membrane and more staining in the cytoplasm. This shift was reversed as the cells entered telophase. To confirm the increase in CD24 levels, we arrested DU145 cells at G2 using nocodazole and assessed CD24 protein levels at different time points following nocodazole removal. Concomitant with an increase in Cyclin B1, a marked increase of CD24 was observed as early as 30&#x02009;min after removal of nocodazole. The increase was transient and largely disappeared at 2&#x02009;h after nocodazole removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>).</p><p>Next, we tagged CD24 at the C- and N-termini to study its localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Interestingly, tagging CD24 at the C-terminus prevented its localization to the cell surface, whereas tagging the N-terminus of mature CD24 protein resulted in plasma membrane and intracellular localization, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f</xref>. The intracellular distribution of CD24-GFP (C) was confirmed by staining non-permeabilized cells with an anti-CD24 monoclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5g</xref>). Moreover, CD24 was expressed as GFP fusion proteins, as they reacted with both anti-GFP and anti-CD24 antibodies by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5h</xref>). Notably, CD24-GFP (N) was considerably more heterogeneous than CD24-GFP (C), reflecting its heterogeneous glycosylation status compared with CD24-GFP (C). To determine whether the intracellular form was sufficient to promote tumour cell growth, we used genetic complementation to confirm that the impact of gene silencing was attributable to CD24. We reconstituted CD24-silenced DU145 cells with either CD24-GFP (C) or GFP-CD24 (N) and monitored the impact of CD24 on tumour cell proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5i</xref>, the intracellular form of CD24, CD24-GFP (C), was at least as potent as CD24-GFP (N) in promoting tumour cell growth. CD24 silencing also reduced the growth of PC3 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). As CD24 is expressed only intracellularly in PC3 cells, its contribution to PC3 growth suggests that intracellular CD24 is sufficient to promote cancer cell proliferation.

These data suggest that CD24 may interact with NPM. NPM is a nucleolar protein and forms a punctate structure in the nucleus that dispersed during mitosis. Interestingly, the CD24&#x02013;NPM association occurred transiently during mitosis. CD24 was more broadly distributed than NPM at the interphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>), although some overlap between the two signals can also be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>).

To confirm this observation in human tumour cells, we immunoprecipitated CD24 from DU145 cells and probed them with an anti-NPM monoclonal antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>, anti-CD24 co-precipitated NPM. Conversely, anti-NPM co-precipitated CD24. To map the region in NPM that interacts with CD24, we used a series of Myc-tagged deletion mutants of NPM and HA-tagged CD24. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>, full-length (1&#x02013;294) and all but one (AA1-177) truncation mutant co-precipitated CD24. As a small NPM C-terminal only fragment encompassing AA196-294 co-precipitated CD24, CD24 interacts with the C-terminus of NPM. However, as the AA196-294 fragment showed reduced association compared with the AA117-294 fragment, a contribution of the NPM core region to the interaction cannot be ruled out.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>CD24 alleviates tumour-suppressor activity of <italic>p14ARF</italic></title><p>To determine whether CD24 competes with ARF for interaction with NPM, we co-incubated recombinant ARF with either control glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) or NPM&#x02013;GST in the presence of increasing amounts of CD24-Fc or control IgG-Fc.

To explore this possibility, we searched the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database for a possible association between CD24 overexpression and TP53 mutation in cancer samples. We limited our search to cohorts that meet two criteria. First, both RNAseq and p53 status data are available. Second, the <italic>Cd24</italic> RNA levels must show a broad distribution. Three cohorts, including low-grade glioma, glioblastoma and prostate cancer, satisfied both criteria.

Based on odds ratio, the mutations <italic>TP53</italic> were two to four times more likely to occur in CD24<sup>hi</sup> group. The association was not due to leukocyte infiltration as the RNA for CD45, a pan-leukocyte marker, did not correlate with either CD24 levels or TP53 mutation rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A recent meta-analysis of immunohistochemistry data between 1990 and 2009 revealed that CD24 is expressed in 68% of clinical samples across all major cancer types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>. A major challenge in understanding the oncogenic function of CD24 is to establish a central programme determining how CD24 promotes oncogenesis. Our data reveal a critical role for intracellular CD24 in tumour cell growth. A mass spectrometry-based approach led to the identification of a CD24&#x02013;NPM interaction. This interaction occurred endogenously was direct as it was recapitulated with recombinant CD24-Fc and NPM&#x02013;GST fusion proteins. Interestingly, the association between CD24 and NPM was most prominent during metaphase and anaphase of mitosis. As such, it is intriguing to consider whether CD24 function may be more prominent during mitosis.</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> analysis with recombinant CD24, ARF and NPM provided definitive evidence that CD24 prevents ARF from interacting with NPM. Being largely unstructured, ARF is known to be rapidly degraded unless associated with NPM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>. The idea that CD24 promotes tumour growth by causing ARF degradation is supported by the fact that ectopic expression of CD24 bypassed ARF-mediated suppression of growth of cancer cells. CD24 had no impact on the growth rate in ARF-deficient U2OS cells, further supporting the concept that CD24 transforming potential is mediated through ARF. Therefore, a central function of CD24 in cancer cells may be to inhibit the ARF&#x02013;NPM interaction, thereby causing ARF degradation. This degradation results in increased MDM2 levels that subsequently reduced p53 levels.</p><p>Although immunofluorescence staining suggests that the CD24&#x02013;NPM association was most prominent at M phase, dispersion of NPM and increased expression of CD24 may have facilitated observation of CD24&#x02013;NPM co-localization during mitosis. A modest but clear co-localization can be found in non-mitotic cells. Consistent with this notion, we observed localization of CD24 in the nucleoli (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). Therefore, in fact, the association between CD24 and NPM can be easily detected by co-immunoprecipitation in cells that have exited from mitosis. Consistent with this view, the impact of CD24 silencing on NPM-associated ARF was clearly demonstrable among mostly non-mitotic thymocytes. In addition, proximity ligation assay revealed that CD24 silencing increased the NPM&#x02013;ARF association in non-mitotic DU145 cells.

In addition, CD24 silencing at least partially restored transcriptional activity of three out of four cancer-associated p53 mutants, including the most common R273H mutation. These data support the idea that although not all cancer samples require CD24 for genetic inactivation of p53, CD24 is a major necessary cellular component associated with many inactivating p53 mutations in cancer. Furthering this concept, we observed that in cancers with heterogeneity in CD24 transcripts, the <italic>TP53</italic> mutation rate was significantly higher among those samples with higher levels of <italic>CD24</italic> transcripts. In addition, our data revealed that by regulating p53 levels, CD24 also determines the susceptibility of p53 to inactivation by viral oncogenes, such as the SV40 large T Ag and HPV16 E6-antigen. Therefore, by decreasing p53 protein levels, CD24 allows inactivation of p53 activity by both mutation and viral oncogenes.</p><p>It should be noted that since ARF is known to suppress tumour development even in the <italic>Tp53</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice, it is anticipated that CD24, being a regulator of ARF degradation, should also function in a p53-independent manner.

Data shown are means and s.d. of triplicate samples and have been normalized against the vector control (artificially defined as 100%) from DU145 cells transduced with either Scr or CD24 ShRNA. The data have been reproduced twice. (<bold>c</bold>) <italic>In silico</italic> analysis revealed an association between CD24 levels and TP53 status. The expression and mutational status data were obtained from the TCGA database as detailed in the Methods section. Glioblastoma, low-grade brain glioma and prostate cancer samples were divided into CD24<sup>hi</sup> (above the mean) and CD24<sup>lo</sup> (below the mean) groups based on RNA-seq data. The frequencies of the samples with somatic Tp53 mutations were compared using either Pearson&#x02019;s <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> tests with correction for low counts of mutant samples in the prostate cancer cohort.
