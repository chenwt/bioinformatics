The lack of induction of classical inflammatory mediators, including IL1-&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1;, during early infection has led to the suggestion that <italic>F. tularensis</italic> evades detection by host innate immune surveillance and/or actively suppresses inflammation. To gain more insight into the host response to <italic>Francisella</italic> infection during the acute stage, transcriptomic analysis was performed on lung tissue from mice exposed to virulent (<italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> ssp <italic>tularensis</italic> SchuS4). Despite an extensive transcriptional response in the lungs of animals as early as 4 hrs post-exposure, <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> was associated with an almost complete lack of induction of immune-related genes during the initial 24 hrs post-exposure. This broad subversion of innate immune responses was particularly evident when compared to the pulmonary inflammatory response induced by other lethal (<italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>) and non-lethal (<italic>Legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>) pulmonary infections. However, the unique induction of a subset of inflammation-related genes suggests a role for dysregulation of lymphocyte function and anti-inflammatory pathways in the extreme virulence of <italic>Francisella</italic>. Subsequent activation of a classical inflammatory response 48 hrs post-exposure was associated with altered abundance of <italic>Francisella</italic>-specific transcripts, including those associated with bacterial surface components. In summary, virulent <italic>Francisella</italic> induces a unique pulmonary inflammatory response characterized by temporal regulation of innate immune pathways correlating with altered bacterial gene expression patterns. This study represents the first simultaneous measurement of both host and <italic>Francisella</italic> transcriptome changes that occur during <italic>in vivo</italic> infection and identifies potential bacterial virulence factors responsible for regulation of host inflammatory pathways.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Defense Threat Reduction Agency contract HDTRA-1-08-C-0023, the Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine and the University of Luxembourg.

Aerosol exposure to <italic>F. tularensis</italic> is associated with the most severe disease, with mortality rates as high as 30% with the <italic>F. tularensis</italic> subsp. <italic>tularensis</italic> (Type A) strain, if left untreated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Dienst1">[5]</xref>. Type A <italic>F. tularensis</italic> is also particularly infectious, with as few as 10 organisms capable of causing human disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Thomas1">[4]</xref>. It is for this reason that Type A <italic>F. tularensis</italic> has been classified as a Category A select agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and is considered a potential bioweapon, leading to increased interest in understanding the pathogenesis of this infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Oyston1">[6]</xref>.</p><p>The host-bacteria interaction is a complex process, involving both the detection of the bacteria by the host as well as manipulation of host biological pathways by the bacterium in an attempt to facilitate bacterial replication/dissemination. The extreme virulence of <italic>F. tularenensis</italic> subsp. <italic>tularensis</italic> is not well understood but multiple studies, in humans and mice, have shown that <italic>Francisella</italic> infection is associated with the absence of a classical host innate immune response (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Bosio1">[7]</xref>. In seven individuals with ulceroglandular tularemia, a decreased expression of genes (relative to samples from normal controls) involved in innate and adaptive immune responses is seen in peripheral blood during the acute phase of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Andersson1">[8]</xref>. In mice, <italic>F. tularensis</italic> fails to stimulate production of classical pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-12p40, in the airways and lungs of aerosol-exposed animals and fails to activate dendritic cells (DC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Bosio2">[9]</xref>. Induction of Type II interferon is also impaired during <italic>F. tularensis</italic> infection of mononuclear phagocytic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Parsa1">[10]</xref>. Similarly, infected human DCs/macrophages also demonstrated a lack of induction of multiple cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Bauler1">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Bosio3">[14]</xref>. Interestingly, both infected and adjacent uninfected DCs fail to respond to Toll-like receptor agonists, suggesting <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> is actively suppressing activation of targeted inflammatory responses through intracellular molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Bosio2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Chase1">[12]</xref>. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that <italic>F.tularensis</italic> does not induce a classical pro-inflammatory immune response. However, most of these investigations have focused on a limited set of inflammatory mediators and so the extent of this suppression with respect to the broader immune response is yet to be fully characterized. Moreover, many of the studies have utilized <italic>F. tularensis</italic> subspecies that do not exhibit the extreme virulence of the <italic>F. tularensis</italic> ssp. <italic>tularensis</italic> strain.</p><p>The current study focused on characterizing the extent of the suppression of the host pulmonary inflammatory response caused by virulent Group A <italic>F. tularensis</italic> SchuS4 (FT SchuS4) through detailed transcriptomic study of both host and pathogen. The host response to FT SchuS4 was also compared to that of the highly lethal <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>, attenuated strains of <italic>F. tularensis</italic> and <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, as well as <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>, which are other respiratory pathogens that induce a severe but non-lethal infection. While acute <italic>F. tularensis</italic> infection at four hours was associated with a marked suppression of multiple aspects of the innate immune response relative to other pathogens, a subset of immune-related transcripts were uniquely induced by virulent <italic>F. tularensis</italic>, including those that function to modulate inflammation. A classical inflammatory response was activated in <italic>Francisella</italic>-infected mice after 24 hrs which correlated with a dramatic change in bacterial gene expression patterns. This simultaneous measurement of host and bacterial transcriptome changes that occur during <italic>in vivo</italic> infection identified potential virulence factors which target host inflammatory pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Bacteria</title><p><italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> subspecies <italic>tularensis</italic> SchuS4 (CDC, Fort Collins, CO) was grown to stationary phase with agitation at 37&#x000b0;C in Mueller Hinton broth supplemented with 2% Isovitalex (BBL), pelleted, suspended in PBS with 20% glycerol, aliquoted, and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062412-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, each pathogen was associated with a unique pattern of expression of these transcripts, suggesting differences in activation and/or modulation of host inflammatory networks. Both LP and PA, which cause acute, self-resolving infections, induce an inflammatory response by four hours as evidenced by increased expression of numerous inflammatory mediators, although the induction in response to PA is much more extensive than that to LP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062412-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In general, induction of inflammatory-related genes remained consistent through-out PA infection. There was a slight decline at 48 hrs coinciding with decreased levels of bacterial counts, as measured by qPCR detection of 16S rRNA, in the lungs of animals, possibly a reflection of immune-mediated clearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062412-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). LP-induced expression of inflammatory mediators was also maintained throughout the time-course, as were levels of bacteria present in lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062412-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, a subset of sequences strongly induced by PA was not induced at any time-point during LP infection (indicated by black bar,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062412.s002">Table S1</xref>). Many of these sequences encode chemokines (CCL28), cytokines (including IFN&#x003b1; subtypes 5, 12, 13, IL11, IL13, IL24, IL27, IL30), and receptors (CCR3, IL6ra, 17r, IL21r, IL22ra1) suggesting differential recruitment of immune cell subsets during PA and LP infection. Others are key regulators of inflammation and stress response (including TOLLIP, Cd3e, Adora2a, Ltb, Ltbp3, Mef2d).

The expression levels of a limited number of genes increased by 48 hrs in FT LVS-infected animals. However, the levels are generally less than what was observed during FT SchuS4 infection at the same time-point. Furthermore, while FT SchuS4 infection induced an extensive host transcriptional response at all time-points examined, FT LVS infection was associated with very little change in host gene expression for at least the initial 48 hrs (data not shown). Animals exposed to aYP demonstrated an induction of a slightly larger group of inflammatory mediators than seen in FT LVS-exposed animals, although to similarly low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062412-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

In contrast, animals exposed to FT LVS did not show induction of the immune-related transcripts induced by FT SchuS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062412-g003">Figure 3</xref>), raising the possibility that they play a role in the extreme virulence uniquely associated with FT SchuS4. Animals exposed to either YP or aYP showed a more extensive induction, but the number of transcripts as well as the level of induction was still less than what was observed in FT SchuS4-infected animals. Animals exposed to either PA or LP showed an induction of only a small subset of the FT SchuS4-induced immune-related genes, despite both pathogens inducing an extensive induction of many other inflammatory-related genes. Collectively, these results suggest that FT SchuS4 infection is associated with a unique host immune response when compared to a less virulent strain of <italic>F. tularensis</italic>, FT LVS, as well as other respiratory pathogens, including both self-limiting and lethal infections. The lack of induction of these transcripts in response to these pathogens was consistent across all time-points, suggesting it is not simply due to differences in kinetics, but rather fundamental differences in activation of host signaling processes. Furthermore, the majority of these sequences were either not induced in response to virulent <italic>Y. pestis</italic> infection, or induced to a lesser degree, suggesting that while both pathogens are associated with high lethality in mice, the underlying mechanisms of pathogenesis differ. Interestingly, these transcripts are strongly suppressed in the lungs of animals infected with the 1918 pandemic strain of influenza virus (Walters, unpublished data), which has been shown to mediate significant induction of pro-inflammatory mediators and PMN infiltration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Baskin1">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Perrone1">[30]</xref>.</p><p>Many of the induced transcripts are expressed in multiple immune cell types and contain binding sites for transcription factors known to be activated by innate signaling pathways, including NFAT (Arcn1, Arl5b, Ets1, Mll3, Npepps, Ppp4r2, Prpf38b, Smurf2, Stag1, Zch2), STAT1 (Csnk1a1,Ifih1), STAT4 (Bzw1, Ifh1), STAT3 (Zhx2), STAT5A (Bzw1, Cdc37l1,Ets1, Usp48), and ATF3 (Usp48, Eif2c2). Consistent with this, by 4 hrs post-exposure, there was also increased expression of the transcription factors NFATc1/NFATc3 as well as genes associated with NFAT signaling (ILF3, Csnk1a1) at four hours post-exposure.</p><p>Interestingly, several of the induced genes encode proteins that function to modulate inflammation. These include ADAM17, which in addition to pro-inflammatory effects, also suppresses epithelial cell cytokine synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Murthy1">[31]</xref> and inhibits early neutrophil infiltration by shedding of L-selectin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Tang1">[32]</xref>.

These genes all function to modulate the inflammatory response to mitigate immune-pathological effects. It is possible that the premature induction of these genes immediately following exposure to FT SchuS4 dampens the pulmonary inflammatory response, at least temporarily, to facilitate replication and dissemination of the bacteria. Furthermore, the activation of host pathways which modulate inflammation could explain the broad level of suppression and/or lack of activation that was observed during FT SchuS4 acute infection. While not impossible, it seems unlikely that the levels of a bacteria-specific factor would be sufficient to facilitate the extensive of inflammation observed even by 4 hrs post-exposure.</p><p>In summary, while acute FT SchuS4 infection was not associated with induction of the well- characterized, classical inflammatory mediators, the unique induction of a subset of immune-related transcripts suggest a role for targeting of leukocyte function and anti-inflammatory pathways in the extreme virulence of this pathogen.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Activation of inflammatory response in FT SchuS4-infected animals correlates with altered bacterial gene expression</title><p>Examination of the expression levels of immune-related transcripts suggest that activation of a classical innate immune response occurs between 24 and 48 hrs post-FT SchuS4 exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062412-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) similar to what was observed in a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Andersson2">[21]</xref>.

The greater number of detectable <italic>Francisella</italic>-specific mRNA transcripts detected at 48 hrs is likely at least partially related to the higher levels of bacterial counts in the lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062412-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Of the 216 transcripts detected at 24 hrs, 168 showed decreased levels at 48 hrs, while the remaining showed either increased or constant expression levels.

It is possible that decreased expression of the bacterial factor(s) suppressing the innate immune response coincides with activation of inflammation in the lungs of infected animals.

TolC is a virulence factor thought to comprise a Type I secretion system, although the secreted factor remains unidentified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Gil1">[44]</xref>. The FPI protein IglC, which lacks homology to any characterized bacterial protein, is a potential effector protein exported via a Type VI secretion system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Broms1">[48]</xref>. The modulation of multiple genes involved in secretion is particularly interesting as the ability of <italic>Francisella</italic> to antagonize activation of macrophages is thought to be at least partly mediated by a secreted bacterial factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Bosio2">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Also showing a trend for decreased expression were numerous genes previously identified as virulence factors, including those associated with the <italic>Francisella</italic> pathogenicity island (IglE, IglF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062412-g004">Figure 4E</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Broms1">[48]</xref>.

Interestingly, FTT_0584 may function to inhibit macrophage cell death during <italic>Francisella</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Weiss1">[50]</xref>.</p><p>Finally, of the 168 <italic>Francisella</italic>-specific genes showing decreased expression correlating with activation of inflammation in the lungs of infected animals, 24 encode hypothetical proteins or pseudogenes that have previously not been identified as virulence factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062412-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Many of these do not show significant sequence homology with any other genes in GenBank and so their function cannot be inferred. Some (FTT_1308c, 1791, 0172 and 0181c) comprise sequences which are specific to the highly virulent Type A strain of <italic>Francisella</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Rohmer1">[39]</xref> and so are of particular interest as suppression of TLR4 signaling is specific to this strain (data not shown). Complete sequencing of highly virulent <italic>F. tularensis</italic> strains has revealed little about the identity of possible virulence factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Larsson1">[38]</xref>. The ability to correlate bacterial gene expression patterns with phenotypes during <italic>in vivo</italic> infection, such as modulation of inflammatory pathways, may provide insight into the potential function of unannotated <italic>F. tularensis</italic> genes. It is feasible that one or more of these sequences encode a factor that is responsible for the extensive suppression of innate immune response signaling observed during the initial 24 hrs post-exposure. The use of transposon-generated mutant libraries of <italic>F. tularensis</italic> and/or gene-specific targeted mutagenesis will undoubtedly be of use in examining this possibility.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study represents the first comparison of the global transcriptional response in lung tissue of mice exposed to highly virulent <italic>F. tularensis</italic> ssp. <italic>tularensis</italic> to other respiratory pathogens including the less virulent though lethal <italic>F. tularensis</italic> ssp. <italic>holarctica</italic> LVS, virulent and avirulent <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and <italic>L. pneumophilla</italic>. This study also represents the first simultaneous measurement of both host and <italic>F. tularensis</italic> transcriptome changes that occur during <italic>in vivo</italic> infection and highlights the potentially extensive regulation of bacterial gene expression that occurs during mammalian infection.</p><p>The ability of a pathogen to antagonize the host innate immune response to facilitate growth and dissemination is often correlated with the level of virulence. Because of this, it is speculated that the extreme virulence associated with <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> ssp. <italic>tularensis</italic> is related to its ability to delay the activation of a classical inflammatory response. Indeed, several studies have reported that <italic>F. tularensis</italic> infection impairs the function of macrophage/dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Bosio2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Chase1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Bosio3">[14]</xref> and little induction of certain sets of immune-related genes has been observed in transcriptional profiling of lung tissue from infected animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Andersson2">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Kingry1">[23]</xref>. Significantly, the results of the current study indicate that this antagonism of the innate immune response is much broader and occurs earlier than previously reported, as shown by the lack of induction of an extensive list of known immune-related transcripts. This was particularly apparent when the expression profiles of immune-related genes in FT SchuS4-infected animals were compared to those induced following exposure to either <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> or <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>. Both of these pathogens cause acute, non-lethal infection that is associated with extensive induction of inflammation-related genes in the lung tissue of exposed animals. Even exposure to <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, a highly lethal pathogen that employs multiple mechanisms to antagonize activation of innate immune signaling, was associated with extensive induction of immune-related genes. The fact that this lack of activation of inflammation is observed in whole lung tissue suggests that <italic>Francisella</italic> is able to suppress innate signaling pathways which function in multiple cell types, possibly including lung epithelial cells and endothelial cells. To date much of the research has focused on <italic>Francisella's</italic> ability to antagonize function/activation of macrophages. While macrophages are central to the innate response to infection, resident epithelial cells have also been shown to play an important role through initiating immune cell infiltration via chemokine expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-GarciaRamallo1">[51]</xref>. Furthermore, a recent study using a mutant defective for replication in macrophages retained its virulence in a murine model of pneumonic tularemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Horzempa1">[52]</xref>. This suggests that the virulence of <italic>Francisella</italic> is not restricted to suppression of macrophage function and also illustrates the need for more studies focused on the bacteria's effect on other target cells, including lung epithelial cells</p><p>The mechanism by which <italic>F. tularensis</italic> mediates this profound suppression of pro-inflammatory pathways is of significant interest, both with respect to understanding the extreme virulence of this pathogen as well as potentially gaining insight into regulatory networks responsible for dampening inflammation. Many mechanisms have been proposed including bacterial expression of catalase, katG,, which serves to harness reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in cells infected with virulent <italic>F. tularensis</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Melillo1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Lindgren1">[53]</xref>. Multiple studies have implicated the PI3K/Akt pathway in <italic>F.tularensis</italic>-mediated suppression of cytokine production, although results are conflicting about whether the pathway is activated or suppressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Melillo1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Butchar1">[54]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Parsa2">[56]</xref>. There is also evidence that the absence of CD14 on alveolar macrophages contributes to the evasion of innate immunity by virulent <italic>F. tularensis</italic>, although the significance of this is unclear as animals lacking CD14 do not exhibit altered susceptibility to pulmonary infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Chase2">[57]</xref>.</p><p>The lack of increased expression of many key inflammatory mediators during acute <italic>F. tularensis</italic> infection could also be mediated through activation of host pathways that function to dampen/resolve the inflammatory response. Such pathways play a critical role in preventing immunopathology due to uncontrolled immune responses. There is precedence for pathogens manipulating these pathways to limit activation of inflammatory pathways and facilitate their own replication, including increased activation of resolution pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Vance1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Aliberti1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Bannenberg1">[60]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Bafica1">[61]</xref>. Certainly, the global suppression of chemokines and lack of PMN infiltration observed in the lungs of animals exposed to <italic>F. tularensis</italic> in the current study is consistent with activation of these resolution pathways. <italic>F. tularensis</italic> has been shown to inhibit the pro-inflammatory response of endothelial cells via direct contact with the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), thus mimicking the anti-inflammatory signaling cascades mediated by activated protein C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Bublitz1">[62]</xref>. The suppression of inflammation during acute <italic>F. tularensis</italic> infection has also been linked to induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Bosio2">[9]</xref>, although this was not found in subsequent studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Chase1">[12]</xref>. In the current study, increased levels of IL-10, TGF-<italic>B</italic> and SOCS2/3 were not observed until 48 hrs post-exposure, at which time a significant inflammatory response was observed. However, the unique induction of a subset of immune-related genes in animals exposed to virulent <italic>F. tularensis</italic> points to a potential role in regulating inflammation. The expression levels of these genes appear to be inversely related to overall strength of inflammatory response during infection, at least with respect to the limited repertoire of pathogens used in the current study, suggesting a potential role in dampening the innate immune response. Indeed, at least several of the transcripts have already been shown to modulate the inflammatory response, including ADAM17, ROCK1 and PTPRC. The function of the remaining transcripts warrants further investigation, both to provide more insight into the intricate regulatory networks governing inflammation as well as to identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention in inflammatory disorder.</p><p>While many studies have focused on how <italic>Francisella</italic> modulates macrophage/dendritic cell function, less is known about how it may modulate leukocyte populations, including natural killer cells which play a key role in the innate response to intracellular pathogens. Of the limited number of immune-related genes that did show increased expression during acute <italic>Francisella</italic> infection, many are involved in lymphocyte activation/function, including NFAT signaling. This possibly explains the significantly higher level of IFN-&#x003b3; in FT Schu4-exposed animals compared to those exposed to other respiratory pathogens (data not shown). Involvement of IFN-&#x003b3; and IFN-&#x003b3;-inducible genes was also observed in the lungs of mice exposed to both the SchuS4 strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-David1">[22]</xref> as well as a different type A strain of <italic>Francisella</italic>, FSCO33 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Andersson2">[21]</xref>.

Increased expression of immune-related transcripts and infiltration of neutrophils coincides with an apparent slower growth of bacteria in the lung, suggesting that once activated, the inflammatory response is capable of slowing <italic>Francisella</italic> growth. The mechanism responsible for this activation of inflammation is unclear. One possibility is <italic>Francisella</italic> alters its surface to be more detectable by host innate immune pathways. Characterization of <italic>F. tularenesis</italic>-specific mRNA transcripts by deep sequencing revealed altered expression levels of genes encoding bacterial surface componants, including those associated with LPS and O-antigen synthesis/modification One such gene, the lipid A modifying N-acetyl transferase, IpxD, was recently shown to be responsible for temperature-mediated LPS remodeling and lpxD-null mutants were attenuated in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Li1">[37]</xref>. <italic>Francisella novicida</italic> strains lacking enzymes required for lipid A carbohydrate modification were also found to be attenuated in mice and elicited higher levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in infected macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Kanistanon1">[71]</xref>.This is intriguing in light of recent studies demonstrating that <italic>F. tularensis</italic> alters its surface carbohydrates during host adaptation to impede recognition of bacteria by innate sensing pathways and reduce macrophage activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Zarrella1">[72]</xref>. This remodeling likely plays a critical role in pathogenesis as null mutants of these genes are often associated with attenuation in mouse models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Li1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Weiss1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Kadzhaev1">[73]</xref>. The LPS of <italic>F. tularensis ssp. novicida</italic> has been found to be a poor stimulator of TLR4/2 signaling, which is thought to be due to unique characteristics of the lipid A structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Hajjar1">[74]</xref>. As the immune-stimulatory studies of <italic>F. tularensis</italic> LPS have only been performed on bacteria cultured in broth, it would be interesting to examine the structure/inflammatory characteristics of LPS purified from bacteria isolated during <italic>in vivo</italic> infection at different time-points.</p><p>In addition to alterations to the bacterial surface, activation of inflammation 48 hrs post-FT SchuS4 exposure could be caused by temporal expression of factor(s) that function to modulate immune response pathways. The inhibitory action of <italic>F. tularensis</italic> on DC/macrophage activation has been shown to be at least partially mediated by a secreted factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Bosio2">[9]</xref>. Analysis of the bacterial transcriptome in lung tissue from FT SchuS4-infected mice demonstrated decreased levels of numerous genes involved in secretion between 24 and 48 hrs post-exposure, suggesting the bacteria is altering export of certain effector proteins. These genes are part of Type I (TolC,), Type II (secB1, secE), Type IV pili (FTT_0905) and Type VI (IglC) secretion systems that function to export toxins and other virulence factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Larsson1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Hager1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Forslund1">[75]</xref>. Of particular interest is tolC, which encodes an outer membrane protein involved in drug efflux and type 1 protein secretion that has been identified as a critical virulence factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Platz1">[76]</xref>. It is speculated that tolC is required for the secretion of an unidentified factor, via the type I secretion pathway, that is involved in suppression of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. Decreased expression of tolC at 48 hrs could be an indicator that <italic>Francisella</italic> is regulating the export of factors which target host defense pathways.</p><p>An important finding of this study was that the nearly complete absence of activation of host innate signaling pathways during acute infection was unique to <italic>Francisella</italic>. Furthermore, the active suppression of TLR4 signaling was specific to the FT SchuS4 strain. Because of this, it is logical to assume that <italic>Francisella</italic> encodes unique effectors which mediate these suppressive effects. Many of the bacterial genes showing decreased expression have unknown functions and no homology to other proteins. Some of these, including FTT_1308c, FTT_1791, FTT_0172 and FTT_0181c, are unique to the highly virulent Type A <italic>Francisella</italic> strains. FTT_0172, FTT_0181c and FTT_1791 are among the highest expressed bacterial transcripts detected (approximately 5000 RPMK counts) at 24 hrs and then decrease significantly at 48 hrs. While they have not previously been identified as virulence factors, the correlation of decreased expression with induction of immune-related genes suggests they could be potential candidates as antagonists to innate immune pathways.</p><p>Temporal regulation of inflammatory pathways may serve to limit early activation of host defense responses that would eliminate <italic>Francisella</italic>, ensure survival of target cells to allow sufficient replication and also to facilitate release of intracellular bacteria. Many pathogens trigger activation of the inflammasome, a multiprotein platform that plays a key role in host defense by controlling the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1B and IL18, bacterial degradation and pyroptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Franchi1">[77]</xref>. Interestingly, <italic>F. tularensis</italic> subsp. <italic>novicida</italic> strains deficient for two membrane proteins found to have decreased levels between 24 and 48 hrs, FTT_584 and fopA, are hypercytotoxic for macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Peng1">[78]</xref>. This was linked to increased activation of AIM-mediated pyroptosis and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that these bacterial products are targeting activation of the inflammasome. Similarly, the tolC deletion mutant is hypercytotoxic to mouse macrophages, elicits higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and is associated with decreased bacterial burdens in multiple tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062412-Platz1">[76]</xref>. That these deletion mutants are associated with enhanced cytotoxicity, and in some cases reduced virulence in mice, suggests that <italic>Francisella</italic>-mediated suppression of specific innate immune responses may serve to delay death of key target cells required for replication/dissemination of the bacteria. Following exponential growth in the cytosol of macrophages, <italic>Francisella</italic> may then decrease expression of proteins which inhibit inflammasome activation to allow induction of pyroptosis and subsequent release of bacteria.</p><p>Collectively, the results of the current study highlight potentially important alterations in bacterial gene expression which occur throughout <italic>in vivo</italic> infection. Furthermore, it identifies candidate bacterial factors for future investigation into mechanisms of <italic>Francisella</italic>-mediated antagonism of host inflammatory responses. While the analysis was focused on bacterial genes with decreasing expression levels correlating with activation of inflammation, it is important to note that many others increased in response to <italic>in vivo</italic> environment and may also play a significant role in pathogenesis. This highlights the importance of investigating not only the host response to infection, but also the pathogen's response to the <italic>in vivo</italic> environment and how that is potentially altered throughout infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0062412.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression levels of </bold><bold><italic>Francisella tularensis</italic></bold><bold> genes in mouse lung tissue as measured by qRT-PCR.</bold></p><p>(EPS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0062412.s001.eps" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="postscript"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0062412.s002"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p><bold>Immune-related genes induced during </bold><bold><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic></bold><bold> but not </bold><bold><italic>L. pneumophila</italic></bold><bold> infection.</bold></p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0062412.s002.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0062412.s003"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p><bold>Immune-related genes induced during Type A </bold><bold><italic>F. tularensis</italic></bold><bold> infection.</bold></p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0062412.s003.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0062412.s004"><label>Table S3</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Francisella</italic></bold><bold>-specific mRNA transcripts showing decreased abundance between 24 and 48 hrs in lung tissue from infected mice.</bold></p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0062412.s004.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dr. Julie Bletz for her valuable scientific comments and manuscript preparation.
