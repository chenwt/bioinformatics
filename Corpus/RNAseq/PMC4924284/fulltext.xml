Field observations disclosed that <italic>Xfp-</italic>infected plants of cv. Leccino show much milder symptoms, than the more widely grown and highly susceptible cv. Ogliarola salentina. To determine whether these field observations underlie a tolerant condition of cv. Leccino, which could be exploited for lessening the economic impact of the disease on the local olive industry, transcriptional changes occurring in plants of the two cultivars affected by <italic>Xfp</italic> were investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A global quantitative transcriptome profiling comparing susceptible (Ogliarola salentina) and tolerant (Leccino) olive cultivars, infected or not by <italic>Xfp,</italic> was done on messenger RNA (mRNAs) extracted from xylem tissues. The study revealed that 659 and 447 genes were differentially regulated in cvs Leccino and Ogliarola upon <italic>Xfp</italic> infection, respectively, whereas 512 genes were altered when the transcriptome of both infected cultivars was compared. Analysis of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shows that the presence of <italic>Xfp</italic> is perceived by the plants of both cultivars, in which it triggers a differential response strongly involving the cell wall. Up-regulation of genes encoding receptor-like kinases (RLK) and receptor-like proteins (RLP) is the predominant response of cv. Leccino, which is missing in cv. Ogliarola salentina. Moreover, both cultivars react with a strong re-modelling of cell wall proteins. These data suggest that <italic>Xfp</italic> elicits a different transcriptome response in the two cultivars, which determines a lower pathogen concentration in cv. Leccino and indicates that this cultivar may harbor genetic constituents and/or regulatory elements which counteract <italic>Xfp</italic> infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Collectively these findings suggest that cv. Leccino is endowed with an intrinsic tolerance to <italic>Xfp</italic>, which makes it eligible for further studies aiming at investigating molecular basis and pathways modulating its different defense response.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12864-016-2833-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Xylella</kwd><kwd><italic>de novo</italic> assembly</kwd><kwd>Transcriptome</kwd><kwd>Olive</kwd><kwd>xylem</kwd><kwd>Tolerance</kwd><kwd>Differentially expressed genes</kwd><kwd>LRR</kwd><kwd>RLK</kwd><kwd>ABA</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>635646</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boscia</surname><given-names>Donato</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p><italic>Xylella fastidiosa</italic> (<italic>Xf</italic>) is a polyphagous bacterium causing important diseases of a wide number of crops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], to which olive (<italic>Olea europaea</italic>) has recently been added. In this last species a strain of <italic>Xf</italic> subsp. <italic>pauca (Xfp)</italic> denoted CoDiRO (abbreviation from the Italian &#x0201c;Complesso del Disseccamento Rapido dell&#x02019;Olivo&#x0201d;) is associated with a destructive disease named Olive Quick Decline Syndrome (OQDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. <italic>Xfp</italic> pathogenicity to olive has been recently demonstrated for the CoDiRo strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] further underlining the aggressive nature of this bacterium and its potential threat for the Mediterranean and European agriculture.</p><p>Being olive a new host, knowledge on the <italic>Xf</italic>-olive pathosystem is lacking, including the aspects concerning the plant response to the pathogen. The final outcome of a <italic>Xf</italic> infection is strongly influenced by the association that the bacterium establishes with the host plant, which could range from commensalism to pathogenicity. Indeed, in several species, <italic>Xf</italic> multiplies and colonizes the host without inducing symptoms, whereas in other, a classical leaf scorching recalling water deficit occurs. Hypotheses behind these symptoms rely on the occlusion of xylem vessels by bacterial colonies aggregated in a biofilm envelope and a plant defense response consisting in the production of tyloses and gums. This species-conditioned behavior, which likely depends on host physiology and/or response to the infection and on the peculiar <italic>Xf</italic> subspecies, is also reflected by the lack of virulence genes and effector proteins, which are present in the genome of other bacterial pathogens, like those encoding the type III secretion system. Because of all the above the current view retains that a disease occurs when the bacterium spreads and multiplies exceeding a certain threshold level and/or finds physiological conditions that make it shifting from a commensalistic relationship to disease induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]</p><p>A key question regarding <italic>Xf</italic>-plant interactions is to understand whether and how the host perceives a pathogen that colonizes the xylem, a tissue mainly composed, in its ultimate developmental stage, of dead cells. Choi et al<italic>.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] demonstrated that xylem-associated cells, particularly those belonging to the protoxylem, sense the presence of the bacterium or of host molecules, i.e. cell-wall degradation products originating from cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs) secreted by the pathogen. These authors propose a model in which <italic>Xf</italic>-infected grapevines affected by Pierce's disease specifically perceive the pathogen and respond to its presence by an abscissic acid (ABA)-mediated management of the drought stress imposed by the bacterium. Paradoxically, being ABA a negative regulator of the plant immune response, the possible host defense response is neutralized, thus provoking the establishment of the disease.</p><p>In a similar study, aimed at disclosing C<italic>itrus reticulata</italic> resistance to <italic>Xf</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] by transcriptome profiling, a clear response to the infection was detected, as triggered by the perception of the bacterium, that elicited cell wall remodelling and up-regulation of different hormones (auxin, ABA and jasmonic acid).</p><p>In both studies common defense mechanisms were identified consisting on the up-regulation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and the perturbation of cell wall architectural modification and enzymes necessary for biosynthesis of its constituents. Indeed, in grapevine and citrus genes encoding receptor-like kinases (RLK) and cell wall homeostasis are differentially expressed during <italic>Xf</italic> infections.</p><p>Plant immune response to pathogens relies on pathogen triggered immunity (PTI) and effector triggered immunity (ETI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Lack of type III secretion system in <italic>Xf</italic>, which facilitates the entrance of pathogen-secreted effectors into the cell, likely makes PTI the prevailing effective line of defense to this pathogen. PTI effectors are cell-wall-associated PRRs with or without an intracellular kinase domain, which act as signal transducer at the cell wall periphery after perceiving external stimuli. The final outcome of the perception is the activation of a defense cascade to counteract pathogen invasion. Elicitors of PTI are microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMP) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP), the latter being degradation by-products of the pathogen attack. Known PRRs with a kinase moiety are the FLS2 (flagellin-sensitive 2), the EFR (elongation factor Tu receptor) both encoding RLKs, that recognize the bacterial MAMPs flg22 and Ef-Tu, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A further well-studied RLK is the protein product of the Xa21 gene, which confers resistance of rice to the infection of <italic>Xanthomonas oyzae</italic> pv <italic>oryzae</italic> (<italic>Xoo</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The most abundant subclass of this large family of proteins counting some 600 and 1000 members in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], comprises leucine-rich repeats (LRR)-RLKs, characterized by the presence of diverse extracellular protruding motifs rich in leucine and other hydrophobic amino acids. This diversity is thought to originate from evolutionary events in response to the necessity of binding to various MAMP or DAMP ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Important events aiming at counteracting microbe attack occur at the cell wall periphery. This first pre-existing barrier undergoes an intense remodelling during biotic or abiotic stresses to maintain homeostasis and transfer external stimuli to the nucleus. Indeed, during water stress, which is the main effect of <italic>Xf</italic> infections, the involvement of cell wall is necessary to adapt cell turgor and expansion and preserve xylem conductivity. A further role of cell wall is related to its polysaccharide composition and its susceptibility/resistance to microbial aggression. Major <italic>Xf</italic> virulence factors are CWDEs polygalacturonase (PG) and endo-1,4-&#x003b2;-glucanase (EGase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], which likely digest homogalacturonan (HG) and xyloglucan (XyG), two major components of plant cell-walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The methyl esterification status of HGs, which is tightly regulated by pectin methylesterase (PME) enzymes and corresponding PME inhibitor (PMEIs) proteins, influences its susceptibility to microbial PGs. Notably, highly esterified HGs were found in intervessel pit membranes of grapevine genotypes showing resistance to <italic>Xf</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] whereas a down regulation of CWDEs PG and pectate lyases is observed in the resistant Ponkan mandarin (<italic>Citrus reticulata</italic>) during <italic>Xf</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Maintaining cell wall integrity is part of a defense mechanism that, by regulating the response to external stimuli and its impairment during pathogen attack, results in the release of DAMPs, i.e. the molecular constituents of membranes acting as regulators of plant immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>A possible strategy for the management of <italic>Xf-</italic>induced diseases is the identification of cultivars showing tolerance/resistance to the pathogen and their use in the field or in breeding programs. Field observations in OQDS-affected areas have repeatedly shown that plants of the olive cv. Leccino vegetate nicely and exhibit very mild symptoms, contrary to those of cv. Ogliarola salentina which are heavily damaged and succumb to infection. Specifically, the canopy of the OQDS-affected trees of the cv. Ogliarola salentina shows a progressive and complete desiccation, whereas in the cv. Leccino these phenomena are limited to few scattered twigs or distal branches. Indeed, a preliminary rough investigation, showed that there is much less bacterium in the xylem and leaf tissues of cv. Leccino than in those of cv. Ogliarola salentina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying these differential phenotypes and to gain knowledge on their response to infection, a transcriptome profiling of <italic>Xfp</italic>-infected plants of both cultivars was undertaken.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The population size of <italic>Xylella fastidiosa</italic> in cv. Leccino plants is lower than in Ogliarola salentina</title><p>As mentioned, <italic>Xfp</italic> qPCR detection assays had shown that cv. Leccino has a lower pathogen population than cv. Ogliarola salentina. To confirm these findings a calibration curve was constructed correlating known amounts of <italic>Xfp</italic> cells (CFU/ml) to their corresponding <italic>Cqs</italic> obtained by qPCR assays (<italic>not shown</italic>). Bacterial titer determined from the calibration curve showed that 14 cv.

Relevant results of this initial analysis are: (i) a distinct clustering according to the healthy/infected status; (ii) an extremely diverse transcriptome profiling of the two infected cultivars; (iii) a similar transcriptome profile of healthy plants, regardless of the cultivar to which they belong.

A recent paper reports the high concentration of these proteins in xylem sap of cotton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In this framework, the up-regulation of a number of transcripts belonging to the LRR-RLK family of proteins is part of this cv. Leccino response. These signaling proteins, whose orthologs are similarly up-regulated in <italic>Xf</italic>-infected grapevine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and CVC-resistant mandarin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], are the first barrier that the plant opposes to pathogen colonization. DNAJ6 chaperone belongs to a class of proteins interacting with HSP70 involved in plant defense response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. A similar transcript was up-regulated in the resistant Ponkan mandarin by <italic>Xf</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Furthermore the up-regulation of a NAC transcription factor was reported to have a role in modulating plant immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. This specific defense reaction does not occur in the cv. Ogliarola salentina</p><p>Transcriptional changes of cv. Ogliarola salentina consist in the up-regulation of several genes [G-type lectin S-receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase SD3-1, ELIP, expansins, LEA and short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (ABA2)] reported in plants subjected to different stresses with the aim to maintain cell wall structural integrity and protect cell components.

The weaker OQDS symptoms shown in the field by cv. Leccino with respect to cv. Ogliarola salentina might depend on a differential transcriptional response of the two cultivars. A lower bacterial titer of cv. Leccino, suggests that it may also exert a beneficial impact on epidemiology as it may result in a lower rate of <italic>Xfp</italic> transmission by <italic>Philaenus spumarius</italic>, thus helping with the containment of the disease spread.

This grove consisted of more than sixty 25&#x000a0;years-old olive trees of the cvs Leccino and Ogliarola salentina. For both cultivars the trees consisted in grafted plants grown in contiguous rows. Previous sampling and laboratory tests proved that the infection rate of this grove was close to 100&#x000a0;% (Boscia, unpublished information). Visual inspections revealed that all trees of the cv Ogliarola salentina had severe symptoms of dye-back encompassing the whole canopy, whereas those of cv. Leccino showed leaf scorching and desiccation limited to few twigs. Healthy trees for both cultivars were selected from groves located outside the infected area to avoid the risk of undetectable infections that could interfere with the plant response. The age and phenological state of these controls were comparable with those of the infected trees. From each <italic>Xfp</italic>-infected tree, mature shoots were collected from the sections of the canopy where branches affected by desiccation and dieback were present.
