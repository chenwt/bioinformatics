    "Glycogenes regulate a wide array of biological processes in the development of organisms as well as different diseases such as cancer, primary open-angle glaucoma, and renal dysfunction. The objective of this study was to explore the role of differentially expressed glycogenes (DEGGs) in three major tissues such as brain, muscle, and liver using mouse RNA-seq data, and we identified 579, 501, and 442 DEGGs for brain versus liver (BvL579), brain versus muscle (BvM501), and liver versus muscle (LvM442) groups. DAVID functional analysis suggested inflammatory response, glycosaminoglycan metabolic process, and protein maturation as the enriched biological processes in BvL579, BvM501, and LvM442, respectively. These DEGGs were then used to construct three interaction networks by using GeneMANIA, from which we detected potential hub genes such as PEMT and HPXN (BvL579), IGF2 and NID2 (BvM501), and STAT6 and FLT1 (LvM442), having the highest degree. Additionally, our community analysis results suggest that the significance of immune system related processes in liver, glycosphingolipid metabolic processes in the development of brain, and the processes such as cell proliferation, adhesion, and growth are important for muscle development. Further studies are required to confirm the role of predicted hub genes as well as the significance of biological processes."
