Transcriptome measures are increasingly affordable and provide an opportunity for developing a stromal versus cancer ratio in xenograft models. In these models, human cancer cells are transplanted into mouse host tissues (stroma) and together coevolve into a tumour microenvironment.

There is increasing evidence that the development and progression of cancer is significantly affected by interactions between the tumor and its microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], suggesting that the ability to profile gene expression in both stromal and cancer cell compartments is critical. Malignant tumors are composed of cancer cells and their associated host cells, which include blood and lymph endothelial cells, immune cells, fibroblasts and myofibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The host cells, also termed stromal cells here, make up about half of most malignant tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and have emerged as targets of anti-tumor therapy in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Currently, the best way to selectively isolate cancer cells from a heterogeneous population of cells in a tumor is Laser Capture Microdissection (<bold>LCM</bold>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. While LCM is increasingly used in the selection of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], the application of LCM to stromal masses presents several important technical challenges: (i) some cell types (e.g. endothelial cells) are too long and thin or intertwined with cancer cells to be isolated due to their infiltrating growth and (ii) the visualization of samples and accurate determination of cell type can be difficult because cellular staining via immunochemistry is not compatible with array analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, LCM of large numbers of cells from many sections and samples is rate limiting and cumbersome, requiring a considerable amount of time (1 day/sample) and sub-zero temperatures. Therefore, novel and affordable high throughput approaches are required to assess the expression of cancer and stromal cells to determine their molecular interactions. Further, transcriptome measures from RNA-seq or conventional expression arrays present the opportunity to develop <italic>in silico </italic>estimates of cancer cells versus stromal cell ratios, which otherwise require labour intensive quantitative histology measures across hundreds of microscopic fields per tissue sample.</p><p>Xenograft models, where human cancer cells are grown in immunodeficient mice, are popular for studying the tumor microenvironment. In such models, the genes of the stromal compartment and cancer cells come from distinct species: mouse and human respectively. While gene expression profiles of human cancer and mouse stroma have been analysed by human microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], this approach is limited because the human and mouse genomes are highly homologous and commercially available arrays are not designed for simultaneously measuring both mouse and human mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus, the interpretation of transcriptome intensities is confounded by <bold>Cross-Species Hybridization (CSH)</bold>, which we have biologically confirmed to exist between human array probes with universal mouse RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We also predicted that this CSH in xenograft models would preferentially occur among homologous human-mouse genes in human arrays resulting in combined gene expression signals where deregulated mouse stromal genes are jointly measured along with human cancer genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We previously hypothesized that deregulated probes on human arrays exposed to whole xenograft tissue experiments could be mined to identify those probes most likely harbouring human-mouse CSH (due to homologous genes and alternative non-homology factors), and that we could impute the enrichment of biological processes and molecular functions of stromal mechanisms via these CSH probes using Gene Ontology (GO) gene set annotations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. While many probes of homologous genes can be enriched for a GO signal, a limitation of this previous study is that this <italic>geneset</italic>-based approach is not designed to impute differential expression of <italic>individual </italic>mouse stromal genes. There is thus a need for improved species specificity of probes in newer arrays designed specifically for jointly studying stromal and cancer cell gene expression in xenograft models.</p><p>In many tumor biology and pharmacology xenograft studies, the interplay and co-expression patterns of cancer and stromal cell genes need to be studied using the simultaneous analysis of both species in the same array experiment. When tissue expression is detected using separate mouse and human arrays, comparing mouse and human gene expression requires complex and artefact-inducing normalization of the two datasets. Currently, there is no genome-wide dual-species microarray available. While whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of xenograft models provides an elegant alternative, the problem of disambiguating the expression intensities of homologuous genes remains (though the solution is quite different: an ambiguous RNA assembly problem). There exist two published dual-species partial arrays, in which one contains a mere 516 human probe-sets and 456 mouse probe-sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and a second contains only protease and inhibitor genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Previously, we reengineered the process of microbial diagnosis by designing a Panmicrobial array that contained 9,477 species specific probes (SSPs) to address 1,710 distinct vertebrate viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Drawing from this experience, we hypothesized that we could establish a comprehensive map of CSH in human and mouse arrays. We thus designed the first genome-wide human-mouse dual-species array (H&#x00026;M array) for comprehensively investigating gene expression of stromal. Furthermore, we also hypothesised that this new dual species array would allow for the development of a novel estimation of the stroma/cancer cell ratio via a cellularity index based on SSPs of homologous housekeeping genes as an alternative to traditional histological LCM assessments. Here we report the first genome-wide dual species array for human and mouse gene expression in xenograft models and identify novel biological functions for CSH probes, that until now have been misattributed to either human cancer cells or mouse stromal cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Datasets and custom human-mouse whole genome arrays used in this study</title><p>Microarray data from the two <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) are available in the GEO repository under accession number GSE23377 (initial <italic>in vitro </italic>biological experiment: GSE23054, version 1 GEO platform: GPL10714; <italic>in vitro </italic>validation experiment for CSH and stroma cell ratio estimation: GSE23364, version 2 GEO platform: GPL10749, <bold>Agilent Custom Array Order #023265</bold>).

Agilent also provided cross hybridizing estimates between mouse probes and human mRNAs and vice versa (7141 human and 6420 mouse probes; <bold>Datasets S2, S3</bold>), which are redesigned to correct for comprehensive CSH. We designed two custom arrays: the second and final one improved on the original design after biological validation. The H&#x00026;M arrays contain all legacy probes from the commercial human and mouse arrays as well as the newly designed ones (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <bold>panel A</bold>). The second and final custom H&#x00026;M array is identified as "H&#x00026;M array version 2" (Agilent GEO platform: GPL10749; <bold>Agilent Custom Array Order #023265</bold>). In an initial <italic>in vitro </italic>biological experiment, we cross-hybridize H&#x00026;M array version 1 with mouse mRNAs, human mRNAs, and a combination of both human and mouse RNAs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Step B1; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). We also conduct a parallel and extensive BLASTn analysis of potential cross species hybridization of probes (Step B2). Taken together the biological and the computationally derived cross hybridizations serve as a model for CSH propensity of probes, and have an extensive optimization method (Step B3). As shown in panel B of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, we conduct a second iteration of probe design (Step B4), and produce version 2 of the H&#x00026;M array. A second and more comprehensive biological experiment that cross hybridizes six arrays (H&#x00026;M array version 2) with mouse and human mRNAs is used for the final evaluation (Step B5; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and improved the annotation of the CSH of each probe (<bold>Datasets S2, S3</bold>).

Biological experiments are conducted to produce physical evidence of human-mouse cross-hybridization and are designed to identify CSH by independently arraying mouse mRNAs and human mRNAs (in the red channel) against the joint human and mouse probes of the dual-species array. Using dual channel technology (measuring two groups of mRNA labelled with different colors simultaneously on the same array), we also pool human and mouse mRNA in equal parts as a control on the green channel.</p><p>We first obtain human and mouse universal reference RNAs from ArrayIt (Sunnyvale, CA), which were derived from a homogenate of all tissues from the organism, making them somewhat representative of any cell type. This universal RNA is amplified and labelled according to the Agilent Low RNA input Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit protocol and according to Agilent's two-color quick amp labelling protocol. The two arrays are scanned with 5 &#x000b5;m resolution and 100% power gain at 600PMT for both Cy3 &#x00026; Cy5 using the GenePix 4000B Axon Scanner.</p><p>We quantify gene expression values using Agilent Feature Extraction Software and subtract the adjusted background for each probe from the mean expression value. Finally, we use an inclusion criterion to identify the probes that show some RNA binding where the minimum expression intensity has to be larger than a value of "1" when exposed to the pooled human and mouse RNA in both arrays. This threshold was set because when the expressed intensity was less than 1, probes vary widely across the two experimental repeats using the same quantity of pooled human and mouse RNAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Step B2: BLASTn analysis of cross species hybridization in array probes</title><p>The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] is run with default parameters to theoretically predict the possibility of CSH for each probe by comparing human array probes with mouse RNAs, and mouse array probes with human RNAs.

Therefore, we designed a custom 2x105k array (H&#x00026;M array, Agilent custom platform) combining all probes from both the human and mouse Agilent 44k commercial whole genome arrays (human: 41,000 probes; mouse: 41,174 probes).

Meanwhile, the optimal parameters for BLASTn result interpretation were selected as previously published (Figure D in Supplementary Methods of our previous publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]), where the sequence alignment derived from BLAST depended on the length of the alignment (varying from 1 to 54) and the BLAST mismatch number (varying from 1 to 12).</p><p>We further sought to incorporate theoretically predicted and experimentally verified CSH probes to the array. As illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref><bold>- Supp. Table S2</bold>, H&#x00026;M array version 2 included 7.1k new custom probes, containing 5k probes designed from experimentally annotated CSH probes in version 1 of the platform, in addition to 2.1k probes that the Agilent protocol suggested as acceptable but whose theoretical prediction resulted in CSH. Together with the 3.6k custom probes designed in version1 array, the total 10.7k custom probes covered 16% (5.3k) of human genes and 15% (5.1k) of mouse genes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref><bold>- Supp. Table S2</bold>). The set of BLAST prediction parameters derived from the initial <italic>in vitro </italic>biological experiment (<bold>Methods, step B3</bold>) performed better in predicting CSH probes than a similar set of parameters with shorter mismatch lengths <bold>(Methods, step B2)</bold>.

We found that biological GS3 that yielded a higher F-score than biological GS2. The former used relative CSH expression values (i.e. the ratio of the absolute CSH expression when exposed to the RNA of the other species compared with the expression when exposed to the RNA of the same species), while the latter used absolute CSH expression values due to the larger number of genes with multiple probes in version 2 of the H&#x00026;M array. A total of 4,644 probes on the H&#x00026;M array (version 2) were annotated as CSH, which comprised the top 5% relatively erroneously expressed (relative CSH) probes achieving the highest recall when compared with CSH theoretical prediction in Model 1-1 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref><bold>- Supp. Table S2</bold>). This threshold of 5% was derived from H&#x00026;M array version 1 probes, as version 2 included all version 1 probes. The estimated recall for mouse CSH probes was 25.6% (i.e. 25.6% probes were truly CSH among all annotated "CSH" mouse probes) and precision was 13% (13% of all theoretically predicted CSH mouse probes are annotated by our biological GS), while the annotated recall and precision was 27% and 11%, respectively, for human CSH probes. Additionally, our extensive annotation stratified all probes on H&#x00026;M array version 2 into ten levels according to their probability of CSH, thus providing array users with more flexibility to disregard CSH probes in their analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Validation of H&#x00026;M array version 1 annotation and reduction of CSH</title><p>The reduction in CSH was further shown by an analyses illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, which shows the comparison of version 1 custom designed 3,292 human probes and 3,530 mouse probes (y-axis) with the pair-wise probes on the Agilent commercial array (x-axis) for cross-species expression using the validating biological experiment.

We found no bias in GO or KEGG for the mouse probes of the custom H&#x00026;M array. Notably, gene ontology and pathway biases exist among the CSH probes on commercial single-species arrays, and should be accounted for on-going and future xenograft tumor studies. Here we are the first to report comprehensive analysis of CSH probes between human cancer cells avoiding these biases. We identified eight significantly enriched (FDR&#x0003c;5%) KEGG pathways (seven human genes and one mouse gene targeted only by CSH commercial probes), eight GO molecular functions (all among human genes), and conclusively, stromal functions detected when using a dual species array for xenograft tissues due to gene expression in mouse stromal tissues, rather than in human cancer cells (data not shown). Further, CSH probes confound the results of microarray analyses of the metabolism pathway of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 when xenograft tumor models were used due to the highly conserved nature of many cytochrome P450 genes (data not shown). Using Agilent 44k human arrays, Sugawara <italic>et al</italic>. reported 28 genes demonstrating higher induction in xenograft tumors compared to the cells in culture medium[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Our independent analysis revealed that 10 of these 28 previously reported genes are targeted by commercial CSH probes (data not shown). Additionally, we observed that the cytochrome P450 pathway involved in xenobiotic metabolism is enriched (cumulative hypergeometric pvalue = 1x10<sup>-5</sup>) in the CSH probes found in the list of 28 genes (data not shown), as would be expected for our xenograft model. Other significant pathways and functions listed that suggest relevant stromal functions include inflammatory signalling through the complement system, focal adhesion and tight junctions involving transmembrane proteins mediating intra-membrane and paracellular diffusion, as well as motor activity and actin binding, and thus possibly mediating invasion and metastasis processes. These results indicated that the design of dual-species arrays and the identification of CSH probes are critically important for studies involving highly conserved genes and pathways in xenograft models.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We established that overlooking CSH probes in xenograft models using commercial human arrays confound incorrect attribution of deregulated stromal genes to cancer cells. To increase the capability of analysing molecular changes in the stromal compartment as well as the interactions between cancer cells and reactive tumor stroma in xenograft modelling, we designed the first custom genome-wide human-mouse microarray, and biologically validated it by observing an overall reduction of the CSH (4.5 median fold reduction for human probes; and 9.4 median fold reduction, for mouse probes; p &#x0003c; 2x10<sup>-16</sup>, Mann-Whitney test). By design, we select a framework of well-established computational and biological methods to identify cross-hybridizing probes, construct a cross-hybridizing map, and identify new SSPs. Here, we provide a combined description of the interplay between the computational predictions of CSH of probes using BLASTn and observation of biological CSH that were utilized to develop an approach stratifying probes in terms of their propensities for cross-hybridization. We also implemented a rigorous rationale for the selection of a threshold needed to redesign the cross-hybridizing probes and offer the foundational datasets used for conducting analyses over a dual-species array: a comprehensive map of cross-hybridizations annotated with both sequence alignment and biological data intended to increase the accuracy and efficiency of measurements in tumor xenograft models. Additionally, we developed a novel method to estimate the mRNA ratio between mouse and human mRNA as a cellularity ratio, thus providing an alternative to conventional histological counts of stroma vs. cancer cells in xenograft models. Of note, the H&#x00026;M array could also be utilized in single species experiments, as long as the probes of that species are selected. This information is clearly available in the "species" column of <bold>Dataset S1</bold>. Further, for comparison of H&#x00026;M array results against previously published dataset using single species commercial Agilent arrays, the H&#x00026;M probes corresponding to the commercial platforms are annotated in the column "designer" of <bold>Dataset S1</bold>.</p><p>One limitation of the current study is that grouping all of the stromal cell types into one category may be too strong of a simplification of the complex cellularity of the host tissue. For instance, changes in the presence of certain types of stromal cells have profound effects on the status of the tumor, and stromal cells are thought to genomically "co-evolve" along with cancer cells during tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Also, the xenograft model involves immune deficient mice, and therefore cannot be used to understand much about the stromal immune cells and associated pathways that participate in regulating the tumor in the xenograft models. However, xenograft models re-constituting bone marrow cells from syngeneic donors may alleviate this limitation in future studies. Further, with the advent of RNA-sequencing, the utility of the present study may reside in our supplemental datasets that allow to reanalyze the species-specific probes of commercial arrays for comparison with RNA-seq experiments or to inform assembly algorithms of RNA-seq in xenograft models. Another limitation is that we have not considered non-coding RNAs in this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>There is ample indication that the issue of CSH is overlooked in xenograft modelling, as the majority of tumor xenograft studies utilize gene expression over human arrays indiscriminately with no correction for homologous probes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], leading to the incorrect attribution of deregulated stromal genes to cancer cells. Furthermore, commercial human and mouse arrays are shown to contain a large number CSH probes, suggesting that commercial designs did not consider the potential reuse of these arrays for xenograft modelling. While the computational methods and biological validations are straightforward and rely on well-established methods, the originality of this study resides in (i) appropriately computationally modelling the deceptively simple source of CSH (homologous genes) - a problem that has nonetheless been overlooked by microarray corporations and by many xenograft biologists in their array-related publications, in (ii) providing well-validated and novel work products: a detailed cross-hybridization map of human and mouse probes, as well as a cost-effective and superior array for expression analyses of human xenograft models, and in (iii) offering a new <italic>in silico </italic>metric for estimating the cellularity ratio of cancer over stroma that should in principle be applicable to RNAseq transcriptomes as well. This study's findings will improve our capability of investigating and interpreting the interactions between human cancer and mouse stromal cells in xenograft modelling. Together, these technological improvements will allow effective interrogation of cancer cell-reactive stroma interactions during cancer initiation, progression and response to therapeutic interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>LCM, laser capture microdissection; CSH, Cross-Species Hybridization; GO, Gene Ontology; H&#x00026;M array, Human-Mouse dual-species array; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; GS, Gold Standard; SSP, Species Specific Probes; HK, housekeeping genes; FDR: False Discovery Rate; CI, Confidence Interval; BLAST, Basic Local Alignment Search Tool.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YAL supervised the entire work; XY designed and conducted the analyses and annotation of data; YH conducted the online custom Agilent array design; YL performed the BLASTn programming; YAL, YH and ER contributed to the biological interpretation of the results; YAL, XY, HY, ER, VG and AI wrote and revised the manuscript.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S1"><caption><title>Additional file 1</title><p><bold>Supplement Tables and Figures</bold>.
