The alternative sigma factor HrpL directly regulates expression of T3SS genes via a promoter sequence, often designated as the &#x0201c;<italic>hrp</italic> promoter.&#x0201d; Although the HrpL regulon has been extensively investigated in DC3000, it is not known whether additional regulon members remain to be found. To systematically search for HrpL-regulated genes, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and bulk mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to identify HrpL-binding sites and likely <italic>hrp</italic> promoters. The analysis recovered 73 sites of interest, including 20 sites that represent new <italic>hrp</italic> promoters. The new promoters lie upstream of a diverse set of genes encoding potential regulators, enzymes and hypothetical proteins. PSPTO_5633 is the only new HrpL regulon member that is potentially an effector and is now designated HopBM1. Deletions in several other new regulon members, including PSPTO_5633, PSPTO_0371, PSPTO_2130, PSPTO_2691, PSPTO_2696, PSPTO_3331, and PSPTO_5240, in either DC3000 or &#x00394;<italic>hopQ1-1</italic> backgrounds, do not affect the hypersensitive response or <italic>in planta</italic> growth of the resulting strains. Many new HrpL regulon members appear to be unrelated to the T3SS, and orthologs for some of these can be identified in numerous non-pathogenic bacteria. With the identification of 20 new <italic>hrp</italic> promoters, the list of HrpL regulon members is approaching saturation and most likely includes all DC3000 effectors.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by USDA-ARS (U.S. Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service) CRIS, by NSF funding IOS-1025642, and by a graduate research fellowship awarded to Cornell student H.

However, if one or more effectors or its activities are recognized by the plant immune system (through resistance proteins or other mechanisms), the host hypersensitive response (HR), a localized plant cell death, is triggered and bacterial growth is limited <xref rid="pone.0106115-Abramovitch1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Effectors are examples of avirulence (avr) genes, a diverse group whose products typically stimulate a strong host defense response.</p><p>Efforts to identify genes involved in virulence and pathogenicity were initiated well before the genome sequences of DC3000 and other <italic>P. syringae</italic> strains were available. Experimental approaches included screening cosmid libraries for gain-of-function avirulence phenotypes <xref rid="pone.0106115-Kobayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106115-Staskawicz1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, using partial sequencing to characterize gene clusters flanked by pathogenicity islands <xref rid="pone.0106115-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and identifying proteins secreted by the T3SS <xref rid="pone.0106115-Yuan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0106115-PetnickiOcwieja1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Regulation of the T3SS was linked to the alternative sigma factor HrpL when a DNA sequence of length 32 bases upstream of <italic>hrpZ</italic> was recognized to support HrpL-dependent transcription <xref rid="pone.0106115-Xiao1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0106115-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. More comprehensive analyses of the HrpL regulon were possible once the genome sequence was determined <xref rid="pone.0106115-Buell1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. For example, a combination of promoter trapping and sequence analysis was used to identify functional <italic>hrp</italic> promoters associated with pathogenicity <xref rid="pone.0106115-Fouts1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. This work established a consensus sequence for the putative <italic>hrp</italic> promoter. Another high-throughput screen, also based on promoter trapping, identified 29 T3SS proteins in DC3000 <xref rid="pone.0106115-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Although the search for T3SS effectors was suggested to be near saturation in this screen, it was carried out using a HrpL overexpression system which might have been vulnerable to false positives. A microarray screen comparing WT DC3000 and a &#x00394;<italic>hrpL</italic> mutant <xref rid="pone.0106115-Ferreira1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> generated the currently accepted list of HrpL regulon members and 54 annotated <italic>hrp</italic> promoters, and has been considered to be nearly complete or exhaustive <xref rid="pone.0106115-Schechter1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106115-Lindeberg2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. More recently, HrpL overexpression and RNA-Seq were used to analyze the HrpL regulon in DC3000 as well as five other <italic>P. syringae</italic> strains, resulting in the identification of 14 new potential regulon members in DC3000 <xref rid="pone.0106115-Mucyn1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>Although multiple approaches have been used to characterize the DC3000 HrpL regulon, several factors suggest that additional members may yet be found. First, inventory strategies have emphasized the identification and functional characterization of effectors, and thus non-effector genes that are important to bacterial growth and survival may have been overlooked. An example of a gene in this class is PSPTO_0834 (alcohol dehydrogenase, zinc-containing protein) <xref rid="pone.0106115-Vencato1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, which is regulated by HrpL and strongly influences bacterial virulence. Second, effector identification is challenging because of effector redundancy and the frequent failure of effector gene mutants to exhibit a virulence phenotype. Many effectors, moreover, show no similarity to known proteins. Third, the <italic>in planta</italic> growth of D28E, a T3SS<sup>+</sup> DC3000 derivative from which the 18 clustered effectors and 10 additional effectors were deleted, is significantly reduced relative to a T3SS<sup>&#x02013;</sup> control strain <xref rid="pone.0106115-Kvitko1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106115-Cunnac1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. This suggests that D28E expresses as yet unidentified factors that are recognized by the plant, some of which may be HrpL regulon members. Fourth, it is not yet known whether divergent examples of the <italic>hrp</italic> promoter, such as the one upstream of <italic>iaaL</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0106115-Ferreira1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> actually bind HrpL or promote HrpL-dependent transcription. Finally, newly available genomic technologies offer enhanced sensitivity for the detection of transcriptional activity and promoter identification <xref rid="pone.0106115-Mucyn1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106115-Filiatrault1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106115-Rhee1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Together, these factors indicate that reexamining the HrpL regulon in DC3000 for additional members would be fruitful.</p><p>Here, we use chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq), and a modified RNA-Seq protocol (incorporating the capture of mRNA 5&#x02032;-ends), to provide evidence for direct binding of HrpL at <italic>hrp</italic> promoters and their activation by HrpL. The experiments identified most known members of the regulon (representing 52 out of 54 previously annotated HrpL-dependent promoters <xref rid="pone.0106115-Guttman1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106115-PetnickiOcwieja1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106115-Fouts1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0106115-Lindeberg2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106115-Lan1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>), as well as 20 new <italic>hrp</italic> promoter candidates. HrpL binding was validated using ChIP followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis (ChIP-qPCR) and promoter activity was tested using transcriptional fusions and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). Computational analyses were used to search for additional members of the HrpL regulon in DC3000 and to investigate the conservation of HrpL regulon members and potential <italic>hrp</italic> promoters within the available <italic>Pseudomonadales</italic> genomes. This analysis revealed that some new HrpL regulon members are widely represented in both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria. Finally, we conducted a translocation assay to demonstrate that one new HrpL regulon member, PSPTO_5633 (designated HopBM1), is translocated into plant cells in a T3SS-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>DC3000 and its derivatives were grown at 28&#x000b0;C in MG medium <xref rid="pone.0106115-Bronstein1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, Kings B (KB) medium <xref rid="pone.0106115-King1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, HMM (<italic>hrp</italic>-minimal medium) <xref rid="pone.0106115-Huynh1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, or on KB, MG, and HMM media solidified with 1.5% (wt/vol) agar. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> TOP10 (Invitrogen) was used as the host for sub-cloning and other plasmid manipulations. <italic>E. coli</italic> was grown at 37&#x000b0;C in Luria-Bertani (LB) <xref rid="pone.0106115-Hanahan1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> medium or LB medium solidified with 1.5% (wt/vol) agar.

Visual inspection of these regions in the ChIP-Seq profile also showed no evidence of enrichment. Because PSPTO_5633 and PSPTO_B0003 have identical coding and upstream sequences, we counted them as a single enrichment instance, reducing the number of novel regions identified by ChIP-Seq to 20.

The results increase the number of HrpL-responsive promoters in DC3000 to 73, including 52 of the 54 promoters already annotated in the DC3000 genome. The experiments reported here establish two important molecular details relevant to regulation by HrpL. First, candidate HrpL binding sites were defined by their immuno-co-precipitation with a FLAG-tagged version of HrpL, using both ChIP-Seq and more localized immune-precipitation experiments to confirm the ChIP-Seq results. All of these regions contain a conserved motif that closely resembles the known <italic>hrp</italic> promoter sequence. Evidence for HrpL binding at these sites has not been reported previously. Second, we show that many of these motifs are active promoters. They are closely associated with transcription start sites, defined using RNA-Seq to capture mRNA 5&#x02032;-ends that map to genomic coordinates immediately downstream of the putative promoters. Using plasmid-based reporter systems, we demonstrate that cloned regions containing most of the promoter candidates also support transcription in a HrpL-dependent manner, and we can also detect HrpL-dependent transcription from regions downstream from the promoters in their native locations using qRT-PCR.

With respect to new regulon members, five are shared (PSPTO_0371, PSPTO_0871, PSPTO_2130, PSPTO_2691 and PSPTO_4721). However, the two studies differ significantly when other new regulon candidates are examined. Fifteen new regulon members reported here (including PSPTO_5633; see below), and 12 in Mucyn <italic>et al.</italic>, are not in common. A likely explanation for the disagreement is that Mucyn <italic>et al</italic>. optimized their experiments to identify genes that respond to HrpL either directly or indirectly, and employed a cloned <italic>hrpL</italic> gene under the control of an arabinose-inducible promoter on a multi-copy plasmid. Some genes identified in this fashion would be expected to have no associated HrpL-binding activity or <italic>hrp</italic> promoter motifs in their upstream regions.

In contrast, the experiments reported here were optimized to identify genes directly regulated by HrpL.

Other proteins within the HrpL regulon share this characteristic, including PSPTO_3331 (newly found), PSPTO_0524, and hopAJ1. Our results are not consistent with a model in which PSPTO_5633 is delivered through the T2SS, either directly or indirectly, into plant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106115-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). However, since this experiment depends on the interaction of Cya with calmodulin within the plant cell, it does not test secretion through the T2SS <italic>per se</italic>. Additional experiments will be required to determine whether PSPTO_5633 or other HrpL regulon members are T2SS substrates.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>HrpL regulon members are represented in other pseudomonadales</title><p>The new HrpL regulon members are largely conserved within the <italic>P. syringae</italic> group, albeit at varying levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106115-g006">Figure 6</xref>). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0106115.s007">Table S3</xref> summarizes the orthology analysis for all 1060 <italic>Pseudomonadales</italic> genomes. Although the large size of this data set precludes a detailed analysis, broad patterns can be discerned. Orthologs for the core regulon components such as <italic>hrpL</italic>, <italic>CEL</italic>, <italic>hrp/hrc</italic> and effector genes are infrequently found outside the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>syringae</italic> group. However, several new regulon members are widely represented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106115-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Examples are PSPTO_1843 (aspartate kinase), PSPTO_3721 (enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase) and PSPTO_4955 (thiosulfate sulfurtransferase/phosphatidylserine decarboxylase) whose orthologs appear in almost all sequenced strains tested. Interestingly, in some cases these are accompanied by upstream <italic>hrp</italic> promoter motifs even in genomic contexts where HrpL is absent, although this is relatively uncommon.</p><p>Diversity in the number of HrpL regulon orthologs and their distinct patterns of conservation across the <italic>Pseudomonadales</italic> imply that HrpL regulon member recruitment is a complex process. A gene is likely to be selected for HrpL regulon membership if its expression confers an advantage in the nutrient-poor and stressful environment of the plant apoplasm, especially when coupled to the expression of the regulon as a whole. The assembly and refinement of a working HrpL regulon probably arises due to multiple evolutionary events, including horizontal gene transfer <xref rid="pone.0106115-Alfano1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, changes in coding regions that alter or eliminate protein function (e.g. conversion into pseudogenes), and variations in <italic>cis</italic>- acting elements <xref rid="pone.0106115-Mucyn1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> or the factors that recognize them. Promoter alteration may be the easiest recruitment mechanism for inclusion into a regulon <xref rid="pone.0106115-Wray1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>.</p><p>In summary, our analysis revealed 20 new HrpL regulon members. The combination of laboratory and computational methods used here makes it likely that the inventory at this point is nearly complete. One conceptual difficulty in &#x0201c;closing&#x0201d; the list is that relaxed criteria can result in candidates that satisfy one of several tests for membership (such as the apparent HrpL-dependent transcription from a region directly upstream from PSPTO_0816 in a promoter trap assay). We suggest however that evidence for HrpL binding, the presence of a motif, and demonstrated transcriptional activity together best define the regulon in practical terms. The remaining challenge is to determine what roles, if any, the new regulon members play in the process of pathogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0106115.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>Likely promoter motifs recovered by MEME using 5&#x02032;-end capture data from </bold><bold><italic>hrpL-FLAG</italic></bold><bold> and </bold><bold><italic>&#x00394;hrpL</italic></bold><bold> cells.</bold></p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0106115.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0106115.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p><bold>qRT-PCR analysis showing HrpL-dependent transcription downstream from 38 known HrpL regulon members.</bold> Relative transcript change was compared between DC3000 and <italic>&#x00394;hrpL</italic> strains.
