To demonstrate the feasibility of developing patient derived xenograft models in this stage, we present a case study wherein xenografts were derived from cancer metastases in a patient progressing on androgen deprivation therapy and prior to initiating pre-chemotherapy enzalutamide treatment. Tissue biopsies from a metastatic rib lesion were obtained for sequencing before and after initiating enzalutamide treatment over a twelve-week period and also implanted subcutaneously as well as under the renal capsule in immuno-deficient mice. The genome and transcriptome landscapes of xenografts and the original patient tumor tissues were compared by performing whole exome and transcriptome sequencing of the metastatic tumor tissues and the xenografts at both time points. After comparing the somatic mutations, copy number variations, gene fusions and gene expression we found that the patient&#x02019;s genomic and transcriptomic alterations were preserved in the patient derived xenografts with high fidelity. These xenograft models provide an opportunity for predicting efficacy of existing and potentially novel drugs that is based on individual metastatic tumor expression signature and molecular pharmacology for delivery of precision medicine.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding provided by National Institutes of Health grant R01CA174777 (to S.

Recent advances in massively parallel next-generation sequencing have made it possible to study cancer heterogeneity and clonal evolution within cancer [<xref rid="pone.0145176.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This has led to in-depth elucidation of tumor specific genetic profiles of several cancers including aggressive and lethal prostate cancer [<xref rid="pone.0145176.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145176.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145176.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, identification of genes that are somatically mutated or have an altered expression profile has yet to yield clinical benefit for patients with advanced prostate cancer. One reason for this could be that functional and therapeutic understanding of these genomic and transcriptomic observations is lacking. Patient derived Xenografts (PDXs) can transform genomic profiles into pharmacogenetic platforms for drug testing [<xref rid="pone.0145176.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145176.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and offer the potential for enhancing gains from sequencing studies. However, PDX models of prostate cancer have historically been challenging to establish, with a high degree of variability in take-rates reported [<xref rid="pone.0145176.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Perhaps not surprisingly, the take-rate with metastatic prostate cancer appears to be generally higher than the take-rate with primary prostate cancer [<xref rid="pone.0145176.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This signifies that PDX models developed from biopsies of advanced prostate cancer may represent feasible platforms for elucidating mechanisms of response to the newest generations of therapies [<xref rid="pone.0145176.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145176.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In this study, in a single patient we initially describe and then compare the mutational landscapes of metastatic tissue with PDXs from bone tissue metastasis of a castrate-resistant prostate cancer patient before and after initiating treatment with enzalutamide, a second-generation AR antagonist. We also determine the recapitulation of genomic alterations from serially obtained cancer tissue in animal models.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Clinical Case Presentation</title><p>The case presented was part of a prospectively conducted feasibility study performed in February 2013 approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board. The goal of the study was to develop PDX models in immune-deficient mouse models from metastases of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) stage patients undergoing standard of care stage specific therapy. PDX models were generated only in one of nine enrolled patients which is presented in this case report. Written informed consent was given by all participants for their clinical records to be used in this study including the patient with successful generation of the PDX models before and after enzalutamide therapy. The patient initially presented with recurrent urinary obstructive symptoms in June 2010. An investigative workup revealed a hard and enlarged prostate and transurethral resection demonstrated an adenocarcinoma with an initial Gleason score (GS) of 9 and a presenting (June 2010) prostate specific antigen (PSA) level of 0.95 ng/dL. He underwent nerve-sparing radical resection of the prostate on October, 2010, with final pathology revealing GS 9; pT3b (bilateral seminal vesicles involvement); N0 (0 of 20 lymph nodes positive for metastases) stage and several positive margins. He received adjuvant radiation combined with luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues which were continued for a year. Post therapy his PSA remained undetectable until August 2012 when it increased to 2.9 ng/dL. Staging bone and computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis were non-revealing for metastasis, but an acetyl choline positron-emission tomography (PET)-CT demonstrated multiple sites of bony metastasis. He was re-started on leuprolide acetate in October 2012, with bicalutamide for hormone sensitive stage and after an initial response progressed to CRPC stage in February, 2013. Prior to initiating therapy for CRPC stage disease, he enrolled on the feasibility study and underwent a research study biopsy of a metastatic rib lesion for sequencing and developing PDX models. He was treated with enzalutamide in combination with sipuleucel-T and indoximod on a clinical trial and underwent a second research biopsy after 12 weeks of continuous treatment with the above combination. At 12 weeks his serum PSA was observed to be 29.3 ng/ml (serially increased from pre enzalutamide PSA of 17.7 ng/ml after two measurements six weeks apart). His repeat imaging scan compared to baseline demonstrated progressive disease in the bone metastasis on a bone scan resulting in change of therapy to systemic docetaxel chemotherapy for 4.5 months and subsequently to carboplatin based chemotherapy after further progression on docetaxel.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Patient Derived Xenograft Methods</title><p>PDXs were developed from biopsies (10mm height x 1.5mm diameter) of castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) tissue metastases collected from the patient before and after initiating stage specific standard of care treatment with enzalutamide. Renal capsule xenografting and subcutaneous 25mg testosterone pellet (Jungle Jim, Fairfield, OH) implantation in NOD-SCID mice (Jackson laboratories, Bar Harbor, Maine; Charles River laboratories, Raleigh, North Carolina) were performed as described previously for the evaluation of prostate carcinogenesis and benign prostatic hyperplasia [<xref rid="pone.0145176.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Expansion of sub-renal xenografts was observed 4 and 6 months after implantation of baseline (visit 1) and visit 2 (after 12-weeks of continuous enzalutamide therapy) biopsy tissue, respectively. PDX tumors from each visit were further expanded in second-generation mice for molecular characterization. (Details of mice anesthesia and euthanasia are included in <bold><xref rid="pone.0145176.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Animal Methods</xref></bold>.) The initial xenograft mice were not biopsied again. The mice were sacrificed when their xenograft tumor diameter achieved 1.0~1.5cm, at which point the whole tumors were harvested. A portion of tumors were re-injected into the second generation mice. The rest of tumors were collected for molecular analyses, pathology confirmation or frozen for future use. Whole exome (WES) and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) were performed on patient tumor tissues and on 10 PDXs (four models from the first generation and six models from the second generation) (<bold><xref rid="pone.0145176.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref></bold>).</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) of tumor</title><p>Deep sequencing of exome captured DNA was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2500.

Unless otherwise specified, all tools built into Genome_GPS were run under the default configurations. Specifically, raw reads were aligned to the human reference genome (hg19/GRCh37) using Novoalign (VN:V2.07.13) with the following options:&#x02014;hdrhd off -v 120 -c 4 -i PE 425,80 -x 5 -r Random (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.novocraft.com/">http://www.novocraft.com/</ext-link>).

Reported SNVs and INDELs were filtered to exclude any variant found in the normal blood sample, variants outside the exons, variants of low or modifier impact, and any variant observed in the 1000 Genomes project [<xref rid="pone.0145176.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] or the Exome Sequencing Project [<xref rid="pone.0145176.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>All somatic copy number variations (CNVs) were called using an updated version of PatternCNV [<xref rid="pone.0145176.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], which uses reference samples to learn the pattern and variance of the WES coverage to better enable somatic CNV calling. The median reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) coverage and variance of a set of germline samples was computed for each 120bp interval overlapping with the location of the exome capture probes. Probes GC content bias was corrected by grouping the probes according to their GC content and by the number of copies of each probe in the capture pool. The peak density within each group was then adjusted on a per sample basis. The base-2 logarithm ratio (Log<sub>2</sub>R) of the coverage between a tumor sample and the reference set was computed for each probe. The Log<sub>2</sub>R values were segmented using CBS [<xref rid="pone.0145176.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] in the DNAcopy package, taking the predicted variance into account (adjusted for the coverage of the tumor sample). The log<sub>2</sub>R was then normalized so that the median of all segmented probe values = 0. After manual review and cross-sample comparison, a few samples were re-centered so that chromosome 2 had the same copy number. A threshold of |Log<sub>2</sub>R| &#x0003e; 0.5 was used to call a region as amplified or deleted. Tumor purity was estimated using PurBayes, with some modifications (1). Specifically, we modified PurBayes to simultaneously identify subclones and estimate purity for each subclone across multiple sequential time points. The criteria to estimate purity included limitation to variants that had at least 50X coverage, did not overlap a called CNV (|Log<sub>2</sub>R| &#x02265; 0.5) and a dbSNP variant, was not on chromosome M or chromosome X, and had at most one read carrying the mutant allele in the corresponding germline sample. Lastly, we eliminated variants that could have arisen from reads mapping to multiple locations by taking a sequence region of 101bp region centered on the variant and aligning against the human genome (hg19) using BLAT [<xref rid="pone.0145176.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Any variant with multiple genome mappings by this approach was not used in the purity analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of tumor specimens</title><p>mRNA libraries were prepared using Illumina&#x02019;s TruSeq RNA prep kit and standard protocol.

However, the precision was relatively lower (mean = 0.656, median = 0.657) compared to recall, suggesting there were considerable amount of PDX specific variant calls. This low precision is likely not due to mapping artifacts as the sequence surrounding those variants (101bp centered on the variant) has poor mapping to the mouse genome using BLAT [<xref rid="pone.0145176.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Presumably, PDX specific mutations mainly originated from two sources: host (mouse) reads contamination and subclone differences. Although we used Xenome to remove host-specific reads, this process is not completely effective given the relatively high similarity between mouse and human genome. Predictably, aligning mouse-derived sequences to the human genome would generate a considerable amount of false positive somatic mutations. In addition, the implantation of tumor cells in NOD-SCID mice could potentially change the frequency of tumor cell populations because of clonal selection, and such subclone drift could also produce many PDX specific mutations. In addition, the relative allele frequencies of somatic mutations were concordant between biopsy tissue and PDXs (<bold><xref rid="pone.0145176.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref></bold>).

Pre-chemotherapy PSA response rate to enzalutamide (decrease in PSA by 50% of baseline after 12 weeks of treatment) is 78% and a complete or partial soft tissue response rate is 56% [<xref rid="pone.0145176.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Recently AR-V7 expression has been reported as a molecular predictive factor of enzalutamide efficacy with AR-V7 expression being associated with low PSA response and shorter duration of progression free survival [<xref rid="pone.0145176.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Our patient did not have a biochemical or a substantive clinical response after 12-weeks of enzalutamide drug exposure and both his metastases as well as the PDX specimens were detected to have AR-V7 expressions. Interestingly minimal decreases in expression levels were observed in the pre to post treatment specimens at 12-weeks. While these observations on AR-V7 expression and resistance to therapy are in agreement with previous reports, the decrease in expression levels of this splice variant post therapy suggests a role for other resistance factors as well including a role for other <italic>AR</italic> splice variants (AR23, AR45) as resistance factors of drug efficacy. Alternately a role for <italic>TMPRSS2</italic>-<italic>ETV4</italic> fusion protein or the expression of other androgen regulated gene fusions with <italic>TMPRSS</italic> interference in determining enzalutamide activity is also unclear. Finally a role for non-AR pathway genes in drug resistance could also be involved. We observed deletion of genes such as <italic>PRKAG2</italic> in tumor tissue and PDXs, a key gene which inactivates enzymes of the fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways (a precursor of sex steroids) and which may affect intra tumor sex steroid levels. Increased <italic>FGFR1</italic> copy number was observed in tumor tissue and PDXs. Increase in copy number of this gene has been postulated to play a role in the development of initial hormone resistance to androgen deprivation therapy [<xref rid="pone.0145176.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Its effect on causing resistance to secondary hormonal therapies such as enzalutamide remains unexplored.</p><p>We successfully developed PDXs from mCRPC sites which were able to faithfully represent patient tumor heterogeneity. The concordance in mutation detection and gene expression levels based on exome and RNA-seq data between human tumor and corresponding xenograft tumors was very high. Some of the PDX specific mutations have low accuracy which might be due to mixture of mouse genome. These observations indicate that these PDXs were able to recapitulate the genomic and transcriptomic characteristics of the patient&#x02019;s underlying cancer. These PDXs now allow the opportunity for evaluating several hypotheses for mechanisms of drug resistance and ultimately develop novel therapeutics that can guide patient intervention. One of the main challenges of developing prostate cancer PDXs for individualized testing of therapies in real-time (i.e. tumor &#x0201c;avatars&#x0201d;) has been a highly variable take-rate, which may be due to several reasons including the source of tissue in prostate cancer (primary vs. metastatic); tissue procurement methods; mouse host strain and engraftment site (subcutaneous or renal sub-capsular). For example, take-rates have been reported to range from 5%&#x02013;95% for primary prostate cancer, and 25%-95% for metastatic disease [<xref rid="pone.0145176.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. An additional challenge to widespread use of PDX models for lab to bedside translation is the requirement for an immune-deficient host. As a result, PDX models are unable to faithfully recapitulate the relationships between different cell types and cytokines in the tumor microenvironment. This is of particular relevance when evaluating cancer immunotherapies or the role of the immune system in disease progression and/or response to AR-targeted therapy or chemotherapy. Another challenge for the successful adoption of using PDXs to enhance precision medicine is the feasibility of translating results from the lab to the bedside in real time after obtaining a functional validation of targetable genes. Finally, the availability of drugs that can be used against the driver mutations identified in this and other studies [<xref rid="pone.0145176.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145176.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] is another practical consideration</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Conclusions</title><p>PDX models remain an attractive option as functional tumor models if they are able to reflect the tumor heterogeneity observed in the original patient tumor through initial stages of passaging [<xref rid="pone.0145176.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].
