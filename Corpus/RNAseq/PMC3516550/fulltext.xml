To derive a systems view of how genetic loci interact in the context of tissue-specific molecular networks, we constructed an F2 intercross comprised of &#x0003e;500 mice from diabetes-resistant (B6) and diabetes-susceptible (BTBR) mouse strains made genetically obese by the <italic>Leptin<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mutation (<italic>Lep<sup>ob</sup></italic>).

By applying a causality test for genes whose expression trait is linked to two loci that overlap insulin QTLs (quantitative trait loci) and integrating protein-protein interactions, we constructed a network for each of five tissues under study.

To simplify the interaction models, we modeled the effects of two loci. Further analysis focused on interactions of genes with eQTLs linked to the top two plasma insulin loci, at chromosomes 2 and 19. We hypothesize that the joint regulation of plasma insulin at the two QTLs is mediated by gene-gene interactions whose expression variations are linked to the two loci. We further developed a novel ranking algorithm to infer candidate genes for regulation of plasma insulin.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Identifying genes with overlapping eQTLs with the insulin QTLs</title><p>Treating gene expression as a phenotypic trait, we computed eQTLs, for all genes expressed in pancreatic islets, white adipose tissue, liver, hypothalamus, and gastroc muscle of each male F2 mouse. We hypothesized that genes with eQTLs that co-localized with insulin QTLs are co-regulated by common genetic factors <xref rid="pgen.1003107-Schadt2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. We identified eQTLs within each tissue that had LOD profile peaks on chromosomes 2 and 19, the same genomic regions containing the peak insulin linkages. Among genes physically located within the insulin QTLs on chromosome 2 or 19 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003107.s009">Table S1</xref>), 89 genes have cis-eQTLs (gene expression QTLs are mapped to within 10 Mb of the genomic location of the genes) in islet, 66 in white adipose tissue, 52 in liver, 51 in hypothalamus, and 5 in gastroc have cis-eQTLs. Clearly, genes with cis-eQTLs may play significant roles in modulating insulin and methods have been developed to identify the causal genes with cis-eQTLs for various phenotypic traits <xref rid="pgen.1003107-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003107-Dobrin1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1003107-Kilpelinen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, each gene with a cis-eQTL can only explain the variance in the trait linked to its location. Here we considered a complementary strategy where we focused on genes with <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs and interactions among them that integrate perturbations from multiple loci. As a greater number of genes showed <italic>trans</italic>-linkage, it is worth studying the potential mechanisms by which these genes jointly mediate the phenotypic variation.</p><p>The expression traits that overlapped with the insulin QTLs were tissue-specific, and are enriched in different GO biological pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003107.s010">Table S2</xref>).

In addition, islets contained the largest proportion of eQTLs that showed linkage to both loci on chromosomes 2 and 19, indicating that similar to traditional complex traits (e.g. insulin), gene expression is also regulated by multiple genetic loci <xref rid="pgen.1003107-Brem2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Co-localization of gene eQTLs and plasma insulin QTLs does not imply the gene is related to plasma insulin regulation.

Several models of various degrees of complexity could explain the joint regulation of a common trait by multiple loci. As plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003107-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, the simplest case (M1) would be that the two loci directly regulate the same gene and that such a gene is responsible for modulating the trait. A slightly more complex case (M2) would be each locus regulates a different gene, which could collaborate directly through protein-protein physical interaction to influence the trait. In model M3, genes regulated by different loci interact indirectly and multiple steps exist before the perturbation signals merge on the common trait. In model M4, multiple tissues and their interactions are involved in regulating the trait. Here, we developed an approach that seeks to combine the first two models to identify those components of the network underlying insulin regulation that are modulated by the chromosome 2 and 19 genetic loci and that may be physically interacting. The more complex models is not considered here but left for future work. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003107-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, genetic variation at a single locus results in perturbations of biological functions that are reflected in the transcripts, or nodes, linked to that locus (orange or green nodes).

Model 4, each locus regulates one gene in a single tissue, and the cross-tissue interaction leads to joint effect on phenotypic variation. B) Interactive model for the additive effects between two genetic loci that regulate plasma insulin. Genetic variation at chromosome 2 changes expression for some nodes in the network (orange), while variation at chromosome 19 changes expression of other nodes (green) including genes regulated by chromosome 2 (yellow node). The blue nodes represent other nodes in the global protein-protein interaction network. Genes bound by grey curves are genes sharing same eQTLs. Nodes involved in an interaction between the two sub-networks (shaded in light orange and green) are connected by bold red lines.

To assess their potential in mediating cross group interactions and regulating clinical traits, we designed a novel ranking algorithm that integrates <underline>T</underline>rait, protein-protein <underline>I</underline>nteraction, and gene <underline>E</underline>xpression (referred to as, TIE score) to identify those genes most likely to play a critical role in insulin regulation. Instead of focusing on the property of individual genes, the TIE score incorporates an <italic>Interaction Potential</italic> (IP) between a protein pair. Because PPI data are not assayed in a relevant physiological context, we leverage the expression data, which is assayed in a relevant context, to weigh whether a protein interaction pair is relevant to our context of interest (i.e., interactions between diabetes-relevant tissues in the cross population). There are many post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications that may impact protein-protein interactions and their resulting functional activities. However, these modifications cannot be inferred by gene expression profiling. For a pair of proteins known to interact, we make the simplifying assumption that their protein activities and binding affinity do not change. We further assume a strong interaction potential (IP) if both genes are highly expressed in a mouse relative to the two genes in other F2 mice (since protein-protein association rates depend on protein concentrations in a simple diffusion model); if one or the other gene has relatively low expression, the IP will be weaker. We then calculate the correlation between the IP and trait, yielding a Trait &#x02013; IP Correlation (TIPC). The TIPC represents the potential of an interaction (instead of individual genes) in regulating a clinical trait. Using TIPC as a weight for each interaction in the protein-protein interaction network, the TIE score is then computed for each node based on the small sub-network formed by the node and its direct neighbors (see Method for details). A node receives a high TIE score if it has numerous interactions with large TIPC values. TIE scores are context dependent so that a given gene may have different TIE scores in different tissues, given that the levels of its own expression and that of its interaction partners' may be different between tissues. In contrast to other network-based approaches <xref rid="pgen.1003107-Deng1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1003107-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, the TIE score enables us to identify key nodes within a network that have multiple protein interactions with neighboring nodes, where such interactions are supported as exerting a strong influence on the particular clinical trait under investigation (in our case, plasma insulin levels).</p><p>For ranking purposes, we limit our calculation to genes with 5 or more interactions and set the TIE score to zero for the rest of the genes, given genes with too few interactions may spuriously influence the TIE score and thus lead to unreliable results. We also permutated gene expression for the nodes in the network a thousand times and calculated the empirical distribution of TIE scores to assess the significance of derived TIE scores (see supplementary methods in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003107.s015">Text S1</xref>).</p><p>Pancreatic islets had the greatest number of genes with a significant non-zero TIE score (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003107-t004">Table 4</xref>, and listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003107.s013">Table S5</xref>). Adipose tissue had many fewer genes with a non-zero TIE-score (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003107.s014">Table S6</xref>) than islets, and the other three tissues had no genes with non-zero TIE scores, suggesting that protein-protein interactions in these tissues may not be the mechanism underlying the cross-locus regulation of plasma insulin involving chromosomes 2 or 19.

The computational model we developed has several unique features.</p><p>Instead of pursuing <italic>cis</italic>-regulating genetic factors, it focused on networks of genes that were <italic>trans</italic>-regulated. The goal was not to identify the genetic factors whose variation at DNA level would lead to changes in circulating insulin. Instead, the model identifies networks of genes showing transcriptional changes as result of variation in the genetic factors. This is based on the assumption that the disease phenotype is at least partially mediated by these transcriptional changes. Genes identified by this approach could also have a more direct link to the disease phenotype compared to the upstream genetic factors. The model also simultaneously considered multiple loci, which enabled the study of the interactions between <italic>trans</italic>-regulated gene modules. As it is extremely common for complex disease phenotype traits to map to multiple loci, it is clear that we need models considering the joint effects of multiple loci. Ideally such models should not only be meaningful in the mathematical terms, but also provide biological insight to the possible mechanisms. Although the linear regression model indicated a joint regulation of the insulin trait, it did not generate any hypotheses on how the joint regulation occurred biologically.</p><p>Compared to other network models, such as co-expression network <xref rid="pgen.1003107-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, ARACNE <xref rid="pgen.1003107-Basso1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and Bayesian network <xref rid="pgen.1003107-Zhu2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003107-Segal1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, which focus on grouping co-expression of individual genes, our method focuses on dissecting potential mechanisms of integrating information from multiple co-expression modules. By considering the protein-protein interactions across the two groups of genes, it is possible to actually identify potential molecular mechanisms involved in joint regulation. Although currently the protein-protein interaction dataset we compiled may be rather incomplete, hundreds of genes were connected by these interactions. This makes prioritizing genes for experimental validation a more important task compared to finding out what could have been missed due to incomplete protein interaction information. To prioritize the key nodes in the disease network, we developed the novel scoring system in the context of the protein interaction network. As we posit that proteins their function by interacting with their neighbors in the network, the TIE score gives a weighted estimation on how strongly the intensity of these interactions correlates with the phenotype. A gene with high TIE score suggests that the intensity of its interactions strongly correlates with the phenotype based on large numbers of interactions. Therefore, the gene is likely to regulate the trait. By integrating genetic, gene expression, and phenotypic trait information, the ranking algorithm identified biologically meaningful candidate insulin regulators.</p><p>A previous publication has shown that, compared to wild-type mice, whole-body <italic>App</italic> knockout mice (<italic>App<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>) have elevated insulin secretion in response to an intravenous glucose injection <xref rid="pgen.1003107-Needham1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.
