Understanding how conjugation is regulated is important to gain insights into these features. Little is known about regulation of conjugation systems present on plasmids from Gram-positive bacteria. pLS20 is a native conjugative plasmid from the Gram-positive bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. Recently the key players that repress and activate pLS20 conjugation have been identified. Here we studied in detail the molecular mechanism regulating the pLS20 conjugation genes using both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches. Our results show that conjugation is subject to the control of a complex genetic switch where at least three levels of regulation are integrated. The first of the three layers involves overlapping divergent promoters of different strengths regulating expression of the conjugation genes and the key transcriptional regulator Rco<sub>LS20</sub>. The second layer involves a triple function of Rco<sub>LS20</sub> being a repressor of the main conjugation promoter and an activator and repressor of its own promoter at low and high concentrations, respectively. The third level of regulation concerns formation of a DNA loop mediated by simultaneous binding of tetrameric Rco<sub>LS20</sub> to two operators, one of which overlaps with the divergent promoters. The combination of these three layers of regulation in the same switch allows the main conjugation promoter to be tightly repressed during conditions unfavorable to conjugation while maintaining the sensitivity to accurately switch on the conjugation genes when appropriate conditions occur. The implications of the regulatory switch and comparison with other genetic switches involving DNA looping are discussed.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Plasmids are extrachromosomal, autonomously replicating units that are harbored by many bacteria. Many plasmids encode transfer function allowing them to be transferred into plasmid-free bacteria by a process named conjugation. Since many of them also carry antibiotic resistance genes, plasmid-mediated conjugation is a major mechanism in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance. In depth knowledge on the regulation of conjugation genes is a prerequisite to design measures interfering with the spread of antibiotic resistance. pLS20 is a conjugative plasmid of the soil bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, which is also a gut commensal in animals and humans. Here we describe in detail the molecular mechanism by which the key transcriptional regulator tightly represses the conjugation genes during conditions unfavorable to conjugation without compromising the ability to switch on accurately the conjugation genes when appropriate. We found that conjugation is subject to the control of a unique genetic switch where at least three levels of regulation are integrated. The first level involves overlapping divergent promoters of different strengths. The second layer involves a triple function of the transcriptional regulator. And the third level of regulation concerns formation of a DNA loop mediated by the transcriptional regulator.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Work in the Meijer lab was funded by grants BFU2008-04034/BMC from the Ministry of Science and Innovation, and Bio2013-41489-P of the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of the Spanish Government.

HGT can be beneficial for bacteria because the newly acquired DNA may endow them with novel features enabling them to adapt to changing conditions in the environment, i.e. rapid evolution. On the other hand, HGT is notorious for its role in the dissemination of virulence/pathogenicity determinants and antibiotic resistance. The main mechanisms responsible for HGT are transformation mediated by natural competence, transduction and conjugation <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Ochman1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004733-Auchtung1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The latter mechanism, -conjugation-, concerns the transfer of a DNA element from a donor to a recipient cell. Conjugative elements containing all the information required for DNA transfer of a donor to a recipient cell are often found on plasmids, but they can also be embedded within a bacterial chromosome. These latter forms are generally named integrative and conjugative elements (ICE).</p><p>Some basic features of the conjugation process are conserved among plasmids <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Frost2" ref-type="bibr">[for review see]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Smillie1" ref-type="bibr">[ 7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004733-Fronzes1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In most cases, a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which is generated by a rolling circle-like mode of DNA replication, is transferred into the recipient cell through a membrane-associated intercellular mating channel, named transferosome, which is a form of type IV secretion system. Conjugative plasmids can be exploited for the construction of tools to genetically modify bacteria of clinical or industrial relevance that are reluctant to genetic manipulation by other ways. Besides its intrinsic scientific interest, a detailed understanding about how conjugation genes are regulated is crucial to design strategies helping to interfere with the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance, and for the construction of genetic tools based upon conjugative plasmids.</p><p>Various conjugative plasmids have been studied in considerable detail <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Frost2" ref-type="bibr">[for review see]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Smillie1" ref-type="bibr">[ 7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004733-Fronzes1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Although most of the well-studied conjugative plasmids replicate in Gram-negative bacteria, an increasing interest in conjugative plasmids of Gram-positive bacteria has resulted in the recent analysis of conjugative plasmids from for instance streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci and clostridia <xref rid="pgen.1004733-GoessweinerMohr1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004733-Chatterjee1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. However, conjugation systems present on the Gram-positive soil bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> had not been reported until recently. This is most remarkable taking into account that (i) it is one of the best-studied Gram-positive bacteria; (ii) it has important industrial applications; and (iii) it is closely related to pathogenic and fastidious bacilli <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Sonenshein1" ref-type="bibr">[for review see]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Sonenshein2" ref-type="bibr">[ 18,19]</xref>. Moreover, several <italic>B. subtilis</italic> strains are gut commensals in animals including humans <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Cutting1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. <italic>B. subtilis</italic> plasmids may therefore play an important role in HGT in different environments. We chose the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> plasmid pLS20 for our studies. Originally, this 65 kb plasmid was identified in the <italic>Bacillus subtilis natto</italic> strain IFO3335 that is used in the fermentation of soybeans to produce &#x0201c;natto&#x0201d;, a dish that is popular in South Asia <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Tanaka1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Previous studies on pLS20 have shown that it is conjugative in liquid media as well as on solid media <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Koehler1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Itaya1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The presence of pLS20 has a broad impact on the physiology of the host, and the localization of some components of the conjugation machinery has been determined <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Bauer1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Rsch1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The replication region of pLS20 has been characterized, and it has been demonstrated that it uses a dedicated segregation mechanism involving the actin-like Alp7A protein <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Meijer1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Derman1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. pLS20 encodes a protein, Rok<sub>LS20</sub>, that suppresses the development of natural competence of <italic>B. subtilis</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1004733-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>Recently, we have reported a global view of the regulatory circuitry of the pLS20 conjugation genes. A conjugation operon encompassing more than 40 genes is located next to a divergently oriented single gene, <italic>rco<sub>LS20</sub></italic>, which encodes the master regulator of conjugation responsible for keeping conjugation in the default &#x0201c;OFF&#x0201d; state. Activation of conjugation requires an anti-repressor, Rap<sub>LS20</sub>, that belongs to the family of Rap proteins. Inactivation of the <italic>rap<sub>LS20</sub></italic> gene on pLS20 severely compromises conjugation, and conjugation was enhanced when <italic>rap<sub>LS20</sub></italic> was expressed from an ectopic locus. The activity of Rap<sub>LS20</sub>, in turn, is regulated by a signaling peptide, Phr*<sub>LS20</sub>. The small <italic>phr<sub>LS20</sub></italic> gene, located immediately downstream of <italic>rap<sub>LS20</sub></italic>, encodes a pre-protein. After being secreted, Phr<sub>LS20</sub> can be processed by a second proteolytic cleavage, resulting in generation of the functional pentapeptide, Phr*<sub>LS20</sub>, corresponding to the five C-terminal residues of Phr<sub>LS20</sub>. When (re)imported, this peptide inactivates Rap<sub>LS20</sub>. Therefore, activation of conjugation is ultimately regulated by the Phr*<sub>LS20</sub> signaling peptide. The Phr*<sub>LS20</sub> concentration will be relatively high or low when donor cells are predominantly surrounded by donor or recipient cells, respectively. Hence, conjugation will become activated particularly under conditions in which recipient cells are potentially present. In addition, Phr*<sub>LS20</sub> has a crucial role in returning conjugation to the default &#x0201c;OFF&#x0201d; state <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Singh2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>Despite identification of the players involved in regulation of the conjugation genes, our knowledge on regulation of the genetic switch responsible for activating conjugation is still very limited. Using a combination of various <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> approaches, we show that the genetic switch controlling pLS20 conjugation involves at least three layers of regulation. Together, they tightly repress the main conjugation promoter under conditions that do not favor conjugation, while maintaining the ability to accurately switch on the conjugation genes when appropriate conditions occur. The three layers involve coinciding or overlapping divergent promoters of different strengths, autoregulated expression of Rco<sub>LS20</sub>, which turns out to be a tri-functional transcriptional regulator, and formation of Rco<sub>LS20</sub>-mediated DNA looping. The sophisticated regulatory mechanism that combines three layers of control into a single switch is novel for plasmids of Gram-positive bacteria. The implications of the uncovered regulation mechanisms for conjugation are discussed in the context of regulatory systems present on other HGT elements and with other regulatory systems involving DNA looping.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Promoters <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>

Third, the spacer contains the extended &#x02212;10 motif (<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-TGn-3&#x02032;</named-content>, double underlined). Fourth, AT-rich tracts are located directly upstream of the predicted &#x02212;35 box which are likely binding sites for the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase &#x003b1;-subunit. Additional evidence that this sequence constitutes the <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> promoter was obtained by primer extension analysis to determine the transcription start site. The detected extension product is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004733-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>.

In the case of the <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> promoter, a smaller extension product with a relatively strong signal was observed 37 bp downstream of the extension product shown. The longer extension product most likely reflects the correct transcription start site based on the following arguments. First, it is known that AMV reverse transcriptase prematurely terminates cDNA synthesis when reaching a stem loop in the RNA, and that the prematurely terminated molecules map at the bottom of the secondary structure <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Shimomaye1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Loreau1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. The position of the strong signal coincides with the 3&#x02032; end of an inverted repeat (indicated in Fig. 3A). Second, no putative core promoter sequences are evident upstream of the 5&#x02032; position of the shorter extension product. Third, if the stronger signal corresponds to the transcription start site, the responsible promoter would be present on Fragment VIII<sub>c</sub> used for the transcriptional <italic>lacZ</italic> fusion in strain GR70. However, no promoter activity was observed with this strain (see text). And fourth, the transcription start site based on the longer extension product corroborates the RNAseq data. <bold>C</bold>.

One possibility could be that promoter <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> is located even further upstream. This does not seem to be the case however, because Fragment IA<sub>r</sub>, corresponding to the 1,014 bp region upstream of <italic>rco<sub>LS20</sub></italic> (strain GR62), also did not provide detectable levels of promoter activity. We then introduced pLS20cat into these strains to study whether it encoded a protein that might be required to activate promoter <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>.

In addition, the results show that the <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> promoter is located on Fragment I<sub>r</sub>.</p><p>Rco<sub>LS20</sub> might be responsible for activating its own promoter. To test this possibility, we engineered strain GR92 that contains the F_I<sub>r</sub>-<italic>lac</italic>Z fusion combined with the cassette in which expression of <italic>rco<sub>LS20</sub></italic> is under the control of the IPTG-inducible <italic>P<sub>spank</sub></italic> promoter.

These results demonstrate that Rco<sub>LS20</sub> activates its own promoter. In addition, the fact that colonies only developed a pale blue color suggests that promoter <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> is weaker than <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic>. To test this more directly, we measured <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> promoter activities at late-exponential growth phase using strain GR92 grown at different levels of Rco<sub>LS20</sub> induction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004733-t001">Table 1</xref>).

The results also show that Rco<sub>LS20</sub> has a triple function. First, low levels of Rco<sub>LS20</sub> are required to activate its own promoter <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>; second, at higher concentrations Rco<sub>LS20</sub> represses its own promoter; and third, Rco<sub>LS20</sub> is responsible for repression of the oppositely oriented <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> promoter. This triple function of Rco<sub>LS20</sub> is likely to have important consequences for regulation of the conjugation genes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">discussion</xref>). It is worth mentioning that whereas maximum activation of the <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> promoter was achieved when <italic>rco<sub>LS20</sub></italic> was induced from the <italic>P<sub>spank</sub></italic> promoter at 50 &#x000b5;M IPTG, efficient repression of the <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> promoter was observed by inducing <italic>rco<sub>LS20</sub></italic> with as low as 10 &#x000b5;M IPTG. Finally, the results obtained show that Rco<sub>LS20</sub> is the only pLS20cat protein required for activation and repression of the <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> promoters.</p></sec><sec id="s2a4"><title>The divergent <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> promoters overlap</title><p>As a first approach to determine the position of the <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> promoter we constructed strains containing <italic>lacZ</italic> gene preceded by different subregions of Fragment I<sub>r</sub> combined with pLS20cat to provide Rco<sub>LS20</sub> in <italic>trans</italic>. The transcriptional regulator Rco<sub>LS20</sub> is a DNA binding protein (see below). Therefore, a lack of <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> promoter activity in the reporter assay can be due to the absence of (part of) the <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> promoter or the Rco<sub>LS20</sub> binding sites required for activation of <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>. Since activator proteins generally bind upstream of promoters, we tested constructs having deletions at the 3&#x02032; end of Fragment I<sub>r</sub> (i.e. flanking the <italic>rco<sub>LS20</sub></italic> gene). Promoter <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> activity was detected when <italic>lacZ</italic> was fused to Fragment VII<sub>r</sub> (strain GR82), but not when it was fused to Fragment VIII<sub>r</sub> (strain GR116) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004733-g001">Figs. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004733-g003">3A</xref>). Interestingly, these results suggested that promoter <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> would be (partially) located on the 63 bp 5&#x02032; region of Fragment VII on which the divergently oriented <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> promoter is also located (see above, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004733-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). In a complementary approach, we determined the transcriptional start site of promoter <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> by primer extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004733-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). The determined transcription start site of promoter <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> is positioned 6 bp upstream of the &#x02212;35 box of the <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> promoter (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004733-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). This implies that promoter <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> overlaps with the <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> promoter.</p><p>
<italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> is a weak promoter whose activity requires Rco<sub>LS20</sub> (see above). It is therefore unlikely that the &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 boxes will be very similar to the consensus sequences. The following two sequences that may constitute a &#x003c3;<sup>A</sup>-dependent promoter are located upstream of the determined <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> transcription start site: (i) [<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-aaGAtA- 17 bp -TgTAAa-3&#x02032;</named-content>] and (ii) [<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-aTaACA-18bp-aAgtAT-3&#x02032;</named-content>] (mismatches with respect to consensus &#x02212;35 (<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-TTGACA-3&#x02032;</named-content>) and &#x02212;10 boxes (<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-TATAAT-3&#x02032;</named-content>) given in lower case, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004733-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). The position of the determined transcription start is optimally spaced with respect to the first but not the second possible promoter sequence. Therefore, we favor the first sequence to correspond to the <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> promoter. Interestingly, this would imply that the positions of the &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35 boxes correspond exactly to the &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 boxes, respectively, of the divergently oriented <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> promoter.</p><p>The results of the RNAseq experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004733-g003">Figure 3C</xref> (see also above) support the conclusion that the <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> promoters overlap.

In agreement with results presented above, the strain harboring <italic>lacZ</italic> fused to Fragment I<sub>c</sub> (PKS3) displayed high <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> promoter activity, but no promoter activity was detected when Rco<sub>LS20</sub> was provided in <italic>trans</italic> (strains PKS5 and PKS8). Efficient Rco<sub>LS20</sub>-mediated repression of the <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> promoter was lost however when <italic>lacZ</italic> was fused to Fragment III<sub>c</sub> (strains GR16 and PKS32). This strongly indicates that an Rco<sub>LS20</sub> operator site is located on the 368 bp Fragment II<sub>c</sub> and that this operator, which would be located at least 85 bp downstream of the <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> promoter, is crucial for efficient repression of the <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> promoter. Fragment II<sub>c</sub> contains an inverted repeated sequence (<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-ATCAAAATCAtgctgcaactTGGTTTTGAT-3&#x02032;</named-content>). To test whether this region constitutes an Rco<sub>LS20</sub> operator site we constructed <italic>lacZ</italic> fusions to Fragments IV<sub>c</sub> or V<sub>c</sub>, and also engineered derivatives of these two strains containing pLS20cat or <italic>P<sub>spank</sub></italic>-<italic>rco<sub>LS20</sub></italic>. The 5&#x02032; ends of these Fragments are located up- or downstream of the inverted repeat (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004733-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). The <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> promoter present on Fragment IV<sub>c</sub> and V<sub>c</sub> was efficiently repressed by Rco<sub>LS20</sub>, indicating that the Rco<sub>LS20</sub> operator site is present on Fragment V and not on the 212 bp region immediately upstream of gene <italic>28</italic> containing the mentioned inverted repeat. Efficient Rco<sub>LS20</sub>-mediated repression of promoter <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> was not observed for the <italic>lacZ</italic> fusion based on Fragment III<sub>c</sub> (see above).

Interestingly though, promoter <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> in strain GR16 was efficiently repressed when the concentration of IPTG was increased to 1 mM (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004733-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). This indicates that another Rco<sub>LS20</sub> operator site is present on the 201 bp Fragment III<sub>c</sub>.

Independent of the concentrations used, Rco<sub>LS20</sub> did not bind to Fragment X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004733-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Together with the <italic>in vivo</italic> data presented above, this provides strong evidence that this region does not contain Rco<sub>LS20</sub> binding sites. Also in agreement with the <italic>in vivo</italic> data, Rco<sub>LS20</sub> bound to both Fragment III and Fragment XII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004733-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Interestingly, the retardation patterns obtained for these fragments were similar, and resulted in the appearance of a maximum of two retarded species. The observation that the two retarded species were already present at low Rco<sub>LS20</sub> concentrations when the majority of the DNA migrated to the position of unbound DNA, strongly indicates that Rco<sub>LS20</sub> binds cooperatively to at least two binding sites present in each operator. In addition, the observation that DNA fragments entered the gel even at very high protein concentrations indicates that Rco<sub>LS20</sub> binds to specific sites and that it does not spread along the DNA. To delineate the O<sub>I</sub> and O<sub>II</sub> regions further we used overlapping and subregions of Fragments III and XII as probes. Fragment IIIA (130 bp containing promoters P<sub>c</sub>/P<sub>r</sub>) and Fragment XIIA (125 bp) both produced up to two shifts, and Rco<sub>LS20</sub> did not bind to the 46 bp region that separates these two fragments. This latter conclusion is based on comparison of gel retardations obtained with fragments XI and XII.</p><fig id="pgen-1004733-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1004733.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Analysis of the Rco<sub>LS20</sub> binding sites in the <italic>rco<sub>LS20</sub></italic> - gene <italic>28</italic> intergenic region by EMSA.</title><p>

Thus, gel retardation assays showed that binding of Rco<sub>LS20</sub> is affected in probes containing alterations in one or two motifs in either operator. For instance, Rco<sub>LS20</sub> did not bind to a derivative of Fragment III_A containing mutations in both motifs a1 and a7; and binding was affected when only motif a7 was mutated. Similarly, mutation of motif b1 or b4 resulted in the appearance of only one retarded species instead of two observed for corresponding fragments without mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004733-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). In summary, the results obtained show that the intergenic <italic>rco<sub>LS20</sub></italic>-gene <italic>28</italic> region contains two Rco<sub>LS20</sub> operators that are separated by 75 bp. Operator O<sub>II</sub> overlaps with promoters <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>/<italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> and the other region is located 75 bp towards the direction of gene <italic>28</italic>.

Next, we tested the responsiveness of promoter <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> to Rco<sub>LS20</sub> using strains containing either Fragment F_I<sub>c</sub> or F_I<sub>c</sub> +5 fused to <italic>lacZ</italic>. As expected, Rco<sub>LS20</sub>, which was provided <italic>in trans</italic> by pLS20cat, efficiently repressed promoter <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> when <italic>lacZ</italic> was fused to Fragment I<sub>c</sub> (strain PKS8). Promoter <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> was not efficiently repressed by Rco<sub>LS20</sub> however, when <italic>lacZ</italic> was fused to Fragment I<sub>c</sub>+5 (strain GR191). Thus, colonies of pLS20cat-harboring cells were blue when grown on Xgal-containing plates (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004733.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). These results show that enlarging the distance between O<sub>I</sub> and O<sub>II</sub> with half a helical turn destroys proper regulation of promoter <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> by Rco<sub>LS20</sub>. Besides affecting the phasing, the 5 bp insertion might also affect the static curvature of the spacer region. Regardless whether the loss of Rco<sub>LS20</sub>-mediated regulation is due to phasing and/or altered curvature, the results provide compelling evidence that Rco<sub>LS20</sub> mediates its regulatory effect through DNA looping.</p><p>Next, we analyzed by EMSA if the 5 bp insertion between operators O<sub>I</sub> and O<sub>II</sub> affects Rco<sub>LS20</sub> binding. As described above, even in the presence of the highest Rco<sub>LS20</sub> concentration applied, DNA fragments F_I, F_IV and F_V containing operators O<sub>I</sub> and O<sub>II</sub> entered the gel migrating to distinct positions, indicating multiple intramolecular Rco<sub>LS20</sub> binding events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004733-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, right column, first, third and fourth panel). Interestingly, however, whereas Fragment I+5 entered the gel at low Rco<sub>LS20</sub> concentrations, most of the DNA did not enter the gel at medium or high Rco<sub>LS20</sub> concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004733-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, right column, second panel). One possible explanation is that dephasing between the two operators allows Rco<sub>LS20</sub> to bind intermolecularly resulting in the formation of high molecular weight nucleoprotein complexes that do not enter the gel. Together, these results support the view that the phasing between O<sub>I</sub> and O<sub>II</sub> is crucial for proper Rco<sub>LS20</sub>-mediated regulation of transcription.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Conjugation is a complex and energy consuming process, involving the generation and transfer of ssDNA, synthesis and assembly of a sophisticated type IV secretion system, and establishment of specific contacts with the recipient cell. Hence, the process of conjugation and expression of the genes involved are strictly controlled. Analysis of the regulation of conjugation genes present on ICEs in bacteria and those on plasmids of Gram-negative bacteria indeed indicates that this is the case <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Wozniak1" ref-type="bibr">[for review see]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Frost2" ref-type="bibr">[ 5,7]</xref>. In our previous studies, we have sequenced and annotated plasmid pLS20cat of the Gram-positive bacterium <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and identified a large conjugation operon. We have also identified <italic>rco<sub>LS20</sub></italic> as the gene encoding the master regulator of conjugation, Rap<sub>LS20</sub> as the anti-repressor required to activate the conjugation genes, and we showed that the activity of Rap<sub>LS20</sub> is in turn regulated by the signaling peptide Phr*<sub>LS20</sub>. In this study, we analyzed the underlying molecular mechanism of how the pLS20 conjugation genes are regulated. The results obtained provide compelling evidence that the conjugation genes of pLS20 are controlled by a complex genetic switch, which is composed of at least three intertwined layers. A scheme of the three layers is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004733-g009">Figure 9</xref>. One of the levels results from the relative positioning of the main conjugation promoter, <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic>, and the divergently oriented promoter <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>, driving expression of the <italic>rco<sub>LS20</sub></italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004733-g009">Fig. 9A</xref>). The presence of divergently oriented promoters is a common form of gene organization in bacteria, and the (likely) role of this organization in transcriptional regulation has long been recognized <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Beck1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Nevertheless, direct proof for and detailed analysis of the implications on transcriptional regulation are restricted to only a minor fraction of the divergently oriented transcriptional units detected. Here, we identified the conjugation promoter <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> and showed that it is a relatively strong promoter, which is repressed by the master regulator of conjugation Rco<sub>LS20</sub>. Importantly, the position of promoter <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> coincides, or at least partially overlaps, with the divergently oriented weak <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> promoter. It has been demonstrated that an RNA polymerase can bind only to one of two overlapping promoters <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.

<xref rid="pgen.1004733-Bendtsen1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> described theoretical scenarios backed up by experimental data that overlapping promoters indeed can result in a transcriptional switch, provided that they have different activities in the absence of the regulatory protein, combined with a regulator that has a strong differential effect on the regulation of both promoters. This is exactly the case for the <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic>/<italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> promoter pair; in the absence of the regulator promoter <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> is several hundred folds stronger than P<sub>r</sub>, and the presence of the regulator strongly represses the <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> promoter while activating the <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> promoter.</p><fig id="pgen-1004733-g009" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1004733.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Model of the different layers contributing to the genetic switch controlling expression of the pLS20 conjugation genes.</title><p>
<bold>A</bold>. RNA polymerase acts itself as a switch because it is unable to bind simultaneously to both of the two overlapping and divergently oriented promoters. Consequently, RNA polymerase (the brown ellipse shaped form) binds only one promoter at a time resulting in transcription of only the gene(s) controlled by this promoter. <bold>B</bold>. Rco<sub>LS20</sub> generates a self-sustaining positive feedback loop by activating transcription from its own promoter (<italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>) (left panel). This, combined with the simultaneous repression of the divergent conjugation promoter (<italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic>), results in conjugation being maintained effectively in the &#x0201c;OFF&#x0201d; state. Relief of Rco<sub>LS20</sub>-mediated repression of the <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> promoter results in activation of the conjugation genes (right panel). In addition, this interrupts the auto-stimulation of the <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> promoter, preventing further synthesis of Rco<sub>LS20</sub>, which in turn will contribute in pushing and maintaining conjugation in the &#x0201c;ON&#x0201d; state. The negative auto-regulatory loop of Rco<sub>LS20</sub> that probably functions to keep Rco<sub>LS20</sub> within a low concentration range (see text) is not presented. <bold>C</bold>. DNA looping results in a high local concentration of Rco<sub>LS20</sub>, increasing specificity and affinity that dampens transcriptional fluctuations between and within individual cells (left panel). This would contribute to tight repression of the <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> promoter, keeping conjugation in the &#x0201c;OFF&#x0201d; state under conditions antithetic to conjugation without compromising the ability to switching rapidly to a high expression state (i.e. &#x0201c;ON&#x0201d;, right panel) of the conjugation genes when appropriate conditions occur. <italic>rco<sub>LS20</sub></italic> and gene <italic>28</italic>, -the first gene of the conjugation operon-, are indicated with large red and blue arrows, respectively.

We showed that, on the one hand, Rco<sub>LS20</sub> activates transcription of its own weak promoter, <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>, thereby generating a self-sustaining positive feedback loop. On the other hand, Rco<sub>LS20</sub> functions simultaneously as an efficient repressor of the <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> promoter. The dual effect that Rco<sub>LS20</sub> has on <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> maintains conjugation effectively in the &#x0201c;OFF&#x0201d; state. We also showed that the level of <italic>rco<sub>LS20</sub></italic> induction from an inducible promoter required for efficient repression of the <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> promoter was about ten-fold lower than that required for maximum auto-activation of the <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> promoter. These differential effects of Rco<sub>LS20</sub> on repressing and activating the <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic>/<italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> promoters will also contribute towards maintaining conjugation stably in the &#x0201c;OFF&#x0201d; state under conditions when conjugation should not be activated. Interestingly, we found that at elevated concentrations Rco<sub>LS0</sub> inhibits its own transcription. This negative autoregulation probably functions to keep Rco<sub>LS20</sub> within a low concentration range in order to respond accurately to the anti-repressor Rap<sub>LS20</sub> to activate the conjugation genes. The triple effects Rco<sub>LS20</sub> has on the regulation of the <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic>/<italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> promoters will also play an important role when Rap<sub>LS20</sub> induces the system to switch to the &#x0201c;ON&#x0201d; state. In addition to relieving repression of the strong conjugation <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> promoter, this will simultaneously annihilate autostimulation of the <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> promoter, preventing further synthesis of Rco<sub>LS20</sub>, which in turn will contribute in pushing and maintaining conjugation in the &#x0201c;ON&#x0201d; state.</p><p>A third level contributing to the genetic switch to activate the conjugation genes involves the DNA looping mediated by simultaneous binding of Rco<sub>LS20</sub> to operators O<sub>I</sub> and O<sub>II</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004733-g009">Fig. 9C</xref>).

Our results showed that the properties of Rco<sub>LS20</sub> and the DNA in the <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic>/<italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> region comply with the necessary features for Rco<sub>LS20</sub>-mediated loop formation. First, using different techniques, we show that Rco<sub>LS20</sub>, -predicted to contain a helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif in its N-terminal region <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Singh2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>-, is a DNA binding protein and that it binds specifically to two operators, O<sub>I</sub> and O<sub>II</sub>. Second, operator O<sub>I</sub>, which is located more than 85 bp away from promoters <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>, is required for efficient regulation of both promoters. Third, Rco<sub>LS20</sub> binds cooperatively to both operators. Fourth, dephasing the positions of the two operators by inserting 5 bp in the spacer region destroys proper regulation of the conjugation genes. And fifth, we showed that Rco<sub>LS20</sub> forms tetramers in solution. This will create a unit containing multiple DNA binding motifs, facilitating cooperative binding to multiple sites within the two operators.</p><p>The DNA loop in the <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic>/<italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> region of pLS20 is characterized by a small spacer region that separates Rco<sub>LS20</sub> operators O<sub>I</sub> and O<sub>II</sub>. The spacer length can be used to classify DNA loops into two categories: short or energetic loops, and long or entropic ones. Due to intrinsic stiffness and torsional rigidity of the DNA, loop formation is normally unfavorable for those with spacer lengths shorter than the DNA persistence length (approximately 150 bp), because the curvature energy required for forming such small loops becomes too great. For such short loops to occur specific features like intrinsic static bending or binding of an additional protein inducing bending are required. In the case of pLS20, in which the operators O<sub>I</sub> and O<sub>II</sub> are separated by only 75 bp, we show that the spacer region contains a static bent.</p><p>The first experimental demonstration that a DNA loop can play a crucial role in transcriptional regulation was reported for the <italic>E. coli ara</italic> operon in 1984 <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Dunn1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Since then, some other operons have been shown to be also regulated by transcriptional regulator-mediated DNA looping <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Cournac1" ref-type="bibr">[for reviews see]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Adhya1" ref-type="bibr">[ 38]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Matthews1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004733-Hochschild1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, though the actual number of transcriptional systems for which DNA looping has been conclusively demonstrated is remarkably low. In the case of plasmids, reports demonstrating DNA looping systems are limited to only few cases. One of these includes regulation of initiation of DNA replication at the beta origin of the <italic>E. coli</italic> R6K plasmid <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Mukherjee1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>; and in the case of <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> plasmid pCF10 it has been proposed that regulation of its conjugation system involves DNA looping mediated by the pheromone-responsive transcriptional regulator PrgX <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Dunny2" ref-type="bibr">[for review see, 45]</xref>. Bio-informatic analyses suggest that DNA looping mediated regulation of transcription is likely to be more common than the few cases for which this has been demonstrated so far. For instance, Cournac and Plumbridge <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Cournac1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> have screened the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome for the presence of putative &#x0201c;simple DNA looping systems&#x0201d; in which looping would involve a single regulator (i.e., this analysis included only transcriptional regulators for which the operator sequence is known, and did not take into account the putative loops that would involve heterologous proteins and/or global transcriptional regulators). Under these restrictive settings, this survey identified 48 genes/operons in which DNA looping mediated regulation is likely to play a role. Interestingly, fourteen of them involve divergently oriented promoters. In the context of our studies, it is worth mentioning the regulation of the conjugation genes located on the integrative and conjugative element ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> that is present in several <italic>B. subtilis</italic> strains. The gene encoding the transcriptional regulator ImmR, and the excision and conjugation genes are expressed from two divergently oriented promoters that are separated by &#x0223c;130 bp. At low concentrations, the ImmR protein can bind to six regions, three being proximal to each promoter. It has been suggested that repression of the <italic>imm</italic>R promoter might involve cooperative interactions between ImmR molecules bound to binding sites proximal to both promoters, i.e. DNA looping <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Auchtung2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Based on the distribution of the operator sites, DNA looping could also be involved in the transcriptional regulation of the Gram-negative plasmids Ti or IncP-plasmids, where divergent promoters have been shown to be involved in controlling both the replication and transfer functions <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Zatyka1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Lang1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.</p><p>What are the benefits of DNA looping in general and for the regulation of the conjugation genes of pLS20 in particular? A major consequence of DNA looping is that it results in a high local concentration of the transcriptional regulator at the right place, which would increase its specificity and affinity <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Oehler1" ref-type="bibr">[for recent review see, 49]</xref>. Often, -and Rco<sub>LS20</sub> is not an exception-, transcriptional regulators are produced in limited amounts per cell. Low numbers of regulators enhance the possibility of transcriptional fluctuations between individual cells within a population. In addition, the intrinsic stochasticity of transcription, -also referred to as noise-, affects the temporal effectiveness of transcriptional regulation; again this is especially prominent when the number of regulatory proteins involved is low. Recent evidences indicate that DNA looping contributes importantly to controlling temporal transcriptional noise, as well as dampening transcriptional fluctuations between cells within a population <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Vilar1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Saiz1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Thus, DNA looping contributes to the tight regulation of promoters especially when levels of transcriptional regulators are low by diminishing stochastic fluctuations in transcription.</p><p>For some differentiation processes, cell-to-cell or stochastic variability in levels of transcriptional regulators form the basis for activation of these processes, resulting in different behavior of genetically identical cells within a population <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Korobkova1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004733-Veening1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Examples of these processes are the formation of persister cells, development of natural genetic competence, spore formation and swimming/chaining. It is believed that such a bet-hedging strategy is beneficial for the fitness of the species because there will always be some cells that are prepared to cope with a deteriorating environmental condition that may arise in the near future. However, for other processes, there may not be such an advantage and it would then be important to tightly repress the process at times when conditions for that process are not apt. Conjugation probably is such a process because there is no benefit in activating the conjugation genes when there is no recipient present to receive the plasmid. The fact that the efficiency of pLS20 transfer during growth conditions antithetic to conjugation is below the detection limit (at least six orders of magnitude lower than those observed during optimal conjugation conditions) strongly indicates that conjugation genes are tightly repressed under such conditions. However, the tight repression of conjugation should not compromise the ability of rapidly switching to high expression of the conjugation genes when appropriate conditions occur. In pLS20 this is achieved by the constellation of DNA looping combined with autoregulated expression of Rco<sub>LS20</sub> and overlapping divergent promoters of different strength.</p><p>A well-studied genetic switch involving DNA looping is the one that governs the switch from the lysogenic to the lytic state of the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> phage &#x003bb; <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Dodd1" ref-type="bibr">[for review see]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Oppenheim1" ref-type="bibr">[ 55,56]</xref>. In the lysogenic or prophage state, phage &#x003bb; replicates passively with the host while the lytic genes are repressed. This prophage state is extremely stable and can be maintained for many generations. Upon induction of the SOS response, however, a switch is made to the lytic cycle resulting in excision of the phage genome, followed by its amplification and eventually lysis of the cell and release of phage progeny. The early lytic phage &#x003bb; genes are located in two divergently oriented operons, which are controlled by the lytic promoters <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>L</sub></italic>. A third operon, which encodes amongst others the CI transcriptional regulator, is located in between the two early lytic operons such that the promoter of gene <italic>cI</italic>, <italic>P<sub>RM</sub></italic>, flanks the divergently oriented <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> promoter driving expression of one of the two early operons. In several aspects, functional analogies exist between CI and Rco<sub>LS20</sub> although they share only 16% of identity at their primary protein sequence level. Both Rco<sub>LS20</sub> and CI stimulate and repress their own promoter at low and high concentrations, respectively, resulting in a self-sustaining positive feedback loop while keeping the transcriptional regulator in a low concentration range. Above, arguments have been given that for pLS20 this situation, together with the effects of the DNA loop, is important for the tight repression of the <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> promoter during conditions in which conjugation is not favourable, while maintaining the sensitivity to be able to respond rapidly to switch on the conjugation genes when appropriate conditions occur. The transcriptional regulation of &#x003bb; appears to serve a similar purpose. Thus, on the one hand the lytic genes are tightly repressed since spontaneous switching to the lytic cycle occurs less than once every 10<sup>8</sup> generations <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Little1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. On the other hand, mutations that specifically eliminate the negative autoregulation of <italic>cI</italic> expression impair prophage induction <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Dodd2" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Dodd3" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Another analogy between the pLS20 and &#x003bb; systems is that both the regulators Rco<sub>LS20</sub> and CI, can form higher order oligomers, permitting them to bind cooperatively to multiple sites distributed in two operators, effectively resulting in DNA looping which plays an important role in the genetic regulation of the conjugation and the lytic operon, respectively. Taking the analogy further, it is interesting to note that these regulatory systems both control a process of horizontal gene transfer.</p><p>However, there are also several differences between the two systems. For instance, whereas regulation of pLS20 conjugation genes involves a short loop of 75 bp, regulation of the &#x003bb; lytic genes involves a long loop of 2.3 kb. A second difference is that CI protein forms dimers in solution. A pair of CI dimers tetramerizes when binding to the binding sites in one operator and another dimer pair does the same when binding to the other operator. Upon DNA looping, interaction between the two tetramers constitutes a functional octamer. In addition, when a loop is formed another pair of dimers may bind to additional binding sites present in both operators, and this additional bridge is responsible for repressing <italic>P<sub>RM</sub></italic> promoter. At present, we do not have such detailed insights in transcriptional regulations at the molecular level for Rco<sub>LS20</sub>. However, instead of dimers, Rco<sub>LS20</sub> forms tetramers in solution, which probably means that the molecular mechanism by which the pLS20 promoters <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> are regulated is distinct from the way CI regulates &#x003bb; promoters <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>RM</sub></italic>. Another argument supporting this assumption is the different configuration of the divergent promoters and the binding sites for the regulator protein. In pLS20, the position of promoters <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic>/<italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> overlaps and the Rco<sub>LS20</sub> binding sites in O<sub>II</sub> overlap and flank these core promoters. In &#x003bb; the binding sites for CI regulator in one operator overlap the <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> promoter and are located upstream of the <italic>P<sub>RM</sub></italic> core promoter sequences. Finally, a major difference between the DNA looping involved systems of pLS20 and &#x003bb; is how the switches are induced. In &#x003bb;, the switch is induced by an SOS response which results in RecA-mediated CI autocleavage. In the case of pLS20, the switch is dictated ultimately by intercellular quorum sensing signaling involving the signaling peptide Phr*<sub>LS20</sub> that regulates the activity of Rap<sub>LS20</sub>, the anti-repressor of Rco<sub>LS20</sub>
<xref rid="pgen.1004733-Singh2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. This quorum sensing system will lead to activation of the conjugation genes when donor cells are surrounded by recipient cells. However, high levels of Phr*<sub>LS20</sub> will build up when the majority of the cells that surround a donor cell already contain pLS20, and this will inactivate Rap<sub>LS20</sub> and hence block activation of the conjugation genes.</p><p>Besides those described here, it is possible that the pLS20 conjugation genes are regulated by additional mechanism(s). For example, the conspicuously long 5&#x02032; untranslated region upstream of gene <italic>28</italic> is predicted to form complex secondary structures, which might modulate expression of the downstream genes in a variety of scenarios. Currently, a study to elucidate a possible role of this long 5&#x02032; untranslated region is carried out in our laboratory.</p><p>In summary, in this work we have provided evidence that regulation of the conjugation genes present on pLS20 is based on a unique genetic switch that combines at least three levels of control. These include (i) overlapping divergent promoters of different strengths, (ii) auto-stimulation and repression of the weak <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> promoter by the transcriptional regulator at low and elevated concentrations, respectively, combined with simultaneous repression of the divergent strong conjugation promoter, and (iii) DNA looping mediated by binding of Rco<sub>LS20</sub> regulator to two operators separated by a short loop. Most likely, the combination of these different layers causes tight repression of the main conjugation promoter <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> when conditions for conjugation are not optimal, while allowing the system to switch rapidly to high expression of the conjugation genes when appropriate conditions occur.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Bacterial strains, plasmids, media and oligonucleotides</title><p>Bacterial strains were grown in LB liquid medium or on 1.5% LB agar plates <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Sambrook1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>.

Weight-average buoyant molecular weights of protein were determined by fitting a single species model to the experimental data using the HeteroAnalysis program <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Cole1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>, and corrected for solvent composition and temperature with the program SEDNTERP <xref rid="pgen.1004733-Laue1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1004733.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>The <italic>rco<sub>LS20</sub></italic> &#x02013; gene <italic>28</italic> intergenic region contains a strong promoter that is inhibited by the pLS20cat encoded protein Rco<sub>LS20</sub>.
