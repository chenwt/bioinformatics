While similar in purpose, there are fundamental differences between the two technologies. Here, we present the largest comparative study between microarray and RNAseq methods to date using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. We found high correlations between expression data obtained from the Affymetrix one-channel microarray and RNAseq (Spearman correlations coefficients of &#x0223c;0.8). We also observed that the low abundance genes had poorer correlations between microarray and RNAseq data than high abundance genes. As expected, due to measurement and normalization differences, Agilent two-channel microarray and RNAseq data were poorly correlated (Spearman correlations coefficients of only &#x0223c;0.2). By examining the differentially expressed genes between tumor and normal samples we observed reasonable concordance in directionality between Agilent two-channel microarray and RNAseq data, although a small group of genes were found to have expression changes reported in opposite directions using these two technologies. Overall, RNAseq produces comparable results to microarray technologies in term of expression profiling. The RNAseq normalization methods RPKM and RSEM produce similar results on the gene level and reasonably concordant results on the exon level. Longer exons tended to have better concordance between the two normalization methods than shorter exons.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors have no support or funding to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>Gene expression analysis is essential for biomedical research. Expression profiling is the simultaneous measurement of the cellular concentration of different messenger RNAs. Microarrays have been the most popular high-throughput gene expression profiling technology for several decades. Recently, the introduction of RNAseq technology has had a revolutionary impact on the field of expression research. RNAseq refers to the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to sequence cDNA in order to get information about a sample's RNA content. Compared to the microarray technology, the RNAseq method offers several distinct advantages. First, the detection range of RNAseq is not limited to a set of predetermined probes as with the microarray technology, so RNAseq is capable of identifying new genes. Second, the resolution of a microarray is limited to the gene level for most arrays and the exon level for specially designed exon arrays. On the other hand, RNAseq can detect expression at the gene, exon, transcript, and coding DNA sequence (CDS) levels. Finally and most importantly, RNAseq can detect structural variants such as alternative splicing and gene fusion. With the maturity of NGS technologies, the price of RNAseq has become comparable to microarrays. The competitive price and additional genomic information make RNAseq an attractive alternative technology for expression profiling. Some researchers have predicted the inevitable replacement of microarray by RNAseq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Wang1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Shendure1">[2]</xref>. However, before this replacement can occur, we must understand the differences and similarities of these two technologies.</p><p>There are two standard microarray detection paradigms: one-channel and two-channel, also known as one-color and two-color detection. Two-channel microarrays are hybridized with cDNA from a pair of samples to be compared, with one sample labelled with fluorescent Cy3 at a fluorescence emission wavelength of 570 nm (green), and the other with Cy5 at a fluorescence emission wavelength of 670 nm (red). After labelling, the two samples are mixed and hybridized to one microarray. The microarray is then scanned for fluorescence intensity. Gene expression identified from a two channel microarray is often represented as a ratio of Cy3/Cy5. In one-channel microarrays, usually only Cy3 is used and only a single sample is hybridized to one microarray. Thus, two-channel microarrays do not truly reflect the abundance levels of a gene transcript but rather the relative abundance between two samples. A study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Patterson1">[3]</xref> has shown good agreement with high correlation coefficients and high concordance of differentially expressed gene lists between one-color and two-color microarrays.</p><p>The Microarray Quality Control (MAQC) project has shown that there is a high level of intra-platform consistency across test sites and inter-platform concordance in terms of genes identified as differentially expressed by microarray methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Shi1">[4]</xref>. Similar to these microarray tests, RNAseq data has been shown to estimate expression level with high reproducibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Marioni1">[5]</xref>. The majority of the previous studies showed moderate to good concordance rate between microarray and RNAseq results. However, few studies have focused on human gene expression consistency between RNAseq and microarray methods. The majority of existing studies have focused on non-human samples such as Candida parapsilolis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Bloom1">[6]</xref>, Candida albicans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Marioni1">[5]</xref>, fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Wilhelm1">[7]</xref>, Drosophila melanogaster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Malone1">[8]</xref>, Saccharomyces cerevisiae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Nookaew1">[9]</xref>, Caenorhabditis elegans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Liu1">[10]</xref>, mouse tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Liu1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-tHoen1">[11]</xref>, and rat tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Su1">[12]</xref>. A few studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Marioni1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Asmann1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Cloonan1">[14]</xref> have performed comparisons using human samples or cell lines, but the sample sizes of those studies were very limited. A large scale, comprehensive analysis of RNAseq and microarray gene expression consistency using human data would benefit the research community and serve as guidance for future studies. A perfect dataset for conducting such a study is The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-2">[16]</xref>.</p><p>TCGA is a massive, comprehensive, and collaborative project to catalogue genomic data for over 20 types of cancers by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), and 27 institutes and centers of the National Institute of Health (NIH). Gene expression profiling is one of the major components of genomic data collected by TCGA. However, use of the gene expression profiling data in TCGA is complicated by the fact the gene expression data reported was obtained through a mixture of microarray and RNAseq technologies. Fortunately, many of TCGA's samples have had gene expression quantified using both technologies. This provided a good opportunity to study the repeatability and concordance of gene expression profiling between the two technologies on a large scale.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>TCGA Data Description</title><p>From TCGA, we collected expression data on 4747 samples over 14 cancer types (TCGA public data until Dec 17, 2012).

cancers from TCGA. The data processing and quality control were done by Broad Institute's TCGA workgroup. For microarray data, gene level normalization was performed by using Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Irizarry1">[17]</xref> algorithm on GenePattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Reich1">[18]</xref>.

The RNAseq gene expression level 3 data contains Reads per Kilobase per Million mapped reads (RPKM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Mortazavi1">[19]</xref>, RNAseq by Expectation-Maximization (RSEM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Li1">[20]</xref> and read count. RPKM is the most widely used RNAseq normalization method, and is computed as follows: RPKM &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10<sup>9</sup>(C/NL), where C is the number of reads mapped to the gene, N is the total number of reads mapped to all genes, and L is the length of the gene. An alternative form of RPKM is Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Trapnell1">[21]</xref>. FPKM is computed similarly to RPKM, except it accounts for the scenario in which only 1 end of a pair-end read is mapped. RSEM on the other hand is based on a generative probabilistic model of maximum expectation. The major difference between RPKM and RSEM is that RPKM's normalization factor is proportional to the mean length of a transcript in the transcriptome while RSEM is independent of the mean expressed transcript length. The more detail difference between RPKM and RSEM is described in a study by Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Li2">[22]</xref>, section 1.1.1.</p><p>Both RPKM and RSEM results were generated using SeqWare pipeline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-OConnor1">[23]</xref>. The reference gene transcript set was based on the HG19 UCSC gene standard track. For RPKM, alignment of raw data was done using BWA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Li3">[24]</xref>, and for RSEM the alignment of raw data was done using MapSplice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Wang2">[25]</xref>. RPKM values were computed using the formula described earlier, and RSEM values were computed using RSEM package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Li1">[20]</xref>. The detailed description of each processing protocol can be found in the TCGA open access FTP download directories.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Comparison between RNAseq and Microarray</title><p>Consistencies between the RNAseq and microarray data were tested using Spearman's correlation instead of Pearson's correlation due to two reasons: 1. RMA normalization uses log2 transformation for microarray data, for RNAseq data, log transformation is impractical due to the large number of zeroes that often are reported in this method. 2. Pearson's correlation is heavily influenced by outliers, and RNAseq data is heavily skewed. In addition to raw expression correlation, the directionality and agreement of the significantly differentially expressed gene list between the two technologies are also important measurements of concordance. Breast cancer is the only cancer type in TCGA that collected expression data using both RNAseq and microarray on 53 tumor-normal paired samples. Using breast cancer data, we identified significantly differentially expressed genes based on Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value and fold-change between the tumor and normal samples using paired t-tests on the microarray data. Previous studies have shown that edgeR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Robinson1">[26]</xref> performs best among the read count based methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Dillies1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Kvam1">[28]</xref>. Thus, for RNAseq data differentially expressed genes were selected based on fold change and adjusted p-value generated by the edgeR package. Directionality and significance agreements were computed. The consistency of the fold-change computed from the microarray and RNAseq data was evaluated by comparing the four quartiles of expression value. Furthermore, results of the RPKM and RSEM normalization methods were compared on both the gene and exon level.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Expression Value Distribution</title><p>Microarray and RNAseq methods are different in terms of the technology used to quantify gene expression. Microarray methods measure the intensity of fluorescence, which reflects the corresponding gene expression level, while RNAseq methods measure the read count, which also reflects the abundance of the gene product. The expression values of microarray data after RMA normalization are on a log2 scale. The count data of RNAseq, on the other hand, is not usually normalized using the quantile normalization method because a log-transformation does not provide a variance-stabilization of the data as it does for the (assumedly log-normally distributed) microarray data. However, in a study by Dillies et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Dillies1">[27]</xref>, quantile normalization has been evaluated in the context of RNA-seq data and shows no worse results than RPKM normalization. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071462-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows an example of expression level distributions across different platforms and normalization methods. The data generated by four methods from 258 same ovarian carcinoma samples were used in this comparison. For the Affymetrix microarray RMA normalization results, the range of expression was between 2.63 and 12.75 with a peak around 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071462-g001">Figure 1a</xref>); for the Agilent microarray RMA normalization, the range of expression was relatively symmetrically distributed between &#x02212;7.66 and 7.61, with a peak around 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071462-g001">Figure 1b</xref>). The Agilent array had expression values across zero because expression from this array is computed as a ratio rather than as a raw intensity value. The expression values derived from RNAseq had a much wider distribution than that of the microarray methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071462-g001">Figure 1c, 1d</xref>). For RPKM, the range was 0 to 3136.11, and for RSEM the range was 0 to 101988.11. Both RPKM and RSEM have large amounts of zero expression values (9.12% of RPKM &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0, 12.58% of RSEM &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0), which reflects non-expressed genes. For RPKM, out of 19990 total genes, the number of detected genes (RPKM &#x0003e;0) per sample was between 17330 and 18784 with the median equal to 18055.

The low Spearman correlation between the two-channel microarray data and RNAseq data is a result of the normalization difference between ratio and non-ratio representations of the data. For two-channel microarray, the intensity of a gene is represented by the ratio of case vs control, which makes two-channel microarray data only comparable within a platform. Since RNAseq is a direct count measurement of gene transcript abundance, a low correlation in this case does not necessarily indicate low concordance between two-channel microarray data and RNAseq data.

The RSEM method has gained considerable popularity, evidenced by the recent adaptation of this method for all RNAseq data by TCGA. We have shown excellent agreement between the RPKM and RSEM methods at the gene level. To be more thorough, we also compared RPKM and RSEM results at the exon level. For RNAseq, the length of the exon plays a significant role in detectability. The median exon length was 138, but the mean exon length was 345, as this data was biased by very long exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071462-g005">Figure 5a</xref>). The consistency between the RPKM and RSEM methods on the exon level is good but not as strong as on the gene level. Some exons were detected as expressed by one of the normalization methods but were not detected by the other, which suggests the level of disparity between RPKM and RSEM is quite strong for these exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071462-g005">Figure 5b, d</xref>). We divided the exons into subcategories based on their length, (1&#x02013;25, 26&#x02013;50, &#x0003e;50 base pairs). Linear regression models were used to fit the exon expression data between the RPKM and RSEM methods at each length interval.

This directly reflects the fact that expression of short exons is harder to quantify through the sequencing method.</p><fig id="pone-0071462-g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0071462.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Exon expression consistency between the RPKM and RSEM normalization methods for RNAseq data.</title><p>a) Exon length distribution from RNAseq data.

Microarray companies such as Affymetrix and Agilent have not abandoned microarray technology. Instead, more customizable and higher resolution arrays are being produced to compete for market share. These strategies will prolong the life of microarray technology, but they will not change their inevitable replacement by RNAseq technology.</p><p>Some researchers choose RNAseq over microarray without a thorough understanding of the differences between the methods. The microarray technology does still hold several advantages over RNAseq. One of the advantages is the lesser complexity required for analysis. Choosing the proper normalization method for a platform may depend on many variables. For microarray data, especially for the Affymetrix and Agilent platforms, one of the most acceptable normalization methods is RMA. To detect differentially expressed genes, a simple t-test is acceptable in most scenarios for microarray data. On the other hand, more complicated models have been introduced to deal with RNAseq's non-expressed genes such as negative binomial: DESeq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Anders1">[29]</xref>, edgeR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Robinson1">[26]</xref>, baySeq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Hardcastle1">[30]</xref>, NBPseq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-DiY1">[31]</xref>, and Poisson distribution: TSPM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Auer1">[32]</xref>, DEGseq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Wang3">[33]</xref>. There has been several studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Dillies1">[27]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Kvam1">[28]</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Robles1">[34]</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Soneson1">[35]</xref> attempting to compare different normalization and differential gene comparison methods for RNAseq data. In the study by Dillies et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Dillies1">[27]</xref>, through simulation, the authors found DESeq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Anders1">[29]</xref> and edgeR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Robinson1">[26]</xref> are able to maintain a reasonable false-positive rate without any loss of power. In a separate study by Kvam et al., the authors recommended baySeq, DESeq and edgeR. Robles et al. suggested using a combination of multiple packages may overcome possible bias susceptibility of a given package to a particular dataset of interest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Kvam1">[28]</xref>. In a most recent study by Soneson et al. the authors suggested an unique combination use of existing packages with LIMMA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Diboun1">[36]</xref> which performed well under many conditions. But such approach requires at least 3 samples per condition to have sufficient power to detect any differentially expressed genes. The authors also pointed out that the non-parametric based SAMseq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Li4">[37]</xref> was among the top performers. However, due to the fold change required for statistical significance by SAMseq was lower than for many other methods, the differentially expressed genes identified by SAMseq may potentially have less biological significance. Thus far, a consensus on the best approach for RNAseq data analysis has not been reached.</p><p>Microarray analysis is more time and cost-efficient than is RNAseq data analysis. The typical raw file size for microarray data ranges from 10 MB to 100 MB while the size of a raw RNAseq data file ranges from 5 GB to 10 GB with additional space required to perform data analysis. To identify a significantly differentially expressed gene from the raw data using a microarray will only take hours; for RNAseq, it will take days to weeks depending on the sample size. In summary, although the current cost to perform expression profiling using microarray and RNAseq is comparable, the cost for the analysis and storage of RNAseq data is significantly higher than for microarray data. However, with the advance of computing hardware and maturity of RNAseq analysis algorithms, we expect these advantages of microarrays to slowly diminish.</p><p>Even though microarray technology ultimately cannot compete with RNAseq for expression profiling, it is still very useful for genotyping purposes. The recently introduced exome genotyping arrays by Illumina and Affymetrix cost significantly less than exome sequencing. Illumina's Human Exome BeadChip only costs $45 per array compared to $500&#x02013;1000 per exome sequencing. Even with the limitation of a pre-selected SNP list, the exome chip is preferable for large scale genome wide association studies (GWAS) due to the more manageable price.</p><p>With microarray technology slowly fading into history, the huge amount of microarray expression data collected by researchers over the last decade is still very valuable for data mining. The majority of the microarray data have been organized and stored in publicly available databases. The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) contains expression data on 848,178 samples across 2720 datasets, and ArrayExpress contains 988,372 assays across 34,148 experiments. Those microarray databases are still providing important support and information for researchers across the world every day.</p><p>Our results show that two-channel microarray expression data should not be directly compared to RNAseq expression data due to different detection schemes. One-channel microarray has very good concordance with RNAseq expression data. Reasonable agreement was observed between the significantly differentially expressed gene lists identified by two-channel microarray and RNAseq techniques; however, out of the significant genes identified by both RNAseq and two-channel microarray, about 1.2% genes had an opposite direction of the fold change. This inconsistency could be caused by random error, normalization differences or heterogeneity in samples. In the scenario of observing such inconsistency, it would be extremely difficult to decide which method to trust, especially when the difference is caused by sample heterogeneity. Thus, we recommend running multiple analysis methods such as bioconductor package LIMMA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Diboun1">[36]</xref> for microarray, and read count based methods such as DESeq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Anders1">[29]</xref>, edgeR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Robinson1">[26]</xref>, baySeq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071462-Hardcastle1">[30]</xref> to select reliable genes. If the discrepancy still cannot be resolved, wetlab method such as RT-PCR needs to be performed for validation. Even though such inconsistency percentage is very small, it does cause some concern and warrants further study. By comparing the RPKM and RSEM normalization methods, we found very good consistency at the gene level and good consistency rate at the exon level. However, the RPKM and RSEM normalization methods had poor consistency for short exons compared to long exons, partially due to the limitation of sequencing technology's ability to detect short exons and the resulting difficulty involved in correctly quantifying the expression of those short exons. Both absolute expression value from one-channel microarray data and fold-change value from two-channel microarray data show slightly more concordance to RPKM result than RSEM result, which may indicates that the RPKM method is more accurate than the RSEM method on gene expression estimation.</p><p>We have presented the largest microarray and RNAseq expression comparison study performed thus far. Given the large sample size, our results would be more definitive than previous studies on this subject. There is no denial that RNAseq is replacing microarray at a rapid pace. However there are still researchers who have yet to make transition from microarray to RNAseq. Our study provides definitive evidence that RNAseq can indeed replace microarray in term of expression analysis. Furthermore, our study also shows that results derived from microarray data are trust worthy. The huge amount of microarray data accumulated over last 10 years stored in repositories such as GEO and ArrayExpress can still serve as excellent data mining resources.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0071462.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p><bold>Shared samples between gene expression technologies in TCGA.</bold></p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0071462.s001.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0071462.s002"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p><bold>Inenuity pathway analysis summary for microarray results.</bold></p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0071462.s002.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0071462.s003"><label>Table S3</label><caption><p><bold>Inenuity pathway analysis summary for RNAseq results.</bold></p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0071462.s003.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>All data used in this manuscript were collected by TCGA.
