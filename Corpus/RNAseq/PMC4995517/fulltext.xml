Previous findings have indicated that myelin proteins, which accumulate following demyelination, inhibit remyelination by blocking the differentiation of rat oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) via modulation of PKC&#x003b1;. We therefore screened drugs for their potential to overcome this differentiation block. From our screening, tamoxifen emerges as a potent inducer of OPC differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>. We show that the effects of tamoxifen rely on modulation of the estrogen receptors ER&#x003b1;, ER&#x003b2;, and GPR30. Furthermore, we demonstrate that administration of tamoxifen to demyelinated rats <italic>in vivo</italic> accelerates remyelination. Tamoxifen is a well-established drug and is thus a promising candidate for a drug to regenerate myelin, as it will not require extensive safety testing. In addition, Tamoxifen plays an important role in biomedical research as an activator of inducible genetic models. Our results highlight the importance of appropriate controls when using such models.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>In the central nervous system (CNS), oligodendrocytes extend processes that form highly organized membrane wraps around axons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.

On the basis of these results, we investigated the potential of PKC&#x003b1; inhibitors to overcome the myelin-associated differentiation block to promote OPC differentiation.

Of the drugs tested (UCN01, midostaurin, staurosporine, bryostatin-1, rottlerin, and tamoxifen), tamoxifen showed particularly potent differentiation-inducing effects. Addition of tamoxifen to OPCs plated on control substrates or to cells on myelin substrates increased the number of MBP+ and CNP+ cells respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>, e&#x02013;i). Quantitative RT-PCR assessment of <italic>Mbp</italic> relative to <italic>Gapdh</italic> mRNA expression demonstrated that tamoxifen treatment induced <italic>Mbp</italic> expression on the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). The increase of MBP+ cells in response to tamoxifen was concentration dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>).</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>Tamoxifen is known to modulate estrogen receptor signaling and PKC&#x003b1; activity</title><p>Tamoxifen has been used for the treatment of breast cancer since the early 1970s<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. In addition to inhibiting PKC&#x003b1; activity, tamoxifen is known to modulate estrogen signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). So far, two classes of estrogen receptors have been identified: the nuclear estrogen receptors alpha (ER&#x003b1;) and beta (ER&#x003b2;), and a membrane-bound G-protein-associated estrogen receptor (GPR30). Whereas ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2; are estrogen-responsive nuclear receptors that act as transcriptional regulators<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, GPR30 is known to modulate several signaling pathways such as the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Estrogen receptors are positive regulators of OPC differentiation</title><p>The literature suggests that all three ER receptor types are expressed in oligodendrocyte lineage cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.

The largest targeted demyelinating lesions in a rodent model have so far been achieved by injection of ethidium bromide (EB) into white-matter tracts of the rat brainstem. Since the efficiency of remyelination is inversely correlated with lesion size, this model is advantageous for studying the kinetics of CNS remyelination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Application of EB results in rapid and complete depletion of glial cells, including astrocytes and oligodendrocyte lineage cells, within 3 days with good preservation of axons. As a consequence the axons become demyelinated. This is followed by a highly predictable sequence of events during which the lesion becomes fully remyelinated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. In young-adult rats, remyelination is complete within 28 days.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Estrogen receptors and active PKC&#x003b1; are expressed by oligodendrocyte lineage cells <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>To confirm that ER&#x003b1;, ER&#x003b2;, and GPR30, as well as activated PKC&#x003b1;, are present in remyelinating lesions, we carried out immunohistochemical staining using antibodies directed against the respective antigens and included co-stainings for the oligodendrocyte lineage cell-specific transcription factor OLIG2. This confirmed the presence of all three ERs and active PKC&#x003b1; in oligodendrocyte lineage cells within remyelinating lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Tamoxifen induces OPC differentiation in demyelinated lesions</title><p>To investigate whether tamoxifen treatment is able to induce OPC differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic>, animals receiving daily intraperitoneal injections of tamoxifen at two different doses (0.5&#x02009;mg/day and 2&#x02009;mg/day) were compared with controls receiving vehicle injections. Several stage-specific molecular markers were used to characterize the OPC response to tamoxifen in remyelinating lesions. We analyzed lesions 7 days post lesion induction (pli) to assess the recruitment of OPCs and lesions 14 days pli to assess the differentiation of OPCs into mature oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a&#x02013;e</xref>). Whereas the number of immature <italic>Pdgfr&#x003b1;</italic> OPCs or &#x0201c;activated&#x0201d; NKX2.2-expressing OPCs was comparable between the groups 7 and 14 days pli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f&#x02013;j</xref>), a significant increase in cells expressing the mature oligodendrocyte markers adenomatous polyposis coli (APC(CC1)) and proteolipid protein (<italic>Plp</italic>) was detected in animals receiving the higher treatment dose 14 days pli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5k&#x02013;o</xref>). These findings indicate that tamoxifen treatment induced the differentiation of OPCs in the lesions.</p><p>However, myelin-sheath formation is also regulated at levels downstream of the transcriptional program.

Investigator-blinded rank analysis demonstrated that tamoxifen significantly increased the number of remyelinated axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). This was confirmed by determining the number of remyelinated axons on high-power digitized micrographs of caudal cerebellar peduncle lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). The relative thickness of newly formed myelin did not differ between the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c&#x02013;h</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that tamoxifen treatment resulted in accelerated remyelination at 14 days pli.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Tamoxifen treatment does not alter the macrophage response</title><p>Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data indicate that tamoxifen can directly regulate OPC differentiation. However, it is possible that tamoxifen also modulates the function of other cell types in demyelinated lesions. In particular, macrophages are important determinants for the efficiency of remyelination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. We initially assessed the number of osteopontin-positive macrophages in the lesions. No differences were detected between the groups with respect to the overall macrophage presence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Recent findings highlight the importance of macrophage activation, specifically of M1 and M2 phenotypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Quantification of the presence of CCR7<sup>+</sup>-M1 and Arginase1<sup>+</sup>-M2 macrophages 7 days post lesion induction did not show significant differences between the tamoxifen treated and control animals. Furthermore, assessment of phagocytic activity in remyelinating lesions by staining intracellular myelin-derived neutral lipids with Oil Red-O did not detect differences between the groups. Nevertheless, further indirect effects of tamoxifen cannot be ruled out entirely.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we have shown that tamoxifen induces OPC differentiation and remyelination <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that this relies on modulation of the estrogen receptors ER&#x003b1;, ER&#x003b2;, and GPR30. The effects of tamoxifen do not involve the PKC&#x003b1; pathway.</p><p>Estrogen receptors play an important role in OPC differentiation and remyelination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Similarly, in our experiments, silencing of ER resulted in impaired OPC differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>, even estrogen was not specifically added to the medium. However, fetal calf serum (FCS) used in the OPC media does contain several components, which could activate estrogen receptors in a ligand-independent manner. Picard 2003, describes a list of molecules which could cross-talk with the estrogen receptors without physically interacting with them, for example, insulin (which forms an important component of the differentiation medium), IGF and FGF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Moreover, testosterone (present in FCS) could be converted by aromatase, which is expressed in low levels in glial cells (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/barres_lab/brain_rnaseq.html">http://web.stanford.edu/group/barres_lab/brain_rnaseq.html</ext-link>), into estrogen and therefore, activate all estrogen receptors. As a results, silencing of ER is likely to impair OPC differentiation in our culture model.</p><p>When estrogen receptors were silenced, the differentiation-inducing effects of tamoxifen were reduced, indicating an involvement of ER (or GPR30) in tamoxifen-mediated effects. In contrast, tamoxifen treatment in combination with silencing of PKC&#x003b1; did not reduce the efficiency of tamoxifen-induced OPC differentiation. In fact we observed transiently increased MBP expression at day 4 compared with tamoxifen treatment alone. While this is only a transient finding at a single time point, it may indicate that combinatorial treatment of tamoxifen and inhibition of PKC&#x003b1; may act synergistically to accelerate OPC differentiation. Nonetheless it can be concluded that differentiation-inducing effects of tamoxifen do not rely on inhibition of PKC&#x003b1;.</p><p>Our results also confirm previous reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> that the inhibition of PKCs does not promote differentiation by itself when cells are cultured in serum containing media. Conversely, in the presence of myelin debris, the inhibition of PKC&#x003b1; neutralizes myelin-associated inhibitors and promotes differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p><p>The majority of the reported pharmacological (metabolism and toxicology) studies of tamoxifen use the free base form of tamoxifen and not the soluble forms (citrate tamoxifen and/or 4-OH tamoxifen). Therefore, the present <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments were also conducted with tamoxifen in its free base form. However, a recent paper by Barrat <italic>et al.</italic> evaluated metabolites of tamoxifen (4-hydroxytamoxifen and endoxifen) as well as tamoxifen citrate, a water-soluble version on a rat glia restricted precursor cell line<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. They found that all metabolites promoted the expression of late stage markers of OPC differentiation, such as <italic>Cnp</italic> and <italic>Mbp</italic>, which is consistent with our findings using primary rat OPC cultures. In addition, the effect of tamoxifen was blocked when a pan-antagonist was added to the media, supporting our finding that tamoxifen acts as an estrogen receptor agonist in OPC differentiation.</p><p>Apart from oligodendroglial cells, tamoxifen potentially also acts on other cell types. We therefore assessed activated macrophages/microglia, which are known to play a key role in remyelination. We did not observe changes in the number of recruited cells or the myelin debris removal at 7 and 14 pli. Furthermore, no differences were observed regarding the number of the pro-inflamatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages. Nevertheless, these results cannot entirely rule out potential indirect effects such as differential release of cytokines or chemokines mediated by tamoxifen. The role of astrocytes was not evaluated since their role during remyelination is less clear.</p><p>To limit the biological variation and to increase the challenge of the experimental treatment by using a paradigm of efficient remyelination, only young adult female rats were included in the present <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. The literature indicates that sex-related differences exist with respect to the efficiency of remyelination: whilst in young rats the rate of remyelination is comparable between the sexes, it is more efficient in aged female rats as compared to male rats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Estrogen signalling plays a distinctive role in females. However, investigating OPCs derived from segregated female and male pups with respect to expression of estrogen receptors and their response to tamoxifen did not show any sex-related differences. Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that indirect systemic effects exist and that male rats may react differently to tamoxifen treatment. The main reasons why we decided to use female rats in our study were comparability to previous studies and the fact that MS often affects female patients.</p><p>In a clinical setting for the treatment of breast cancer tamoxifen was used at doses ranging from 20&#x02013;40&#x02009;mg per day. With an estimated average weight of females at 65&#x02009;Kg, this translates into 0.3&#x02013;0.6&#x02009;mg/Kg. The estimated human equivalent in our experiments is 0.27&#x02009;mg/Kg, which is in keeping with current treatment paradigms in human.</p><p>Steroid hormones are known to influence the course of MS and also to modulate demyelination in animal models. During pregnancy, a reduction in the frequency of relapse rate in patients with relapsing&#x02013;remitting MS (RRMS) has been reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Similarly, a decrease in the severity of the symptoms in comparison with a nonpregnant control group was detected in pregnant mice affected by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model of the autoimmune destruction of myelin sheaths occurring in MS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Interestingly, the administration of estriol to nonpregnant women with RRMS showed a reduction in the number of Th1 cells, which are involved in the autoimmune response, and also in the clinical score of the disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Furthermore, there is evidence that steroid hormones promote myelin repair: administration of progesterone to cerebellar slices after lysolecithin-induced demyelination showed an increase in remyelination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref> and recently, the same group has shown that administration of progesterone promotes myelin regeneration in chronic demyelinated lesions in the corpus callosum of mice after being fed with cuprizone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. These data support the positive effects of steroid hormones and their potential for the treatment of demyelinating diseases.</p><p>Considerable efforts are currently being made to develop remyelination-enhancing drugs. The use of tamoxifen has several advantages over the development of new drugs. For example, it has an excellent safety profile that has undergone the test of time by exhaustive application in the clinic. In our study, tamoxifen emerges as a good candidate for testing in an experimental medicine study specifically designed to assess remyelination in MS patients.</p><p>Our findings also have important implications for basic research: experiments investigating the function of specific molecules in the CNS on the basis of the widely used CreERT2Lox system rely on the tamoxifen-dependent activation of Cre recombinase for the induction of genetic changes. Our data demonstrate that administration of tamoxifen has a strong influence on CNS stem/precursor cells. To rule out any unintended effects of tamoxifen on the increasingly used inducible CreERT2-rat transgenic models, and potentially also for CreERT2 mice models, the inclusion of adequate controls is advised.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Preparation of primary OPC cultures</title><p>Primary OPC cultures were isolated from neonatal Sprague Dawley (postnatal day 0&#x02013;3) rat forebrains following a standard protocol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> Neonatal pups were euthanized according to &#x0201c;Schedule 1&#x0201d; regulations from the Home Office Animal Procedures Committee UK.
