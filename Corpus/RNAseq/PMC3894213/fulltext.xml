Whilst extensive changes in phosphorylation have been documented between the mammalian bloodstream form and the insect procyclic form, relatively little is known about the parasite's protein kinases (PKs) involved in the control of cellular proliferation and differentiation. To address this, a <italic>T. brucei</italic> kinome-wide RNAi cell line library was generated, allowing independent inducible knockdown of each of the parasite's 190 predicted protein kinases. Screening of this library using a cell viability assay identified &#x02265;42 PKs that are required for normal bloodstream form proliferation in culture. A secondary screen identified 24 PKs whose RNAi-mediated depletion resulted in a variety of cell cycle defects including in G1/S, kinetoplast replication/segregation, mitosis and cytokinesis, 15 of which are novel cell cycle regulators. A further screen identified for the first time two PKs, named <underline>r</underline>epressor of <underline>d</underline>ifferentiation <underline>k</underline>inase (RDK1 and RDK2), depletion of which promoted bloodstream to procyclic form differentiation. RDK1 is a membrane-associated STE11-like PK, whilst RDK2 is a NEK PK that is essential for parasite proliferation. RDK1 acts in conjunction with the PTP1/PIP39 phosphatase cascade to block uncontrolled bloodstream to procyclic form differentiation, whilst RDK2 is a PK whose depletion efficiently induces differentiation in the absence of known triggers. Thus, the RNAi kinome library provides a valuable asset for functional analysis of cell signalling pathways in African trypanosomes as well as drug target identification and validation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The African trypanosome, which is transmitted by the tsetse fly, causes the usually fatal disease Sleeping Sickness in humans and a wasting disease, called Nagana, in livestock in sub-Saharan Africa. There are no vaccines available against the diseases, and various problems are associated with current drug treatments (including toxicity to the patient and parasite drug resistance). Thus, it is important to identify essential parasite proteins that could be targeted by novel drugs. Protein kinases (PKs) are important cell signalling molecules, and are generally considered to have potential as drug targets. Here we report the construction of a library of trypanosome cell lines that allows us to specifically deplete each of the trypanosome's 190 PKs individually and analyse their function. Using this library, we show that &#x02265;42 PKs are essential for proliferation of the mammalian-infective bloodstream form of the parasite (and thus have potential as drug targets), and demonstrate that 24 of these play important roles in coordinating cell division. We also shed light on how the parasite develops during its life cycle as it passes from the mammalian bloodstream form to the tsetse fly gut by identifying the first two PKs that regulate this life cycle developmental step.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a Scottish Universities Life Sciences Alliance (SULSA) studentship to NGJ, an MRC/BBSRC studentship to EBT, and an MRC New Investigator Research Grant [GO900239] to TCH.

It has a complex life cycle, whereby the parasite differentiates multiple times through a series of morphologically and biochemically distinct life cycle stages in each host. Some life cycle stages, such as the short stumpy bloodstream form (BSF) and the metacyclic form in the tsetse salivary glands are cell cycle arrested and pre-adapted for life in the new host, while others, such as the long slender BSF and the insect procyclic form (PCF) and epimastigote form proliferate. The signal transduction pathways regulating differentiation events are just starting to be unravelled. For example, differentiation of the long slender BSF to the short stumpy BSF occurs via a quorum-sensing pathway in response to an as yet unknown parasite-derived molecule termed Stumpy Induction Factor (SIF) <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Vassella1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1003886-MacGregor1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. A number of protein kinases (PKs), ZFK <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Vassella2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, MAPK5 <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Domenicali1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and TOR4 <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Barquilla1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, have all been identified as negative regulators of this differentiation event, but the links between these kinases are not clear at present. Stumpy cells, which specifically express the citrate transporter PAD1 required to transduce a citrate and/or cis-aconitate signal <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Dean1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, then differentiate to the PCF in the tsetse fly midgut, and a protein phosphatase cascade regulating stumpy to PCF differentiation has been described <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Szoor1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Szoor2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, although the antagonising PKs are not yet known. A MAP Kinase Kinase, MKK1, has also recently been shown to regulate later differentiation steps in the tsetse fly, since <italic>MKK1</italic> null mutants are unable to establish salivary gland infections <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Morand1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>The cell division cycles of proliferative <italic>T. brucei</italic> stages are also complex, in part because of the need to faithfully replicate and segregate the parasite's several single copy organelles, and in part because there are key regulatory differences between <italic>T. brucei</italic> and mammalian cell cycles, as well as between different life cycle stages of the parasite. BSF <italic>T. brucei</italic> appear to have unusual mechanisms for regulating cell cycle checkpoints, as a block in mitosis inhibits cytokinesis but not successive rounds of nuclear DNA synthesis or kinetoplast replication and segregation <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Hammarton1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. A number of PKs have now been shown to regulate cell cycle progression in BSF <italic>T. brucei</italic>, for example, CRK1 and CRK3, which regulate G1/S and G2/M, respectively <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Tu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, AUK1 and TLK1, which are required for progression through mitosis <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1003886-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and PLK, PK50 and PK53 which regulate cytokinesis <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Hammarton2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, but many cell cycle/checkpoint regulators undoubtedly remain to be identified.</p><p><italic>T. brucei</italic> has 158 eukaryotic PKs (ePKs), 12 predicted pseudokinases and 20 atypical PKs (aPKs), which phosphorylate proteins despite their lack of a conserved PK structure <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Parsons1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1003886-Nett1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Although <italic>T. brucei</italic> does not possess any canonical receptor tyrosine kinase or tyrosine kinase-like kinase homologues, members of the other four major groups of ePKS, the AGC, CAMK, CMGC and STE kinases, are present, as are a number of &#x02018;Other&#x02019; PKs. The CMGC, STE and Other/NEK groups of PKs are relatively expanded in <italic>T. brucei</italic> compared to humans. In the original analysis of the <italic>T. brucei</italic> kinome, additionally over 30 &#x02018;Orphan&#x02019; PKs, which do not display sequence homology to any previously described PK families, were identified <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Parsons1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, although several of these have since been allocated to ePK groups <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Urbaniak1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Nett1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. To date, 64 ePKs, 9 pseudokinases and 9 aPKs have been reported in at least one study to be essential for BSF proliferation, although some discrepancies do exist between different data sets, presumably reflecting the different methods employed to test essentiality. Some of these essential kinases have been identified via RNAi studies of individual genes <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Barquilla1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Tu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Hammarton2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Barquilla2" ref-type="bibr">[15,20]</xref>, while others were identified via an RNAi screen of 30 PKs <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Mackey1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, an RNAi screen of CDXG kinases <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Nishino1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, a conditional null mutant screen of 20 targets <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Merritt1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and a global RNAi target sequencing (RIT-seq) screen <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Alsford1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.

In addition, depletion of TbAUK3, in contrast to an earlier study <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, or down-regulation of the tousled-like kinase, TLK2, generated substantial growth defects.

Several STE family members, which are potential upstream activators of the MAPKs, were also newly identified as playing important or essential roles in cell growth, including two STE11-type PKs (Tb927.11.2040 and Tb927.8.1100), the STE20 family MAPKKK, SLK1, and an unclassified STE kinase, Tb927.10.2040. Three atypical protein kinases, ATR and RIO1, were also shown for the first time to be important for cell growth.</p><p>Overall, the loss of fitness phenotypes detected in our kinome-wide RNAi screen has an excellent correlation with previous studies knocking down individual genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003886-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003886.s005">S1</xref>). Additionally, two protein kinases shown previously to be non-essential for growth by gene knockout, ZFK <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Vassella2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and MKK1 <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, did not show a loss of fitness phenotype in our screen. However, one notable discrepancy with the published literature was PLK, which has been shown to be essential in BSF <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Hammarton2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, but gave no RNAi phenotype in this study. qPCR analysis, however, revealed that in the two cell lines used in this study, no reduction in <italic>PLK</italic> mRNA was detected after RNAi induction, explaining the lack of the expected phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003886.s003">Figure S3</xref>). To monitor mRNA knockdown more widely, qPCR was performed for a number of target genes, encompassing cell lines with both loss of fitness phenotype and no phenotype upon RNAi induction. Transcripts were substantially reduced (typically by 40&#x02013;60%) for 11 of the 12 other genes studied by qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003886.s003">Figure S3</xref>). For <italic>MKK5</italic>, qPCR indicated there to be inefficient knockdown of mRNA. While MKK5 is known to be redundant in BSF parasites <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, this does raise the possibility that other false negatives arising from inefficient mRNA knockdown may be present within the screen dataset.</p><p>Correlation with the genome wide RITseq screen of Alsford <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Alsford1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> was also good, with 70% of the individually targeted genes giving the same 3 day growth phenotype. A severe growth phenotype (defect apparent at 3 days post-RNAi induction) was detected for 20 PKs by Alsford, but not in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003886.s005">Table S1</xref>). In contrast, this study identified 25 PKs whose depletion resulted in a growth defect that were not identified by Alsford (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003886.s005">Table S1</xref>). The variance between the two studies is likely to have arisen through the use of different strains of <italic>T. brucei</italic>, different RNAi constructs and different methods for assessing cell growth, highlighting the importance of using complementary approaches in such studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Screening protein kinases important for BSF proliferation for cell cycle defects</title><p>The 42 RNAi cell lines displaying a growth defect in culture were analysed using DAPI staining to identify PKs with a potential role in cell cycle control (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003886-t001">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003886.s006">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003886-g002">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003886.s002">S2</xref> B&#x02013;G). The nucleus and kinetoplast undergo discrete replication cycles in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, with the kinetoplast commencing replication slightly ahead of the nucleus. A cell in G1 phase has 1 nucleus and 1 kinetoplast (1N1K cell), while a cell in G2/M phase will have 1 nucleus and 2 kinetoplasts (1N2K) and a cell that has undergone mitosis but has not yet undergone cytokinesis will have 2 nuclei and 2 kinetoplasts (2N2K). Any other NK configuration is abnormal. Growth curves were used to determine the optimal time points for performing DAPI staining (before, during and after the appearance of the growth defect) for each cell line and flow cytometry was used to confirm the DAPI cell cycle analysis for specific cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003886-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003886.s002">S2H</xref>).

It is possible that TOR1 was knocked down less efficiently in our cell line, since we only observed slow growth rather than growth arrest following RNAi induction. Similarly, with PK53, a different phenotype was observed than reported previously <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>; induced RNAi cells displayed slower growth rather than cell death, and rather than depletion of PK53 blocking cells during cytokinesis furrowing, increased numbers of 2N1K cells were observed, suggesting that PK53 depletion affected kinetoplast and/or basal body replication and/or segregation. Such a discrepancy might be explained by differing levels of PK53 knockdown in the two studies. PKs targeted by the remaining 15 cell lines were identified as novel cell cycle regulators (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003886-t001">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003886.s006">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003886-g002">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003886.s002">S2</xref>). Several of these kinases appear to play roles in kinetoplast division. Depletion of CRK9 or CK2A1 resulted in a reduction in 1N2K and 2N2K cells, accompanied by an increase in abnormal cell types, of which the most abundant were 2N1K cells (13% and 19% total cells for CRK9 and CK2A1 RNAi, respectively, at 48 hours post-induction), suggesting defects in kinetoplast replication or segregation. Previously, CRK9 was reported to affect mitosis and cytokinesis in PCF <italic>T. brucei</italic>, but no phenotype was detected upon depletion of CRK9 in the BSF <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Gourguechon1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>Depletion of CK1.1/CK1.2 resulted in dramatic increases in 2N2K and abnormal cells from 20 hours post-induction. The most abundant abnormal cells were 2N1K cells, which comprised 16% of total cells at 24 hours post-induction. The remainder of the abnormal cells had a variety of N/K configurations (including &#x0003e;2N&#x0003e;2K cells), but no zoids were detected. Taken together, these data suggest down-regulation of CK1.2 (CK1.1 is redundant in BSF <italic>T. brucei</italic>) may affect kinetoplast division and cytokinesis, adding to existing data showing that this kinase is essential <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Urbaniak2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Similarly, depletion of NEK12.2 resulted in increased 2N2K and abnormal cells (of which the majority were 2N1K cells with no zoids detected) from 35 hours post-induction, suggesting that this kinase also (in addition to a role in BSF to PCF differentiation described below) regulates kinetoplast division and cytokinesis. Down-regulation of Tb927.11.4470 led to increased 2N2K and abnormal cell types (2N1K as well as cells with multiple nuclei and/or kinetoplasts (&#x0003e;2N&#x0003e;2K cells)) at 48 hrs post-induction, potentially indicating a role for this kinase in kinetoplast replication/segregation and/or cytokinesis. Two kinases, the CMGC kinase, Tb927.11.5340, and ATR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003886-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) appear to be mitotic regulators, since their depletion resulted in increased 1N2K and 1N&#x0003e;2K cells (more dramatic upon ATR RNAi where these cell types comprised 33% and 15% of the total cells, respectively, at 48 hours post-induction). Flow cytometry indicated that DNA replication had occurred in these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003886.s002">Figure S2H</xref>), suggesting that progression through mitosis was inhibited, invoking the mitosis to cytokinesis checkpoint <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Hammarton3" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> allowing kinetoplast re-replication in the absence of cell division. Four kinases, the AGC kinase Tb927.3.2440, the CAMK, Tb927.7.6220, MPK2 and the CMGC/RCK kinase Tb927.3.690 were identified as being essential for cytokinesis, since their depletion resulted in the accumulation of 2N2K and &#x0003e;2N&#x0003e;2K aberrant cell types. Depletion of Tb927.3.2440 and Tb927.3.690 resulted in the most dramatic phenotypes, with almost all cells being abnormal by 48 hours post-induction.</p><p>Additionally, four PKs (GSK3-short, AUK3, TLK2 and CLK1) may play roles in either or both mitosis and cytokinesis. GSK3-short RNAi resulted in slight increases in 1N2K and 2N2K cells and the appearance of small numbers of &#x02018;other&#x02019; abnormal cell types (including 2N1K and 0N1K cells), and only minor changes to the flow cytometry profile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003886.s002">Figure S2H</xref>), suggesting DNA replication proceeded normally followed by a possible delay in mitosis and/or defects in cytokinesis. Previous studies of GSK3-short have shown it to be essential for viability in BSF <italic>T. brucei</italic> and validated it as a potential drug target, but have not examined its cell cycle phenotype <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Ojo1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. RNAi of AUK3 resulted in large numbers of &#x02018;other&#x02019; cell types appearing from 18 hours post-induction. The most common types of abnormal cells were 2N1K and 0N1K cells, together comprising &#x0223c;70% and &#x0223c;60% of the abnormal cell population at 18 and 24 hours, respectively. Also prevalent were cells with multiple nuclei and/or kinetoplasts (&#x0003e;2N&#x0003e;2K; 17% and 31% at 18 and 24 hours, respectively). Thus, it is possible that AUK3 is involved in mitosis and/or cytokinesis since a delay in mitosis or defects in furrow ingression during cytokinesis could result in the generation of these cell types <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Hammarton3" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>Depletion of TLK1/TLK2 resulted in a large increase in 1N2K and 0N1K cells, reaching 43% and 13%, respectively, at 36 hours post-induction, concomitant with a reduction in 2N2K cells. Flow cytometry revealed an increase in the &#x0003c;1C peak and a decrease in the 2C peak, consistent with the increase in 0N1K cells and decrease in proportion of 1N1K cells, respectively, and a shift of the 4C DNA content peak to the right, indicating that many cells (presumably 1N2K and &#x02018;others&#x02019;) were aneuploid and had over-replicated their DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003886.s002">Figure S2H</xref>). Previously, TLK1 depletion in BSF was shown to cause defective spindle formation and chromosome segregation, resulting in an increase in 1N2K and abnormal cells (but not zoids), but did not affect 2N2K cell numbers <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Li3" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. While TLK2 depletion did not result in any observable phenotype in PCF <italic>T. brucei</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1003886-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, it is possible that it does play a role in BSF, accounting for the differences in phenotype between the TLK1/TLK2 double knockdown and TLK1 single knockdown cell lines. Thus, in BSF <italic>T. brucei</italic>, it is possible that knockdown of TLK1 and TLK2 inhibits mitosis but does not trigger the mitosis to cytokinesis checkpoint, resulting in inappropriate cytokinesis in 1N2K cells leading to the formation of zoids (0N1K cells). This would imply that TLK2 is involved in this checkpoint. Given that many cells were aneuploid, it may be that cells reinitiated DNA synthesis (but did not complete it) prior to cytokinesis occurring in 1N2K cells.</p><p>Depletion of CLK1 resulted in a dramatic increase in 1N2K, 2N2K and abnormal cell types from 6&#x02013;9 hrs post-induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003886-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). At 9 hours post-induction, the majority of the abnormal cell types had configurations of 2N3K or 2N4K, but at later timepoints, the N/K configurations of many cells became difficult to accurately determine since discrete nuclei and kinetoplasts could no longer be seen. Flow cytometry revealed a decrease in the 2C peak and an increase in the 4C peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003886-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003886.s002">S2</xref>), consistent with an accumulation of cells that had replicated their DNA. These data suggest mitosis and cytokinesis, but not DNA replication, were deregulated in these cells. To investigate the possible cytokinesis defect further, the cytokinesis stage of &#x0003e;200 2N2K cells was determined up to 12 hours post-induction, showing that the majority of the accumulated 2N2K cells had no furrow and were therefore yet to commence cytokinesis. Thus, CLK1 appears to be required for mitosis and entry into cytokinesis and is also essential for survival of trypanosomes in a mouse model, thereby validating CLK1 as a potential drug target <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Nishino1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>In summary, cell cycle screening of our kinome RNAi library has allowed putative cell cycle functions to be assigned to 15 PKs for the first time, although further, more detailed analyses will be required to confirm these functions. However, the fact that we were also able to reproduce a number of RNAi phenotypes obtained for PKs studied previously provides a level of confidence in the screen findings. The simple cell cycle screen applied here was also sensitive enough to be able to pick up defects across the whole cell cycle from G1/S to kinetoplast division to mitosis and cytokinesis. Since additional simple screens e.g. using immunofluorescence to investigate replication of organelles and/or structural components of the trypanosome cell or flow cytometry to investigate DNA replication could be applied to identify the PKs responsible, this library adds to the tool-kit for the study of the <italic>T. brucei</italic> cell cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Identification of a STE11-like ePK that represses bloodstream to procyclic form differentiation</title><p>Differentiation of <italic>T. brucei</italic> BSF parasites to PCF parasites involves major changes in gene and protein expression, metabolism and morphology (reviewed in <xref rid="ppat.1003886-MacGregor1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>).

Following induction, the presence of cells with PCF-like morphology was detected for the STE11-like PK, Tb927.11.14070, RNAi cell line which had not shown a noticeable loss of fitness in the Alamar Blue screen. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that RNAi of Tb927.11.14070led to expression of the PCF&#x02013;specific surface protein, EP procyclin <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Ziegelbauer1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, and that the kinetoplast repositioned to midway between the posterior of the cell and the nucleus, in a manner characteristic of PCF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003886-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Following RNAi induction and growth at 37&#x000b0;C, the proportion of EP procyclin positive cells reached 20% by 72 hr, as assessed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003886-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), which is consistent with the percentage of differentiation competent stumpy-like parasites (stumpy*) in the monomorphic 2T1 cell line <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Alsford2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. These data indicate that this PK, named <underline>R</underline>epressor of <underline>D</underline>ifferentiation <underline>K</underline>inase 1 (RDK1), is a repressor of BSF to PCF differentiation; depletion of RDK1 allows differentiation-competent cells to proceed to the procyclic form even at 37&#x000b0;C, the temperature of the mammalian bloodstream which is higher than that found during natural transmission in the tsetse (nominally 27&#x000b0;C). To investigate further the effect of RDK1 depletion, growth curves were performed for RDK1 RNAi lines cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> at 37&#x000b0;C. Slow growth was detected from 48 hr post-induction for RDK1 RNAi lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003886-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Knockdown of RDK1 was confirmed at the mRNA level by qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003886.s003">Figure S3</xref>) and at the protein level by expressing a C-terminal 12-Myc tagged version of RDK1 (RDK1::12myc) from the endogenous locus and Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003886-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). RDK1 is predicted (using the TMHMM algorithm) to contain three transmembrane domains in the N-terminal domain, with the PK domain at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003886-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) suggesting that RDK1 is a membrane protein. The third predicted transmembrane domain corresponded to a region predicted to be disordered and may be a false positive; therefore, the number and topology of the TM domains remains unclear. Cell fractionation analysis showed that RDK1::12myc was associated with the membrane fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003886-g003">Figure 3E</xref>) as RDK1::12Myc was found in the supernatant fraction of a detergent based lysis, which contains membrane and cytoplasmic components, and in the pellet fraction of a hypotonic lysis which contains membrane and cytoskeletal proteins. This fractionation pattern was the same as that observed for MCA4, a protein previously identified as cell membrane associated <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Proto1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed with an anti-Myc antibody to detect RDK1::12Myc in an RDK1 RNAi background (see above). In uninduced cells, RDK1::12Myc staining outlined the cell body and was also present on the flagellum, although often the flagellum staining was much weaker than the cell body staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003886-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). Upon induction of RDK1 RNAi, the RDK1::12Myc signal outlining the cell body disappeared by 22 hours post-induction, and the flagellum staining was much reduced. This might suggest that RDK1 is turned over more slowly in the flagellum than in the rest of the cell. These data support a cell membrane location for RDK1, which correlates with the identification of RDK1 in the flagellum surface proteome and the annotation of RDK1 as a cell surface receptor kinase <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Oberholzer1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p><fig id="ppat-1003886-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1003886.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>RDK1 is a repressor of BSF to PCF differentiation.</title><p><bold>A</bold>: <italic>RDK1</italic> RNAi was induced for 72 hours before cells were analysed by (immuno)fluorescence microscopy with DAPI (to stain nuclei and kinetoplasts) and FITC-conjugated anti-EP procyclin.

At 48 hr post-induction, mRNA was extracted from induced and uninduced RDK1 RNAi cell lines and sequenced. Analysis of differentially regulated transcripts identified a total of 479 genes whose expression was significantly different in the induced and uninduced samples, of which 275 were identified in both biological replicates. 145 of these were down-regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003886.s007">Table S3</xref>).

These data suggest that the protein kinase, RDK1, and the tyrosine phosphatase, PTP1, are working together as repressors of differentiation in discrete signalling pathways that respond to the SIF differentiation signal. RDK1 has some sequence identity with STE11-like MAP kinase kinase kinases, which operate with STE5 scaffold proteins to phosphorylate STE7 PKs within a MAP kinase signalling cascade. No STE5 proteins have been identified in trypanosomes, raising the possibility that the 2 or 3 trans-membrane domains of RDK1 act to anchor the protein in the membrane and initiate a MAP kinase signalling cascade that represses differentiation of BSF to PCF; such a pathway would be likely to operate in association with the PTP/PIP39 phosphatase cascade <xref rid="ppat.1003886-MacGregor1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Szoor1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Szoor2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><fig id="ppat-1003886-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1003886.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Analysis of differentiation during RDK1 RNAi.</title><p><bold>A</bold>: qRT-PCR analysis of PAD1 mRNA expression after 24 hr treatment of uninduced RDK1 RNAi cells with 250 &#x000b5;M 8-pCPT-cAMP. <bold>B&#x02013;D</bold>: quantification of EP procyclin-expressing cells by flow cytometry following induction of RDK1 RNAi.

In contrast to RDK1 RNAi, incubation of the induced RDK2 RNAi line with 8-pCPT-cAMP or subjecting it to cold shock (27&#x000b0;C) did not potentiate the differentiation phenotype (proportion of EP procyclin positive cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003886-g005">Figure 5D, 5E</xref>), indicating that RDK2 depletion is sufficient to induce differentiation of the entire sub-population of bloodstream form cells that is sensitive to these differentiation triggers.

While the cell death phenotype associated with RDK2 RNAi (most likely due to the observed cell cycle defects in kinetoplast division and cytokinesis, see above) complicates the interpretation of these data and prevented analysis of the differentiation phenotype over a longer time period, the efficiency with which RDK2 depletion induces differentiation in the absence of other triggers suggests RDK2 plays a vitally important role in controlling BSF to PCF differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>This study demonstrates that it is feasible to perform large scale functional analysis of gene families, since the recombineering-based system used to generate the library of RNAi plasmids has proven to be efficient, robust and rapid.

Additionally, the kinome library of RNAi cell lines itself is an important resource, since it permits systematic and global analysis of PK signalling in <italic>T. brucei</italic>. The ability to use the 2T1 derived cell lines with endogenous tagging constructs or other expression cassettes further allows the generation of reporter cell lines to interrogate the role of each PK in controlling any cellular process of interest.</p><p>This study confirms the importance of protein phosphorylation to the parasite <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Urbaniak3" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>; while the absence of a proliferation phenotype upon RNAi induction does not provide sufficient evidence that a gene is non-essential, this study has identified at least 42 (considering the double knockdown cell lines) out of 190 PKs (22.1%), to be required for normal BSF proliferation. 13 of these PKs are worthy of prioritisation as drug targets, as RNAi induced cell lines die very rapidly upon RNAi induction. These include the CMGC PKs CRK3, CRK9, CRK12, CLK1, Tb927.10.5140 and Tb927.3.690, the AGC PK Tb927.3.2440, CK1.1, AUK1, RDK2, TLK, TOR2 and the STE PK Tb927.10.2040.

A more defined cell cycle analysis that focuses on G1/S-specific markers could be designed to identify PKs involved in regulating G1 transition and entry into S phase, early cell cycle events such as basal body duplication or Golgi replication, DNA replication or positive regulators of differentiation that promote formation of cell cycle arrested stumpy form parasites. However, major challenges for the future will be to link individual PKs in signalling cascades, and, given that a high proportion of trypanosome PKs are differentially phosphorylated between the bloodstream and procyclic form (<xref rid="ppat.1003886-Nett1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003886-Urbaniak3" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003886.s005">Table S1</xref>), to determine life cycle stage-specific signalling pathways as well as identify those that are divergent in other eukaryotes.</p><fig id="ppat-1003886-g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1003886.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the BSF trypanosome cell cycle and differentiation from BSF to PCF.</title><p>Protein kinases implicated in cell cycle control and differentiation are indicated (red font: cell cycle function identified in this study; black font: cell cycle function previously identified).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1003886.g006"/></fig><p>The study also identified the first two PKs involved in repressing BSF to PCF differentiation.

In contrast, 40&#x02013;60% of cells undergo differentiation upon RDK2 RNAi suggesting that RDK2 might act to prevent differentiation of all cells within the population that are receptive to the various differentiation signals, and as such might act upstream of both RDK1 and PTP1.
