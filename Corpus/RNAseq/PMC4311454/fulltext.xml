A broad range of genomic tools are available for other <italic>Rosaceae</italic> species but these tools are still lacking in the <italic>Rubus</italic> genus, thus limiting gene discovery and the breeding of improved varieties.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p><italic>De novo</italic> RNA-seq of ripe blackberries grown under field conditions was performed using Illumina Hiseq 2000. Almost 9 billion nucleotide bases were sequenced in total. Following assembly, 42,062 consensus sequences were detected. For functional annotation, 33,040 (NR), 32,762 (NT), 21,932 (Swiss-Prot), 20,134 (KEGG), 13,676 (COG), 24,168 (GO) consensus sequences were annotated using different databases; in total 34,552 annotated sequences were identified. For protein prediction analysis, the number of coding DNA sequences (CDS) that mapped to the protein database was 32,540. Non redundant (NR), annotation showed that 25,418 genes (73.5%) has the highest similarity with <italic>Fragaria vesca</italic> subspecies <italic>vesca</italic>. Reanalysis was undertaken by aligning the reads with this reference genome for a deeper analysis of the transcriptome. We demonstrated that <italic>de novo</italic> assembly, using Trinity and later annotation with Blast using different databases, were complementary to alignment to the reference sequence using SOAPaligner/SOAP2. The <italic>Fragaria</italic> reference genome belongs to a species in the same family as blackberry (<italic>Rosaceae</italic>) but to a different genus. Since blackberries are tetraploids, the possibility of artefactual gene chimeras resulting from mis-assembly was tested with one of the genes sequenced by RNAseq, <italic>Chalcone Synthase</italic> (<italic>CHS</italic>). cDNAs encoding this protein were cloned and sequenced. Primers designed to the assembled sequences accurately distinguished different contigs, at least for chalcone synthase genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We prepared and analysed transcriptome data from ripe blackberries, for which prior genomic information was limited.

Batsch.).</p><p>Among the <italic>Rosaceae</italic> are blackberries (<italic>Rubus</italic> spp), with growing market interest due to recent discoveries about the beneficial effects of polyphenols for human health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore, increasing polyphenol levels will likely result in healthier fruits. However, despite the agricultural and biological importance of <italic>Rubus</italic>, knowledge of the genetics and genome is limited. So far, genomic efforts have focused largely on other <italic>Rosaceae</italic>, including apple (<italic>Malus x domestica</italic>), strawberry (<italic>Fragaria vesca</italic>), peach (<italic>Prunus persica</italic>) and pear (<italic>Pyrus communis</italic>) for which whole genome sequencing has been completed by combining traditional Sanger, Roche and next-generation Illumina GA sequencing technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Many genomic resources for these <italic>Rosaceae</italic> species are available on the Genome Database for <italic>Rosaceae</italic> website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The genus <italic>Rubus</italic> is classified into 12 subgenera, and at the same time is divided into sections or subseries. Economically, the most important subgenus is <italic>Rubus</italic>, with more than 130 species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. During the domestication of blackberries, parentals with desirable traits such as large, sweet fruits, thornlessness and high yield have been hybridised, resulting in complex hybrids comprising elite commercial lines.</p><p>The variety <italic>Rubus</italic> spp. var. Lochness is a high yielding tetraploid (4n&#x02009;=&#x02009;28) blackberry, and one of the most widely cultivated varieties. Its origin is Scottish, with parents SCRI 74126RA8 x SCRI 75131D2 hybrid complex, obtained in 1998 in Invergowrie, Scotland, by the Scottish Crop Research Institute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It is a mixture of races, among which the most prominent are &#x0201c;Comanche&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Merton Thornless&#x0201d;. The parents came from Scotland and North America, and include European species; <italic>Rubus ulmifolius</italic>, <italic>R. trivialis, R. strigosus,</italic> and <italic>R. armeniacus</italic>. Commercially, the term often used is <italic>fruticosus</italic>, although from a botanical point of view, it is more accurately described as <italic>Rubus</italic> spp. var. Loch Ness.</p><p>The lack of dense genetic maps, large high-throughput marker collections, and suitable mapping populations has limited gene isolation and breeding in blackberry. Several <italic>Rubus</italic> genes have been reported, mainly related to fruit quality, especially genes encoding the enzymes of phenylpropanoid metabolism, and resistance to diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], but most of these are derived from raspberry (<italic>Rubus idaeus</italic>) and none of them have been cloned and characterized molecularly in blackberry.</p><p>Currently, there are more than 74.2 million ESTs in the NCBI public collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, less than 3,200 EST sequences are available collectively for all the <italic>Rubus</italic> species, and approximately 540,000 for all the species in the <italic>Rosaceae</italic> family, compared to more than 1.8 and 2 million ESTs available for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Zea mays</italic>, respectively.</p><p>RNA-Seq is a powerful tool for transcriptome analysis and uses deep-sequencing technologies to produce millions of short cDNA reads. The resulting reads are either aligned to a reference genome or reference transcripts, or assembled de novo (without the genomic sequence) to produce a genome-scale transcription map that consists of both the transcript structure and level of expression for each gene at any particular developmental stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Here, we describe the generation of almost 9 billion nt bases using Illumina RNA-Seq technology, and the detection of 42,062 consensus sequences. These sequences are functionally annotated and represent the first <italic>Rubus</italic> sp. transcriptome. We show that <italic>de novo</italic> assembly using Trinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and a later annotation with BLAST interrogation of different databases is complementary to alignment to a reference sequence with SOAPaligner/SOAP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], using as a reference, the genome sequence a species of the same family (<italic>Rosaceae</italic>), but a different genus, <italic>Fragaria</italic>. Access to the sequence of the ripe blackberry transcriptome will accelerate genetic analysis and breeding of this crop and facilitate attempts to improve fruit quality based on secondary metabolite accumulation, and improved field performance within more sustainable production.</p><p>We have demonstrated the suitability of short-read sequencing for de novo assembly and annotation of genes without prior genome information, as well as its reliability and complementarity by alignment with sequence from a close, but distinct, species. Our results will facilitate the discovery of new functional genes in <italic>Rubus</italic> sp. Based on this background, the aim of this study was founded on i) the importance of the transcriptome to improvement of fruit quality dependent on secondary metabolite content, which will be useful for breeders and biotechnologists, and ii) comparison of bioinformatic approaches to study a new transcriptome, with little or no pre-existing information of its genome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sample preparation and Illumina sequencing</title><p>RNA-seq was performed on ripe fruit of <italic>Rubus</italic> sp var Lochness to gather information about genes expressed at the time and place most important to breeders of blackberry. Traits such as colour (anthocyanin biosynthesis), sweetness (sugar metabolism) and healthfulness (polyphenol metabolism) are determined by metabolic pathways active in ripe fruit. Total RNA of two independent samples, Ripe Fruit1 (RF1) and Ripe fruit2 (RF2) were isolated from ripe fruits to characterize the <italic>Rubus</italic> sp. transcriptome and enhance sequence coverage. After cleaning and quality checks, two independent rounds of Illumina sequencing (RF1 and RF2) generated 44,166,280 and 45,562,458 clean reads in total, encompassing 4,416,628,000 and 4,556,245,800 total nucleotides (nt) respectively (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

First, several databases were used to annotate each gene. In each database, two criteria were used, the score and the evalue. The evalue was set to discard alignments with statistical significance (NCBI minimum score&#x02009;=&#x02009;58, evalue&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.000001; and Swissprot minimum score&#x02009;=&#x02009;30, evalue&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.00001). Each gene was analyzed independently, and the annotation was made according to these criteria; these data are shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. The KEGG PATHWAY database records networks of molecular interactions in cells, and variants of them, specific to particular organisms. Pathway-based analysis helped to understand further the biological functions of genes. Pathway information for all annotated sequences was obtained from KEGG pathway annotations.</p><p>COG is a database where orthologous gene products are classified. Every protein in COG is assumed to have evolved from an ancestral protein, and the whole database is built on genes encoding proteins from species with complete genome sequences as well as the evolutionary relationships between bacteria, algae and eukaryotes. All consensus sequences were aligned to the COG database to predict and classify possible functions. It was possible to get Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation from the NR annotation. GO offers three ontologies: molecular function, cellular component and biological process. The basic unit of GO is the GO-term. Every GO-term belongs to a type of ontology. Based on the NR annotation, the Blast2GO program was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] to get the GO annotation of all consensus sequences. WEGO software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] was then used for GO functional classification and to understand the distribution of gene functions of the species at a macro level.</p><p>For functional annotation, 33,040, 32,762, 21,932, 20,134, 13,676, 24,168 consensus sequences were annotated using the NR, NT, Swiss-Prot, KEGG, COG, GO databases, respectively; in total 34,552 annotated sequences were identified. For protein prediction analysis, the number of CDS that mapped to the protein database was 32,540.</p><p>Among the annotated sequences, the species with the highest number of best hits were wild strawberry (<italic>Fragaria vesca subsp. vesca</italic>) (73.56% matched genes) and peach (<italic>Prunus persica</italic>) (15.25% matches) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

The 2,005 genes in the &#x0201c;Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites&#x0201d; category expressed in blackberry fruits will be useful for defining metabolic pathways for synthesis and turnover of compounds potentially beneficial to human health, and modifiable by plant breeding in Blackberry.</p><p>To further differentiate the NCBI nucleotide sequences and assembled sequences at the protein level, COG classification was undertaken to analyse the NCBI sequences.</p><p>The 13,676 assembled sequences were divided into 25 clusters according to NCBI COG classification (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The groups with the highest representation were found in the clusters R &#x0201c;general function prediction only&#x0201d;, K &#x0201c;transcription&#x0201d; and L &#x0201c;replication, recombination and repair&#x0201d; (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p><p>To determine differential expression, once all reads were assembled and annotated, each gene expression level was normalized to its length for each replicate (C1 and C2). The gene expression level was calculated by using RPKM method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] (Reads per kilobase transcriptome per million mapped reads), with the following formula: RPKM&#x02009;=&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup>C/(NL/10<sup>3</sup>) which defines the expression of gene A , where C is the number of reads that are uniquely aligned to gene A , N is the total number of reads that are uniquely aligned to all genes, and L is the number of bases in gene A. The RPKM method is able to eliminate the influence of different gene lengths and sequencing discrepancies in the calculation of gene expression. Therefore, the calculated gene expression can be used directly for comparing the difference of gene expression among samples. Normalized data from C1 was plotted against data from C2; low dispersion in the plot indicated high repetitivity in expression between samples. Gene expression levels showed high similarity between biological replicates, RF1 and RF2 (Additional files <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Most genes showed no significant differences between the samples, suggesting the results were reliable. Therefore, the calculated FPKM gene expression values can be directly compared between genes and, for any given gene, between samples.</p><p>Finally, SSRs were detected using MISA software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], using the sequences as a reference (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Predominant SSRs were dinucleotides (over 4000), followed by trinucleotides (over 3000), mononucleotides (1200), hexanucleotides (365) and similar amounts of tetra and pentanucleotides (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Despite the importance of these sequences to predict variability in different organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] no further analysis has been undertaken with these data in the present study, but the sequences are available in EBI databases (PRJEB6680), to use as markers for improvement of blackberry quality.

This provides a significant database for berry breeders. All the classifications (COG, KEGG, etc.) provide new tools and resources for research on fruit development and bioactives. However, functional assignment of genes based on similarity to genes in other plant species should be undertaken with caution, especially if the comparator species are taxonomically distant from blackberry, such as <italic>Populus balsamifera subsp.

However, Trinity is reliable in assembling genes from different chromosomes and avoiding chimeras, especially when the hybrid has been derived from different species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>To test for putative chimeras, the CDS of one gene encoding <italic>Chalcone Synthase</italic> (<italic>CHS</italic>) was selected as a representative example for its role in biosynthesis of flavonols and anthocyanins, that are greatly accumulated in blackberries.

This could be problematic for primer design for RT-qPCR analysis, since design of primers that amplify only one of the contigs encoding a specific protein, instead of all the copies of that gene, could give misleading expression data. To check if this is a real problem, three pairs of primers were designed for the CHS gene. The first two pairs were designed using the zone with high SNP frequency between the two contigs encoding CHS in blackberry (the first 500&#x000a0;bp, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Consequently, these primers should monitor the transcript levels of each contig encoding CHS but not the combined expression of both genes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). The third pair of primers was designed within the sequence conserved between the two genes; accordingly this third pair should report the total expression of the CHS genes.</p><p>RT-qPCR showed that the expression reported by this third primer pair (Contig1&#x02009;+&#x02009;2) was equal to the sum of the RT-qPCR products of the two primer pairs which amplified Contig1 and Contig2 separately, during three stages of ripening of blackberry fruit (green, red and black) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

Consequently chimeras existing in other contig pairs are less likely to impact the sequence of the encoded protein than for CHS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The blackberry transcriptome data provide a resource that will enhance comparative studies between different berry crops which are of increasing economic and social importance due to their healthy properties. Consequently these transcriptome data and analyses provide an important new resource for biological research. The genes we have identified provide candidates for resistance genes against RNA viruses, fungal or bacterial pathogens as well as many genes encoding enzymes of flavonoid metabolism which are key to the health-promoting effects of many berries. The SSRs and SNPs identified here will constitute an important resource for mapping and marker-assisted breeding of ripe fruit quality traits in <italic>Rubus</italic> sp. and closely related crop species.</p><p>Two different strategies have been used to analyse sequence, assemble and annotate a new transcriptome <italic>de novo</italic> without a reference genome or transcriptome. We have demonstrated that the techniques are both robust and complementary and should be used in accordance with the research objectives. We show that the transcriptome of a non-model polyploid species, in this case, a tetraploid, can be sequenced, assembled and annotated avoiding high levels of artificial chimeras. The analysis of expression of several contigs of the same gene can inform expression analyses of both individual genes and all the genes encoding proteins of particular interest.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Plant materials and RNA isolation</title><p>The <italic>Rubus sp.</italic> var.
