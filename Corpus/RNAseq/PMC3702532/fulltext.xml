Yet, the contribution of maternal physiology to lactation difficulties remains poorly understood. Human milk fat globules, by enveloping cell contents during their secretion into milk, are a rich source of mammary cell RNA. Here, we pair this non-invasive mRNA source with RNA-sequencing to probe the milk fat layer transcriptome during three stages of lactation: colostral, transitional, and mature milk production. The resulting transcriptomes paint an exquisite portrait of human lactation. The resulting transcriptional profiles cluster not by postpartum day, but by milk Na:K ratio, indicating that women sampled during similar postpartum time frames could be at markedly different stages of gene expression. Each stage of lactation is characterized by a dynamic range (10<sup>5</sup>-fold) in transcript abundances not previously observed with microarray technology. We discovered that transcripts for isoferritins and cathepsins are strikingly abundant during colostrum production, highlighting the potential importance of these proteins for neonatal health. Two transcripts, encoding &#x003b2;-casein (CSN2) and &#x003b1;-lactalbumin (LALBA), make up 45% of the total pool of mRNA in mature lactation. Genes significantly expressed across all stages of lactation are associated with making, modifying, transporting, and packaging milk proteins. Stage-specific transcripts are associated with immune defense during the colostral stage, up-regulation of the machinery needed for milk protein synthesis during the transitional stage, and the production of lipids during mature lactation. We observed strong modulation of key genes involved in lactose synthesis and insulin signaling. In particular, protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, F (PTPRF) may serve as a biomarker linking insulin resistance with insufficient milk supply. This study provides the methodology and reference data set to enable future targeted research on the physiological contributors of sub-optimal lactation in humans.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the Cincinnati Children&#x02019;s Hospital Perinatal Institute (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/service/p/perinatal/default/">http://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/service/p/perinatal/default/</ext-link>); Cincinnati Diabetes and Obesity Center (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.uc.edu/Research/Overview.aspx">http://diabetes.uc.edu/Research/Overview.aspx</ext-link>); National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) (P51RR000169-49S1); the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NIH 8 UL1 TR000077-04); and National Institutes of Health (NIH) HD13021.

Most new mothers in the U.S. initiate breastfeeding in an attempt to follow these recommendations&#x02013;but there is wide variation in lactation success with 50% of mothers failing to achieve their personal breastfeeding goals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067531-Li1">[7]</xref>. While there has been progress in recognizing how hospital and workplace barriers may undermine breastfeeding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067531-Declercq1">[8]</xref>, the contribution of maternal physiology to lactation difficulties remains poorly characterized.</p><p>Research into the biology of human lactation has been seriously impeded by the impracticality and ethical concerns of obtaining systematic samples of mammary tissue from lactating woman. However, there is an intriguing workaround&#x02013;human milk secreted during lactation is a rich source of mammary epithelial cell RNA. As lipid droplets exit the mammary epithelial cell, they are enveloped by cell membrane and secreted into milk as membrane-bound globules of fat. About 3&#x02013;8% of human milk fat globules contain mammary epithelial cell cytoplasmic remnants, including RNA, captured during milk fat globule formation and secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067531-Patton1">[9]</xref>. Maningat et al. demonstrated that the microarray-generated human milk fat layer transcriptome includes genes uniquely expressed in the lactating mammary epithelial cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067531-Maningat1">[10]</xref>. Their ground-breaking work established the human milk fat layer as a potential window into mammary epithelial cell gene expression during lactation without invasive tissue biopsy.</p><p>With the advent of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) it is now possible to characterize the gene expression of milk-producing cells with highly sensitive detail. In contrast to microarray technology, RNA-Seq can accurately quantify both very low and very high abundance transcripts, as well as detect novel transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067531-Wang1">[11]</xref>. Consequently, sequencing of the mRNA found in the milk fat layer is a potentially powerful tool for identifying transcriptional signatures that underlie suboptimal lactation in women. In particular, based on epidemiologic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067531-NommsenRivers1">[12]</xref> and clinical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067531-NommsenRivers2">[13]</xref> research findings, we sought to determine expression of insulin signaling pathway genes and whether sequencing mRNA obtained from the milk fat layer might reveal candidate biomarker genes linking whole-body insulin action to poor lactation performance.</p><p>To date, RNA-Seq of the milk fat layer has not been reported and thus the extent to which RNA-Seq offers insights into the mammary transcriptome captured from this unique source is not known. Furthermore, it is unknown if the milk fat layer yields RNA purely of mammary epithelial cell origin, or if RNA from non-mammary epithelial sources is also present in the milk fat layer obtained from colostrum, transitional, or mature human milk.</p><p>In this paper, we describe the extraction and sequencing of high-quality RNA from the human milk fat layer over three stages of milk production, demonstrating the significance of defining lactation stage based on biochemical parameters (versus postpartum day). We then characterize the RNA-Seq transcriptome responsible for the production of biochemically-defined colostrum, transitional, and mature milk in humans, including: a) demonstrating how RNA-Seq captures the broad dynamic range of gene expression within the temporal context of secretory activation and lactation; b) functional enrichments of distinct gene expression trajectories; c) differential expression of insulin signaling genes; and d) differential expression of lactose synthesis genes. We identify key candidate genes that may control rate-limiting steps during lactation and outline future work in the endeavor to discover the biological underpinnings of poor lactation performance in women attempting to breastfeed.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Defining Colostral, Transitional and Mature Lactation Stages</title><p>We isolated milk fat layer mRNA from 55 fresh milk samples over 48 collections (Protocol-I: n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;24 on day 2 of lactation, with follow-up collection from n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;12 at 4&#x02013;6 weeks postpartum; and Protocol-II: n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;12 convenience collections; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3"><bold>Methods</bold></xref>).

In prior work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067531-Maningat1">[10]</xref>, milk fat fractions were not inspected for signs of contamination with intact cells. While intact cells should form a pellet when whole milk is centrifuged, some may remain trapped in the fat layer. Indeed, under the fluorescent microscope we observed nucleated cells in milk fat fractions, presumably of leukocyte origin (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0067531.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>). We tested a washing protocol to remove these nucleated cells. Regardless of washing protocol, leukocyte-specific genes were not expressed in mature milk fat layers, scantly expressed in transitional milk fat layers and robustly expressed in colostral milk fat layers (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0067531.s002">Figure S2</xref></bold>). Cell markers associated with epithelial and other (non-leukocyte) lineages are also expressed in the colostral milk fat layer.

As summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067531-t003"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>, two of the top three transcripts in the colostrum milk fat layer are isoferritins (FTL, FTH1).

In other biological contexts, ferritin primarily functions as an iron-storage molecule; however, colostrum ferritin appears to have little iron associated with it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067531-Arosio1">[21]</xref> and thus may instead enable the neonate to sequester iron. Second, unlike the ferritin found in mature milk, colostrum ferritin is highly glycosylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067531-Arosio1">[21]</xref>. These glycosylations may have an antimicrobial role, which parallels the recent finding of lactation stage-specific functional roles for lactoferrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067531-Barboza1">[22]</xref>. The colostral stage is further characterized by high abundance of mRNAs (CTSD, CTSB, PSAP) that encode proteins involved in macromolecule catabolism (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067531-t003"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>). These enzymes may be involved in the remodeling of milk-secreting cells to support the production of mature milk. However, it is also possible that they are involved in the pre-digestion of colostrum. Fragments of osteopontin in human milk have been shown to occur by cleavage with plasmin and cathepsin D <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067531-Christensen1">[23]</xref>.

The solute carrier family 2A genes (SLC2A, GLUT protein family) are involved in glucose (and other solute) transport across cell membranes. We detected expression of several SLC2A genes in the milk fat layer of mature samples (SLC2A1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13). SLC2A1 is thought to be the primary route for glucose entry into the lactocyte across species based on reports from rodent and bovine studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067531-Macheda1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067531-Shennan1">[39]</xref>.

SLC2A9 increased from 1.9 to 4.0 to 5.7 FPKM across colostral, transitional and mature lactation stages, respectively. Little is published on SLC2A9 in the mammary gland, but our data suggest this member of the SLC2A family deserves further attention, including whether it is involved in glucose and/or transport of other solutes into the mammary gland.</p></sec><sec id="s2h2"><title>Rate-limiting enzymes of lactose synthesis</title><p>There are two potential sources of UDP-Galactose in the mammary epithelial Golgi, either through the uptake and metabolism of D-Galactose or D-Glucose. Our results show that both pathways are up-regulated between colostral and transitional stages. However, the more predominant route appears to originate with D-Glucose, as the enzymes unique to this pathway are up-regulated 5.9-fold (PGM1) and 8.2-fold (UGP2). In contrast, GALK1 is up-regulated 3.3-fold.</p><p>Similar to what we observed for the insulin signaling pathway, the strong up-regulation of the lactose synthesis pathway observed between colostral and transitional lactation stages is attenuated between transitional and mature lactation stages. Gene expression for the enzymes central to the synthesis of UDP-Glucose from D-Glucose (PGM1, UGP2, and NME2) are down-regulated, with only PGM1 attaining statistical significance (0.58 fold-change, mature vs. transitional, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.02), suggesting these nodes are critical to the regulation of lactose synthesis. SLC2A9, SLC2A1 and SLC2A4RG are all modestly up-regulated (only SLC2A1 significant, increasing 2.0-fold) and LALBA is further up-regulated 6.1-fold, consistent with increased glucose utilization and milk protein output in mature lactation. All other lactose synthesis genes are expressed at a level similar to transitional samples. While protein abundances are often not linearly reflected by mRNA levels, these transcriptional results do suggest key network nodes to probe in future studies. In summary, we hypothesize that the rate-limiting enzyme PGM1 modulates milk yield in humans.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Confirmation of Genes of Interest</title><p>To confirm our RNA-Seq findings using a different assay, we probed the following genes of interest in 4 samples from mature lactation using qPCR: the major milk protein genes (LALBA, CSN2), the gene most abundant in the mature milk fat layer transcriptome using microarray technology (CSN3, from Maningat et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067531-Maningat1">[10]</xref>), and a selection of key genes differentially expressed in the lactose synthesis pathway (PGM1 and UGP2) and insulin signaling pathway (INSR, IRS2, AKT1, EIF4EBP1, PPP1CB, PIK3R2, FLOT2, and PTPRF).

In this paper, we explored several methodological issues in using human milk fat layer RNA for this purpose. We found that: a) lactation stage must be defined biochemically (such as Na:K ratio), not by day of lactation, b) lactation stage influences RNA quality, quantity, and potential immune cell contamination, c) immediate processing and hard, fast centrifugation yield better quality RNA, and d) additional washing of the milk fat layer is not necessary for the analysis of mature milk samples and does not decrease immune cell contamination in colostrum samples. We also found that RNA sequencing yields superior results compared to microarray experiments.</p><p>Our RNA-Seq results paint the most vivid portrait to date of the transcriptome responsible for human milk production. Strikingly, transcripts of &#x003b2;-casein and &#x003b1;-lactalbumin genes make up 45% of the total pool of mRNA during mature lactation. Consistent with known physiology, genes expressed during lactation are associated with making, modifying, transporting, and packaging these highly abundant milk proteins. Lactation-stage specific transcripts are associated with immune defense during the colostral stage, the up-regulation of massive milk protein synthesis during the transitional stage, and the full-scale production lipids and other factors during the mature stage of lactation. Furthermore, fundamentally different regulatory mechanisms appear to control milk production during the different stages of lactation. First, genes whose products participate in transcription and translation are differentially regulated across all three stages. Second, we see dramatic changes in the transcriptome even after the onset of copious milk production (e.g., transitional versus mature stage). Future experiments, utilizing the methods outlined in this paper, are needed to determine the comprehensive acute, long-term, local, and systemic mechanisms by which women produce milk in response to infant feeding patterns. For example, the effect of early milking frequency on &#x0201c;programming&#x0201d; milk production capacity has been explored in bovine models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067531-BernierDodier1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067531-Shields1">[40]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067531-Littlejohn1">[42]</xref>, but no human studies have been conducted, most notably due to the previous need for mammary biopsies.</p><p>Correlates of impaired insulin and glucose metabolism have recently been reported to be associated with poor lactation performance in women <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067531-NommsenRivers1">[12]</xref>.
