Here we examine the origin of egg-spots, an evolutionary innovation of the most species-rich group of cichlids, the haplochromines, where these conspicuous male fin colour markings are involved in mating. Applying a combination of RNAseq, comparative genomics and functional experiments, we identify two novel pigmentation genes, <italic>fhl2a</italic> and <italic>fhl2b</italic>, and show that especially the more rapidly evolving b-paralog is associated with egg-spot formation. We further find that egg-spot bearing haplochromines, but not other cichlids, feature a transposable element in the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory region of <italic>fhl2b</italic>.

The emergence of evolutionary innovations, that is, lineage-restricted traits linked to qualitatively new functions, involves the origin of new developmental modules that are responsible for the identity of these novel characters<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Most of the available evidence suggests that new developmental programs emerge largely through co-option of pre-existing regulatory gene networks via changes in their regulation and deployment (&#x02018;old genes playing new tricks&#x02019;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>).

Haplochromine egg-spots vary substantially in colour, shape, number and arrangement between species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), and even within species a certain degree of variation is observed. In some species, also females show egg-spots, which are then much less pronounced and colourful. The function of egg-spots has been implicated with the mating behaviour of the female-mouthbrooding haplochromines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Immediately upon spawning, a haplochromine female gathers up her eggs into the mouth; the male then presents his egg-spots to which the female responds by snatching and bringing her mouth close to the male&#x02019;s genital opening; upon discharging sperm, the eggs become fertilized inside the female&#x02019;s mouth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The mother subsequently broods and carries her progeny in the oral cavities for several weeks after fertilization.</p><p>Here we are interested in the molecular basis of the anal fin egg-spots of haplochromine cichlids. The main advantages of the cichlid egg-spot system are that (i) the evolutionary innovation of interest emerged just a few million years ago and hence is recent compared with most other evolutionary novelties studied so far<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>; (ii) the phylogenetic context in which the novel trait evolved is known and living sister clades to the lineage featuring the novelty still exist<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>; and (iii) the genomes of two outgroup species lacking the trait and of three derived species featuring the trait are available. This allows us to study early events involved in the origin of an evolutionary innovation in an assemblage of phenotypically diverse, yet closely related and genetically similar species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Using RNAseq, we identify two novel candidate pigmentation genes, the a- and b-paralogs of the four and a half LIM domain protein 2 (<italic>fhl2</italic>) gene, and show that both genes, but especially the more rapidly evolving b-copy, are associated with the formation of egg-spots. We then find that egg-spot bearing haplochromines&#x02014;but not an egg-spot-less ancestral haplochromine and not the representatives from more basal cichlid lineages&#x02014;exhibit a transposable element insertion in close proximity to the transcription initiation site of <italic>fhl2b</italic>. A functional assay with transgenic zebrafish reveals that only a haplochromine-derived genetic construct featuring the SINE (short interspersed repetitive element) insertion drove expression in a special type of pigment cells, iridophores. Together, our data suggest that a <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory change (probably in the form of a SINE insertion) is responsible for the gain of expression of <italic>fhl2b</italic> in iridophores, contributing to the evolution of egg-spots in haplochromine cichlids.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>fhl2</italic> paralogs: novel candidates for egg-spot morphogenesis</title><p>As a first step, we performed an Illumina-based comparative transcriptomic experiment (RNAseq) between male (with egg-spots) and female (without egg-spots) anal fins in the haplochromine cichlid <italic>Astatotilapia burtoni</italic>.

In addition, we tested another haplochromine species, <italic>Cynotilapia pulpican</italic>, with a different egg-spot arrangement to exclude positional effects of gene expression on the anal fin. In both species, the two duplicates of <italic>fhl2</italic> were overexpressed in egg-spots (<italic>A. burtoni</italic>: <italic>fhl2a</italic>: <italic>t</italic><sub>5</sub>=10.77, <italic>P</italic>=0.0001; <italic>fhl2b: t</italic><sub>5</sub>=4.362, <italic>P</italic>=0.0073; <italic>C. pulpican</italic>: <italic>fhl2a</italic>: <italic>t</italic><sub>4</sub>=5.031, <italic>P</italic>=0.0073; <italic>fhl2b: t</italic><sub>4</sub>=9.154, <italic>P</italic>=0.0008).

We found that the expression of both <italic>fhl2</italic> paralogs increases substantially throughout anal fin and egg-spot development, and both genes showed higher expression levels compared with the other pigmentation genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>); <italic>fhl2b</italic> shows the highest increase in expression exactly when egg-spots begin to form. Furthermore, we corroborate that the expression domain of both <italic>fhl2a</italic> and <italic>fhl2b</italic> matches the conspicuously coloured inner circle of egg-spots with RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref> for results on <italic>fhl2b</italic>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>fhl2a</italic> and <italic>fhl2b</italic> evolved under purifying selection</title><p>In general, phenotypic differences can arise via mutations affecting the function of proteins or via changes in gene regulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.

An additional series of qPCR experiments in 12 tissues revealed that, in cichlids, <italic>fhl2a</italic> is primarily expressed in heart, bony structures and muscles, whereas <italic>fhl2b</italic> is highly expressed in the eye, and further in skin and the egg-spots of haplochromines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). This is different to the gene expression profiles in medaka, where both duplicates are highly expressed in heart, skin and eye tissues; and in zebrafish, where the two paralogs are primarily expressed in heart, eye and (pharyngeal) jaw tissues, with <italic>fhl2a</italic> showing rather low levels of gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 3 and 4</xref>). When compared with the other teleost fishes examined here, our results suggest that the haplochromine <italic>fhl2a</italic> retained most of the previously described functions, whereas the more rapidly evolving <italic>fhl2b</italic> obtained new expression patterns. Together, the gene expression profile and the pattern of sequence evolution make <italic>fhl2b</italic> a prime candidate gene for the morphogenesis of haplochromine egg-spots.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>fhl2b</italic> shows an AFC-SINE insertion in species with egg-spot</title><p>Since there were no changes in the coding regions of <italic>fhl2a</italic> and <italic>fhl2b</italic> that are specific to the egg-spot bearing haplochromines, we shifted our focus towards the analysis of putative regulatory elements, exploring the recently available genomes of five East African cichlids (including the egg-spot bearing haplochromines <italic>A. burtoni</italic>, <italic>Pu. nyererei</italic>, <italic>Metriaclima zebra</italic> and the egg-spot-less non-haplochromines <italic>Neolamprologus brichardi</italic> and <italic>Oreochromis niloticus</italic>). The non-coding region of <italic>fhl2a</italic> shows homology with other teleosts (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>, <italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic>, <italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis</italic> and <italic>Gasterosteus aculeatus</italic>) and we identified four conserved non-coding elements (CNEs) in all species examined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). These CNEs might thus represent conserved regulatory regions responsible for ancestral conserved functions of <italic>fhl2a</italic> in teleosts. We might be missing cichlid-specific regulatory regions in important upstream regions although, as our capacity to detect lineage-specific enhancers is limited owing to the small sample size for each lineage and the high background conservation level present in cichlids.</p><p>Concerning <italic>fhl2b</italic>, we did not find any CNE that is shared by cichlids and other teleosts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). Strikingly, however, we found a major difference that is shared by the three egg-spot bearing haplochromines: the presence of a transposable element upstream of <italic>fhl2b</italic>. Specifically, we identified a SINE belonging to the cichlid-specific AFC-SINEs (African cichlid family of SINEs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), which inserted ~800-bp upstream of the transcriptional start site of <italic>fhl2b</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). To confirm that this insertion is associated with the egg-spot phenotype, we sequenced the upstream region of <italic>fhl2b</italic> in 19 cichlid species. The insertion was indeed present in nine additional, egg-spot bearing haplochromine species, yet absent in all 10 non-haplochromines examined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). Importantly, we found that one haplochromine species lacks the AFC-SINE element, namely <italic>P. philander.</italic> This species belongs to one of the basal lineage of haplochromines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), which is characterized by the absence of egg-spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). This suggests that the AFC-SINE upstream of <italic>fhl2b</italic> is not characteristic to the entire haplochromine clade, but to those that feature egg-spots, thus linking the SINE insertion to the origin of this evolutionary innovation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Haplochromine <italic>fhl2b</italic> regulatory region drives iridophore expression</title><p>A long-standing hypothesis proposes that ubiquitous genomic repeat elements are potential regulators of transcription, and could thereby generate evolutionary variations and novelties<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. SINEs are known for their capability of &#x02018;transcriptional rewiring&#x02019;, that is, to change the expression patterns of genes by bringing along new regulatory sequences when inserted in close proximity to a gene&#x02019;s transcriptional initiation site<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. In order to test whether the insertion of an AFC-SINE close to <italic>fhl2b</italic> functions as an enhancer of gene expression, we aimed for a functional experiment. We were particularly interested to find out whether there were changes in enhancer activity between AFC-SINE-positive haplochromines and other cichlids lacking both the insertion and the egg-spot phenotype. To this end, we designed reporter constructs containing the upstream region of <italic>fhl2b</italic> (~2&#x02009;kb upstream to intron 1) of three cichlid species linked to the coding region of green fluorescent protein (GFP), and injected these constructs into zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) embryos to generate transgenic lines. We switched to the zebrafish system here, as no functioning transgenesis was available for haplochromine cichlids at the time the study was performed (owing to the small number of eggs per clutch associated with the characteristic female-mouthbrooding behaviour). The three constructs were derived from <italic>A. burtoni</italic> (haplochromine with egg-spots, AFC-SINE<sup>+</sup>), <italic>P. philander</italic> (haplochromine without egg-spots, AFC-SINE<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) and <italic>N. sexfasciatus</italic> (lamprologine, AFC-SINE<sup>&#x02212;</sup>), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>).</p><p>We were able to produce stable transgenic zebrafish lines for each of the three constructs to examine the expression of GFP. Importantly, we found striking differences in expression between the <italic>A. burtoni</italic> construct and the two constructs lacking the AFC-SINE. Of the three reporter lines, only the AFC-SINE<sup>+</sup> showed GFP expression in iridophores, a silvery-reflective type of pigment cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). This experiment demonstrates the presence of novel enhancer activities in the regulatory region of <italic>fhl2b</italic> in derived haplochromines and strongly suggests that these came along with the SINE insertion.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Iridophores and egg-spot development</title><p>The egg-spot phenotype has previously been associated with pigment cells containing pteridines (xanthophores)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, whereas our new results indicate an auxiliary role of iridophores in egg-spot formation. We thus re-evaluated the adult egg-spot phenotype by removing the pteridine pigments of the xanthophores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). We indeed found that <italic>A. burtoni</italic> egg-spots show a high density of iridophores, which is further corroborated by the increase in gene expression of the iridophore marker <italic>pnp4a</italic> during egg-spot formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). With the exception of the proximal region of the anal fin, the number of iridophores is greatly reduced in the fin tissue surrounding egg-spots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>). Interestingly, this proximal region is the only area of the anal fin besides the egg-spots where we observed <italic>fhl2</italic> expression with RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref> for <italic>fhl2b</italic>), once more linking <italic>fhl2</italic> expression with iridophores (and less so with xanthophores, which are very rare in this region). In the non-haplochromine <italic>N. crassus</italic>, which features a yellow anal fin pattern containing xanthophores, we did not find iridophores in the xanthophore-rich region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>), suggesting that the xanthophore/iridophore pattern is unique to haplochromine egg-spots. Importantly, we also observed that iridophores appear early in the newly forming egg-spot of haplochromines, that is, before the first xanthophores start to aggregate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref>).</p><p>In zebrafish, stripe development is initiated by iridophores, which serve as morphological landmarks for stripe orientation in that they attract further pigment cells such as xanthophores by expressing the <italic>csf1</italic> ligand gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.

An alignment between the genomic regions of the two <italic>fhl2</italic> paralogs shows that there were no CNEs in common and generally very little homology between them, suggesting that the regulation of the expression of <italic>fhl2a</italic> in egg-spots might proceed in a different way (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we were interested in the genetic and developmental basis of egg-spots, an evolutionary innovation of the most species-rich group of cichlids, the haplochromines, where these conspicuous colour markings on the anal fins of males play an important role in mating<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>We first performed a comparative RNAseq experiment that led to the identification of two novel candidate pigmentation genes, the a- and b-paralogs of the four and a half LIM domain protein 2 (<italic>fhl2</italic>) gene. We then confirmed, with qPCR and RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, that the expression domain of both duplicates indeed matches the conspicuously coloured inner circle of egg-spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). Especially the more rapidly evolving b-copy of <italic>fhl2</italic> emerged as strong candidate gene for egg-spot development, as its expression profile mimics the formation of egg-spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the egg-spot bearing haplochromines, but not other cichlids, feature a transposable element in the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory region of <italic>fhl2b</italic>. Finally, making use of transgenic zebrafish, we could show that a <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory change in <italic>fhl2b</italic> in the ancestor of the egg-spot bearing haplochromine cichlids (most likely in the form of the AFC-SINE insertion) resulted in a gain of expression in iridophores, a special type of pigment cells found in egg-spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). This in turn might have led to changes in iridophore cell behaviour and to novel interactions with pigmentation genes (<italic>csf1b</italic>, <italic>csf1ra</italic> and <italic>pnp4a</italic>), thereby contributing to the formation of egg-spots on male anal fins. The specific mode of action of the SINE insertion, and how the <italic>fhl2b</italic> locus interacts with these other pigmentation genes remains elusive at present. Addressing these questions would require functional studies in haplochromines, which are, however, hampered by the specific mechanisms involved in the trait complex of interest (mouthbrooding makes it notoriously difficult to obtain enough eggs&#x02014;in a controlled manner&#x02014;to make such experiments feasible).</p><p>Our results are also suggestive of an important role of the a-copy of <italic>fhl2</italic> in cichlid evolution. With our qPCR experiments, we provide strong evidence that <italic>fhl2a</italic> is involved in jaw tissue in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>) and, importantly, in the pharyngeal jaw apparatus of cichlids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>), another putative evolutionary innovation of this group. The pharyngeal jaw apparatus is a second set of jaws in the pharynx of cichlids that is functionally decoupled from the oral jaws and primarily used to process food<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Interestingly, <italic>fhl2a</italic> has previously been implicated in the evolution of fleshy lips in cichlids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, which is yet another ecologically relevant trait. From a developmental perspective, the main tissues underlying these traits&#x02014;the cranio-facial cartilage (the jaw apparatus) and pigment cells (egg- spots)&#x02014;have the same origin, the neural crest, which itself is considered an evolutionary key innovation of vertebrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. It thus seems that the function of <italic>fhl2</italic> in cichlids may have been split into (a) an ecologically important, that is, naturally selected, scope of duties, and (b) a role in colouration and pigmentation more likely to be targeted by sexual selection.</p><p>Taken together, our study permits us to propose the following hypothesis for the origin of cichlid egg-spots: In one of the early, already female-mouthbrooding, haplochromines the insertion of a transposable element of the AFC-SINE family in the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory region of <italic>fhl2b</italic>, and its associated recruitment to the iridophore pigment cell pathway, mediated the evolution of egg-spots on the anal fins&#x02014;possibly from the so-called <italic>perfleckmuster</italic> common to many cichlids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The conspicuous anal fin spots were fancied by haplochromine females, which&#x02014;just like many other cichlids and also the ancestral and egg-spot-less haplochromine genus <italic>Pseudocrenilabrus</italic>&#x02014;have an innate bias for yellow/orange/red spots that resemble carotenoid-rich prey items<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, leading to the fixation of the novel trait. In today&#x02019;s haplochromines, egg-spots seem to have a much broader range of functions related to sexual selection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.</p><p>Most of the currently studied evolutionary innovations comprise relatively ancient traits (for example, flowers, feathers, tetrapod limb, insect wings and mammalian placenta), thereby making it difficult to scrutinize their genetic and developmental basis. Here we explored a recently evolved novelty, the anal fin egg-spots of male haplochromine cichlids. We uncovered a regulatory change in close proximity to the transcriptional start site of a novel iridophore gene that likely contributes to the molecular basis of the origin of egg-spots in the most rapidly diversifying clade of vertebrates.

The values on the <italic>x</italic> axis represent fish standard length in millimetres (three replicates per developmental stage were used). The error bars represent the s.e.m. <italic>fhl2b</italic> shows the largest increase in expression overall and its expression profile mimics the formation of egg-spots. Three other pigmentation genes (<italic>pnp4a, csf1ra</italic> and <italic>mitfa</italic>) were included for comparative reasons. <italic>csf1ra</italic> and <italic>mitfa</italic> show a much smaller increase in gene expression during egg-spot development than <italic>fhl2a</italic> and especially <italic>fhl2b</italic>, while <italic>pnp4a</italic> shows a constant increase in gene expression throughout the development of egg-spots. (<bold>c</bold>) RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization experiments revealed that both <italic>fhl2</italic> paralogs (results only shown for <italic>fhl2b</italic>) are primarily expressed in the colourful inner circle of haplochromine egg-spots (defined by the solid line) and not in the transparent outer ring (defined by the dashed line). Expression was also observed in the proximal fin region, which also contains pigment cells. Panel 2 is a close-up from the region defined by the square in panel 1.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ncomms6149-f2"/></fig><fig id="f3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Gene tree of the two <italic>fhl2</italic> paralogs and expression profiling in East African cichlid fishes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Bayesian inference phylogeny of the orthology and paralogy relationships between cichlids, other teleosts (<italic>O. latipes</italic>, <italic>D. rerio, Ta. rubripes</italic> and <italic>G. aculeatus</italic>) and tetrapods (<italic>Anolis carolinensis</italic> and <italic>Mus musculus</italic>) <italic>fhl2</italic> sequences. This gene tree is important for generating functional hypotheses about both duplicates, and to infer the ancestral state of the <italic>fhl2</italic> gene before duplication. Our phylogeny indicates that <italic>fhl2a</italic> is more similar to the ancestral state, while <italic>fhl2b</italic> is apparently evolving faster in teleosts. Values at the tree nodes represent posterior probabilities. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>, we present a synteny analysis supporting the origin of teleost <italic>fhl</italic>2 duplicates in the teleost genome duplication.

(<bold>c</bold>) RQ of <italic>fhl2a</italic> and <italic>fhl2b</italic> gene expression in 12 tissues in <italic>N. crassus</italic>, a substrate spawning lamprologine that has no egg-spots. In both species, gill tissue was used as reference; in <italic>N. crassus</italic>, &#x02018;egg-spots&#x02019; corresponds to the fin region where haplochromines would show the egg-spot trait. In <italic>C. pulpican</italic> (<bold>b</bold>), <italic>fhl2a</italic> is highly expressed in heart, in pigmented tissues (eye, skin and egg-spot) and in craniofacial traits (oral jaw and lower pharyngeal jaw); <italic>fhl2b</italic> is mainly expressed in the pigmented tissues. <italic>N. crassus</italic> (<bold>c</bold>) shows a similar expression patterns for <italic>fhl2a</italic> and <italic>fhl2b</italic>, with the difference that <italic>fhl2a</italic> does not show high expression levels in jaw tissues, and <italic>fhl2b</italic> is not highly expressed in skin and fin tissue. These results suggest that <italic>fhl2b</italic> shows a higher functional specialization, and that it might be involved in the morphogenesis of sexually dimorphic traits such as pigmented traits including egg-spots.
