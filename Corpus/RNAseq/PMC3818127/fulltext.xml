profiles to those of TALE-based transcriptional activators and suggest the use of offset
nicking to generate double strand breaks (DSBs) as a potential route to improving
sgRNA:Cas9 genome editing specificity.</p><p id="P3">In <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>, Cas9 generates a blunt-ended double-stranded
break 3bp upstream of the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) via a process mediated by two
catalytic domains in the protein: an HNH domain that cleaves the complementary strand of
the DNA and a RuvC-like domain that cleaves the non-complementary strand<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. To enable RNA-guided genome
regulation, it is essential to first eliminate Cas9 nuclease activity by ablating the
natural activity of RuvC and HNH nucleases domains<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. By searching for sequences with known structure that are
homologous to Cas9 (refer <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 1</xref>), we identified and mutated up to 4 amino acids likely
involved in magnesium coordination (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). The generated quadruple Cas9 mutant showed
undetectable nuclease activity upon deep sequencing at the targeted loci (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>), implying
that we had successfully reduced Cas9 nuclease activity to levels below the threshold of
detection in our assay.</p><p id="P4">Nuclease-deficient Cas9 (hereafter referred to as Cas9<sub>N-</sub>) can in
principle localize transcriptional regulatory domains to targeted loci by fusing these
domains to either Cas9<sub>N-</sub> or to the sgRNA. We explored both approaches in
parallel (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1a, 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P5">To generate a Cas9<sub>N-</sub> fusion protein capable of transcriptional
activation, we directly fused the VP64 activation domain<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> to the C terminus of Cas9<sub>N-</sub> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). This Cas9<sub>N-</sub>VP64 protein robustly
activated transcription of reporter constructs when combined with sgRNAs targeting
sequences near the promoter, thereby displaying RNA-guided transcriptional activation
(<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1c, 1d</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P6">To generate sgRNA tethers capable of transcriptional regulation, we first
determined which regions of the sgRNA will tolerate modifications by inserting random
sequences into the sgRNA and assaying for sgRNA:Cas9 nuclease function. We found that
sgRNAs bearing random sequence insertions at either the 5&#x02032; end of the crRNA
portion or the 3&#x02032; end of the tracrRNA portion of a chimeric sgRNA retain
functionality, whereas insertions into the tracrRNA scaffold portion of the chimeric
sgRNA result in loss of function (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). To recruit VP64 to the sgRNA, we thus appended two
copies of the MS2 bacteriophage coat-protein binding RNA stem-loop<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> to the 3&#x02032; end of the sgRNA (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>) and expressed these chimeric sgRNAs together
with Cas9<sub>N-</sub> and a MS2-VP64 fusion protein. We observed robust
sequence-specific transcriptional activation from reporter constructs only in the
presence of all 3 components (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1c, 1e</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Having successfully activated reporter construct transcription, we next attempted
to regulate endogenous genes. We initially chose to target ZFP42 (REX1) and POU5F1
(OCT4), both tightly regulated genes involved in maintenance of pluripotency. For each
gene we designed multiple sgRNAs targeting a ~5kb stretch of DNA upstream of the
transcription start site and assayed transcriptional activation using either a
promoter-luciferase reporter construct<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> or directly via qPCR of the endogenous genes. We observed that
introduction of individual sgRNAs modestly stimulated transcription of both target
genes, but multiple sgRNAs acted synergistically to stimulate robust multi-fold
transcriptional induction (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs. 3, 4</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. In these experiments, both the Cas9 and sgRNA tethering approaches
were observed to be effective, with the former displaying ~1.5&#x02013;3 fold higher
potency (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). This difference is
likely due to the requirement for 2-component as opposed to 3-component complex
assembly. However, the sgRNA tethering approach, in principle, enables different
effector domains to be recruited by distinct sgRNAs so long as each sgRNA uses a
different RNA-protein interaction pair, enabling multiplex gene regulation using the
same Cas9<sub>N-</sub> protein. We noted that a majority of the stimulation in the above
experiments was by sgRNAs closer to the transcriptional start site, and thus
correspondingly also attempted to regulate two additional genes, SOX2 and NANOG, via
sgRNAs targeting within an upstream ~1kb stretch of promoter DNA (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). And indeed, this
choice of sgRNAs proximal to the transcriptional start site resulted in robust gene
activation.</p><p id="P8">The ability to both edit and regulate genes using the above RNA-guided system
opens the door to versatile multiplex genetic and epigenetic regulation of human cells.
However, an increasingly recognized constraint on Cas9-mediated engineering is the
apparently limited specificity of sgRNA:Cas9 targeting<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Resolution of this issue requires in-depth
interrogation of Cas9 affinity for a very large space of target sequence variations.
Towards this we adapted our RNA-guided transcriptional activation system to serve this
purpose. Our approach provides a direct high-throughput readout of Cas9-targeting in
human cells, avoids complications introduced by dsDNA cut toxicity and mutagenic repair
incurred by specificity testing with native nuclease-active Cas9 and can be adapted to
any programmable DNA binding system. To illustrate this latter point, we also applied
this system to evaluate TALE specificity. The methodology of our approach is outlined in
<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> (also see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>): Briefly, we design a
construct library in which each element of the library comprises a minimal promoter
driving a dTomato fluorescent protein. Downstream of the transcription start site a 24bp
(A/C/G) random transcript tag is inserted and two TF binding sites are placed upstream
of the promoter: one is a constant DNA sequence shared by all library elements. The
second is a variable feature that bears a &#x02018;biased&#x02019; library of binding
sites which are engineered to span a large collection of sequences that present many
combinations of mutations of target sequence that the programmable DNA targeting complex
was designed to bind. We achieved this using degenerate oligonucleotides engineered to
have nucleotide frequencies at each position such that the target sequence nucleotide
appears at a 79% frequency and each other nucleotide occurs at 7%
frequency<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. The reporter
library is then sequenced to reveal the associations between the 24bp dTomato transcript
tags and their corresponding &#x02018;biased&#x02019; target site in the library
element. The large diversity of the transcript tags assures that sharing of tags between
different targets will be rare, whereas the biased construction of the target sequences
means that sites with few mutations will be associated with more tags than sites with
more mutations. Next we stimulate transcription of the dTomato reporter genes with
either a control-TF engineered to bind the shared DNA site, or the target-TF that was
engineered to bind the target site. As assayed by dTomato fluorescence, protein
expression was observed to peak by ~48 hours. To prevent over-stimulation of the library
total RNA was harvested within 24 hours. We then measure the abundance of each expressed
transcript tag in each sample by conducting RNAseq on the stimulated cells, and then map
these back to their corresponding binding sites using the association table established
earlier. Note that one would expect the control-TF to excite all library members equally
because its binding site is shared across all library elements, whereas the target-TF
will skew the distribution of the expressed members to those that are preferentially
targeted by it. This assumption is used to compute a final normalized expression level
for each binding site by dividing the tag counts obtained for the target-TF by those
obtained for the control-TF.</p><p id="P9">We used the above approach to first analyze the targeting landscape of multiple
sgRNA:Cas9 complexes. Our data reveals that these complexes can potentially tolerate
1&#x02013;3 mutations in their target sequences (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig.
2b</xref>). They are also largely insensitive to point mutations, except those
localized to the PAM sequence (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>).
Introduction of 2 base mismatches significantly impairs activity, with highest
sensitivity localized to the 8&#x02013;10 bases nearest to the 3&#x02032; end of the
sgRNA target sequence (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2d</xref>). These results are
further reaffirmed by specificity data generated using two different sgRNA:Cas9
complexes (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>
and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 2, 3</xref>).
Notably, we found that different sgRNAs can have vastly different specificity profiles
(<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs. 7a,
7d</xref>), specifically, sgRNA2 here tolerates up to 3 mismatches and sgRNA3 only up to
1. Again the greatest sensitivity to mismatches was localized to the 3&#x02032; end of
the spacer, albeit mismatches at other positions were also observed to affect
activity.</p><p id="P10">We next conducted additional experiments to validate these results.
Specifically, we first confirmed the assay is specific for the sgRNA being evaluated, as
a corresponding mutant sgRNA is unable to stimulate the reporter library (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). We also
confirmed via targeted experiments that single-base mismatches within 12bp of the
3&#x02032; end of the spacer in the assayed sgRNAs indeed still result in detectable
targeting, however 2bp mismatches in this region result in significant loss of activity
(<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>).
Furthermore, based on the observed insensitivity to mutations in the 5&#x02032; portion
of the spacer, we conjectured that this region was not entirely required for sgRNA
specificity and thus likely small truncations in this region would still result in
retention of sgRNA activity. Supporting this hypothesis we observed that 1&#x02013;3bp
5&#x02032; truncations are indeed well tolerated (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). Finally, an
interesting revelation of the single-base mismatch data from both these experiments was
that the predicted PAM for the <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> Cas9 is not just NGG but
also NAG<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. We confirmed this result
with targeted experiments using the wild-type Cas9 in a nuclease assay (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Taken together, our data demonstrate that the sgRNA:Cas9 system can potentially
tolerate multiple mismatches in its target sequence. Consequently, achieving high
targeting specificity with current experimental formats will likely require judicious
and potentially complicated bioinformatic choice of sgRNAs. Indeed, when we rescanned a
previously generated set of ~190K Cas9 targets in human exons that had no alternate NGG
targets sharing the last 13nt of the targeting sequence<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> for the presence of alternate NAG sites or for
NGG sites with a mismatch in the prior 13nt, only .04% were found to have no
such alternate targets.</p><p id="P12">We note that our theoretical calculations suggest that there should be an
exponential relationship between the cutting and mutation rates induced by a Cas9
nuclease and the expression level of a gene driven by a Cas9-TF (refer <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 2</xref>), such that direct
tests of specificity using Cas9 nucleases should be more sensitive and also more
reflective of consequences of the underlying chromatin context. However, our TF assay
offers a significant compensatory advantage in the form of convenient high-throughput
multiplexing via RNAseq.</p><p id="P13">We next applied our transcriptional specificity assay to examine the mutational
tolerance of another widely used genome engineering tool, TALE proteins. As a genome
editing tool usually TALE-FokI dimers are used, and for genome regulation TALE-VP64
fusions have been shown to be highly effective. We used the latter as it was compatible
with our transcriptional activation assay and this format also reveals the specificity
profile of individual TALE proteins. Examining the TALE off-targeting data (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2e, 2f, 2g</xref>) reveals that 18-mer TALEs<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> can potentially tolerate 1&#x02013;2
mutations in their target sequences, but fail to activate a large majority of 3 base
mismatch variants in their targets. They are also particularly sensitive to mismatches
nearer the 5&#x02032; end of their target sequences<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Notably, certain mutations in the middle of the target lead to
higher TALE activity, an aspect that needs further evaluation. We confirmed a subset of
the above results via targeted experiments in a nuclease assay (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). We also observed
that shorter TALEs (14-mer and 10-mer) are progressively less tolerant to mismatches but
also reduced in activity by an order of magnitude (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>) <sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. To decouple the role of individual
repeat-variable diresidues (RVDs), we confirmed that choice of RVDs<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> does contribute to base specificity but TALE
specificity is also a function of the binding energy of the protein as a whole (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>). While a
larger data-set would shed further light into the intricacies of TALE specificity
profiles, our data imply that engineering shorter TALEs or TALEs bearing a judicious
composition of high and low affinity monomers can potentially yield higher specificity
in genome engineering applications and the requirement for FokI dimerization in nuclease
applications enables a further dramatic reduction in off-target effects especially when
using the shorter TALEs<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P14">Unlike TALEs where direct control of the size or monomer composition is a ready
approach to modulating specificity, there are limited current avenues for engineering
the sgRNA:Cas9 complex towards lower binding affinity (and hence higher specificity) for
their targets<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. We therefore focused on exploiting
cooperativity requirements to improve specificity, akin to the use of ZF/TALE fusions to
the dimeric FokI endonuclease that creates the requirement for the simultaneous binding
of two adjacent ZFs/TALEs. Because synergy between multiple complexes is critical to
ensure robust target gene activation by Cas9<sub>N-</sub>VP64, transcriptional
regulation applications of Cas9<sub>N-</sub> is naturally specific as individual
off-target binding events should have minimal effect. Although it should be noted that
since individual sgRNA:Cas9 complexes can result in measurable activation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>), potential off-target effects might be
magnified when perturbations are highly multiplexed.</p><p id="P15">In the context of genome-editing, we chose to focus on creating off-set nicks to
generate DSBs. Our motivation stems from the observation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 15</xref>) that a large
majority of nicks do not result in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) mediated
indels<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>., and thus when
inducing off-set nicks, off-target single nick events will likely result in very low
indel rates. Towards this we found that inducing off-set nicks to generate DSBs is
highly effective at inducing gene disruption at both integrated reporter loci (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) and at the native AAVS1 genomic locus (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs. 16, 17</xref>).
Furthermore, we also noted that consistent with the standard model for homologous
recombination (HR) mediated repair<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>
engineering of 5&#x02032; overhangs via off-set nicks generated more robust NHEJ events
than 3&#x02032; overhangs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). In addition to
a stimulation of NHEJ, we also observed robust induction of HR when the 5&#x02032;
overhangs were created. generation of 3&#x02032; overhangs did not result in improvement
of HR rates (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3c</xref>). It remains to be determined
if Cas9 biochemistry or chromatin state and nucleotide composition of the genomic loci
also contributed to the observed results above. While we did not actually measure
off-target activity of this methodology, we believe the use of cooperativity such as
with off-set nicks for generating DSBs offers a promising route for mitigating the
effects of off-target sgRNA:Cas9 activity.</p><p id="P16">In summary, we have engineered the sgRNA:Cas9 system to enable RNA-guided genome
regulation in human cells by tethering transcriptional activation domains to either a
nuclease-null Cas9 or to guide RNAs. We expect the use of additional effector domains
such as repressors, dimeric and monomeric nucleases, and epigenetic modulators to
further expand this sgRNA:Cas9 toolset. As activation by individual sgRNA:Cas9 complexes
was not observed to be strong and needed synergy among multiple complexes for robust
transcription, exploring activity of Cas9-activators based on other Cas9 orthologs will
be an important avenue for future studies.</p><p id="P17">Based on these RNA-guided regulators we additionally implemented a
transcriptional activation based assay to determine the landscape of off-target binding
by sgRNA:Cas9 complexes and compared them to TALE effectors. We observed that the
sgRNA:Cas9 system can result in off-targeting events. We noted that there are large
differences in specificity between evaluated sgRNAs (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Based on this we
speculate that sgRNA-DNA binding (and associated thermodynamic parameters) are a
prominent determinant of specificity. Thus judicious choice of sgRNAs (such as avoidance
of poly-G, poly-C rich spacers, and use of targets &#x0003e;3 mismatches away from the
genome) will be a productive route to improved target specificity, albeit rules
governing their precise design such as Tm, nucleotide composition, secondary structure
of sgRNA spacer versus scaffold and role of the underlying chromatin structure of the
target loci remain to be determined. Controlling the dose and duration of Cas9 and sgRNA
expression will also be critical for engineering high specificity, and thus RNA based
delivery will be an attractive genome editing route<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Although structure-guided design and directed evolution may
eventually improve the specificity of individual Cas9 proteins, we have also shown here
that engineering a requirement for cooperativity via off-set nicking to generate DSBs
can potentially ameliorate off-target activity, and will perhaps be an useful approach
for exploring therapeutic applications. Use of small molecule modulators of HR/NHEJ
pathways and co-expression of associated end processing enzymes could further help
refine this methodology. Overall, the ease and efficacy of editing and regulating
genomes using the Cas9 RNA-guided genome engineering approach will have broad
implications for our ability to tune and program complex biological systems.</p><sec id="S1" specific-use="web-only"><title>Online Methods</title><sec id="S2"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p id="P18">The Cas9 mutants were generated using the Quikchange kit (Agilent

paired reads to a set of 250bp reference sequences that corresponded to
234bp of the constructs flanked by the pairs of 8bp library barcodes (see
<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure

supplied to novoalign, the 23bp degenerate Cas9 binding site regions and the
24bp degenerate transcript tag regions (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6a</xref>, first
level) were specified as Ns, wheras the construct library barcodes were
explicitly provided. For TALE experiments, the same procedures were used

<italic>Validity checking:</italic> Novoalign output for comprised files
in which left and right reads for each read pair were individually aligned
to the reference sequences. Only read pairs that were both uniquely aligned
to the reference sequence were subjected to additional validity conditions,
and only read pairs that passed all of these conditions were retained. The
validity conditions included: (i) Each of the two construct library barcodes
must align in at least 4 positions to a reference sequence barcode, and the
two barcodes must to the barcode pair for the same construct library. (ii)
All bases aligning to the N regions of the reference sequence must be called
by novoalign as As, Cs, Gs or Ts. Note that for neither Cas9 nor TALE
experiments did left and right reads overlap in a reference N region, so
that the possibility of ambiguous novoalign calls of these N bases did not
arise. (iii) Likewise, no novoalign-called inserts or deletions must appear
in these regions. (iv) No Ts must appear in the transcript tag region (as
these random sequences were generated from As, Cs, and Gs only). Read pairs
for which any one of these conditions were violated were collected in a
rejected read pair file. These validity checks were implemented using custom
perl scripts.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Induced sample reporter gene cDNA sequence processing</title><p id="P26"><italic>Alignment:</italic> SeqPrep (downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jstjohn/SeqPrep">https://github.com/jstjohn/SeqPrep</ext-link> on June 18, 2012) was

after which novoalign (version above) was used to align these 79bp common
segments as unpaired single reads to a set of reference sequences (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure

merging of read pairs, validity processing did not have to filter for unique

reads, so that validity processing only applied these tag regions of the
reference sequences and not also to a separate binding site region.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Assembly of table of binding sites <italic>vs.</italic> transcript tag
associations</title><p id="P27">Custom perl was used to generate these tables from the validated
construct library sequences (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6a</xref>,
4<sup>th</sup> level, left). Although the 24bp tag sequences composed of
A, C, and G bases should be essentially unique across a construct library
(probability of sharing = ~2.8e-11), early analysis of binding site
<italic>vs.</italic> tag associations revealed that a non-negligible
fraction of tag sequences were in fact shared by multiple binding sequences,
likely mainly caused by a combination of sequence errors in the binding
sequences, or oligo synthesis errors in the oligos used to generate the
construct libraries. In addition to tag sharing, tags found associated with
binding sites in validated read pairs might also be found in the construct
library read pair reject file if it was not clear, due to barcode
mismatches, which construct library they might be from. Finally, the tag
sequences themselves might contain sequence errors. To deal with these
sources of error, tags were categorized with three attributes: (i)
<italic>safe vs. unsafe</italic>, where <italic>unsafe</italic> meant
the tag could be found in the construct library rejected read pair file;
<italic>shared vs. nonshared</italic>, where <italic>shared</italic>
meant the tag was found associated with multiple binding site sequences, and
<italic>2+ vs. 1-only</italic>, where
<italic>2+</italic> meant that the tag appeared at least twice
among the validated construct library sequences and so presumed to be less
likely to contain sequence errors. Combining these three criteria yielded 8
classes of tags associated with each binding site, the most secure (but
least abundant) class comprising only <italic>safe, nonshared,
2+</italic> tags; and the least secure (but most abundant) class
comprising all tags regardless of safety, sharing, or number of
occurrences.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Computation of normalized expression levels</title><p id="P28">Custom perl code was used to implement the steps indicated in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure
6a</xref>, levels 5&#x02013;6. First, tag counts obtained for each
induced sample were aggregated for each binding site, using the binding site
<italic>vs.</italic> transcript tag table previously computed for the
construct library (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6c</xref>). For each sample, the aggregated tag
counts for each binding site were then divided by the aggregated tag counts
for the positive control sample to generate normalized expression levels.
Additional considerations relevant to these calculations included:</p><list list-type="order" id="L1"><list-item><p id="P29">For each sample, a subset of &#x0201c;novel&#x0201d; tags
were found among the validity-checked cDNA gene sequences that could

association table. These tags were ignored in the subsequent
calculations.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P30">The aggregations of tag counts described above were
performed for each of the eight classes of tags described above in
binding site <italic>vs.</italic> transcript tag association table.
Because the binding sites in the construct libraries were biased to
generate sequences similar to a central sequence frequently, but
sequences with increasing numbers of mismatches increasingly rarely,
binding sites with few mismatches generally aggregated to large
numbers of tags, wheras binding sites with more mismatches
aggregated to smaller numbers. Thus, although use of the most secure
tag class was generally desirable, evaluation of binding sites with
two or more mismatches might be based on small numbers of tags per
binding site, making the secure counts and ratios less statistically
reliable even if the tags themselves were more reliable. Some
compensation for this consideration obtains from the fact that the
number of separate aggregated tag counts for <italic>n</italic>
mismatching positions grew with the number of combinations of
mismatching positions (equal to ), and so dramatically increases
with <italic>n</italic>; thus the averages of aggregated tag counts
for different numbers <italic>n</italic> of mismatches (shown in
<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2b, 2e</xref>, and in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs.

of aggregated tag counts for <italic>n</italic> &#x02265; 2. We note
that for consistency in this study, however, all tags were used for
all data sets.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P31">Finally, the binding site built into the TALE construct
libraries was 18bp and tag associations were assigned based on these
18bp sequences, but some experiments were conducted with TALEs
programmed to bind central 14bp or 10bp regions within the 18bp
construct binding site regions. In computing expression levels for
these TALEs, tags were aggregated to binding sites based on the
corresponding regions of the 18bp binding sites in the association
table, so that binding site mismatches outside of this region were
ignored.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Expression level boxplot P-values</title><p id="P32">For the expression level boxplots in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs. 7, 8, 13</xref>, P-values were computed comparing
the mean expression levels between consecutive numbers of target sequence
mismatches, so that for a boxplot showing expression level values associated

vs. 1, 1 vs. 2, 2 vs. 3, &#x02026;, 7 vs. 8). Because the 0 mismatch
expression level data comprises a single value, the t-test performed for the
0 vs. 1 comparison is a single sample t-test comparing this single value
against the distribution of 1 mismatch expression levels. For all other
comparisons, two-sample, two-tailed, t-tests were performed assuming unequal
variance. All P-values were calculated using MatLab (MathWorks, Waltham)
version 2013b. Significance is portrayed using symbols * for

the seed region at the 3&#x02032; end of the 20bp target region (excluding
the PAM sequence in positions 21&#x02013;23) by considering a range of
candidate seed start positions. For each candidate start position, the
normalized expression levels for position pairs, both of which were at or
beyond the candidate start position, were accumulated in one set, and the
expression values for position pairs, at least one of which was ahead of the
candidate start position were accumulated in another set. The P-value of the
separation of the central values of these two sets of normalized expression
levels was then computed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test as calculated by
the MatLab ranksum function. The start position associated with the lowest
P-value in the range of positions tested was interpreted as the beginning of
the seed region. An adjacent start position had virtually the same P-value
as the minimum (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3b</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S12"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS509616-supplement-1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e757" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S13"><p>P.M. thanks Reza Kalhor for insightful discussions.

transcriptional activation, we directly tethered the VP64 activation domain to
the C terminus of Cas9<sub>N-</sub>. <bold>(b)</bold> To generate sgRNA tethers
capable of recruiting activation domains, we appended two copies of the MS2
bacteriophage coat-protein binding RNA stem-loop to the 3&#x02032; end of the
sgRNA and expressed these chimeric sgRNAs together with Cas9<sub>N-</sub> and
MS2-VP64 fusion protein. <bold>(c)</bold> Design of reporter constructs used to
assay transcriptional activation is shown. Note that the two reporters bear
distinct sgRNA target sites, and share a control TALE-TF target site.
<bold>(d)</bold> Cas9<sub>N-</sub>VP64 fusions display RNA-guided
transcriptional activation as assayed by both fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) and immunofluorescence assays (IF). Specifically, whereas the
control TALE-TF activated both reporters, the Cas9<sub>N-</sub>VP64 fusion
activates reporters in a sgRNA sequence specific manner. <bold>(e)</bold> As
assayed by both FACS and IF we observed robust sgRNA sequence-specific
transcriptional activation from reporter constructs only in the presence of all
3 components: Cas9<sub>N-</sub>, MS2-VP64 and sgRNA bearing the appropriate MS2
aptamer binding sites. The bar in the micrographs is 100&#x003bc;m.
<bold>(f)</bold> For the REX1 gene we designed 10 sgRNAs (positions
indicated in the figure) targeting a ~5kb stretch of DNA upstream of the
transcription start site (DNase hypersensitive sites are highlighted in green),
and assayed transcriptional activation using both the above approaches via qPCR
of the endogenous genes. Although introduction of individual sgRNAs modestly
stimulated transcription, multiple sgRNAs acted synergistically to stimulate
robust multi-fold transcriptional induction. Note that in the absence of the
2X-MS2 aptamers on the sgRNA we do not observe transcriptional activation via
the sgRNA-MS2-VP64 tethering approach. Data are means +/&#x02212; SEM

TALEs</title><p><bold>(a)</bold> The methodology of our approach is outlined (refer also <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).
<bold>(b)</bold> The targeting landscape of a sgRNA:Cas9 complex reveals
that it is potentially tolerant to 1&#x02013;3 mutations in its target
sequences. <bold>(c)</bold> The sgRNA:Cas9 complex is also largely insensitive
to point mutations, except those localized to the PAM sequence. Notably this
data reveals that the predicted PAM for the <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> Cas9 is
not just NGG but also NAG. <bold>(d)</bold> Introduction of 2 base mismatches
significantly impairs the sgRNA:Cas9 complex activity, primarily when these are
localized to the 8&#x02013;10 bases nearer the 3&#x02032; end of the sgRNA
target sequence (in the heat plot the target sequence positions are labeled from
1&#x02013;23 starting from the 5&#x02032; end). <bold>(e)</bold> Similarly
examining the TALE off-targeting data for an 18-mer TALE reveals that it can
potentially tolerate 1&#x02013;2 mutations in its target sequence, and fails to
activate a large majority of 3 base mismatch variants in its targets.
<bold>(f)</bold> The 18-mer TALE is, similar to the sgRNA:Cas9 complexes,
largely insensitive to single base mismatched in its target. <bold>(g)</bold>
Introduction of 2 base mismatches significantly impairs the 18-mer TALE
activity. Notably we observe that TALE activity is more sensitive to mismatches
nearer the 5&#x02032; end of its target sequence (in the heat plot the target
sequence positions are labeled from 1&#x02013;18 starting from the 5&#x02032;
end). Statistical significance symbols are: *** for
P&#x0003c;.0005/<italic>n</italic>, ** for
P&#x0003c;.005/<italic>n</italic>, * for P&#x0003c;.05/<italic>n</italic>, and

events upon introduction of targeted nicks or breaks: DNA cleavage events
resolved through the HDR pathway restore the GFP sequence (via a donor
template), whereas mutagenic NHEJ causes frame-shifts rendering the GFP out of
frame and the downstream mCherry sequence in frame. For the assay, we designed
14 sgRNAs covering a 200bp stretch of DNA: 7 targeting the sense strand
(U1&#x02013;7) and 7 the antisense strand (D1&#x02013;7). Using the Cas9D10A
mutant, which nicks the complementary strand, we used different two-way
combinations of the sgRNAs to induce a range of programmed 5&#x02032; or
3&#x02032; overhangs (the nicking sites for the 14 sgRNAs are indicated).
<bold>(b)</bold> Inducing off-set nicks to generate DSBs is highly effective
at inducing gene disruption. Notably off-set nicks leading to 5&#x02032;
overhangs result in more NHEJ events as opposed to 3&#x02032; overhangs.
<bold>(c)</bold> Again, off-set nicks leading to 5&#x02032; overhangs also
result in more HR and NHEJ events as opposed to 3&#x02032; overhangs. In
<bold>(b,c)</bold> the predicted overhang lengths are indicated below the
