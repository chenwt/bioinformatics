Although this transformation has been studied by marker expression analysis and fate-mapping, the mechanisms that control the progression of lung progenitors along distinct lineages into mature alveolar cell types remain obscure, in part due to the limited number of lineage markers<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>-<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and the effects of ensemble averaging in conventional transcriptome analysis experiments on cell populations<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>&#x02013;<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. We used microfluidic single cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on 198 individual cells at 4 different stages encompassing alveolar differentiation to measure the transcriptional states which define the developmental and cellular hierarchy of the distal mouse lung epithelium. We empirically classified cells into distinct groups using an unbiased genome-wide approach that did not require <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge of the underlying cell types or prior purification of cell populations. The results confirmed the basic outlines of the classical model of epithelial cell type diversity in the distal lung and led to the discovery of many novel cell type markers and transcriptional regulators that discriminate between the different populations. We reconstructed the molecular steps during maturation of bipotential progenitors along both alveolar lineages and elucidated the full lifecycle of the alveolar type 2 cell lineage. This single cell genomics approach is applicable to any developing or mature tissue to robustly delineate molecularly distinct cell types, define progenitors and lineage hierarchies, and identify lineage-specific regulatory factors.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">In mice, alveolar epithelial cells differentiate between embryonic days (E) 16.5 and 18.5: distal airway tips expand into sac-like configurations ("sacculation") as a morphologically uniform population of low columnar progenitors proceeds towards the fate of either flat alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells specialized for gas exchange or surfactant-secreting cuboidal alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Figure 1</xref>). At each time point during sacculation, progenitors, intermediates, and recently differentiated cells coexist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. To resolve the cellular composition of the developing bronchio-alveolar epithelium, we initially sequenced transcriptomes of 80 individual live cells of the developing mouse lung epithelium late in sacculation (embryonic day E18.5, 3 biological replicates). Single cell suspensions of micro-dissected distal lung regions were purified using magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) to deplete leukocytes and alveolar macrophages and enrich for epithelial cells (CD45<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figure 2</xref>). An automated microfluidic platform was used to capture and lyse individual epithelial cells, reverse transcribe RNA, and amplify cDNA.</p><p id="P4">RNA-seq libraries from the amplification products of single cells as well as bulk control samples were sequenced to a depth of 2-5 million reads per library (Methods). Saturation analysis confirmed that this sequencing depth is sufficient to detect most genes expressed by single cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Figure 3a</xref>). Technical noise and dynamic range were assessed using RNA control spike-in standards and by comparing single cells with the bulk samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Figure 3b-e</xref>). The results are consistent with previous data from our group<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and others<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>&#x02013;<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>; we obtained single transcript sensitivity and high (~10<sup>5</sup>) dynamic range. Comparison of three biological replicate experiments showed that median expression of all genes across single cells was strongly correlated (r = 0.91 and r = 0.92, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Figure 3f-g</xref>).</p><p id="P5">We performed principal component analysis (PCA) on all 80 single cell transcriptomes using genes expressed in more than two cells and with a non-zero variance (8578 genes). Genes with highest loadings in the first four principal components were analyzed by unsupervised hierarchical clustering as well as PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data 3</xref>). This unbiased approach detected five different cell populations and four different gene families, which permutation analysis showed to be highly significant (Methods). Using known marker genes within the different clusters, we were able to associate cells with four previously reported epithelial cell types (Clara (<italic>Scgb1a1</italic>), ciliated (<italic>Foxj1</italic>), AT1 (<italic>Pdpn</italic>, <italic>Ager</italic>) and AT2 (<italic>Sftpc</italic>, <italic>Sftpb</italic>) cells). The fifth group was characterized by co-expression of AT1 and AT2 marker genes and was located on the PCA plot between the populations of AT1 and AT2 cells, suggesting either an intermediate population transitioning between the two alveolar lineages or a population of bipotential alveolar progenitors. As discussed below, transcriptional profiles of distal lung epithelial cells at E16.5 implicate this fifth population as alveolar bipotential progenitor (BP) cells<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. We validated these findings in two biological replicates of pooled E18.5 lungs using microfluidic single cell qPCR experiments: hierarchical clustering of 10 known alveolar and bronchiolar marker genes identified the same five populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Figure 5a-d</xref>). Together, these results show that single cell RNA-seq enables the identification and molecular characterization of cell types and developmental intermediates retrospectively without the need to first purify populations of interest.</p><p id="P6">In addition to classifying the epithelial cell populations in the distal lung at E18.5, our analysis identified sets of genes specific to each population, providing a battery of novel markers that can be used to distinguish cells from each alveolar and bronchiolar lineage. We used Guilt-By-Association and correlation analysis to assess the significance of co-expression of genes in all cells belonging to a specific cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Data 4</xref>, Methods). The large number of lineage-specific genes allowed us to annotate functions of individual cell types by gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figure 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Data 5</xref>): AT1 cells were enriched in pathways associated with ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, tight and adherens junction as well as regulation of actin cytoskeleton; AT2 cells were enriched for adipocytokine and PPAR signaling as well as lysosome pathways; the Clara cell lineage was enriched for metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, drug metabolism as well as glutathione metabolism, and ciliated cells showed enrichment for progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation and cell cycle pathways. Furthermore, we identified transcription factors, receptors and ligands whose expression profile across all single cells strongly correlated with the individual cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figure 4b,c</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Among the numerous newly identified putative cell-type markers, several are of particular interest. <italic>Hopx</italic> transcription factor was previously reported to regulate alveolar maturation by suppressing surfactant protein production in AT2 cells<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>; our data show that <italic>Hopx</italic> is expressed in BPs, turns off in maturing AT2 cells, and is maintained in AT1 cells. We validated AT1 specific expression of <italic>Hopx</italic> by transgenic labeling and colocalization with two AT1 markers, <italic>Pdpn</italic> and <italic>Ager</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figure 4e</xref>). We also found that <italic>Vegfa</italic> endothelial growth factor is specifically expressed in the AT1 lineage, presumably serving as a signal to activate nearby capillary endothelial cells; AT1-specific expression was validated by single cell qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figure 4d</xref>). <italic>Egfl6</italic>, encoding a protein implicated in cell adhesion and cell differentiation, is specifically expressed in AT2 cells; AT2-specific expression was confirmed by multiplex in-situ hybridization with the canonical AT2 marker <italic>Sftpc</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>). Krt15, a component of intermediate filaments, was specifically expressed in the Clara cell lineage, which we validated by co-staining with the canonical Clara cell marker Scgb1a1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>). Finally, we used single cell multiplexed qPCR to validate lineage specific expression of six additional genes including <italic>Itgb4</italic> and <italic>Top2a</italic> for ciliated cells, <italic>Cftr</italic>, <italic>Cebpa</italic>, <italic>Sftpd</italic> and <italic>Id2</italic> for the AT2 lineage and <italic>Vegfa</italic> for the AT1 lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figure 4d</xref>). Most genes specifically expressed by the AT2 lineage at E18.5 were also detected by single cell RNA-seq in mature AT2 cells of an adult mouse lung, whereas genes specific to AT1, Clara or ciliated cells were not or low expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figure 4f</xref>). In summary, we identified a large number of new, and potentially more specific markers for various biological processes and stages relevant to alveolar and bronchiolar maturation.</p><p id="P8">Identification of the progenitor and differentiated cell types at E18.5 prompted further investigation of developmental intermediates in the alveolar maturation pathway. Sacculation of distal airway tubules commences at E16.5 and the distal epithelium is dominated by alveolar progenitor cells at this time<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Therefore, we measured transcript levels of 10 known marker genes in 107 single cells of the distal lung epithelium at both E16.5 (33 cells) and E18.5 (74 cells) using multiplexed single cell qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Figure 5a-d</xref>). Marker gene expression profile and PCA identified Clara and ciliated cells distinct from alveolar lineages at both E16.5 and E18.5, corroborating the earlier separation of bronchiolar from alveolar maturation pathways. However, gene expression of alveolar cells showed no segregation into AT1 and AT2 lineages at E16.5, as marker genes for both subpopulations were commonly expressed by all cells, while by E18.5 they had clearly separated. This is consistent with a recent temporo-spatial marker study suggesting that AT1 and AT2 lineages emerge from a common BP<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. In addition to BPs and mature alveolar cells at E18.5, we observed cells in intermediate maturation stages based on partial coexpression of AT1 and AT2 marker genes. We used the newly identified genes specific for each mature alveolar cell type to sub-classify these intermediates and thereby reconstruct the molecular pathway of differentiation of BPs into AT1 and AT2 lineages, grouping the genes into early and late markers of either lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 3</xref>). We confirmed the presence of developmental intermediates showing heterogeneity in marker gene expression by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Figure 5f-i</xref>)</p><p id="P9">The constructed hierarchy identified transcription factors, receptors, and ligands showing expression changes that correlated with specific transitions in the maturation states of alveolar cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Figure 5e</xref>). The transcription factors <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Cited2</italic> were expressed in BP and AT2 cells, whereas <italic>Hes1</italic> was expressed in BP and AT1 cells. Interestingly, we did not detect any transcription factors that initiated expression exclusively in either of the maturing alveolar lineages, suggesting that lineage commitment involves down-regulation of factors active in alveolar progenitor cells rather than <italic>de novo</italic> expression of a lineage specific transcription factor. Ligands were expressed in either BP and AT2 (<italic>Cxcl15</italic>, <italic>Cmtm8</italic>) or BP and AT1 cells (<italic>Sema3a</italic>, <italic>Tgfb</italic>, <italic>Vegfa</italic>), and receptors were expressed in either a BP (<italic>Fzd2</italic>), BP/AT2 (<italic>Fgfr2</italic>) or BP/AT1 (<italic>Gprc5a</italic>) pattern. These results show that our approach can be utilized to characterize transcriptional profiles of transient cellular intermediates during a dynamic maturation process within a complex tissue.</p><p id="P10">Finally, we explored temporal changes within the distal lung by sequencing additional single cell transcriptomes prior to (E14.5, 45 progenitor cells), early in (E16.5, 27 progenitor cells), and long after (adult, 46 transgenically labeled AT2 cells) sacculation. We performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of <italic>Sftpc</italic>-positive cells (124 cells) using genes with the highest PC loadings in a PCA analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 4a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Data 6</xref>). Cells clustered in groups that highly correlated with developmental stage of cell isolation, in sequence from early progenitors (EP), via BP and nascent AT1 and AT2 cells, to mature AT2 cells. Thus, AT2 cell maturation occurs in a progressive manner via transcriptionally distinct intermediates that can be robustly discriminated by expression profile throughout embryonic and adult life. The population of EP cells co-expresses AT2 marker <italic>Sftpc</italic> and AT1 marker <italic>Pdpn</italic>, indicating that these cells are located at the tips of the branching epithelial tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Figure 6a</xref>). EP cells segregate into two sub-groups, one exclusive to E14.5 (early EPs, EP-A) and the other present at both E14.5 and E16.5 (late EPs, EP-B), indicating that cellular differentiation is not fully synchronous throughout the lung. Both EP populations show high expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression and chromosome dynamics (gene groups IIIa, IIb and IIIa, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 4a,c</xref>), which are downregulated during the transition of EPs to BPs. The down-regulated EP-specific genes include transcription factor <italic>Sox11</italic>, which is expressed in the developing airway epithelium and causes an alveolar defect when mutant<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, as well as <italic>Tuba1a</italic>, a putative target of <italic>Sox11</italic><sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>; this suggests that <italic>Sox11</italic> could be involved in maintaining the proliferative competence of EP cells. At E18.5, BP cells expressing both AT1 and AT2 markers appear in conjunction with intermediate populations with reduced expression of AT1 markers (nascent AT2) or AT2 markers (nascent AT1). Mature AT2 cells are characterized by expression of genes involved in respiratory gas exchange and immune response (gene group IV) and were only detected at adult stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 4a</xref>). Interestingly, the overall number of genes as well as the total number of transcripts expressed in each cell were strongly correlated with its differentiation state: early progenitor cells at E14.5 expressed up to 6000 genes, whereas mature AT2 cells expressed about 4-6 times fewer genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Figure 7a</xref>). In summary, we followed the full lifecycle of <italic>Sftpc</italic><sup>+</sup> cells and identified seven gene sets that robustly distinguish multipotential, bipotential, nascent, and mature AT2 cell states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Figure 6b</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We anticipate that a similar strategy to that pursued here can be applied to virtually any tissue to empirically classify and characterize the panoply of developing and mature cell types, elucidate the molecular regulation of these distinct populations, and explore how they are disrupted in disease.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2" specific-use="web-only"><title>Online-only Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Mouse strains</title><p id="P13">Timed-pregnant C57BL/6J females (JAX) were used for all embryonic time points reported with gestation age verified by crown-rump length prior to use.

Distal lung epithelial cells at E14.5 express over 6000 genes, whereas cells at E18.5 express approximately 3000 and mature AT2 cells only around 2000 genes. Each point on the saturation curve was generated by randomly selecting a number of raw reads from each sample library and then using the same alignment pipeline to call genes with mean FPKM &#x0003e;1. Each point represents four replicate sub-samplings. Error bars represent standard errors. All libraries were sequenced to a depth of at least 2 million reads.</p><p id="P60">(b) Single cell RNA-seq reveals that the total number of transcripts expressed by single cells decreases with increasing differentiation state of the cell. Number of transcripts per cell were calculated from the FPKM values of all genes in each cell using the correlation between number of transcripts of exogenous spike-in mRNA sequences and their respective measured mean FPKM values (exemplary calibration curves are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Figure 3c</xref> for three replicates at E18.5).
