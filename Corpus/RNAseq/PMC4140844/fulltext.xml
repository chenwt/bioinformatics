While a rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV has been established, the lack of uniform, severe disease in this model complicates the analysis of countermeasure studies. Modeling of the interaction between the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein and its receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 predicted comparable interaction energies in common marmosets and humans. The suitability of the marmoset as a MERS-CoV model was tested by inoculation via combined intratracheal, intranasal, oral and ocular routes. Most of the marmosets developed a progressive severe pneumonia leading to euthanasia of some animals. Extensive lesions were evident in the lungs of all animals necropsied at different time points post inoculation. Some animals were also viremic; high viral loads were detected in the lungs of all infected animals, and total RNAseq demonstrated the induction of immune and inflammatory pathways. This is the first description of a severe, partially lethal, disease model of MERS-CoV, and as such will have a major impact on the ability to assess the efficacy of vaccines and treatment strategies as well as allowing more detailed pathogenesis studies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The development of vaccines and treatment strategies is aided by robust animal disease models that accurately depict the illness that is observed in humans. Here we describe a new, improved model for MERS-CoV using the common marmoset, whereby the severe, and even lethal, illness that has been observed in many human cases is recapitulated. Prior to the development of this model, the only available animal models for MERS-CoV infection were the rhesus macaque and a mouse model that requires adenovirus-transduced expression of the human version of the protein required for virus entry. The rhesus macaque model more closely mimics the mild to moderate disease observed in some patients&#x02014;mainly those without significant comorbidities. The increased severity of illness in the common marmoset model is an important advance in the ability to evaluate potential therapeutic agents against MERS-CoV, as discrimination between successfully treated and control animals should be more apparent. In addition, the closer models recapitulate the disease observed in humans, the more likely findings can be eventually translated into use in humans.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) in addition to grants for the Development of Nonhuman Primate Reference Transcriptome Resources (R24OD011172-03) and the Washington National Primate Research Center (P51OD010425) to MGK.

With over 836 cases and at least 290 deaths <xref rid="ppat.1004250-ProMEDmail1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, there has been a rapid increase in the number of MERS-CoV cases as diagnostics are being more widely applied. While dromedary camels are suspected to be involved in zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Haagmans1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004250-Briese1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>; and camel as well as horse DPP4 can efficiently facilitate virus entry <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Barlan1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, the mechanism(s) by which most people acquire MERS-CoV is still unclear. Since targeted attempts to prevent zoonotic transmission are currently not feasible and significant morbidity and mortality still occur in individuals with comorbidities, developing effective prophylactic and therapeutic treatment strategies remains a high priority. Although several treatment regimens have been suggested for use in patients based on <italic>in vitro</italic> MERS-CoV studies or treatment implemented during the SARS-CoV pandemic, only one such treatment has been tested <italic>in vivo</italic> against MERS-CoV to date <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Falzarano1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. To enable a better evaluation of MERS-CoV treatment and prevention strategies, an animal model more representative of severe human disease is crucial.</p><p>Assessment of potential treatments in relevant animal disease models is essential prior to conducting clinical trials. Attempts to generate small animal models of disease have so far not been successful. Mice <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Coleman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Scobey1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, hamsters <xref rid="ppat.1004250-deWit1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and ferrets <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Raj1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> do not support replication of MERS-CoV in what appears to be a receptor dependent manner. To overcome this impediment, it was recently demonstrated that adenovirus vectored transduction of human DPP4 into multiple strains of mice, including various knock-outs, results in productive infection and mild pneumonia <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Notwithstanding the aforementioned mouse models, the only naturally permissive MERS-CoV disease model that has been described to date is the rhesus macaque model <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Munster1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004250-deWit2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In the rhesus macaque, MERS-CoV causes a transient infection of the lower respiratory tract resulting in mild to moderate clinical disease. While this model is useful, it seems to recapitulate the mild disease observed in some human cases, rather than the more severe or even lethal disease observed in many human cases. Moreover, although this model has been used to assess treatment strategies <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Falzarano1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Falzarano2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, it can be difficult as an evaluative model for therapeutics as clinical signs are mild, the duration of illness is relatively short and virus replication is limited.</p><p>Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26) was recently shown to be the cellular receptor for MERS-CoV <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Raj2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and the interaction between the MERS-CoV spike protein and DPP4 was subsequently determined by co-crystallography studies <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Although DPP4 is a relatively conserved protein in general, recent data have shown that receptor specificity is likely a major factor in the species tropism of MERS-CoV <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Raj1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004250-vanDoremalen1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. This suggests that mapping the spike binding region of DPP4 of a species of interest before performing experimental inoculations of animals could provide a more rational approach to identifying MERS-CoV susceptible animal models. Here, we modeled the interaction of the common marmoset DPP4 with the MERS-CoV spike protein and show that no differences exist compared to human DPP4 at the site of interaction. Subsequent inoculation of common marmosets (<italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic>) resulted in severe, even lethal, respiratory disease in inoculated animals, with widespread, coalescing bronchointerstitial pneumonia and high viral loads in the lungs of all animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Common marmoset DPP4 is predicted to bind the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein</title><p>Variations in the DPP4 receptor appear to play a major role in the ability of MERS-CoV to infect certain animal species. To predict the ability of MERS-CoV spike protein to bind to marmoset DPP4, analyses were performed using human DPP4 (known to bind MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein) <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Raj2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and ferret DPP4 (unable to bind MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein) <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Raj1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Comparison of the amino acid alignments of human, ferret and marmoset DPP4 revealed that marmoset DPP4 is 96.4% identical to human DPP4, while ferret DPP4 is 87.4% identical to human and 87.5% identical to marmoset DPP4. Recently, the 14 amino acids in human DPP4 that facilitate binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein were identified by co-crystallography studies <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. No amino acid differences between human, rhesus macaque and common marmoset were identified within the DPP4 region interacting with the MERS-CoV RBD, whereas between human/rhesus/marmoset and ferret and mouse nine or six amino acid residues were different within this region, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004250-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The 100% identity of the 14 amino acid residues between human and marmoset DPP4 in the interaction regions indicates that MERS-CoV RBD should bind to marmoset DPP4. This was further supported by modeling the binding potential between human, ferret and marmoset DPP4 with the MERS-CoV RBD. No significant differences in binding energy were observed between the human (&#x02212;981) and marmoset (&#x02212;978) DPP4 &#x02013; MERS-CoV RBD, whereas the binding energies between ferret DPP4 and the MERS-CoV RBD was significantly higher (&#x02212;601). A marmoset DPP4 homology model was built using the human DPP4 structure (PDB ID: 4KR0, Chain A). This model demonstrated that all amino acid differences between human and marmoset DPP4 were located away from the binding region of DPP4 with the S1 portion of the spike glycoprotein; the nearest residues to this interface that differ are Arg343, Ile193 and Val279 which are 14A, 10A and 13A away, respectively, from the nearest atom in MERS-S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004250-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Taken together this suggests that marmoset DPP4 would facilitate binding with the MERS-CoV RBD and that marmosets would be susceptible to MERS-CoV infection.</p><fig id="ppat-1004250-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1004250.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Interaction between the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein (S1) and its receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Alignment of the amino acid residues from human, common marmoset and ferret DPP4 that have been identified to interact with the receptor binding domain of the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein.

Up regulation of innate immune genes such as pattern recognition receptors, interferon-stimulated genes, inflammatory cytokines and signaling molecules, as well as adaptive immune responses such as lymphocyte signaling, proliferation, and differentiation, immunoglobulin production, antigen presentation, and T cell costimulation were observed. We were able to detect many common serum cytokine transcripts using RNAseq, which unfortunately cannot be measured in immunoassays as these are not available for common marmosets. Notably, we detected down regulation of interferon gamma (IFN&#x003b3;) and its receptor (IFNGR1) at multiple time points, and no expression of interferon beta (IFN&#x003b2;), consistent with reports that MERS-CoV infection attenuates these cytokines <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Lau1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004250-Niemeyer1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.

We also observed significant down regulation of IL-8 and IL-18 at all time points, and up regulation of IL-27 for all animals. IL-1&#x003b2; was up regulated in the 4 dpi samples, but down regulated at 3 and 6 dpi. As cytokine transcripts generally have a short half-life, in some cases we were not able to detect DE cytokine transcripts, but were able to detect changes in their receptors or molecules associated with cytokine signaling. We observed up regulation of the receptors for IL-2 (IL2RB), IL-4 (IL4R), IL-6 (IL-6R), IL-17 (IL17RC, IL17RE), IL-22 (IL22RA1), and IL-27 (IL27RA), and down regulation of receptors for IL-1 (IL1R1, IL1RAP), IL-12 (IL12RB2), IL-18 (IL18R1), and IL-20 (IL20RA) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004250.s009">Table S7</xref>).

The MAP tool utilizes relationships with molecules neighboring the DE transcripts in this dataset to predict transcriptional behavior. These relationships are based on published work curated in the IPA knowledgebase, and provide insight into the dynamics of all molecules within a given network or pathway generated using the primary transcriptional data from this experiment. While type I interferons, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6 were predicted to be induced, type II interferons and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF&#x003b1; were predicted to be at least partially inhibited. While transcriptional induction of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF&#x003b1; was expected, especially given the extent of inflammation in the lungs, the time points for sampling may have been too late to catch TNF&#x003b1; induction as it is one of the first cytokines induced during inflammation. Its induction is supported by downstream effectors such as NF&#x003ba;B, RelA, and RelB and many accessory proteins that were unregulated at the time points investigated. Moreover, as TNF&#x003b1; signaling tends to be down regulated rapidly, the up regulation of SOCS3, which is induced by TNF&#x003b1; as part of a negative feedback loop that ultimately results in suppression of TNF&#x003b1; and IL-1, was observed at all time points.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In MERS-CoV-infected common marmosets, clinical disease was more severe than in the rhesus macaque, was of longer duration and resulted in euthanasia of some animals.

Two of the six animals that were not euthanized at the scheduled 3 dpi necropsy had to be euthanized due to severity of disease, making this the first lethal MERS-CoV animal model. In both the marmoset and rhesus macaque <xref rid="ppat.1004250-deWit2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> models, viral replication occurred predominantly in the lower respiratory tract; however, in marmosets MERS-CoV RNA was also detected in the blood. This is suggestive of a more systemic dissemination that was corroborated by the detection of viral RNA in nearly all tested tissues in all infected animals. Taken together, the data from the common marmoset model suggest that this model more closely recapitulates severe, even lethal, human disease caused by MERS-CoV. This differs from the rhesus macaque model for MERS-CoV <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Munster1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004250-deWit2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, which more closely resembles mild to moderate human disease.</p><p>While viral RNA was detected in kidney samples from five out of seven marmosets, no histological abnormalities were observed, virus could not be isolated and viral antigen was not detected by immunohistochemistry. Elevations in creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels were noted on 4 dpi in the two animals that were euthanized, suggesting some degree of kidney involvement during infection; however, the lack of evidence of virus replication in this tissue suggests that this is not a direct viral effect. The acute renal failure in some patients <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Zaki1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> may be a secondary effect of ARDS <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Seeley1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> or other comorbidities and not primarily the result of direct MERS-CoV damage to the kidneys. While evidence of pulmonary fibrosis was not yet observed histologically at the time points investigated, transcriptional evidence of the onset of fibrosis was extensive. Previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have demonstrated that pulmonary fibrosis was a major mechanism of disease progression, and that lung inflammation caused by infection induced fibrogenic transcriptional programs <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Gralinski1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004250-Rockx1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In the marmosets, the role of fibrosis is unknown and needs to be further clarified and supported by data from human cases. We anticipate that studies using larger groups of marmosets, additional control animals, and samples collected at later time points post-infection will confirm the histologic course of fibrosis progression, as well as the transcriptional events underlying these pathogenic processes.</p><p>Currently, the only small animal MERS-CoV challenge model available, requires transduction of animals with an adenovirus vector expressing human DPP4 <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Although this is a very useful model, MERS-CoV infection in this model is highly dependent on the transduction of cells and level of DPP4 expression from the adenovirus vector and thus does not necessarily reflect the natural disease process. Therefore, therapeutics indicated to inhibit MERS-CoV in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies likely need to be tested in one of the two described nonhuman primate models. As such, marmosets should likely serve as the animal of choice for future therapeutic studies where possible. Not only does the more severe, and potentially lethal disease set a higher bar for protection, it would also allow a greater differentiation to be made between disease in untreated animals versus treated animals, currently a limitation of the rhesus macaque model <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Falzarano1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The marmoset model also allows the evaluation of intervention strategies at later time points as the disease process in the rhesus model is rapid and quite transient. However, late treatment that targets the virus, as with many countermeasures, is unlikely to be successful once significant lung damage has already occurred as was observed by the lack of success of very late treatment with ribavirin and interferon in human MERS-CoV cases <xref rid="ppat.1004250-AlTawfiq1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. To enable treatment of patients prior to severe lung injury, future transcriptional studies may yield early indicators of disease progression that can be used as diagnostic or prognostic tests to improve clinical management. The development of the more severe marmoset model will ensure a better pre-clinical analysis of treatments prior to proceeding to clinical trials in humans. As such, this new MERS-CoV disease model is a significant contribution to reducing the impact of MERS-CoV on global public health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML), and performed following the guidelines of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, International (AAALAC) by certified staff in an AAALAC-approved facility, following the guidelines and basic principles in the United States Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

VeroE6 and LLC-MK2 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 &#x000b5;g/ml streptomycin.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Histopathology and immunohistochemistry</title><p>Histopathology and immunohistochemistry were performed on marmoset tissues. After fixation for 7 days in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and embedding in paraffin, tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). To detect HCoV-EMC/2012 antigen, immunohistochemistry was performed using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against HCoV-EMC/2012 (1&#x02236;1000) as a primary antibody for detection of HCoV-EMC/2012 antigen. Immunohistochemistry for DPP4 (CD26) was performed with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum (1&#x02236;400) (Abcam). To confirm the cell type of infected cells a subset of specimens were stained with an antibody against cytokeratin (1&#x02236;100) (Dako) and the rabbit polyclonal against HCoV-EMC/2012. Fluorescently labeled goat anti-mouse (AlexaFluor 488) goat anti-rabbit (AlexaFluor 594) were used for detection.

Tissues (30 mg) were homogenized in RLT buffer and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For whole transcriptome sequencing, tissues collected from the right lower lobe of the lung were homogenized in TRIzol reagent and frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. The TRIzol was phase separated and total RNA was further purified from the aqueous phase using the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Virus isolation</title><p>Weighed tissue samples were homogenized in a TissueLyzer II (Qiagen) after addition of 1 ml DMEM. Homogenates were centrifuged to pellet cellular debris and 10-fold dilutions of homogenate were made and subsequently inoculated onto VeroE6 and LLC-MK2 cells for virus isolation. After 1 hr, cells were washed once with DMEM and supplemented with virus isolation medium. Cells were scored for cytopathic effect 5 days following infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Quantitative PCR</title><p>For detection of viral RNA, 5 &#x000b5;l RNA was used in a one-step real-time RT-PCR upE assay <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Corman1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> using the Rotor-Gene probe kit (Qiagen) according to instructions of the manufacturer.

Input RNA was rRNA reduced using the Ribo-Zero Magnetic Kit (Human/Mouse/Rat), (Epicentre), and rRNA reduction was verified by BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies). Libraries were quality controlled and quantitated using the BioAnalzyer 2100 system and mass measurement using QuBit (Life Technologies). The libraries were clonally amplified on a cluster generation station using Illumina version 2 MiSeq reagents to achieve a target density of approximately 1000 K&#x02013;1200 K clusters/mm2 on the flow cell. The resulting libraries were then sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq system at single reads of 50 bp, and were processed on the system to generate quality control metrics and FASTQ files with MiSeq Reporter 2.3.32.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Next generation sequencing</title><p>Raw reads were trimmed to 50 base pairs (bp) and adapter sequences were removed. We mapped the 50 bp reads to a custom-compiled set of known ribosomal sequences (human, mouse) using the short-read aligner software Bowtie v. 1.0.0 <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Langmead1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> to remove potential rRNA sequences. The remaining unmapped reads corresponding to MERS-CoV genome (GenBank accession no. JX869059.2) were also removed using Bowtie. All the remaining reads were mapped to the common marmoset (<italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic>) genome assembly (Genome assembly: C_jacchus3.2.1, GCA_000004665.1) downloaded from Ensembl (version 74) using STAR v.2.3.0.1 <xref rid="ppat.1004250-Dobin1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.

For the downstream analyses we only retained those transcripts with at least 40 raw read counts in at least one sample. The raw read counts were normalized using edgeR <xref rid="ppat.1004250-McCarthy1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. For the calculation of expression ratios, an offset of 5 was added to the normalized expression levels, i.e. counts per million (cpm) values to dump down variations due to low abundances. We identified transcripts with greater than 2-fold change relative to the uninfected control, and used Spotfire DecisionSite (Tibco) to perform hierarchical clustering using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic means (UPGMA) method, and generate heatmaps. Functional enrichment analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Raw data were deposited into the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) via the Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number pending).</p></sec><sec id="s4k"><title>Data and materials availability</title><p>GEO Accession #GSE55023.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1004250.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Temperature, hematology and clinical blood chemistry from common marmosets inoculated with MERS-CoV.
