We have previously demonstrated that myeloma cells exhibit constitutive plasma membrane (PM) localization of GLUT4, consistent with the dependence of MM cells on this transporter for maintenance of glucose consumption rates, proliferative capacity, and viability. The purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular basis of constitutive GLUT4 plasma membrane localization in MM cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>We have elucidated a novel mechanism through which myeloma cells achieve constitutive GLUT4 activation involving elevated expression of the Rab-GTPase activating protein AS160_v2 splice variant to promote the Warburg effect. AS160_v2-positive MM cell lines display constitutive Thr642 phosphorylation, known to be required for inactivation of AS160 Rab-GAP activity. Importantly, we show that enforced expression of AS160_v2 is required for GLUT4 PM translocation and activation in these select MM lines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of a full-length, phospho-deficient AS160 mutant is sufficient to impair constitutive GLUT4 cell surface residence, which is characteristic of MM cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This is the first study to tie AS160 de-regulation to increased glucose consumption rates and the Warburg effect in cancer. Future studies investigating connections between the insulin/IGF-1/AS160_v2/GLUT4 axis and FDG-PET positivity in myeloma patients are warranted and could provide rationale for therapeutically targeting this pathway in MM patients with advanced disease.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Findings</title><p>The Rab-GTPase activating protein (Rab-GAP) AKT substrate of 160 kDa (AS160) plays a critical role regulating the tethering and fusion of GLUT4-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. AS160 is the product of the gene <italic>TBC1D4</italic>, which belongs to the <italic>TBC1</italic> (Tre-2, BUB2p, and Cdc16p) gene family of Rab-GAPs. AS160 contains numerous phosphorylation sites, including the critical residues Ser588 and Thr642 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In the presence of activating stimuli, phosphorylation of AS160 by the AGC kinases such as RSK1, SGK1, or PKB/AKT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], leads to inactivation of the Rab-GAP domain to allow GTP-loaded Rab proteins to ferry GSVs to the PM. AS160 also functions as a positive regulator of GLUT4 trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Specific N terminal domains in AS160 facilitate interaction of AS160 with PM phospholipids, bringing GLUT4-GSVs in proximity to the PM. The proximity of AS160 to active kinases such as AKT in the PM promotes phosphorylation and inactivation of AS160-Rab GAP activity facilitating insertion of these proximal GLUT4-GSVs into the PM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, a novel AS160 splice variant was recently discovered (termed AS160_v2 or AS160 variant 2) which lacks exons 11 and 12 and exhibits a broad expression profile in human tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The lack of these coding sequences appears to imbue the AS160_v2 protein with an increased permissiveness toward GLUT4 trafficking to the cell surface without the exclusion of any known phosphorylation sites or protein subdomains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Importantly, it has been demonstrated that ectopic expression of AS160_v2 in rat L6 myotubes enhances GLUT4 PM localization and increases glucose consumption rates by 30% to 40% during insulin or IGF-1 treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Given the importance of AS160 in the regulation of GLUT4 trafficking, the identification of a splice variant of AS160 displaying a diminished propensity for GLUT4 retention, and the knowledge that the AGC kinases AKT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], RSK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and SGK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] are constitutively active in myeloma, we sought to determine whether AS160 deregulation contributes substantively to the basal activation of GLUT4, that we have previously demonstrated in myeloma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><sec><title>AS160_v2 is expressed in several multiple myeloma cell lines but is absent in normal B lymphocytes</title><p>Quantitative RT-PCR performed on a panel of multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines revealed an up-regulation of AS160 at the transcript level in JJN3, KMS11, L363, RPMI8226, and H929 cells (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A), while MM.1S, U266, and INA6 exhibit low levels of AS160 mRNA expression, comparable to normal B lymphocytes (NBL). The identity of the AS160_v2 isoform was verified by PCR analysis. A region of the AS160 transcript spanning exons 11 and 12 was amplified from cDNA generated from MM cell lines and full-length AS160 cDNA, as a control. The predominant PCR product amplified from the MM cell line cDNA was significantly shorter than the product from the vector; consistent with the 189 bp length of exons 11 and 12 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). Sequencing of the PCR products confirmed the absence of exons 11 and 12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, RNA-Seq transcriptomic analysis of the JJN3 myeloma cell line confirmed complete sequence identity with the AS160_v2 reference sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In addition to the full length AS160 sequence and AS160_v2 sequences, six additional AS160 transcripts have been identified and deposited in the NCBI database. We quantified the reads associated with the AS160 full-length, AS160_v2 splice isoform and additional transcripts and found that AS160_v2 constitutes 94.8% of all transcripts associated with this gene in the JJN3 cell line (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C). Moreover, analysis of 60 other MM cell line transcriptomes demonstrated that AS160_v2 accounted for greater than 95% of all AS160 expression (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E) in the vast majority of the tested cell lines.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>AS160_v2 is selectively upregulated in a subset of multiple myeloma cell lines and patient samples.</bold> (<bold>A</bold>) AS160 transcript levels in NBL and a panel of 8 MM cell lines assessed by qRT-PCR.

Analysis of 11 normal B cell transcriptomes revealed significantly lower AS160_v2 expression (~38% to 55% of total transcript abundance, Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D). A t-Test comparing myeloma patient samples and NBL samples for AS160_v2 abundance demonstrated that the expression of AS160_v2 is significantly higher in the MM cells (&#x003c1; = 2.5&#x000d7;10<sup>-43</sup>).

To avoid the potentially confounding effects of endogenous AS160_v2 protein, we selected MM.1S cells for these studies based on their low baseline AS160 expression. MM.1S cells were transiently transfected with the AS160-4P construct, which contains alanine substitutions at four critical phosphorylation sites required for GLUT4 trafficking to the surface or an empty vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Cells were then stained for GLUT1 and GLUT4 and visualized via confocal immunofluorescence microscopy to evaluate subcellular localization profiles. Since GLUT1 is constitutively localized on the PM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], it serves as a marker for PM bound proteins as well as a negative control, as it remains unchanged upon introduction of AS160-4P (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C). In contrast, AS160-4P-expressing MM.1S cells revealed an intracellular sequestration of GLUT4, based on discrete, punctate cytosolic staining which contrasts with that observed in cells transfected with control pcDNA (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C). These results demonstrate that ectopic expression of a full-length, phospho-deficient AS160 mutant is sufficient to impair constitutive GLUT4 cell surface residence, which is characteristic of MM cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Suppression of AS160_v2 expression decreases glucose consumption and proliferation by reducing GLUT4 PM content</title><p>Cell lines that basally up-regulate AS160_v2 (KMS11, JJN3, and L363) were stably transduced with pLKO.1 lentiviral vectors expressing shRNAs specific to AS160 (AS-1, AS-2) or noncoding control (C). The loss of AS160_v2 protein (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A) universally reduces glucose consumption three days post-infection (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B, D and F). Inhibition of glucose transport by AS160_v2 silencing is associated with cytotoxic effects in KMS11 and L363 cell lines and reduces cell growth in JJN3 cells (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C, E and G). Expression of an alternative AS160 shRNA (labeled AS-2) also reduces glucose uptake and induces cell death (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B-C). PM proteins were extracted from JJN3 cells expressing C and AS-1 shRNAs to correlate GLUT4 PM localization with the expression of AS160-V2. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated reduced GLUT4 content on the cell surface in cells expressing the AS-1 shRNA, while whole-cell GLUT4 levels remained constant (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>H-I). The outcomes of RNAi experiments performed in the KMS11, JJN3, and L363 cell lines show that AS160_v2 silencing closely recapitulates the effects of GLUT4 suppression and glucose deprivation, with KMS11 and L363 cells undergoing substantial cell death in response to these perturbations while JJN3 cells consistently display a growth defect with maintained viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. As an additional negative control, we transduced U266 cells with C and AS-1 shRNAs. Since U266 cells express very low levels of AS160_v2, there is no impact on glucose uptake or cell growth (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>J-K).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>AS160 knockdown suppresses glucose consumption and inhibits cell growth by reducing PM GLUT4 content in KMS11, JJN3, and L363 but not in U266 cells.</bold> (<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblot analysis verifying AS160 knockdown with two distinct AS160 targeting shRNA&#x02019;s.

Our findings corroborate those described by Baus and colleagues regarding the stimulatory function displayed by phosphorylated AS160_v2 towards GLUT4 trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In their study, the authors demonstrate that ectopic expression of human AS160_v2 cDNA in AS160-negative L6 rat myoblast cells potentiates GLUT4 cell surface localization and cellular 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake in a signaling-dependent manner. It has also been shown that GLUT4 translocation is suppressed in insulin-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes following RNAi-mediated silencing of full-length AS160 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In line with these <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, a loss-of-function nonsense mutation in the <italic>TBC1D4</italic> gene in a severely insulin-resistant <italic>Acanthosis nigricans</italic> patient was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Interestingly, expression of the resulting truncated AS160 protein (R363X) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes recapitulated the aberrations associated with AS160 silencing, thus connecting impaired AS160 function with diminished GLUT4 activity under insulin-replete conditions.</p><p>More recently, studies in adipocytes and soleus isolated from AS160<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice demonstrated impaired insulin stimulated glucose uptake and reduced insulin-stimulated GLUT4 PM translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Interestingly, the AS160<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> adipocytes and soleus also exhibited reduced GLUT4 content suggesting a potential role for AS160 in regulating insulin-sensitivity by modulation of GLUT4 content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These studies strongly support a model of AS160 function in which both full-length AS160 and AS160_v2, when phosphorylated, augment the actions of insulin to promote GLUT4 cell surface localization. We hypothesize, however, that under identical, stimulatory signaling conditions (e.g., insulin receptor activation), AS160_v2 more robustly promotes GLUT4 trafficking in comparison to full-length AS160. This hypothesis is based on the findings that the fractional increase observed in insulin-stimulated 2-DG uptake by L6 myotubes overexpressing AS160_v2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] is greater than the fractional decline in insulin stimulated 2-DG transport by 3T3-L1 adipocytes displaying knockdown of full-length AS160 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We acknowledge, however, that further studies comparing these two splice variants under identical experimental conditions are necessary to extract meaningful information regarding their distinct functionalities. Furthermore, interrogation of the functional consequences of inclusion of exons 11 and 12 in the AS160 protein is paramount to understanding the differences between isoforms.</p><p>While the biological functions of the additional AS160 truncated transcripts detected in NBL and MM patient samples are unknown, one can speculate that possible maintenance of Rab-GAP activity in these transcripts may increase retention of GLUT4 or regulate the propensity of GLUT4 PM trafficking in response to stimulatory signals. Since insulin and IGF-1 are important myeloma growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] there may exist a selective pressure in MM to upregulate genes that couple insulin/IGF-1 signaling to metabolic effectors that promote aerobic glycolysis.</p><p>We have previously demonstrated that some MM cell lines, like MM.1S and U266, exhibit constitutive GLUT4 cell surface localization even in the absence of AS160 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], supporting investigation of alternative, AS160-independent mechanisms of GLUT4 activation in MM. One remaining unresolved issue pertains to the identity of the kinases responsible for AS160 phosphorylation in the context of myeloma.
