Investigation of mammalian transcriptome divergence has been restricted to analysis of bulk gene expression levels and gene-internal splicing. Using allele-specific expression analysis in inter-strain hybrids of <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, we determined the contribution of multiple cellular regulatory systems to transcriptome divergence, including: alternative promoter usage, transcription start site selection, cassette exon usage, alternative last exon usage, and alternative polyadenylation site choice. Between mouse strains, a fifth of genes have variations in isoform usage that contribute to transcriptomic changes, half of which alter encoded amino acid sequence. Virtually all divergence in isoform usage altered the post-transcriptional regulatory instructions in gene UTRs. Furthermore, most genes with isoform differences between strains contain changes originating from multiple regulatory systems. This result indicates widespread cross-talk and coordination exists among different regulatory systems. Overall, isoform usage diverges in parallel with and independently to gene expression evolution, and the <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> regulatory contribution to each differs significantly.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the European Research Council (DTO) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://erc.europa.eu/">http://erc.europa.eu/</ext-link>); EMBO Young Investigators Program (DTO) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.embo.org/funding-awards/young-investigators">http://www.embo.org/funding-awards/young-investigators</ext-link>); Hutchinson Whampoa (DTO) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hutchison-whampoa.com/en/global/home.php">http://www.hutchison-whampoa.com/en/global/home.php</ext-link>); Cancer Research UK (DTO, SLB, KS, SW) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/">http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/</ext-link>); University of Cambridge (SLB, KS, DTO, AG) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/">http://www.cam.ac.uk/</ext-link>); European Molecular Biology Laboratory (AG, DT, AB, PF, JCM) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.embl.org/">http://www.embl.org/</ext-link>); Wellcome Trust WT095908 and WT098051 (DT, PF, DTO) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/">http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/</ext-link>); and FP7 HEALTH grant from the European Commission GEUVADIS grant agreement 261123 (AG, AB) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geuvadis.org/">http://www.geuvadis.org/</ext-link>).

Many studies have dissected the changes in levels of gene expression, as well as the genetic mechanisms that underlie this divergence [<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137367.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The set of isoforms expressed from a gene is as tightly controlled as the gene expression level, both between individuals and between cells from the same tissue [<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the extent to which a gene&#x02019;s isoform usage changes between closely related mammalian subspecies and the mechanisms that might underlie such changes, have remained unexplored.</p><p>Multiple diverse and independent regulatory systems contribute to the set of isoforms expressed from a gene. These contributions impact not only internal splice site choice, but also promoter selection, transcription start site selection, and polyadenylation site selection [<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Isoform usage divergence contributes to organismal evolution by modulating post-transcriptional regulatory sequences embedded within a transcript, as well as changing protein structure [<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137367.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Regulatory systems that control transcript structure involve an interaction between nucleic acid sequences in DNA or RNA (<italic>in cis</italic>) and protein or RNA-based complexes binding to them in a sequence-specific fashion (<italic>in trans)</italic>. Promoter selection and transcription start site selection are regulated by transcription factors and cofactors binding to sequences in gene enhancers and promoters, which control the behavior of the basal transcription machinery through recruitment to a specific site, or alter post-translational modifications on the basal transcription factors [<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137367.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137367.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Internal splicing, in contrast, is controlled by the spliceosome, a large ribonucleoprotein complex that assembles through a series of intermediates on sequences in the target intron and flanking exons and catalyzes intron excision [<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Alternative internal splicing occurs due to differential binding of splice factors such as HnRNP and SR proteins, or by changes in sequence at the 3&#x02019; and 5&#x02019; exonic splice sites and the intronic branch site [<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Polyadenylation site selection is poorly understood, despite 50% of human genes containing alternative polyadenylation sites [<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], but it is believed to be controlled by recruitment of cleavage factors to sequences in the nascent RNA transcript, which in turn recruit the poly-A polymerase [<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137367.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>To date, most studies of isoform expression divergence have focused on internal splice site choice, including exon gain/loss and cassette exon inclusion [<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137367.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137367.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137367.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In C. elegans, eQTL studies have analyzed internal splicing divergence between strains, and found that <italic>cis</italic>-acting variants predominate [<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In fruit flies, intercrosses of Drosophila species and subspecies have been used to thoroughly dissect genome-wide the mechanisms underlying divergence of internal splicing [<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. They observed that patterns of alternative splicing have distinct profiles of <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> divergence. For example, intron retention is predominantly driven by <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory changes, whereas exon skipping is equally driven by mutations <italic>in cis</italic> or <italic>in trans</italic>. Some studies in human cells have taken a quantitative trait analytical approach, and identified a number of proximal genetic variants associated with heritable changes in splicing in HapMap lymphoblastoid lines [<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Comparison of splicing across all vertebrate clades revealed that cassette exon expression levels diverge at a significantly higher rate than gene expression levels [<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137367.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Divergence of cassette exon expression and divergence of gene expression appears to be decoupled in vertebrates, displaying independent evolution both between tissues and between species [<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137367.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Between evolutionarily distant mammals, divergence of cassette exon expression levels are driven primarily by <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory changes, as observed in a transchromic mouse stably carrying human chromosome 21 [<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The degree to which variation of isoform usage is driven by selection or drift is unclear; analysis of exon usage across six primates suggested that a minority of changes in exon usage are functional and under selective pressure [<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Here, we use a classical genetics approach to dissect transcriptome divergence using inbred mouse strains as a mammalian model species. We have analyzed the divergence of internal splicing, transcription start site selection, polyadenylation site selection, and promoter choice. Our results quantify the mechanisms contributing to evolutionary divergence in transcriptional and post-transcriptional isoform usage, and how they conspire with differential gene expression to generate transcriptional divergence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Isoform usage differences are as widespread as gene expression differences in a single mammalian species</title><p>We used genetic crosses of two mouse strains, previously used to study imprinting, gene expression evolution and methylation [<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

To discriminate between multiple differential isoform usage (DIU) regulatory changes within a gene and also from changes to overall gene expression, we considered a set of genes expressing only two overlapping transcripts in adult mouse liver (2211 genes). This set represents 50% of all genes expressing multiple isoforms, and includes both genes encoding many transcripts of which only two are expressed, and genes for which only two transcripts are annotated, where both are expressed. Restricting analysis to only genes expressing two isoforms gave us the power to precisely characterize the regulatory change necessary to alter the ratio of the two isoforms, therefore isolating specific regulatory change events at each locus. Due to the allele-specific nature of our analysis we further subset this group to genes containing one or more known SNV or indel between BL6 and CAST (set of 1258 genes used for further analysis).</p><fig id="pone.0137367.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0137367.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Divergent Isoform Usage (DIU) between closely related mouse subspecies.</title><p>(<bold>A)</bold> Experiments interrogated DIU by comparing the parental F0 strains, and both directional crosses of F1 mice.

Genes expressing 3, 4 or 5 isoforms were not enriched for any KEGG, Transpath or Transfac pathway, however moderate enrichment was observed for GO categories associated with subcellular location: genes expressing 3 isoforms are enriched for the GO terms cytoplasm (p = 0.0001) and organelle membrane (p = 0.00015), genes expressing 4 isoforms are enriched for mitochondrion (p = 8.1e-5), cytoplasmic part (p = 8.1e-5), and cytoplasm (p = 0.0004), and genes expressing 5 isoforms are enriched for the GO term cofactor binding (p = 0.0006). Relative to all expressed genes, single-isoform genes are enriched in a number of functional GO categories (25 in total of p &#x0003c; 0.001), suggesting that single-isoform genes, which were outside the scope of our analysis, may have specific functional characteristics.</p><p>Of this set of 1258 genes, 20% showed expression patterns consistent with a divergence in the contribution of each isoform to total gene expression between species (251 genes) (<xref rid="pone.0137367.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>).

Since it is currently not feasible to obtain the full-length sequences of RNA transcripts in a high-throughput manner, in this work we chose to perform expression quantification by aligning RNA-sequencing reads to annotated cDNA sequences and using a probabilistic model to deconvolve expression levels.</p><p>Almost one in five assayed isoform pairs had robust evidence of isoform expression divergence between these strains of mice. Remarkably, isoform expression changes in 84% of the divergent loci were caused by changes in multiple underlying regulatory systems. In other words, there were multiple, simultaneous differences in usage of upstream UTRs, downstream UTRs, transcription start sites, and/or their internal exon-exon splicing junctions. Statistically, the co-occurrence of these differences is highly unlikely to be the result of random chance. Three possibilities exist to explain this co-occurrence of regulatory divergences: (i) a single mutation in an upstream regulatory pathway affecting multiple systems; (ii) enrichment of independent regulatory mutations at specific loci due to natural selection; or (iii) an underlying coordination of apparently independent gene control mechanisms, diverging simultaneously by selection or neutral drift. The first possibility is unlikely because a pleiotropic upstream regulator would have been detected in our functional enrichment analysis. The second is unlikely because the recent divergence time of these two mouse strains precludes extensive selective pressure, particularly in light of the high conservation of liver gene expression. The third possibility is therefore the most likely; indeed, co-transcriptional splicing is a well-understood precedent that coordinates the spliceosome and polymerase machineries. Our data reveal that this coordination extends to other aspects of transcript structure such as polyadenylation and transcription start site selection [<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137367.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Also consistent with our results, there have been a small number of reports of splicing factors controlling other aspects of transcript structure such as polyadenylation [<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137367.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. It is likely that many aspects of transcript structure are codetermined during transcription.</p><p>Internal splicing is found in the absence of any other structural change more often than expected by chance. Besides internal splicing, our data revealed that 83% of diverged transcripts between closely related mice have different 5&#x02019; UTR sequences (AFE and TSS), and 81% have different 3&#x02019; UTR sequences (ALE and APA). Divergence by internal splicing is strongly associated with the presence of the coiled-coil sequence motif. Since there is no functional category associated with this structural change, the reason for this correlation is not clear. This motif is commonly associated with complex regulatory systems involving homo- and hetero-dimerization with multiple partners, including the famous regulators c-fos and c-jun [<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>Our data shows further that divergence of the untranslated regions at both the beginning and end of genes is more common than internal splicing changes. The widespread differences found in the 3&#x02019; and 5&#x02019; UTRs may substantially alter transcript stability and microRNA recognition sequences. It has long been known that protein coding sequences are rarely altered between closely and even distantly related mammals [<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137367.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]; however, regulatory alterations that modify the transcriptome&#x02019;s dynamics have been largely unexplored.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Differences between inter-species and intra-species regulatory divergence in mammals</title><p>Our results reveal that divergence <italic>in cis</italic> and divergence <italic>in trans</italic> both play important roles in transcript usage change within a mammalian species.

Thus divergence of internal splicing between many complex eukaryotic species appears to be driven by a similar pattern of regulatory mutation. In contrast, we reveal here a role for <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory variants in internal splicing divergence within a mammalian species. Our results suggest that a transition from a combination of <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>- regulatory variants to predominantly <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variants may occur around speciation, which is consistent with observed patterns of intra- and inter-species gene expression divergence in yeast, fruit flies, and mammals [<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137367.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137367.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].

The observed differential expression of Hnrnpc between these two strains of mice suggests that the regulatory changes observed <italic>in cis</italic> downstream of Hnrnpc could be compensatory in nature, despite the surprising finding that no evidence of <italic>trans</italic>-encoded divergence was identified. Interestingly, the RBM47 gene in CAST contains more than 20 changes in sequence when compared to the sequence in BL6, many of which contribute to all 5 known isoforms expressed of this gene. It is likely therefore that both differential expression and sequence divergence in splicing factors are altering the transcriptome during the short divergence time between these two subspecies of Mus musculus.</p><p>Note added in proof: Since the original submission of this paper, a similar work focusing on fibroblasts from the same mouse strains, as well as a re-analysis of reference 28 has appeared in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Differential usage of isoforms is prevalent in mammals even following a short divergence time, collectively restructuring both the coding and the noncoding transcriptome.

We then compared, for each transcript, the expression estimate for the BL6 allele in the simulated F1 hybrid with the expression estimate of the same transcript for the F0 sample.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Classifying divergence of isoform expression</title><p>To classify genes according to their mode of expression divergence we defined four models (conserved, cis, trans and cis&#x00026;trans) as described in Turro et al. 2013 (Section 4.2). We compared the conserved model with each of the three other models and, assuming a prior probability of 0.25 that any of the four models is true, we calculated the joint posterior probability of the models. Genes with a posterior probability greater than 0.5 for any of the models were classified accordingly, while genes for which the data did not favor any model strongly were not considered further. Note that for the sake of stringency we only selected a model if it was more likely than all the other models put together.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Classifying structural differences in isoform pairs</title><p>To determine structure differences between each pair of isoforms we wrote our own R scripts. These scripts first compare whether the isoforms have overlapping first exons. If the first exons overlap and have different start sites, the isoforms are said to have an alternative TSS. If the first exons do not overlap the isoforms are said to have an AFE. ALE and APA are defined in a similar way. Detection of internal splice sites includes checking for exons that are present in only one of the isoforms and also internal splice junctions whose start or end sites differ between the isoforms.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Over- and Under-Enrichment Analysis</title><p>Enrichment analysis was performed using the Genetrail Over-/Under-representation analysis tool by Mus musculus Ensembl gene ID. Enrichment analysis of regulatory divergence classes compared the list of genes in each class (cis, trans, cis&#x00026;trans, conserved) with the list of all genes expressing 2 transcripts and containing a SNV between BL6 and CAST, and included KEGG-pathway analysis, Transpath-pathway analysis, Transfac analysis, and Gene Ontology analysis. Enrichment analysis of categories of transcript change compared the list of genes containing each structural variant (INT, ALE, AFE, APA, TSS) with the list of all genes expressing 2 transcripts and containing an SNV between BL6 and CAST, and included KEGG-pathway analysis, Transpath-pathway analysis, Transfac analysis, and Gene Ontology analysis; as well as testing for enrichment of chromosomal locations, Pfam domains, miRNA targets, ELR motifs, RGD motifs, and Coiled-coil motifs. In all cases p-value adjustment was performed using FDR adjustment with a significance threshold of 0.01 and a minimum number of genes of 5.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Motif Enrichment Analysis</title><p>To assess whether genes with DIU were enriched for motifs of known RNA binding proteins, we obtained a list of 118 experimentally determined motifs for factors encoded by known mouse genes [<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Subsequently, we performed pairwise enrichment of the exonic sequences of genes in the different regulatory categories (e.g. cis vs trans, cis vs cons, etc...). Significance was determined using a hypergeometric test using the HOMER software package [<xref rid="pone.0137367.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and multiple testing correction by FDR.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0137367.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Model Selection.</title><p>The difference between the posterior probability of the best model and the posterior probability of the second best model is plotted for genes with a posterior probability greater than 0.5 for any of the models.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0137367.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0137367.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Expression level and MCSEs.</title><p>The expression levels of all transcripts in one of the F0 libraries are plotted against the respective Monte Carlo standard errors.
