Nevertheless, remarkably few details are known about the rate-limiting steps in targeting and decay of RNA. The membrane-anchored endoribonuclease RNase Y is a virulence factor in Gram-positive pathogens. We have obtained a global picture of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> RNase Y sequence specificity using RNA-seq and the novel transcriptome-wide EMOTE method. Ninety-nine endoribonucleolytic sites produced <italic>in vivo</italic> were precisely mapped, notably inside six out of seven genes whose half-lives increase the most in an RNase Y deletion mutant, and additionally in three separate transcripts encoding degradation ribonucleases, including RNase Y itself, suggesting a regulatory network. We show that RNase Y is required to initiate the major degradation pathway of about a hundred transcripts that are inaccessible to other ribonucleases, but is prevented from promiscuous activity by membrane confinement and sequence preference for guanosines.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>
<underline>R</underline>ibo<underline>n</underline>ucleic <underline>a</underline>cids (RNA) are key intermediates between the heritable genome and the expression of proteins. Thus the level of a specific RNA determines the capability of the cell to produce the corresponding protein. Bacteria maintain a very high turnover (high production but also high decay-rate) of RNA molecules, to ensure that they can, at any time, change the protein production program in response to outside stimuli. However, all types of RNA molecules do not have the same half-life, some last for tens of minutes whereas most only last for seconds. Here we examine how endo<underline>r</underline>ibo<underline>n</underline>ucle<underline>ase Y</underline> (RNase Y), one of the enzymes that cleave RNA into smaller fragments, chooses its targets from the pool of cellular RNA. We show that RNase Y prefers to cleave RNA at a specific ribonucleotide sequence, thus keeping the RNA degradation to the correct level, not too fast and not too slow. RNase Y is anchored to the inside of the cell envelope, and we furthermore show that releasing RNase Y into the interior of the cell results in poor growth, but is at the same time able to compensate for the loss of CshA, another factor in the RNA decay machinery.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by The Swiss National Science Foundation [PL], the Boninci Foundation [PL], SwissLife Jubil&#x000e4;umsstiftung [PR], Novartis Consumer Health Foundation [PR], and the canton of Geneva.

RNA synthesis is determined by promoter strength, via the adherence of the RNA polymerase sigma factor to promoter motifs such as the -10 and -35 elements, and can be further regulated by transcriptional regulators. RNA decay is a highly efficient process in bacteria, and most mRNAs have half-lives of less than a few minutes [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which allows the cell to rapidly shut down unwanted protein production. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, the rate-limiting step in the RNA degradation process of the majority of RNA is thought to be an endoribonucleolytic cleavage performed by RNase E, after which, a collection of exonucleases can convert the resulting RNA fragments to single nucleotides [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Surprisingly for such a fundamental function, RNase E initiated decay is not ubiquitous in bacteria, since RNase E homologs are absent from many Firmicutes, including pathogens like Staphylococci and Streptococci, as well as &#x003b5;-Proteobacteria and Spirochaetales [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Instead it has recently been proposed that in Firmicutes, the initiating cleavage is performed by the endoribonuclease RNase Y [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>RNase Y, encoded by the <italic>cvfA</italic> (or <italic>rny</italic>) gene, was originally discovered in <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> as an important virulence factor [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. More recently, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> RNase Y was shown to be responsible for maturation of the <italic>sae</italic> virulence regulating operon [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> to cleave the SAM-riboswitches, and mature RNase P RNA and scRNA [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. An N-terminal hydrophobic alpha-helix anchors RNase Y to the membrane [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and a coiled-coil domain then separates the anchor from an RNA binding KH domain and a HD domain containing the Histidine-Aspartate active site [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. RNase Y forms dimers and even tetramers via the coiled-coil domain and the membrane anchor, independently of each other [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to RNase E, the RNase Y gene is not essential, and can be deleted in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pyogenes</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The fitness cost of these RNase Y deletions range from mild to none in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pyogenes</italic>, but is quite severe in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic>, to a point where the gene was originally thought to be essential [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the pathogenesis of both <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pyogenes</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> is severely affected by the deletion of RNase Y, in both silkworm and mouse models [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], cementing the importance of RNase Y across a wide range of Firmicutes.</p><p>Several functions, that are not mutually exclusive, have been described for the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> RNase Y: A 3' phosphodiesterase activity, demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], utilises the same active site in the HD domain as the endoribonucleolytic activity which has been demonstrated <italic>in vivo</italic> by the identification of a single RNase Y cleavage site in the <italic>sae</italic> virulence regulator operon [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> RNase Y has furthermore been shown by bacterial-two-hybrid assay to interact with enolase, a key metabolic enzyme, and the DEAD-box RNA helicase CshA [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which is thought to open secondary RNA-structures in an ATP-dependent manner [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Both interaction has recently been confirmed <italic>in vivo</italic>, by tandem affinity purification, to be via the non-enzymatic C-terminal extension of CshA [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. CshA has been proposed to help RNases in the RNA decay machinery gain access to cleavage sites that are buried within secondary structures [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. When the <italic>cshA</italic> gene is deleted in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>, the mutants grow very poorly at low temperature (24&#x000b0;C) and the decay of about a hundred RNAs is retarded, including the quorum sensing <italic>agr</italic> mRNA which indirectly promotes hemolysis [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In this respect, RNase Y seems to be functionally similar to RNase E that serves as a scaffold for the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> degradosome [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>A number of additional RNases are involved in general RNA decay in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> (as opposed to maturation of stable RNAs), supported either by experimental evidence or inference by homology. There are three identified 3' to 5' exoribonucleases, <underline>p</underline>oly<underline>n</underline>ucleotide <underline>p</underline>hosphorylase (PNPase), RNase R, and SA1660/YhaM [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. RNase R is essential in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> but has not been studied [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], whereas a transcriptome-wide decay assay has been made with a PNPase mutant of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>, showing that many RNAs are stabilised [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The importance of PNPase and RNase R is also evident in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, where the single knockout mutants are viable whereas the double knockout is lethal [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], indicating redundancy in the 3' exoribonucleolytic pathway. In contrast to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, a large number of bacterial phyli, including the Firmicutes, encode one or two RNase J homologs. These are 5' to 3' exoribonucleases, an activity that until recently was thought to be absent from bacteria. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> encode two paralogs, RNase J1 and RNase J2, that form a complex where only the active site of RNase J1 is responsible for the 5' exoribonucleolytic activity <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Deletion mutants of either RNase J exhibits very severe growth phenotypes and the correct maturation of essential molecules such as 16S rRNA and RNase P RNA are dependent on the RNase J1/J2 complex [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], however these RNases have not been studied carefully in terms of RNA decay.</p><p>We here examine the role of RNase Y in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> by transcriptome-wide RNA decay analyses, identifying increased RNA half-lives that are due to RNase Y dependent degradation defects. We additionally show that the N-terminal membrane anchor is not needed for the RNase Y endoribonucleolytic activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that its function must therefore be to sequester either RNase Y itself, or a protein partner(s), to the membrane.</p><p>Finally, even in the well-studied <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> system, where RNase E has been studied for decades, it remains unclear how certain RNA substrates are chosen for degradation more readily than others, since multiple signals, at both the 5'-end and at the RNase E cleavage site, appears to be of importance [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Even less is known about RNase Y, and we therefore use the novel global method EMOTE (Exact Mapping Of Transcriptome Ends) [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] to identify, to our knowledge for the first time, the <italic>in vivo</italic> recognition sequence motif of a decay-initiating endoribonuclease, and are able to show that the preferred cleavage site is 3' of a guanosine, in an otherwise adenosine and uridine rich region.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>RNA decay of a specific sub-set of the transcriptome is affected by deletion of RNase Y</title><p>In order to understand the phenotypes observed in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> RNase Y mutants, two previous transcriptome-wide studies have observed altered steady state levels of a number of transcripts [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These effects were consistent with a defect in RNA degradation, and the half-lives were examined for a small number of transcripts, some of which did indeed show increased RNA stability [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the global scale of half-life increase&#x02013;and thus the scale of RNA decay rate-limiting activity performed by RNase Y&#x02013;cannot be discerned by steady state level measurements alone, since indirect effects of the RNase Y deletion may cause an increase or decrease in promoter activity. We therefore performed a transcriptome-wide RNA degradation assay to understand whether the increased steady-state RNA levels in a strain deleted for the RNase Y gene (&#x00394;Y) are indeed caused by an increase in RNA half-life. Decay of transcripts in the &#x00394;Y strain was measured by treating exponentially growing cultures with rifampicin to inhibit the RNA polymerase, whereupon samples were taken at 0, 150, 300 and 600 seconds. The isolated RNA for each time point was sequenced using the stranded Illumina RNA-seq protocol. Using the normalisation and criteria described in the Experimental Procedures we were able to obtain the half-life of RNA corresponding to 1464 ORFs, and the 0 second time-point was additionally used to measure the steady-state levels. The assay was carried out in duplicates and compared to isogenous wild-type (WT) data obtained previously [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Differences in RNA levels and stability between WT and &#x00394;Y were determined using a smallest-difference model: For each ORF, the calculated steady state levels and half-life for the two WT and the two &#x00394;Y datasets were compared, and the smallest difference between WT and &#x00394;Y was used. If the range of WT and the range of &#x00394;Y overlapped, then the difference was set to zero. The smallest-difference model is well suited to experiments with a low number of biological replicates, and gives a conservative estimate of the number of affected genes.</p><p>Only 248 ORF RNAs are strongly affected by the RNase Y deletion, whereas 160 ORFs increase in stability just below the conservative 2 fold cut-off used throughout this study (summarised in <xref rid="pgen.1005577.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, see also <xref rid="pgen.1005577.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref> for a full list). There was an overall good correlation between increased RNA stability and increase in steady-state levels as shown in <xref rid="pgen.1005577.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>. The ORFs that were significantly affected in both steady-state and half-life levels (upper right quadrant in <xref rid="pgen.1005577.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) comprise 50 ORFs encoding several ribosomal proteins, housekeeping genes, chaperones, as well as the virulence regulators <italic>sarA</italic>, <italic>sarR</italic>, <italic>agrA</italic> and <italic>agrC</italic>. The correlation is nevertheless not absolute and some ORFs that accumulate are not stabilised, presumably due to indirect effects of the &#x00394;Y mutation. There are even seven ORF RNAs that decrease in abundance, notably the &#x0003e;8 fold lower expression of the <italic>spa</italic> transcript, which encodes the antibody-binding Protein A (<xref rid="pgen.1005577.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).

The list of non-coding (ncRNAs), small RNAs and untranslated regions (UTRs) compiled by Sassi and coworkers [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] (collectively referred to as ncRNAs throughout this manuscript, for simplicity) were therefore added to the analysis of open reading frames described above (<xref rid="pgen.1005577.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005577.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Only 67 ncRNAs passed the quality control criteria for confidently estimating their half-lives, mainly due to the silica-column based method of RNA isolation used for the RNA-seq, which depletes RNA molecules shorter than 200 nucleotides (nt). Among them, six ncRNAs (srn_1510_rsaA, srn_1520_Sau76, srn_2620_Teg61, srn_2830_SbrB, srn_3820_SprX and srn_3160_RsaOD/TB-glyS) were stabilised and accumulated above the 2-fold cut-off (<xref rid="pgen.1005577.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). As expected, abundance of the 514 nt regulatory RNAIII was increased in &#x00394;Y, in concordance with the increase in <italic>agr</italic>, which drives the RNAIIII promoter, and the decrease in <italic>spa</italic>, whose decay is initiated by RNAIII [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Identifying RNase Y cleavage sites by EMOTE</title><p>The identification of RNA molecules that are stabilised and/or accumulated in &#x00394;Y, naturally leads to the question of whether these RNAs are cleaved directly by RNase Y, and if so, where on the RNA the cleavage takes place. Knowing the exact endonucleolytic sites might reveal which type of signals regulates RNase Y activity. However, until now, only a few RNase Y cleavage sites have been mapped in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic>, and only one single site has been located in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore we used Exact Mapping Of Transcriptome Ends (EMOTE), a technique that maps the exact 5'-end of mono-phosphorylated RNA on a transcriptome-wide scale [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], to identify RNase Y cleavage sites in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>.</p><p>Briefly the EMOTE assay consists of ligating a synthetic RNA oligo (Rp6) to the 5'-ends of total RNA, using T4 RNA ligase 1, which will only accept 5' mono-phosphorylated RNAs as substrate. The ligated RNA is then reverse transcribed to cDNA, and by using the sequence of Rp6 as anchor for Illumina sequencing, it is possible to specifically sequence only the 5'-ends of mono-phosphorylated cellular RNA. The large number of reads generated by Illumina sequencing can then be mapped onto the genome of the organism, and the exact positions of each of the mono-phosphorylated 5'-ends are obtained (see <xref rid="pgen.1005577.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref> and <xref rid="sec017" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p><p>Mutants where the entire RNase Y gene (<italic>cvfA</italic>) of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> is deleted have previously been generated by our group and others [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Studies have indicated that RNase Y is part of a network of protein-protein interactions involved in RNA decay [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and it is therefore possible that deleting the entire gene causes secondary effects. We therefore replaced the wild-type RNase Y allele with a mutated gene in which the active site HD-motif (Histidine 367 and Aspartate 368) was replaced by two Alanines, resulting in strain Y<sup>367AA</sup>. Additionally, the putative N-terminal membrane anchor in RNase Y (amino acids 2&#x02013;24) was also deleted by allelic replacement, while preserving the alternative GTG start-codon of the RNase Y gene, generating strain Y<sup>&#x00394;2&#x02013;24</sup>. Growth of both the RNase Y deletion strain (&#x00394;Y) and Y<sup>367AA</sup> were very similar to the WT strain, whereas strain Y<sup>&#x00394;2&#x02013;24</sup>, with an anchorless RNase Y, grew markedly slower (<xref rid="pgen.1005577.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>).</p><p>EMOTE was performed in duplicate with WT and the different RNase Y mutants, whereupon comparison of EMOTE assays from WT with the combined data from &#x00394;Y and Y<sup>367AA</sup> strains was used to map potential endoribonucleolytic cleavage sites that were RNase Y dependent, in other words, 5'-ends that were observed in the WT strain, but not in the &#x00394;Y and Y<sup>367AA</sup> mutants.</p><p>The highly stringent conditions used (see <xref rid="sec017" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>) resulted in a list of 99 RNase Y cleavage sites, of which 50 are inside annotated open reading frames and 49 are either in UTRs, ncRNAs or intergenic regions (<xref rid="pgen.1005577.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). Conservative criteria were chosen in order to avoid false positives, however even if more lenient criteria were used, such a list would not (and cannot be) exhaustive, due to a number of factors that are unavoidable in a transcriptome-wide <italic>in vivo</italic> assay. a) Cleavage sites in transcripts with low abundance will be filtered out, since the signal in the WT will be relatively weaker. b) It is possible, and even likely, that RNases overlap in their activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, similar to what has been observed for <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> RNase Y and RNase J1 <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], therefore any sites that are also cleaved by alternative RNases will be filtered out. c) A potential site will only be detected if the downstream fragment is stable enough to remain detectable in the cell, a problem that is increased in organisms such as <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>, which have RNase J with 5' to 3' exoribonuclease activity that can remove the 5'-end generated by RNase Y as soon as it is made. This problem could possibly be avoided by generating a &#x00394;Y&#x00394;J1 mutant and use a &#x00394;J1 mutant for comparison, but unfortunately we have after several attempts been unsuccessful in producing such a double mutant. Furthermore, it cannot excluded that the 5'-ends interpreted as RNase Y cleavage sites are in fact caused by another RNase whose activity is altered in the RNase Y mutants. This could be an undiscovered endoribonuclease which is inactive in the absence of RNase Y activity, or possibly that the exonucleolytic activity of RNase J stalls at certain positions in the WT strain, whereas no such stalling occurs in the &#x00394;Y strains. To exclude the latter possibility, the EMOTE data for a &#x00394;J1&#x00394;J2 mutant were examined. In this strain there are no RNase Js [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], which can consequently not stall, and the presence of EMOTE reads mapping to 97 of the 99 RNase Y cleavage positions proves that the vast majority of the identified RNase Y sites are not caused by variations in RNase J stalling.</p><p>One identified cleavage site corresponded to the previously demonstrated RNase Y cleavage in the <italic>sae</italic> operon [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A number of the identified RNase Y cleavage sites fell within nine ORFs that were stabilised in our transcriptome wide RNA stability assay, showing that these coding RNAs are direct targets of RNase Y, which performs the cleavage that initiates degradation (<xref rid="pgen.1005577.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005577.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). However, a decay-initiating cleavage does not need to be within an ORF, but can in principle be anywhere on the RNA. Therefore the search was extended 200 nucleotides in either direction from the ORFs, which identified an additional ten stabilised ORFs with associated RNase Y cleavage sites. To ensure that these ORFs are potentially on the same RNA molecules as the detected RNase Y cleavage, reads were identified in the RNA-seq data that span both the cleavage site and the ORF, with &#x0003e;50 reads considered significant. An RT-PCR assay was used to connect those sites/ORFs that either have too few RNA-seq reads or are further from the ORF than the length of the Illumina reads (50 nt). Combined, the RT-PCR reactions and the RNA-seq connected 37 cleavage sites with corresponding ORFs (<xref rid="pgen.1005577.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>), including all ORFs that are significantly stabilised in the RNase Y mutant. Thus a total of 19 stabilised ORFs (20%) could be linked to one or more of the 99 identified RNase Y cleavage sites. Moreover, RNase Y cleavage sites were identified in or near RNase J1 (<italic>SA0941-rnjA</italic> operon), RNase J2 (<italic>rnjB</italic>) and phosphofructokinase (<italic>pfkA-pykA</italic> operon), which have all been linked to the RNA decay machinery (<xref rid="pgen.1005577.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A&#x02013;2C</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Finally, because the RNase Y-encoding <italic>cvfA</italic> gene is not expressed in the &#x00394;Y strain it is inherently excluded by the criteria used to identify RNase Y cleavage sites, however, when EMOTE data from the Y<sup>367AA</sup> strain (which does express <italic>cvfA</italic>) is compared to WT data, then a potential RNase Y cleavage site inside its own transcript is revealed (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005577.g002" ref-type="fig">2D</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005577.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>; <xref rid="pgen.1005577.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen.1005577.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1005577.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>RNase Y cleavage sites fall within or near the genes encoding components of the putative degradosome, as defined by [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and show sequence preference for guanosines.</title><p>Predicted transcription start sites (TSS), detected RNase Y cleavage sites (Y-cleav.) and predicted transcriptional terminators (TransTerm) are indicated.

However, it cannot be excluded that RNase Y contributes to these processes with activity that overlaps with other RNases.</p><p>To further analyse the fate of the two fragments generated by RNase Y cleavage, a region of 300 nt upstream and a region of 300 nt downstream of each RNase Y site were defined, and their stability and steady-state levels were examined. Based on this data, all but one of the RNase Y sites could be organised into four subgroups, depending on the fate of either the upstream or the downstream fragment in the WT strain, compared to the &#x00394;Y strain (<xref rid="pgen.1005577.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005577.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>): Class 1 (17 sites), where both upstream and downstream fragments were stabilised by the lack of cleavage (i.e. in the &#x00394;Y mutant), presumably indicates that the RNase Y cleavage is an initiating event for decay of the entire RNA. Class 2, (61 sites), probably represents a maturation event, since neither the stability of the upstream, nor the stability of the downstream fragment are affected by the cleavage, however, it may still be regulatory if the cleavage site is situated inside an ORF. Class 3 and 4 (12 and 8 sites, respectively), where either the upstream or the downstream fragment is stabilised, but the other fragment is not, can serve to express co-transcribed genes differentially when the RNase Y cleavage allows the decay of either the upstream or downstream genes, thus combining maturation and decay-initiation in a single cleavage event. It is striking that none of the identified RNase Y cleavage sites generate downstream fragments that are <underline>de</underline>stabilised in the &#x00394;Y strain, and only a single site (position 2436931, in the ncRNA srn_4470_RsaX28) generates an upstream fragment that is destabilised. Furthermore, only a single site (pos. 1620959 near <italic>rpsT</italic>) exhibits a <underline>de</underline>creased abundance of the downstream fragment in the &#x00394;Y mutant, making it the only site that might potentially be a transcription start site that has been misinterpreted as an RNase Y dependent cleavage site in the EMOTE data.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>RNase Y preferentially cleaves after guanosines</title><p>A consensus sequence for RNase Y cleavage was obtained by plotting the nucleotide frequency near the 99 identified RNase Y cleavage sites (<xref rid="pgen.1005577.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). Two things stood out from this analysis: That RNase Y has a preference for cleaving immediately after a G (58%), and with lower frequency after A (30%), whereas only 10% and 2% of cleavage sites were after U and C, respectively, and that the region of cleavage has a tendency to be A/U-rich. Neither of these two rules appear to be strictly required, although the preference for G is especially striking in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> where the genome is 67% A+T. It is thus likely that other factors such as secondary structures or protein partners are important for target selection. For example, the RNase Y cleavage site in the <italic>sae</italic>-operon identified by Marincola and coworkers [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and re-identified in our EMOTE assay (SA0663 in <xref rid="pgen.1005577.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>), is immediately after a U residue rather than a G or A (<xref rid="pgen.1005577.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the primary sequence preferences of RNase Y are augmented by secondary structures, we defined three sub-regions of 50 nt in the vicinity of each RNase Y site: The 50 nt immediately upstream, the 50 nt spanning the cleavage site, and the 50 nt downstream of the cleavage (<xref rid="pgen.1005577.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6A Fig</xref>). Each sub-region was examined for potential secondary structures using the RNA folding program mFold [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and then scoring the lowest possible &#x00394;G for each sub-region. The median &#x00394;G for all three sub-regions was between -3.9 and -5.8 kcal/mol, however the 50 nts spanning the cleavage sites consistently (in 93 out of 99 sites) had less predicted secondary structure than either the upstream or downstream regions (<xref rid="pgen.1005577.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6B Fig</xref>). This is not conclusive in itself, but consistent with previous observations that secondary structure in the vicinity of the RNase Y site will affect cleavage [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that large, multi-helix, secondary or tertiary structures such as pseudoknots are important for target site selection, but these are extremely hard to predict systematically <italic>in silico</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Analyses of fragment fates in target RNAs</title><p>A set of transcripts were selected for further examination by Northern blot, both to confirm the RNase Y cleavage sites inferred by the transcriptome-wide data and to determine the lengths of the detected RNA, since neither RNA-seq nor EMOTE provide accurate information regarding the integrity of the RNA.</p><sec id="sec007"><title>T-box riboswitches</title><p>From the list of putative RNase Y cleavage sites identified by EMOTE, it was striking that seven sites were located immediately upstream of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. This group of genes are often regulated by T-box riboswitches, which sense the level of tRNA molecules charged with amino acids, and terminate transcription prematurely if the level is already sufficient [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Four predicted T-box riboswitches were examined by Northern blotting: TB-valS, TB-leuS, TB-serS and TB-glyS. The prematurely terminated 5'-UTR was observed for all four T-boxes, and the accumulation observed by RNA-seq was confirmed for TB-glyS, TB-serS, and TB-valS (<xref rid="pgen.1005577.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). No degradation intermediates were observed to accumulate significantly in neither WT nor RNase Y mutant strains, presumably because degradation initiated by RNase Y is the rate-limiting step. Therefore, in order to observe the cleavage site identified by EMOTE, a mutant with the highly efficient 5' to 3' exoribonuclease J1 inactivated (Strain J1<sup>AGA</sup>) was used to prevent further processing of the downstream cleavage products generated by RNase Y. This approach revealed RNA fragments corresponding to the distance between the RNase Y cleavage and the riboswitch-induced transcription termination site for <italic>valS</italic> and <italic>leuS</italic> T-boxes (<xref rid="pgen.1005577.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B and 3D</xref>). In contrast, the downstream fragments that appear for the <italic>glyS</italic> and <italic>serS</italic> T-boxes are shorter than the distance between the RNase Y cleavage site and the T-box transcriptional terminator. The <italic>glyS</italic> T-box was therefore examined further, by using three additional probes to cover the entire 204 nt RNA. The two probes hybridising upstream of the RNase Y cleavage site were unable to detect the fragment that accumulates in J1<sup>AGA</sup>, demonstrating that it is indeed a result of cleavage at position +111, and is probably slightly shortened by 3' to 5' exonucleases until one of the many T-box secondary structures prevent further 3' processing (<xref rid="pgen.1005577.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen.1005577.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1005577.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>T-box riboswitches cleaved by RNase Y.</title><p>(A) Layout of the <italic>valS</italic> T-box, indicating Transcription Start Site (TSS), RNase Y cleavage site (Y-cleavage), the highly conserved T-box motif that binds to the 3' CCA of uncharged tRNAs (Anti-CCA), and the predicted T-box riboswitch transcriptional terminator (TB-Term.).

The cleavage sites in TB-valS, TB-leuS and TB-serS are all in the region between the so-called &#x0201c;Stem I&#x0201d;, which recognises the anti-codon of the tRNA, and the highly conserved &#x0201c;T-box sequence&#x0201d;, which participates in either a terminator or an anti-terminator structure depending on whether the tRNA is charged [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

<italic>rpsB</italic> and <italic>tsf</italic>
</title><p>The loss of RNase Y activity generates a dramatic effect for the <italic>rpsB</italic> and <italic>tsf</italic> ORFs (encoding ribosomal protein S2 and elongation factor TS, respectively), both in terms of half-life and steady-state levels (<xref rid="pgen.1005577.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, Tables <xref rid="pgen.1005577.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005577.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). A predicted rho-independent transcriptional terminator can be identified between these two genes (<xref rid="pgen.1005577.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref> and position +947 in <xref rid="pgen.1005577.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>; [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]), but previous studies, based on both microarray and RNA-seq data, suggest that they might be co-transcribed [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The identification, by EMOTE, of an RNase Y cleavage site inside the <italic>rpsB</italic> ORF (<xref rid="pgen.1005577.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>, position +865), suggests that RNase Y can initiate decay of the <italic>rpsB</italic> transcript, and thereby influence the stability, and consequently the steady-state level. However, no RNase Y sites were detected in the <italic>tsf</italic> transcript, and we therefore examined whether <italic>rpsB</italic> and <italic>tsf</italic> are indeed in an operon (i.e. whether there is read-through of the transcriptional terminator), and whether the steady-state levels of such a read-through transcript are affected by the deletion of RNase Y. Northern blotting with probe rpsB-C, which anneals immediately upstream of the transcriptional terminator (<xref rid="pgen.1005577.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A and 4C</xref>) revealed a major transcript of ~900 nt (corresponding to termination at the terminator) and a slightly weaker signal at ~2000 nt (corresponding to read-through of the terminator). As expected from the RNA-seq, both of these transcripts were massively accumulated in the &#x00394;Y strain (<xref rid="pgen.1005577.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>), indicating that the stabilisation of <italic>rpsB</italic> and <italic>tsf</italic> observed in the rifampicin assay (<xref rid="pgen.1005577.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) is the cause, although it cannot be ruled out that the &#x00394;Y mutant exhibits increased <italic>rpsB</italic> promoter activity, which would also contribute to the increase in steady state level. A probe annealing inside the <italic>tsf</italic> ORF (<xref rid="pgen.1005577.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>), also gave rise to two bands in the WT strain: a ~2000 nt transcript, corresponding to the read-through from the <italic>rpsB</italic> promoter, and a ~1000 nt RNA which would correspond to a transcript from the predicted <italic>tsf</italic> promoter (<xref rid="pgen.1005577.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>, position +1041). In the &#x00394;Y strain, the signal for the ~2000 nt band is much stronger than for the ~1000 nt band, indicating that whatever affects the <italic>tsf</italic>-encoding RNA must happen upstream of <italic>tsf</italic> transcription start site. Probe rpsB-D hybridises between the transcriptional terminator and the <italic>tsf</italic> transcription start site, and detected neither the ~900 nt band from probe rpsB-C nor the ~1000 nt band from probe tsf-E, verifying that these transcripts do not overlap (<xref rid="pgen.1005577.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen.1005577.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1005577.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>

The wild-type protein is presumably translated at the membrane whereas the anchorless RNase Y would have no such constrictions, stacking the cards against hetero-dimers, and the re-anchoring strategy was therefore not expected to be 100%.

However, if a guanosine is found in combination with the right adjacent secondary structure, as seem to be the case for the T-box RNAs, then that could augment the specificity considerably. Finally, the sub-cellular location of RNase Y certainly restricts the target choice, and we show that lifting this requirement in itself (in the Y<sup>&#x00394;2&#x02013;24</sup> mutant), leads to severe difficulties for the cell. Despite this, the Y<sup>&#x00394;2&#x02013;24</sup> mutation is able to suppress the cold-sensitive phenotype caused by the deletion of the CshA RNA helicase, which presumably generates a global increase in secondary RNA structures that inhibit exoribonucleases, and we speculate that RNase Y, once liberated from the membrane, is able to provide new access-points for the exoribonucleases and relieve the burden of mis-regulated RNA decay.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec017"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec018"><title>Growth and RNA isolation</title><p>All strains were grown in Mueller-Hinton broth (Becton-Dickinson) with uracil (20 mg/l) and appropriate antibiotics at the following concentrations: 10 mg/l chloramphenicol, 10 mg/l erythromycin, 50 mg/l kanamycin.</p><p>For RNA isolation, cultures were harvested in mid-exponential phase at an OD<sub>600</sub> of ~0.4, and RNA was purified using either RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) for RNA-seq and EMOTE, or Trizol (Ambion) for Northern blots (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures).</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Decay and steady-state analyses</title><p>Quantification, normalization, and decay half-lives were computed for each assay following the procedure described in [<xref rid="pgen.1005577.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

The 5'-bases of the mono-phosphorylated RNAs are marked with asterisks, and the downstream fragment generated by an RNase Y cleavage is in red (absent from the &#x00394;Y strain). The two total RNA samples, one from the WT strain and one from the &#x00394;Y mutant are separately ligated to the Rp6 oligo (light blue), a reaction that only works for 5' mono-phosphorylated RNA. The Rp6 RNA oligo has 7 random bases, the so-called Quantification Sequence, in the middle (indicated by NN). The ligated RNA is reverse transcribed with a primer which has a random sequence near the 3' end, and a tag (light green) at the 5' end. This generates cDNA with a known sequence at the 5' end. At the 3' end, a cDNA molecule will also have a known sequence, if (and only if) the reversely transcribed RNA molecule was ligated to the Rp6 oligo (i.e. the RNA molecule was mono-phosphorylated in the cell). The cDNA that has the cRp6 tag at one end and the reverse transcription tag at the other end is then PCR-amplified with primers that add the appropriate adaptor-sequences for Illumina sequencing at the ends (Illumina 1.0 and Illumina 2.0, marked in dark blue and dark green respectively). Additionally, the primers that hybridises to the cRp6 sequence contain an EMOTE barcode (A and B) that is unique for each RNA sample. Once the EMOTE barcode has been added, then the PCR products can be mixed, since each and every molecule can be bioinformatically traced back to the original RNA sample it came from. The mix of PCR-products is then sequenced, using Illumina technology, from the &#x0201c;Rp6-end&#x0201d;. As little as 50 nt sequence will read through the EMOTE barcode and Quantification Sequence, into the first 20 nt of the original mono-phosphorylated RNA molecule. These 20 nt of transcriptome sequence, referred to as the Mapping Sequence, can be aligned to the place on the genome that corresponds to the 5' end of the original RNA molecule, and the exact chromosomal position of the 5' base (asterisk) can easily be determined. Since PCR is being employed in the EMOTE protocol, it is important to verify that reads mapping to the same position, actually reflect individual original RNA molecules. Within the EMOTE reads, if the 7 bases of Quantification Sequence are different, then the reads must originate from separate ligation events with different Rp6 molecules, and as a consequence, from different original RNA molecules.When millions of reads are sorted into their respective RNA samples, and mapped onto their respective chromosomal positions, it is possible to identify specific species of RNA 5' ends that are present in the WT data, but absent from the &#x00394;Y data. The positions of these 5' ends are good candidates for RNase Y cleavage sites (in red).</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1005577.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1005577.s004"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Growth and hemolysis of the RNase Y mutants with and without complementation.</title><p>A) Overview of the RNase Y protein. The functional domains are according to Kaito et al. 2005 and Lehnik-Habrink et al. 2011: Membrane anchor, KH: RNA-binding domain, HD: Catalytic domain with the key HD motif, His367 and Asp368, that are mutated to alanines in the Y<sup>367AA</sup> mutant. B) Growth curves of WT and RNase Y mutant strains. Growth of strains was monitored continuously, in quadruplicate, in a plate-reader at 37&#x000b0;C. Error-bars indicate standard deviation. The cultures were started from exponentially growing cultures, however a parallel experiment started from stationary cultures gave essentially identical results. C) Growth of RNase Y variants on agar-plate. Left panel: over-night cultures grown at 37&#x000b0;C, were diluted and spotted on MH-agar plate at the indicated temperature for the indicated time. On agar-plate, the &#x00394;Y strain grows slightly slower than the WT strain at 37&#x000b0;C. The difference in growth between WT and &#x00394;Y is more pronounced at low temperature. Both &#x00394;Y and Y<sup>367AA</sup> grew equally whatever the growth condition indicating that the main effect observed with &#x00394;Y is due to its enzymatic activity as opposed to an indirect role through the binding of protein-partners. The Y<sup>&#x00394;2&#x02013;24</sup> mutant as observed in liquid culture (B) grow markedly slower at 37&#x000b0;C than WT and &#x00394;Y strain. Our RNA-seq analyses (<xref rid="pgen.1005577.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) showed that the quorum-sensing <italic>agr</italic> mRNA both accumulate and is stabilised in absence of &#x00394;Y, leading to increase production of hemolysin, which are controlled by the <italic>agr</italic> system as shown in the right panel where the strains were plated on horse-blood agar. Both &#x00394;Y and Y<sup>367AA</sup> spot have a similar halo of hemolysis, in contrast the Y<sup>&#x00394;2&#x02013;24</sup> does not induce the production of hemolysin, indicating that the Y<sup>&#x00394;2&#x02013;24</sup>, still targets the <italic>agr</italic> messenger. D) qRT-PCR quantification of <italic>agrA</italic> RNA in mutants, relative to WT levels. All cultures were harvested at OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.4, and the relative levels were normalised to mRNA of the <italic>HU</italic> housekeeping gene. Error-bars indicate the SEM. E) Growth of the Y<sup>&#x00394;2&#x02013;24</sup> strain is restored in presence of the full length RNase Y protein. The Y<sup>&#x00394;2&#x02013;24</sup> strain, transformed with the plasmids expressing RNase Y variants or the empty vector, was cultivated over-night at 37&#x000b0;C, and spot after dilution on a MH agar-plate at 37&#x000b0;C. The slow growth of the Y<sup>&#x00394;2&#x02013;24</sup> mutant is suppressed when over-expressing the full-length protein, irrespective of whether the latter is active or not, suggesting that the full length proteins can re-anchor the anchorless RNase Y back to the membrane via dimerisation. F) Complementation assay in a &#x00394;Y strain by plasmids expressing the RNase Y variants. The &#x00394;Y strains, transformed with the plasmids expressing Y variants or the empty vector, were spotted on MH agar-plate (left panel) and horse-blood plate (right panel). pY complement both the growth and the hemolysis defect of a &#x00394;Y strain, showing that it is fully active and that the strep-flag-his tag fused at the C-terminal in these constructions do not seem to alter the RNase Y activity. As expected, the two phenotypes were not restored when the active site is mutated in the full-length (pY<sup>367AA</sup>) or the anchorless (Y<sup>&#x00394;2&#x02013;24,367AA</sup>) protein.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1005577.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1005577.s005"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>RNase Y cleavage sites and ORFs are on the same RNA molecules.</title><p>(A) List of RNase Y cleavage sites that are close enough to an ORF to prove their connection via analyses of the RNA-seq data to find 50 nt Illumina reads that span the gap (number of spanning reads shown in the last column).

Class 1) If both upstream and downstream fragments were stabilised by the lack of cleavage (i.e. in the &#x00394;Y mutant), then the RNase Y cleavage is presumably an initiating event for decay of the entire RNA. Class 2) If neither the stability of the upstream, nor the stability of the downstream fragment are affected by the cleavage, then the cleavage probably represents a maturation event, but may still be regulatory if the cleavage site is situated inside an ORF. Class 3) and Class 4) If either the upstream or the downstream fragment is stabilised, but the other fragment is not, then the RNase Y cleavage can serve to express co-transcribed genes differentially, by allowing the decay of either the upstream or downstream genes, thus combining maturation and decay-initiation in a single cleavage event.
