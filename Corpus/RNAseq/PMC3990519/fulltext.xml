We do not know, however, to what extent these transcriptomes resemble those in infected Tsetse flies - or in humans or cattle, where parasitaemias are substantially lower. For clinical and field samples it is difficult to characterize parasite gene expression because of the large excess of host cell RNA. We have here examined two potential solutions to this problem for bloodstream form trypanosomes, assaying transcriptomes by high throughput cDNA sequencing (RNASeq). We first purified the parasites from blood of infected rats. We found that a red blood cell lysis procedure affected the transcriptome substantially more than purification using a DEAE cellulose column, but that too introduced significant distortions and variability. As an alternative, we specifically amplified parasite sequences from a mixture containing a 1000-fold excess of human RNA. We first purified polyadenylated RNA, then made trypanosome-specific cDNA by priming with a spliced leader primer. Finally, the cDNA was amplified using nested primers. The amplification procedure was able to produce samples in which 20% of sequence reads mapped to the trypanosome genome. Synthesis of the second cDNA strand with a spliced leader primer, followed by amplification, is sufficiently reproducible to allow comparison of different samples so long as they are all treated in the same way. However, SL priming distorted the abundances of the cDNA products and definitely cannot be used, by itself, to measure absolute mRNA levels. The amplification method might be suitable for clinical samples with low parasitaemias, and could also be adapted for other Kinetoplastids and to samples from infected vectors.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Most experiments on African trypanosomes - including those designed to look for new drugs - have studied parasites either from culture, or from laboratory rodents. We are interested in comparing these parasites that grow in man and domestic animals, where the parasites generally have different nutrient concentrations and much lower parasitaemias than in experimental models. The most accessible way to make the comparison is to measure the amounts of mRNAs. In this paper we describe how methods that are used to purify the parasites from human cells can change the relative amounts of mRNA. We also describe a method to examine RNA from relatively small numbers of parasites that are mixed with host cells.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

Nearly all experiments on African trypanosomes, however - including those designed to look for new drugs - have studied parasites either from culture, or from laboratory rodents with high parasitaemias. Drugs have to kill parasites that are living in humans or ruminants. These parasites are very difficult to study because parasitaemias are low, so we have no idea whether their metabolism is really the same as that of parasites in culture. The ideal way to assess differences between these parasites and the standard lab models would be to characterise their proteomes or metabolomes, but the numbers of parasites are insufficient. The amounts of RNA are however sufficient, for transcriptome analysis, especially since amplification techniques are available.</p><p>The most sensitive method to characterise transcriptomes is to make cDNA by reverse transcription, followed by second strand synthesis and analysis of the products by high throughput sequencing <xref rid="pntd.0002806-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. To ensure coverage that is independent of the transcript length, the mRNA is fragmented prior to cDNA synthesis <xref rid="pntd.0002806-Mortazavi1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. To create a good library for sequencing, 50&#x02013;100 ng of mRNA is generally needed. When less is available, the cDNA can be amplified. One approach is to include tags at the ends of the cDNA, and use those sequences for polymerase chain reaction amplification or linear amplification <xref rid="pntd.0002806-Pan1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002806-Tariq1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002806-Adiconis1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. An alternative is to include a promoter for a bacteriophage polymerase in the cDNA primer <xref rid="pntd.0002806-Pan1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002806-Adiconis1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002806-Sengupta1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Once double-stranded cDNA is made, it has the promoter at one end, and this can be used as a template for further RNA synthesis by the bacteriophage polymerase. The RNA produced in this way is once again converted to cDNA, which is then sequenced. The various amplification techniques can be qualitatively very good for transcript detection, but when tested quantitatively, they were found to cause considerable distortions in measured transcript levels <xref rid="pntd.0002806-Pan1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002806-Adiconis1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Several groups have obtained trypanosome transcriptomes using RNASeq <xref rid="pntd.0002806-Siegel1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, including quantitation of full-length developmentally regulated mRNAs <xref rid="pntd.0002806-Siegel2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Trypanosome mRNAs are very unusual because each bears, at the 5&#x02032;-end, a 39 nt sequence called the spliced leader. To map the splice sites, the spliced leader sequence can be used as a primer for second strand synthesis on cDNA. This &#x0201c;spliced leader tagging&#x0201d; approach has been used both to map splice sites <xref rid="pntd.0002806-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002806-Nilsson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002806-Kolev1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and to measure changes in splice site usage in different life cycle stages <xref rid="pntd.0002806-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002806-Nilsson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.

For all but very high parasitaemias, a purification step will be necessary in order to obtain sufficient parasite sequence reads. One option is to purify the trypanosomes away from the host cells before RNA is prepared. The alternative is to select trypanosome sequences from the RNA mixture before starting the high-throughput sequencing procedure: the spliced leader makes this possible. We here describe an optimized spliced leader priming protocol, and compare the effects of both trypanosome purification and spliced leader priming on the final transcriptome data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The animal work was approved by the Makerere University animal care committee, clearance number VAB/REC/13/080.

Results from the buffy coat samples (BC) showed correlation coefficients of &#x0003e;0.98 for all three pairwise comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002806-g001">Figure 1A, B</xref>), whereas both DEAE purification (DE, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002806-g001">Figure 1C,D</xref>) and red cell lysis (RL, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002806-g001">Figure 1E,F</xref>) resulted in more variation (coefficients of 0.80&#x02013;0.94, and 0.94&#x02013;0.98 respectively). We have not compared the buffy coat results with those for cultured trypanosomes because we do not have results for cultures of this trypanosome strain. Relative standard deviations (the standard deviation divided by the mean) for individual genes did not correlate with either the mRNA abundance or the half-life (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002806.s001">Figure S1</xref>, A&#x02013;F) suggesting that neither of these parameters was directly linked to the variation seen.</p><fig id="pntd-0002806-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0002806.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Effect of column purification and erythrocyte lysis on transcriptome profile reproducibility.</title><p>A&#x02013;B Buffy coat samples (BC).

Some functional categories were particularly affected: for example, increases in mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins, chaperones and mitochondrial metabolic proteins, and decreases in mRNAs encoding protein kinases and cytoskeletal proteins (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002806.s002">Figure S2</xref>). We also looked to see whether mRNAs from some genes were &#x0201c;lost&#x0201d; during purification, considering only genes giving at least 10 reads per million from buffy coat trypanosomes. In the DEAE samples, there were around 30 that fell below 10 reads per million, while after red cell lysis the number lost varied from 43 to 204.</p><p>We conclude that if purification is necessary, DEAE cellulose is the method of choice, but some variability will be introduced.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Selective trypanosome cDNA synthesis and amplification</title><p>For many clinical samples, the numbers of trypanosomes are likely to be too low to allow transcriptome analysis without prior amplification <xref rid="pntd.0002806-Eikmans1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002806-Kuepfer1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002806-Blum1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002806-Manful1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002806-Haanstra1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>(Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002806.s007">Table S2</xref>).

The first strand was made using reverse transcriptase primed with a T3 promoter primer bearing, at the 3&#x02032; end, (T)<sub>24</sub> or nine random nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002806-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). To make a <italic>T. brucei</italic>-specific second strand, we tested primers representing various segments of the spliced leader (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002806-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002806.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). Synthesis was measured by including (<sup>32</sup>P)-dCTP in the reaction, and specificity was tested with a negative control of HeLa RNA alone as template. Initial results showed that it was possible to see specific priming only with purified poly(A)+ trypanosome RNA (not shown). Not unexpectedly, selectivity for trypanosome mRNA was strongly affected by the primer sequence and the annealing temperature. Examples of the results for three primers are shown in Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002806.s003">Figure S3B</xref>. When we used a primer that included the entire SL (panel SL), the smear from HeLa RNA alone (lane 3) was the same as that obtained when trypanosome RNA was included (lanes 1 and 2), implying insufficient selectivity for trypanosome mRNA. Using shorter, 20mer SL primers (panels SL20 and SL-2), selectivity was seen: the smears for the samples with trypanosome RNA (lanes 5, 6, 9 and 10) gave stronger signals than those for HeLa RNA alone (lanes 7 and 11). The primer concentration was also critical (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002806.s003">Figure S3C</xref>): for example, using 0.5 pM of primer SL-4, there was no difference with or without trypanosome RNA (lanes 1 &#x00026; 2) whereas with 0.05 pM primer SL-4, five times more product was obtained if trypanosome RNA was present (lanes 3 &#x00026; 4).</p><p>Next, we tested amplification methods and conditions. We attempted linear amplification using T3 polymerase (for explanation, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref>) but yields were poor, so we decided to concentrate on PCR. We tested a variety of combinations of spliced leader primers with a T3 promoter primer, with different annealing temperatures and numbers of PCR cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002806-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). The most specific result was obtained using a &#x0201c;nested&#x0201d; PCR strategy. After cDNA synthesis, the second strand was primed with the 20mer primer SL-4, which terminates 4 nt upstream of the 3&#x02032;-end of the spliced leader. With authentic trypanosome mRNAs, the first four nt synthesised will be ATTG - the last 4 nt of the spliced leader. This should be absent in most mis-primed HeLa cDNAs. Amplification was then done with the T3 primer and a 20mer primer (&#x0201c;SL20&#x0201d;) that terminated at the end of the spliced leader. This primer combination will only work if the first four nt after the SL-4 primer really were ATTG, providing an additional level of specificity. PCR results using the optimal primer combination and conditions (see Methods) are illustrated in Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002806.s003">Figure S3D</xref>: with this combination, we usually obtained at least twice as much PCR product with the trypanosome-HeLa mix as with HeLa RNA alone.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Effect of spliced leader priming and amplification on transcriptome measurements</title><p>We now analysed the effects of spliced leader priming and amplification on the measured transcriptome. The cDNAs obtained by spliced leader priming alone, using poly(A)+ RNA as substrate (T in subsequent figures and tables) or using 1000&#x02236;1 HeLa mixtures as described above (TH in the figures and tables) was sheared, Illumina adaptors were added, and the resulting fragments amplified and sequenced according to the standard Illumina protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002806-g003">Figure 3F&#x02013;I</xref>). In a first experiment duplicate RNA preparations were sequenced using the Illumina GAII sequencer. Later, two more replicates were analysed using the Illumina HiSeq 2000, with duplicate random-shear controls sequenced in the same way. All reads were aligned to the trypanosome genome. Statistics for these experiments are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0002806-t002">Table 2</xref> and results are in Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002806.s008">Table S3</xref>.

In the second experiment (replicates TH3 and TH4), enrichment was 10 times better, with 20% of reads aligning (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0002806-t002">Table 2</xref>). It is possible that the use of HiSeq technology in the second experiment increased the percentage of mapped reads, but variations in the amplification efficiency could also have contributed. We extracted all reads that mapped to the predicted mature RNAs available in TritrypDB (CDS). In addition, we extracted reads containing the spliced leader (SL tags) or poly(A) and the T3 promoter, and assigned them to an open reading frame based on their positions in the genome. Most analyses were done with all reads added together.</p><table-wrap id="pntd-0002806-t002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id

As expected, when we calculated the RPKM for the spliced leader primed samples we detected a clear bias against longer transcripts (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002806.s004">Figure S4</xref> C&#x02013;F) illustrating what we observed above in the average read density profiles for long genes.</p><p>We now quantitatively compared the results from spliced leader primed RNAs with those from classical RNA-Seq of randomly-sheared RNA. The latter is currently the standard method for mRNA quantitation, although it too is likely to have some biases. Since we already knew that our spliced-leader-primed reads were heavily 5&#x02032; biased, we first corrected the classical RNASeq data for mRNA length (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002806-g006">Figure 6</xref> legend). In all graphs most mRNAs formed a dense cloud with little apparent correlation, while a small minority was abundant in both datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002806-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Results for the total counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002806-g006">Figure 6A, B</xref>) correlated rather better than those for SL tags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002806-g006">Figure 6C,D</xref>). Correlations for each gene excluding SL and poly(A)/T3 tags were similar (not shown), which is not surprising because there were about six times more gene reads than SL tags (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0002806-t002">Table 2</xref>). Since our amplified and unamplified spliced leader-primed results correlated better with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002806-g004">Figure 4F</xref>) than with the classical RNASeq, the major cause of the difference between the T and TH samples and randomly sheared pure RNA must have been the spliced leader priming. We found no GC content bias from amplification.</p><fig id="pntd-0002806-g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0002806.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Transcriptomes obtained by spliced leader priming differ from those obtained using randomly sheared RNA.</title><p>The results from spliced leader-primer cDNA synthesis (T) or from amplified samples (TH) are compared with those from control randomly sheared poly(A)+ RNA.

Their method differed somewhat from ours. For example, they used a second-strand primer that covered the entire spliced leader; we could not do this because the long primer gave too much background priming on HeLa cDNA (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002806.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Nevertheless, when they compared their SL tag counts with those obtained from total (not SL-primed) cDNA, the dot plots looked very similar to ours (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002806-g006">Figure 6E</xref> with Supplementary Figure S9 in <xref rid="pntd.0002806-Nilsson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>). This suggests that in their experiments also, SL priming introduced distortions.</p><p>We conclude that synthesis of the second cDNA strand with a spliced leader primer, followed by amplification, is sufficiently reproducible to allow comparison of different samples so long as they are all treated in the same way. However, SL priming gives results that differ substantially from those obtained using the standard protocol with randomly sheared mRNA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>To analyse the transcriptomes of field samples, the choice of the most appropriate method will depend on the number of parasites present relative to host cells, and the total number of parasites in the sample. A decision can be made on a sample-to-sample basis if parasitaemias and lymphocyte counts can be checked prior to sampling.</p><p>We first assume an experimental scenario with a parasitaemia of 4&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup>/ml and a lymphocyte count of 4&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup>/ml. This could arise in <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> patient samples. An average lymphocyte yields 5 times more mRNA than a trypanosome (see Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002806.s008">Table S3</xref>). Use of whole blood gives maximum trypanosome yield with minimal handling. If RNA were prepared from whole blood, and sequenced on a single lane, approximately 1 million reads might map unambiguously to trypanosome coding regions (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002806.s007">Table S2</xref>) (This assumes that globin mRNA is removed prior to library preparation.) 1 million reads is just about the lowest threshold for transcriptome analysis: most coding regions would map around 50 reads <xref rid="pntd.0002806-Manful1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. This would also yield the total lymphocyte transcriptome as a by-product, although this will give limited information since it will come from a complex mixture of cell types. For samples with parasite&#x02236;lymphocyte ratios of at least 1&#x02236;10, the variability that ensues from low read counts has to be weighed against the variability of results, and the decrease in low-abundance mRNAs detected, that are introduced by column purification. An expensive alternative would be to apply the sequencing library to several lanes in order to get more reads.</p><p>If parasite&#x02236;lymphocyte ratios are lower than 1&#x02236;10, either the parasites must be purified, or the parasite mRNA must be specifically amplified. Standard Illumina library preparations work best with at least 50 ng of mRNA sample, which can be obtained from about 2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> trypanosomes (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002806.s007">Table S2</xref>). If that number is available, column purification is a good option although the results will be less reproducible than for unpurified samples. We already saw variations under ideal lab conditions, but in a field lab purification times might be longer and the temperature could be higher, both of which could have deleterious effects. Samples with fewer parasites could be pooled prior to RNA preparation, which might to some extent compensate for the variability introduced by column purification.</p><p>For samples containing less than about 5&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> parasites, amplification of some sort will be unavoidable. We were able to achieve up to 200-fold enrichment of trypanosome sequences from a 1000&#x02236;1 HeLa&#x02236;trypanosome mixture. This gave ample coverage of the transcriptome starting with only 5 ng of trypanosome RNA. The reads obtained were not directly proportional to mRNA abundance, but were instead strongly influenced by the spliced leader priming and also, to a lesser extent, by the PCR amplification. Despite this, the method was reproducible, especially when 200-fold enrichment was achieved. This indicates that the distortions that were seen must have been due to sequence-specific effects such as blockage of reverse transcriptase by secondary structures, PCR bias towards shorter amplicons, and long 5&#x02032;-untranslated regions. Because the results from the method are reproducible, data from different samples can be compared. Ideally, all samples should be treated in the same way, with at least 3 replicates per condition; under those conditions relative mRNA levels for each gene could be calculated and differentially expressed genes detected. Alternatively, the results could be converted into approximate &#x0201c;real&#x0201d; mRNA abundances using correction factors. These would need to be measured in individual labs, since they will be affected by the sequencing platform, the precise amplification and library building conditions, and the database version used for the alignments.</p><p>Spliced leader priming of mixed human/trypanosome poly(A)+ mRNA has the advantage of starting with quite large RNA amounts, which are easy to handle. The alternative, for samples containing at least 10<sup>4</sup> parasites, would be to purify the parasites using a column, then make the library using a method or kit designed for picogram amounts of mRNA. There have been relatively few independent evaluations of these amplification protocols for transcriptome quantitation, but all of them cause method-specific distortions. The consensus so far is that if amplification is necessary, the results for different samples can only be compared if the same method is used throughout (<xref rid="pntd.0002806-Pan1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002806-Tariq1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002806-Adiconis1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://openwetware.org/wiki/BioMicroCenter:RNAseq">http://openwetware.org/wiki/BioMicroCenter:RNAseq</ext-link>).</p><p>Our method for spliced leader priming and amplification of trypanosome mRNA should be suitable for any sample containing at least 10<sup>4</sup> trypanosomes, and could be particularly useful if conditions do not allow immediate and rapid column chromatography. In principle, samples from <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> sleeping sickness patients could be analysed. The same principle could be applied for any other organism in which the mRNAs carry a spliced leader: our results show, though, that careful optimisation of the spliced leader primers, ratios and annealing temperature will be necessary. Once this is achieved, the method might be used to analyse gene expression in samples from <italic>Trypanosoma congolense</italic> or <italic>Trypanosoma vivax</italic> infected cattle, for intracellular kinetoplastids, or samples from infected vectors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0002806.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>The variability in results from purified trypanosomes does not correlate with mRNA abundance or half-life.
