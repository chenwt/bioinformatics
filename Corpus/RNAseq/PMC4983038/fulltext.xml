However the removal of &#x0201c;growth-promoting&#x0201d; antibiotics in broiler chickens in Europe and increasing demands elsewhere for antibiotic-free chicken are focusing efforts to find alternative approaches to control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].

In general, the enrichment analyses of DEGs showed that all comparison done with the in vivo and in vitro growth conditions belonged mainly to two categories: biological processes and molecular functions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Table S5). The total DEGs of IV vs RM (673), IV vs PM (382), IV vs OS (521) and PM vs RM (600) groups were identified and found to be over-represented in three different GO terms: biological process (BP), molecular function (MF) and cellular component (CC) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Table S5). Among them, the majority of DEGs of all groups (IV-PM, IV-RM, OS-RM and PM-RM) but not OS vs RM were found to be involved in the organic substance metabolic processes (GO:0071704), cellular metabolic processes (GO:0044237), and single-organism metabolic processes (GO:0044710) whereas the IV-OS showed DEGs distributed in the organic cyclic compound binding (GO:0097159), heterocyclic compound binding (GO:1901363), and ion binding categories (GO:0043167).</p><p>Specifically, the two related groups PM-RM and IV-RM showed DEGs over-represented in ethanolamine metabolic process (GO:0006580-BP), structural constituent of ribosome (GO:0003735-MF), organellar large ribosomal subunit (GO:0000315-CC), rRNA binding (GO:0019843-MF), carbohydrate binding (GO:0030246-MF) and &#x02018;de novo&#x02019; IMP biosynthetic process (GO:0006189), and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter complex (GO:0043190), respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Validation of RNASeq data by qRT-PCR</title><p>qRT-PCR was performed on four DEGs to confirm the data generated by RNAseq in vivo (IV) compared to in vitro samples (RM, PM, OS).

Chicken intestinal loops were used to represent in vivo infection in a single time point (4&#x000a0;h) infected under controlled conditions and the in vitro growth conditions involved addition to different media (increased osmolarity, nutritional limitation, fresh rich medium) to represent aspects of the different environments that might be encountered by <italic>C. perfringens</italic> during the pathogenesis of necrotic enteritis.</p><p>Intestinal loops showed histopathological effects similar to early characteristic NE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] during bacterial colonization (4&#x000a0;h), but the majority of virulence and virulence-associated genes were either repressed or lower expressed, suggesting that the damage observed might be produced by toxins in the broth supernatant.</p><p>The sequencing data analyses obtained clearly showed a significant impact on gene expression of the <italic>C. perfringens</italic> transcriptome during intestinal infection and under different conditions in vitro. The overall data in the MDS plot (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) highlighted the difference between the samples and showed the greatest variance in the in vivo samples; this latter was not unexpected since obtaining and processing the in vivo samples was a relatively complex process.</p><p>The majority of the total of 144 genes that responded to all the in vivo comparisons (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), 68 genes (47.2&#x000a0;%) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), were related to the COG groups of amino acid and carbohydrate transport (Metabolism class) indicating increased source and transport of amino acids/carbohydrates, which suggests that <italic>C. perfringens</italic> was adapting its metabolism to diverse environments, as is important during infection.</p><p>A distinct hierarchical cluster profile was observed in the heat map of gene expression (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) where it is clear that IV vs RM, PM vs RM and IV vs OS groups cluster together due to similar gene expression patterns. The combination of heat map results, which shows up- and downregulated genes, and general analysis of volcano plots (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1), support the conclusion that the gene expression patterns were related to nutritional deficiency (in vivo and PM) and increased osmotic pressure (OS) that occurred in the environment of the chicken intestine and under in vitro conditions. It is noteworthy that DEG in vivo showed greatest similarities to those of bacterial growth in PM, evident in the heat map (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), where PM vs RM cluster together with IV vs RM and IV vs OS. The comparison IV vs PM showed that the majority of genes were downregulated, suggesting that there was similar or greater nutritional deficiency in the intestinal environment. It is interesting to note from the heat map analysis the relatively fast (4&#x000a0;h in vivo and 1&#x000a0;h in vitro) up- and downregulation of a similar group of genes under very different conditions, which demonstrates a promptly organized transcriptional regulation during infection that did not involve the well-known regulators Agr and VirR/VirS.</p><p>Within the time of observation, 673 genes (19.4&#x000a0;% genome) showed differential expression in 4&#x000a0;h in the IV vs RM group and 600 genes (17.3&#x000a0;% genome) in 1&#x000a0;h in the PM vs RM group (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Most DEGs of the comparison groups IV vs RM, IV vs OS and PM vs RM (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) were localized to metabolic processes and cellular processes, as well as catalytic activity and transporter activities, suggesting their involvement in the NE <italic>C. perfringens</italic> adaptation to the intestinal environment and to a nutrient poor environment, an adaptation similar to that reported for <italic>C. difficile</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These include components of ethanolamine metabolic processing and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter complex, also described to be important for adaptation to environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of NE is complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and is likely to involve many genes on the pathogenicity loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], chromosomal genes associated with NE strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and other genes controlled by the VirRS regulatory system. In <italic>C. perfringens</italic>, the two-component regulatory system VirR/VirS and regulatory RNA (VR-RNA) cascade have major control of virulence genes, as well genes for enzymes involved in energy production, acquisition of nutrient and other cellular functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Two crucial quorum-sensing (QS) systems, a cell-to-cell communication using chemical signals to monitor bacterial environment and regulate many bacterial genes, such as Agr-system and LuxS are important for the regulation of toxin genes since they regulate VirR/VirS. The QS system switches on the VirR/VirS two-component regulatory system, and initiates the disease process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Analysis of the behaviour of these major regulatory genes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S4), including either the VirR/VirS genes or Agr gene, showed no significant expression under any conditions, while genes of the LuxS operon were all significantly downregulated under all growth conditions. The impact of downregulation or no significant change in the expression of the major regulatory genes was clearly evident in the repression/lack of expression of most of the virulence-associated genes (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S3, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). It is interesting that the response to environmental cues led to the repression of <italic>netB</italic>, which may be directly linked to VirR/VirS repression since <italic>netB</italic> is under the control of the VirR/VirS two-component regulatory system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore these results are in agreement with the conclusion that most of the virulence-associated genes in <italic>C. perfringen</italic>s are controlled by Agr and VirR/VirS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Taken together, the results from in vivo and in vitro growth conditions and heat map cluster observations suggest that unknown regulatory elements act to induce/repress a large group of genes, as well their importance in the initial steps of colonization.</p><p>Adherence of enteropathogens to intestinal epithelium cells is an important first step in establishing an infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Degradation of the intestinal mucus barrier and colonization of this site is likely to be the critical step in the initiation of NE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Interestingly, the chitinase gene (CP4_3444) and the chitin-binding protein (CBP) (CP4-3445) on the pathogenicity locus, NELoc-1, were markedly upregulated (from 20-fold to 110-fold) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). These chitinases belong to the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 18 that is widespread among bacterial pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. These glycosyl hydrolases cleave the glycosidic bonds of glycans and are increasingly being recognized as virulence-associated factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. They are common in bacterial pathogens involved in mucus colonization and degradation, which is very likely an initial step in the pathogenesis of NE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The upregulation of these two chitinase genes was in marked contrast to the downregulation or lack of change of the rest of NELoc-1. These findings suggest either that the <italic>C. perfringens</italic> may have been in the early stages of a response to its presence in the intestine by starting to upregulate virulence-related genes or that the transition from a nutritionally rich to a poor medium, which also induced transcription of these two genes (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), is a signal for chitinase gene upregulation, or both.</p><p>Degradation of mucus in the small intestine is likely a critical source of nutrients for <italic>C. perfringens</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This allows the bacterium to form localized microcolonies on the mucosal surface and to produce the QS auto-inducing peptides that start the VirR/VirS cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The demonstration that the most upregulated gene in the virulome group was the prominent sialidase (<italic>nanI</italic>) (up to 130-fold) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) also supports the conclusion that the transcriptomic changes observed reflected changes expected in the initial stage of intestinal colonization. <italic>C. perfringens</italic> utilizes sialic acid found in mucin as a nutrient source through the action of sialidases, which appear to be involved in promoting adhesion of <italic>C. perfringens</italic> through modification of epithelial cell surfaces to allow binding to sialidase-exposed receptors on enterocyte cell surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. It is also noteworthy that the increased transcription of <italic>nanI</italic> that occurred in vivo was also observed in the transition from RM to PM (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, some toxin genes, notably &#x003b1;-toxin gene (<italic>cpa</italic>), kappa toxin genes (<italic>colA</italic>), hyaluronidase (<italic>nag</italic>A), hyaluronidase (<italic>nag</italic>J) and &#x003b2;-2 toxin (<italic>cpb2</italic>) were significantly upregulated under most growth conditions (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Despite the dramatic repression of Agr and VirR/VirS, the transcription of &#x003b1;-toxin (<italic>cpa</italic>) and &#x003b2;2-toxin (<italic>cpb2</italic>) was significantly increased, suggesting that these regulators may not be critical for the regulation of &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;2 toxins, dissimilar to what has been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This group of toxins thus seems to be partly independent of VirR/VirS and may be involved as part of early colonization steps.</p><p>The small RNA, VR-RNA system by itself controls at least 147 genes including <italic>plc</italic>, 15 collagenases (<italic>cna</italic>), siliadase (<italic>nanJ</italic>), sialidase (<italic>nanI</italic>), hyaluronidase (<italic>nagL</italic>) and many other virulence-related and housekeeping genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The notable exception to the downregulation of VR-RNA and most genes of the virulome was the upregulation of one collagenase gene (<italic>cna</italic>) and particularly the sialidase (<italic>nanI</italic>) discussed earlier. The VR-RNA was only significantly upregulated in rich media (RM) compared to osmotic shock (OS), but <italic>cna, nanJ</italic> and <italic>nanI</italic> were not significantly transcribed (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S3). This suggests that the VR-RNA acts a repressor of these genes.</p><p><italic>virT</italic> (RNA regulator) has been suggested to have a role of fine-tuning the transcription of VirR/VirS-regulated genes; it negatively regulates <italic>pfoA</italic> transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Our results support these findings since <italic>vir</italic>T was significantly upregulated (30-, 32-, 78-fold changes) under three growth conditions (IV-RM, IV-OS and PM-RM) whereas <italic>pfoA</italic> did not show any expression.</p><p>The regulatory network in <italic>C. perfringens</italic> is very complex and likely has unknown regulator(s) for both chromosomally and plasmid encoded toxin genes<italic>.</italic> The classical two-component systems (TCS) are composed of a histidine kinase (HK) that responds to specific stimuli, and a response regulator (RR) involved in regulating gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In 2011, Dintner <italic>et al.</italic> described a widespread distribution of unique and self-sufficient detoxification modules against antimicrobial peptides (AP), whereby ABC- type of transporters with unusual domain architecture were controlled by an adjacent TCS. This detoxification module consists of a &#x0201c;three-component system&#x0201d; (3CS) (a putative periplasmic ABC transporter substrate-binding protein and a two-component system). We observed that three out of the six TCS (CP4_0635&#x02013;0637; CP4_1221-1223; CP4_2491-2493) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S4) that were significantly upregulated in different growth conditions (IV-RM, IV-OS, PM-RM) have an adjacent periplasmic ABC-transporter with these features, which were also significantly upregulated. The 3 CS &#x0201c;CP4_0635-0637&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;CP4_1221-1223&#x0201d; comprises the periplasmic-binding component of ABC transport systems specific for trehalose/maltose and a two-component system of the AraC family. Finally, &#x0201c;CP4_2491-2493&#x0201d; also includes a periplasmic-binding component of ABC transport systems specific for a molybdate-binding protein and a two-component system of the AraC family. These periplasmic ABC transporters act as a single transmembrane sensor to assist TCSs to respond to extracellular conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. To survive during colonization or infection <italic>C. perfringens</italic> might avoid these innate host defenses that form such a key component of mucus, using these 3CS as defense against AP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, TCS &#x0201c;CP4_0982-0983&#x0201d; (ethanolamine sensory transduction histidine kinase) which was significantly upregulated in PM-RM (6-fold) is adjacent to the ethanolamine operon that was also significantly upregulated (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S4). Ethanolamine, a breakdown product of the membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine, is prevalent in the gastrointestinal environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. There is a global association of ethanolamine degradation with intestinal bacterial pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. For example, three intestinal pathogenic bacteria (<italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, <italic>C. perfringens</italic>, and <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>) are able to utilize both ethanolamine and 1,2-propanediol as a sole carbon source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Recently, Kendall <italic>et al.</italic> (2012) suggested not only that ethanolamine utilization might provide a competitive advantage to enterohaemorrhagic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157 but also that ethanolamine might act as a signal to initiate for expression of important virulence genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. It is possible that we have identified some of the early signalling events and transcriptome changes associated with adaptation of <italic>netB</italic>-positive <italic>C. perfringens</italic> to the intestinal environment and/or specific environmental modifications. These results support the idea of the role of ethanolamine as a carbon and/or nitrogen source contributing to pathogenesis of intestinal infection as been recognized in promoting successful intestinal colonization by <italic>C. difficile</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>It would be interesting to investigate further <italic>C. perfringens</italic> gene expression profiles during the different stages of NE in vivo. Further work is required to increase the relevance of findings of the ligated intestinal chicken loop model with clinical NE. Our analysis suggests that we may have identified early transcription events that initiate NE infection, since the chicken model as used did not show the transcription of main virulence genes. Infection for 8&#x000a0;h has been reported to induce classic lesions of NE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], which might follow expression of a different group of genes including most virulence genes. A different approach may be examining the transcriptome in <italic>C. perfringens</italic> isolated directly of experimentally induced cases of NE, similarly described for <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Another possible approach is the examination of different in vitro conditions (temperature, carbon source, intestinal mucus, bile). Taking advantage of the transcriptome method at different stages of the pathogenesis of NE is very important to understanding the coordination of gene expression and the pathogenesis of the infection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This is the first transcriptome study using RNASeq on NE <italic>C. perfringens</italic> under in vivo and in vitro conditions, which demonstrate that the global gene expression were highly modulated by environmental conditions.
