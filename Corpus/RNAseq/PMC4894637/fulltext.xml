RbdB is a nuclear protein that accumulates, together with Dicer B, in nucleolar foci reminiscent of plant dicing bodies. Disruption of rbdB results in loss of miRNAs and accumulation of primary miRNAs. The phenotype can be rescued by ectopic expression of RbdB thus allowing for a detailed analysis of domain function. The lack of cytoplasmic dsRBD proteins involved in miRNA processing, suggests that both processing steps take place in the nucleus thus resembling the plant pathway. However, we also find features e.g. in the domain structure of Dicer which suggest similarities to animals. Reduction of miRNAs in the rbdB- strain and their increase in the Argonaute A knock out allowed the definition of new miRNAs one of which appears to belong to a new non-canonical class.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>miRNAs are essential regulators in eukaryotic cells and serve to control translation and stability of mRNAs. Processing of primary miRNA transcripts is carried out in two steps by evolutionary conserved machineries consisting mainly of double-strand specific RNases of the Dicer family and accessory double-strand RNA binding proteins (dsRBPs). Regulation occurs by effector proteins of the Argonaute family. While processing in plants is confined to the nucleus, the mechanisms is split into a nuclear and a cytoplasmic step in animals. By knock-out and complementation experiments, we identify RbdB in the amoebozoa <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> as the accessory dsRBP processing component for both steps. Fluorescence microscopy shows that RbdB co-localizes with the RNaseIII Dicer B in nucleolar foci suggesting mechanistic similarities to plants. Functional domain analysis of RbdB and the structure of Dicers, however, indicate similarities to animals. This places <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> at an evolutionary branch point between plants and animals. Deep sequencing reveals that the rbdB knock-out strain shows reduced accumulation of microRNAs.

They are involved in many biological processes, e.g. in development, differentiation and metabolism [summarized in <xref rid="pgen.1006057.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006057.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Key proteins of the RNAi-machinery are required for miRNA processing as well as for binding to cognate sequences in mRNA targets and subsequent gene silencing. At least one Argonaute-like protein, one Piwi-like protein, one Dicer and one RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) was suggested to have constituted the basic RNAi machinery in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes [<xref rid="pgen.1006057.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Research has focused on plants and animals which belong to the supergroups of archaeplastida and opisthokonta respectively [<xref rid="pgen.1006057.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Of special evolutionary interest is the supergroup of amoebozoa with the model organism <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> which branched off the tree of life after the plants but before the animal/fungi split [<xref rid="pgen.1006057.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. <italic>The D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> genome encodes five Argonaute proteins of the Piwi clade (AgnA to AgnE), two Dicer homologues (DrnA and DrnB) and three RdRPs (RrpA to RrpC). Previous experiments have shown that AgnA [<xref rid="pgen.1006057.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and RrpC [<xref rid="pgen.1006057.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] are required for the production of siRNAs while DrnB is essential for miRNA processing [<xref rid="pgen.1006057.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006057.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. DrnA is probably the nuclease that generates siRNAs but apparently, a knockout is lethal.</p><p>The structures of the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> RNase III proteins differ from those in animals or plants. Based on sequence similarities of the RNase III domains, DrnA and DrnB were classified as Dicer homologues, even though they lack a PAZ domain, the DUF283 domain and a helicase domain [<xref rid="pgen.1006057.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, the latter is encoded in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> RdRPs instead [<xref rid="pgen.1006057.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Like animal Dicers, DrnA and DrnB encode one dsRBD instead of two as in plant Dicer homologues [<xref rid="pgen.1006057.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Surprisingly, the dsRBD is present at the N-terminus of DrnA and DrnB. Drosha like RNase III enzymes that are only present in animals are distinct in sequence from Dicer and consist of tandem RNase III domains and a C-terminal dsRBD [<xref rid="pgen.1006057.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Genes encoding proteins with these features are not present in the genome of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic>. However, the domain architecture of DrnA and DrnB is more similar to that of Drosha-like enzymes than to Dicer homologues of animals and plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006057.g001">Fig 1</xref>)</p><fig id="pgen.1006057.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1006057.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Domain architecture of RNase III enzymes.</title><p>Schematic domain architecture of human Drosha and Dicer, DCL1 from <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> (A.th.) and DrnA and DrnB from <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> (D.d.) is shown.

Human Drosha contains a region that is rich in prolines (P-rich site) as well as a region that is rich in serine and arginine (S/R-rich). DrnA and DrnB lack the Helicase domains, the DUF283 domain as well as the PAZ domain. DrnB exhibits a proline and serine rich (P/S-rich) region.

DsRNA binding domain proteins (dsRBPs) contribute miRNA processing [summarized in <xref rid="pgen.1006057.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006057.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. One strand of the miRNA duplex is stably incorporated into an Argonaute protein. Upon binding to perfect or partially complementary sequences in mRNA targets, the latter are endo- and exonucleolytically degraded or translationally repressed [summarized in <xref rid="pgen.1006057.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

However, due to the relatively low knockdown efficiency of 40% mRNA reduction, we can only speculate that Serrate in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> has adopted the role of a negative regulator of miRNA processing and may compete with the microprocessor complex of DrnB and RbdB.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Subcellular Localization of the microprocessor-complex</title><p>DrnB localizes in distinct subnuclear compartments which can often be found in close association with nucleoli [<xref rid="pgen.1006057.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].

A second miRNA with essentially the same features was detected by deep sequencing but was barely detectable in Northern Blots. Such miRNA-like small RNAs would probably have escaped most prediction tools.

This is suggested by the lack of suitable cytoplasmic dsRBD candidates that are usually required for generating mature miRNAs and by the presence of D-bodies in the nucleolar periphery. Furthermore, our data emphasize the modular character and the flexibility of the RNAi machinery: functional domains have been exchanged between proteins in the microprocessor during evolution and can still be shuttled by molecular methods without affecting the functionality of the complex.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec015"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec016"><title>Cell growth and transformation</title><p>All <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> strains were grown axenically in HL5+ medium (Formedia) supplemented with Blasticidine S and/or Geneticin at concentrations of 10 &#x003bc;g/mL when required.

This fragment was cloned adjacent to the N-terminal rbdB fragment in the context of the pGEM-T Easy vector. Thus, sequences encoding the amino acids &#x00394;504&#x02013;612 were deleted. It should be noted that not only the P-rich site which comprises the amino acids 511&#x02013;584 was cut out but also a few adjacent nucleotides.
