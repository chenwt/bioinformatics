In this study, we show that these cells are characterized by a molecular signature that mediates their retention in the liver. By examining liver transplants where donors and recipients are HLA mismatched, we distinguish between donor liver&#x02013;derived and recipient-derived leukocytes to show that Eomes<sup>lo</sup> NK cells circulate freely whereas Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cells are unable to leave the liver. Furthermore, Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cells are retained in the liver for up to 13 y. Therefore, Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cells are long-lived liver-resident cells. We go on to show that Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cells can be recruited from the circulation during adult life and that circulating Eomes<sup>lo</sup> NK cells are able to upregulate Eomes and molecules mediating liver retention under cytokine conditions similar to those in the liver. This suggests that circulating NK cells are a precursor of their liver-resident counterparts.</p></abstract><counts><fig-count count="5"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="47"/><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Natural killer cells are lymphocytes that were first identified by their ability to kill tumor cells without the need for prior sensitization. The best characterized NK cells develop in the bone marrow, circulate in the blood, and have a role in the immune defense against viruses and cancer. However, NK cells are also found in large numbers in nonlymphoid organs, including the uterus and liver (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Organ-specific NK cells differ phenotypically from their circulating counterparts and are also likely to have specialist physiological functions relevant to their home organs (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). For example, uterine NK cells mediate placental implantation during pregnancy (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Recently, NK cells in the liver have been a focus of intense research interest. In mice, splenic NK cells almost uniformly express the T-box transcription factor Eomes, but in the liver, a distinct population of Eomes<sup>&#x02212;</sup> NK cells is also present (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). These murine Eomes<sup>&#x02212;</sup> NK cells have an immature phenotype and were originally thought to be precursors to Eomes<sup>+</sup> circulating NK cells (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). More recently, it has been proposed that Eomes<sup>&#x02212;</sup> liver NK cells form a separate lineage from Eomes<sup>+</sup> circulating NK cells (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Suggestively, the transcription factors required for the development of the two NK cell subsets differ, with circulating NK cells requiring Eomes (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and E4bp4 (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), whereas liver NK cells develop independently of these, but instead require T-bet (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Furthermore, sorted Eomes-GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> liver NK cells are not able to differentiate into Eomes<sup>+</sup> NK cells (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Parabiosis experiments show that T-bet&#x02013;dependent liver NK cells, defined in these studies as DX5<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD49a<sup>+</sup>, do not leave the liver, providing definitive evidence that these NK cells are liver resident (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>There have been three recent reports of NK cell subsets enriched in human liver, compared with blood, defined either as CD49a<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), CD56<sup>bright</sup> (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), or CXCR6<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The enrichment of these subsets in liver, and their expression of CD69, is suggestive of residency, but the difficulties of working with human subjects mean that definitive experiments to address whether these NK cells are liver resident have not yet been performed (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>We previously postulated that human liver, similar to that of the mouse, might contain a liver-specific NK cell population defined by its lack of Eomes expression. Human liver does contain an NK cell population that is not present in blood but, in contrast to the liver-specific population in the mouse, it is Eomes<sup>hi</sup> (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In this study, we demonstrate that these cells express a signature of molecules that mediate their retention in the liver. Working with HLA-mismatched human liver transplants, we show that Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cells are not able to exit the liver and are long-lived, capable of surviving in the liver for up to 13 y. This indicates that these are genuine liver-resident cells. Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cells can be replenished from the circulation during adult life, and cytokines found at high concentrations in the liver promote the upregulation of Eomes. This suggests that, in humans, Eomes<sup>lo</sup> circulating NK cells may be recruited to the liver where they upregulate Eomes becoming long-lived liver-resident cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Samples</title><p>Perfusion fluid was obtained from 16 healthy livers used for transplantation and 11 healthy livers that were unsuitable for transplantation due to vascular abnormalities, long warm ischemic time, or because of primary tumors found in other organs.

S1PR1, which mediates migration of immune cells from tissues into the circulation (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), was expressed at lower levels on Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cells, whereas CD69, which negatively regulates S1PR1, was expressed at higher levels, similar to findings in other subsets of NK cells proposed to be resident in the liver or lymphoid organs (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).

Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cells also express lower levels of perforin and granzyme B but higher levels of granzyme K. The decreased expression of proteins associated with cytotoxicity on Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cells might suggest that they are less cytotoxic than their Eomes<sup>lo</sup> counterparts. Indeed, Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cells were somewhat less able to kill K562 target cells than were Eomes<sup>lo</sup> NK cells, although both did have some cytotoxic capacity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DC1">Supplemental Fig. 1A</xref>). Perhaps surprisingly, given their lesser ability to kill target cells, it was the Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cells that had the greater propensity for degranulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DC1">Supplemental Fig. 1B</xref>). We assessed IFN-&#x003b3;, TNF-&#x003b1;, and GM-CSF production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DC1">Supplemental Fig. 1C&#x02013;E</xref>), because these have been shown to differ between Eomes<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and Eomes<sup>+</sup> NK cells in mice (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).

Finally, we assessed the ability of the cells to produce LIF, because this was one of the most upregulated genes in Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cells by RNAseq, and IL-22, because IL-23R was also overexpressed in Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cells. However, under the conditions examined, both subsets made very little of either of these cytokines and there was no significant difference between them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DC1">Supplemental Fig. 1F, 1G</xref>).

Neither liver NK cell population is phenotypically identical to these, because they are both CD56<sup>+</sup> and CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1E</xref>). However, ILC1 notoriously varies in its phenotype between organs (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), so this does not rule out that one of these subsets might represent ILC1. Therefore, we used data on the whole transcriptomes of ILC1 and NK cells sorted from human lymph nodes (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) to generate a list of differentially expressed genes using the R package SCDE (<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Comparing this to the genes differentially expressed between Eomes<sup>lo</sup> and Eomes<sup>hi</sup> liver NK cells revealed that each NK subset shared roughly the same proportion of genes with both conventional NK cells and ILC1 isolated from the tonsils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1F</xref>). We also considered the possibility that one of the liver NK cell subsets might represent a CD56<sup>+</sup> ILC3 population. However, neither NK subset produced significant IL-22 with any of the stimulation regimes we tried (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DC1">Supplemental Fig. 1G</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that both the Eomes<sup>lo</sup> and the Eomes<sup>hi</sup> CD3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD56<sup>+</sup> subsets present in the liver are likely to represent NK cells, and not helper ILCs.</p></sec><sec id="s12"><title>Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cells do not exit the liver and are long-lived in the liver</title><p>The findings that Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cells were present in liver but not blood, and that the most altered pathways in Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cells are associated with blood exit and tissue retention, suggested that Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cells might represent a liver-resident population.

In these transplants, we could distinguish between donor liver&#x02013;derived and recipient leukocytes by staining with Abs specific for the mismatched HLA.

We isolated leukocytes from the explanted first transplant and distinguished between donor liver&#x02013;derived and recipient-derived cells to determine which leukocytes were able to survive in the liver without replenishment from the circulation. One important caveat is that most of the patients receiving their second transplant were already undergoing immunosuppressive therapy following their first transplant, or they were suffering from immune-mediated complications, or both. However, we did find that the proportions of T cells, NK cells, and Eomes<sup>lo</sup> and Eomes<sup>hi</sup> cells as a proportion of total NK cells were not significantly different between healthy livers, disease controls receiving their first transplant, and our cohort of five retransplant patients, suggesting that our findings are likely to be broadly representative of the situation in healthy liver and other liver diseases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DC1">Supplemental Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>Eomes<sup>lo</sup> NK cells retained in the liver were present in the three biopsies taken immediately after transplant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2F</xref>) and in livers explanted 8 d and even 3 y posttransplant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3B</xref>), but they were barely detectable in livers collected &#x02265;6 y posttransplant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3C&#x02013;E</xref>).

However, it is also possible that the alterations we observed were caused by other aspects of the culture conditions, rather than being Eomes mediated. To more precisely define which genes were altered specifically as a result of Eomes expression, we lentivirally transduced NKL cells with either empty vector or Eomes and examined transduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5B</xref>). NKL cells are derived from a human NK cell leukemia (<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). We used this cell line because it is more easily transduced than primary peripheral blood NK cells and yet is identical to them with respect to expression of Eomes, CD49a, CD103, and S1PR1. Unlike peripheral blood NK cells (but similar to other NK cell lines), NKL cells express intermediate levels of CCR5, CXCR6, and CX3CR1, so we did not examine alterations in these chemokine receptors. Eomes-transduced NKL cells expressed higher levels of CD49a and CD103 than did control-transduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5B</xref>), suggesting that the increase in the expression of these integrins in in vitro&#x02013;differentiated Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cells may be a direct result of Eomes action. In contrast, S1PR1 expression did not differ, indicating that decreased S1PR1 expression in both ex vivo&#x02013;isolated and in vitro&#x02013;differentiated Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cells may not be a direct result of the action of Eomes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s16"><title>Discussion</title><p>Recent years have seen an explosion in interest in liver-specific NK cells and particularly in the idea that there may be a liver-resident subset of NK cells. In mice, these liver-resident NK cells have been characterized in detail. They are dependent on T-bet but independent of Eomes and, using parabiosis experiments, have been definitively shown not to recirculate (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). We took a comparable approach to identify liver-resident NK cells in humans. Similar to mouse liver, human liver contains both Eomes<sup>lo</sup> and Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cell subsets but, in contrast to the mouse, the Eomes<sup>lo</sup> NK subset is present in both blood and liver whereas the Eomes<sup>hi</sup> subset is restricted to the liver. The transcription factors regulating circulating versus liver-resident NK cells, therefore, seem to be reversed in humans compared with mice. This is consistent with a report of an infant with a silencing mutation in Eomes, who presented with a normal distribution of circulating NK cells, suggesting that Eomes is not required for their development in humans (<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). That these two T-box transcription factors could have switched roles over the course of evolution should perhaps not be surprising in the light of their highly homologous nature and often redundant roles (<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p>By RNAseq, the most altered canonical pathways between the two liver NK cell subsets were associated with blood exit and tissue retention, and this suggests that the main difference between Eomes<sup>lo</sup> and Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cells is that the Eomes<sup>hi</sup> population is liver resident. An earlier study showed that some NK cells can be retained in the liver for up to 2 y (<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). We have extended this work by showing that some NK cells are retained for up to 13 y and that these long-term resident NK cells are the Eomes<sup>hi</sup> population. This demonstration that Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cells are unable to re-enter the circulation and are long-lived in the liver provides, to our knowledge for the first time, evidence of a bona fide liver-resident NK cell population in humans. To our knowledge, this is also the first such demonstration of a resident NK cell population in any human tissue.</p><p>Examination of recipient-derived cells from transplanted livers removed between 8 d and 13 y posttransplant further revealed that Eomes<sup>hi</sup> liver-resident NK cells can be recruited from the circulation during adult life. Eomes<sup>lo</sup> NK cells can become Eomes<sup>hi</sup> when exposed to IL-15 and TGF-&#x003b2;, which are highly expressed in the liver (<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). This suggests that one source of Eomes<sup>hi</sup> liver NK cells is circulating Eomes<sup>lo</sup> NK cells, although these experiments do not rule out the possibility that Eomes<sup>hi</sup> liver NK cells also derive, at least in part, from circulating CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem cells or NK progenitor cells (<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). There have been two recent reports of a small population of CXCR6<sup>+</sup> NK cells in the blood, although these, unlike CXCR6<sup>+</sup> NK cells in the liver, are Eomes<sup>lo</sup> (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). One possibility, then, is that circulating CXCR6<sup>+</sup>Eomes<sup>lo</sup> NK cells are recruited to the liver by CXCL16, which is highly expressed by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) and there upregulate Eomes.</p><p>Our finding that Eomes<sup>lo</sup> NK cells could give rise to Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cells was unexpected in the light of work in mice, showing that liver-resident and circulating NK cells form separate lineages (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). It is, of course, likely that human and mouse NK cells differ in this respect, as they do in so many others. However, note that sorted circulating-type NK cells in mice can give rise to a small number of liver-type NK cells during 2 wk in vivo, so there may be some degree of flexibility between the lineages, even in mice (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Furthermore, when bone marrow is transferred to a lethally irradiated mouse, a small proportion of donor-derived liver-resident NK cells are present 3 mo later (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and when ILC progenitors are transferred to a Rag/&#x003b3;c double knockout host, donor-derived liver-specific NK cells are present after 3&#x02013;6 wk (<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Therefore in mice, as we show in humans, there may also be some replacement of liver-resident NK cells from the circulation during adult life.</p><p>In vitro&#x02013;differentiated Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cells mirrored their ex vivo&#x02013;isolated counterparts in their expression of CCR5, CX3CR1, and S1PR1. However, they did not express increased CXCR6. This is consistent with the proposition that CXCR6 causes recruitment to the liver where the cytokine environment promotes Eomes upregulation, as opposed to the alternative that Eomes causes CXCR6 expression. We also found increased expression of CD49a and CD103, strikingly similar to recent findings that TGF-&#x003b2; causes the upregulation of these integrins in circulating NK cells recruited to the salivary gland in the mouse (<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). This is also in line with mRNA expression in freshly isolated Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cells, although we did not detect a difference in protein expression ex vivo. It is possible that ex vivo&#x02013;isolated Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cells do express these proteins but at subdetectable levels, or that they express mRNA and are poised to produce protein but only do so under particular conditions. Transduction of NKL cells with Eomes also caused an increase in the expression of these integrins but did not alter expression of S1PR1. This could indicate that IL-15 and TGF-&#x003b2; alter S1PR1 via a parallel, Eomes-independent pathway, but could also potentially be a result of differences between the NKL cell line and primary NK cells. Nonetheless, it seems clear that IL-15 and TGF-&#x003b2; can cause peripheral blood NK cells to upregulate Eomes and concomitantly alter their expression of chemokine receptors, integrins, and S1PR1 in such a way as to promote retention in the liver, and that the alteration in integrin expression, at least, is likely to be a direct consequence of Eomes expression.</p><p>We therefore propose that CXCR6<sup>+</sup>Eomes<sup>lo</sup> circulating NK cells are recruited to the liver by CXCL16 (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), where they are exposed to high concentrations of IL-15 and TGF-&#x003b2; (<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) causing the upregulation of Eomes. This in turn alters cell surface expression of chemokine receptors, integrins, and S1PR1 such that the Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cells become unable to leave the liver and turn into long-lived resident cells. The precise function of these cells remains to be defined but, as has been suggested in the mouse, their residency may point to tissue-specific homeostatic functions (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). There is also some evidence that liver-resident NK cells in the mouse are memory cells (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). The longevity of Eomes<sup>hi</sup> NK cells in human liver could point to these cells also having memory, although this is an idea that will be challenging to test in humans.</p><p>The distinction between circulating and liver-resident NK cells in humans may also prove clinically relevant. Recently, evidence has emerged that the main drivers of ischemia-reperfusion injury in mouse kidney are resident NK cells (<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). If the same proves to be true of human liver, this could suggest that targeting these cells in the donor liver prior to implantation may present a novel target to ameliorate ischemia-reperfusion injury in the setting of liver transplantation. Finally, the finding that a large proportion of the NK cells present in organs are likely to be resident suggests that we should reconsider the tendency to assume that observations made on NK cells circulating in the blood necessarily signify anything about their organ-resident counterparts (<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="DC1"><label>Data Supplement</label><media id="d36e194" xlink:href="JI_1601424.zip"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the liver transplant patients, transplant co-ordinators, and theatre staff at the Royal Free Hospital, London for their assistance in collecting samples, Amir Gander and the Royal Free TAPb project for ethical approvals and arranging collection of livers deemed unsuitable for transplant, Anthony Nolan for HLA typing, and Tony Brooks and Mike Hubank of University College London Genomics for bioinformatics.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="grant" fn-type="supported-by"><p>This work was funded by <funding-source id="gs01">Royal Society</funding-source>/<funding-source id="gs02">Wellcome Trust</funding-source> Sir Henry Dale Fellowship WT105677 (to V.M. and A.O.C.), a <funding-source id="gs03">Wellington Hospital, London</funding-source> fellowship (to F.P.R.), and a <funding-source id="gs04">Wellcome Trust</funding-source> investigator award (to M.K.M. and K.A.S.).</p></fn><fn id="dep" fn-type="other"><p>The RNA sequencing data presented in this article have been submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology's Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE87392.</p></fn><fn id="supp" fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>The online version of this article contains <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jimmunol.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.4049/jimmunol.1601424/-/DCSupplemental">supplemental material</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn id="abbr" fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations used in this article:<def-list><def-item><term id="G1">ILC</term><def><p>innate lymphoid cell</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G2">RNAseq</term><def><p>RNA sequencing.</p></def></def-item></def-list></p></fn></fn-group><sec id="s17" sec-type="financial-disclosure"><title>Disclosures</title><p>The authors have no financial conflicts of interest.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sojka</surname><given-names>D.
