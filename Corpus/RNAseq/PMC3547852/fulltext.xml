To evade the host immune response, <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> promotes high frequency gene conversion events between many silent pilin copies and the expressed pilin locus (<italic>pilE</italic>), resulting in the production of variant pilin proteins. Previously, we identified a guanine quartet (G4) structure localized near <italic>pilE</italic> that is required for the homologous recombination reactions leading to pilin antigenic variation (Av). In this work, we demonstrate that inactivating the promoter of a small non-coding RNA (sRNA) that initiates within the G4 forming sequence blocks pilin Av. The sRNA promoter is conserved in all sequenced gonococcal strains, and mutations in the predicted transcript downstream of the G4 forming sequence do not alter pilin Av. A mutation that produces a stronger promoter or substitution of the <italic>pilE</italic> G4-associated sRNA promoter with a phage promoter (when the phage polymerase was expressed) produced wild-type levels of pilin Av. Altering the direction and orientation of the <italic>pilE</italic> G4-associated sRNA disrupted pilin Av. In addition, expression of the sRNA at a distal site on the gonococcal chromosome in the context of a promoter mutant did not support pilin Av. We conclude that the DNA containing the G-rich sequence can only form the G4 structure during transcription of this sRNA, thus providing a unique molecular step for the initiation of programmed recombination events.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>To evade the host immune response, pathogens have evolved mechanisms to provide genetic diversity in targets of immune surveillance. Organisms that express these diversification systems are under strong evolutionary pressure to provide subpopulations of preexisting variants and often rely on cellular recombination machinery to catalyze dedicated high-frequency reactions without disturbing genome integrity. Previously, we defined a guanine quartet (G4) structure in the strict human pathogen <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> that is required for initiating the homologous recombination reactions leading to pilin antigenic variation (Av). G4 structures have been implicated in many biological processes, however the mechanisms allowing their formation within a chromosome have not been elucidated. In this work, we show a direct link between transcription of a small RNA (sRNA) that initiates within the G4 structure forming sequence and pilin Av and conclude that the process of transcription is necessary for G4 structure formation. sRNAs have emerged as important regulatory molecules in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and this is a novel activity of a sRNA in a bacterium. We anticipate that the reliance of G4 structure formation on transcription is a mechanism used by other biological systems that rely on this alternative DNA structure.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was partially funded by NIH grants R37AI033493, R01AI055977, and R01AI044239 to HSS and LAC was partially supported by NIH training grant T32GM08061 and NIH Diversity Supplement for R37AI033493.

This result suggests that either the structure doesn't form often enough to produce an observable reduction in viability when the G4 structure interrupts replication, or there are proteins that can remove the G4 structure to prevent a replication stop. The RecQ helicase is a likely candidate for an enzyme that could remove the G4 structure to prevent a replication blockage (Laty A. Cahoon, Kelly A. Manthei, Ella Rotman, James L. Keck and H.
