In TIS, a high-density transposon insertion library is grown under a condition of interest, and then subjected to high-throughput sequencing to map the transposon insertion site for each mutant in the library. The number of reads detected from each insertion mutant is proportional to the fitness of that mutant under the selected growth condition. Thus, strains carrying transposon insertions in loci required for survival will produce few or no reads, while reads from insertions that do not affect growth will be well-represented.</p><p>Genomic regions that are dispensable for growth in optimal laboratory conditions (e.g., rich media) but are required for survival in more stringent growth conditions are termed conditionally essential loci, whereas essential loci are thought to be required under all conditions. Because TIS is limited by sequencing capacity, here we use the terms &#x02018;essential&#x02019; and &#x02018;conditionally essential&#x02019; to define regions that are consistently underrepresented in reads in a given condition; the terms encompass both loci that are absolutely necessary for growth and those that can be disrupted, but are required for optimal growth. Identification of such regions, which can include non-coding sequences in addition to open reading frames, can yield considerable insight into the means by which an organism adapts to different environments. To date, comparative TIS-based studies have been carried out in diverse bacterial species and have defined genes required for survival in the presence of various nutrients and stresses as well as in experimental models of infection (reviewed in <xref rid="pgen.1004782-Barquist1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>).</p><p>While recent studies have firmly established the power and value of TIS, there are several shortcomings in current approaches used for TIS analysis that limit the optimal and widespread application of this technique for conditional essentiality screens. First, read counts between TIS libraries must be normalized to minimize the differences between libraries to be compared; however, current normalization protocols, which generally rely on scaling the frequency of all insertion mutants by a single factor to equalize the total number of reads per library <xref rid="pgen.1004782-vanOpijnen1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004782-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, do not take into account differences in library complexity that arise from stochastic processes encountered during the experiment such as biologic bottlenecks and sequence sampling error. Second, current methods for analysis of conditional essentiality are largely limited to annotated genomic features (e.g., ORFs, ncRNAs), which prevents <italic>de novo</italic> discovery of novel conditionally essential sequences. Finally, current TIS analysis methods usually rely on largely ad-hoc cutoffs (e.g., a minimum fold change in reads required for analytic consideration), and routinely utilize custom computational tools that are inaccessible to most biologists.</p><p>Here, we propose approaches to overcome these limitations of current conditional essentiality analysis. Our solutions include: 1) explicitly modeling changes in sequence abundance between libraries to simulate the systematic differences that can exist between TIS datasets; 2) a novel adaptation of a hidden Markov model, which enables annotation-independent prediction of functional importance across the entire genome; and 3) implementation of this pipeline on a single platform <xref rid="pgen.1004782-XX1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> using well-documented tools in order to offer biologists a standardized method of TIS analysis.</p><p>Our new analytic approaches are combined in a pipeline termed ARTIST (<underline>A</underline>nalysis of high-<underline>R</underline>esolution <underline>T</underline>ransposon-<underline>I</underline>nsertion <underline>S</underline>equences <underline>T</underline>echnique), which includes both a previously characterized workflow for the definition of essential loci in a single TIS library <xref rid="pgen.1004782-Chao1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and a new pipeline for identification of conditionally essential loci. We validate the ARTIST pipeline by reanalyzing a TIS dataset from a recent study of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> requirements for growth in a mouse model of infection <xref rid="pgen.1004782-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Furthermore, we demonstrate ARTIST's versatility by carrying out a new analysis of <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> genomic requirements for infection in a rabbit model using a high-density transposon library created here. In both instances, ARTIST improves the detection of likely conditionally essential genes, while limiting false positive assignments. We believe the ARTIST pipeline will greatly facilitate and enhance the effectiveness of future TIS studies in a variety of organisms and conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Overview of the ARTIST pipeline</title><p>The ARTIST pipeline is Matlab-based <xref rid="pgen.1004782-XX1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and contains two different analysis tools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004782-g001">Figure 1</xref>). One arm, termed EL-ARTIST (for <underline>E</underline>ssential <underline>L</underline>oci analysis), defines all loci that are required for growth (i.e., regions with few or no associated transposon insertions) in a TIS library generated under a single growth condition&#x02014;commonly, standard laboratory conditions. While the key features of the EL-ARTIST analysis method were previously described <xref rid="pgen.1004782-Chao1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, until now this approach was not publicly available as a standalone tool.</p><fig id="pgen-1004782-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1004782.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Flowchart of the ARTIST pipeline.</title><p>Mapped reads from the control and experimental TIS libraries are tallied into read counts for every transposon insertion (see the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004782.s014">Text S1</xref> for example data formats). In the essential loci analysis arm, EL-ARTIST (shaded in orange), the control TIS data is first normalized to remove replication bias <xref rid="pgen.1004782-Gallagher1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and then a sliding window method <xref rid="pgen.1004782-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> is used to initially define stretches of insertions that appear underrepresented in the data. These regions are subsequently used to train a hidden Markov model (HMM), which will refine the grouping of adjacent insertions into essential regions across the entire genome. The steps in this arm have been previously published <xref rid="pgen.1004782-Chao1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In the conditionally essential analysis arm, Con-ARTIST (shaded in blue), the control dataset is first subjected to simulation-based normalization to compensate for genetic drift and sampling error. The resulting simulated control datasets are then compared to the experimental dataset using Mann-Whitney U (MWU) rank sum tests. Genes that are significantly different in reads with high reproducibility can be defined at this step. Alternatively, significantly under- and overrepresented genes from the MWU can serve as a training set for a HMM to further classify all genomic sites of insertion as conditionally depleted, enriched or unchanged between growth conditions. These assignments can be subsequently combined and used to categorize annotated genomic loci. Experimental data that is provided by the user are shown in green, while outputs from the ARTIST pipeline are shaded in purple.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1004782.g001"/></fig><p>The second arm, Con-ARTIST (for <underline>Con</underline>ditionally essential loci analysis) is a new tool that compares transposon libraries that have been grown under different conditions, in order to define conditionally essential loci that are only required for survival under a subset of growth conditions. The Con-ARTIST workflow includes two novel modules that improve upon current TIS analysis methods. First, simulation-based resampling aids normalization between libraries that have different frequencies of mutants due to stochastic experimental variation. Second, a hidden Markov model (HMM) dissects the genome in an annotation-independent manner, allowing the definition of both annotated and uncharacterized genomic regions according to their contribution towards growth.</p><p>In the first step of the Con-ARTIST workflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004782-g001">Figure 1</xref>), mapped read counts from all transposon insertions are normalized between TIS datasets using simulation-based resampling of the control library. This creates independently simulated control libraries that reflect how mutant frequencies can change in an experiment simply due to chance events. For each of these simulated libraries, the number of reads within every annotated genomic feature (e.g., ORFs, ncRNAs, etc.) is compared to that of the same feature in the experimental dataset using a Mann-Whitney U (MWU) statistical test. Non-parametric statistical tests such as the MWU are preferred, as they make no assumptions about the distribution of reads in each dataset and thus may be less sensitive to biases in the experiment (e.g., PCR amplification jackpot events). These MWU tests identify annotated regions that contain significantly different numbers of reads in the control versus the experimental library. When MWU tests are performed on all simulated control datasets, they provide the user with an estimate of how significance values can change due to chance in the experiment.</p><p>The results from the MWU analyses can be used directly for hypothesis generation or to train an annotation-independent hidden Markov model. The HMM is a statistical model that decodes whether genomic regions belong to a particular biological category (e.g., required for growth <italic>in vivo</italic>) given the fold changes in read counts at every insertion site in the genome. The HMM output is a map of every potential transposon insertion site in the genome and each site's likelihood of being required or dispensable for growth under the experimental condition tested. As the HMM is annotation-independent, this allows the user to scan the genome at fine resolution (i.e., down to individual insertions) and discover novel loci that regulate growth, such as upstream regulatory elements in intergenic regions and domain-coding regions within annotated genes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004782.s014">Text S1</xref> for more details). Probabilities within annotated loci can also be combined and a general prediction of essentiality reported for every gene or genomic feature. The final output will be a table of all genomic loci and their predicted biologic states (e.g., no change in growth between experimental conditions, required for growth under the control condition, conditionally underrepresented or conditionally overrepresented). All ARTIST scripts and example files (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004782.s001">Dataset S1</xref>) as well as a comprehensive user manual (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004782.s014">Text S1</xref>) are provided in the supplementary materials.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Genetic drift and sampling error limit the accuracy of conditional essentiality TIS analysis</title><p>Deriving meaningful results from conditional TIS experiments relies on understanding whether differences in mutant frequencies between libraries arise from selection or chance. There are two principal processes that can cause stochastic differences in mutant abundance and interfere with downstream analytical accuracy in TIS-based genetic screens: genetic drift and sampling error. In the context of a population of transposon mutants, genetic drift can be thought of as change in mutant frequencies due to random events, such as population bottlenecks and expansions <xref rid="pgen.1004782-Troy1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004782-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. A stringent bottleneck will markedly alter the complexity of a library independent of the fitness of its constituent mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004782.s002">Figure S1A,B</xref>) while sampling error occurs when low abundance mutants in a mixed population are missed solely due to low sequencing saturation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004782.s002">Figure S1C,D</xref>).</p><p>Comparative analyses of Himar transposon libraries created in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (previously described by Zhang et al. <xref rid="pgen.1004782-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>) and <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (constructed for this study) grown <italic>in vitro</italic> and in animal hosts provide clear evidence for the existence of host bottlenecks and for stochastic variability in library recovery (see below). For example, we created a <italic>V. cholerae</italic> library that was used to inoculate infant rabbits, a model host for the study of cholera <xref rid="pgen.1004782-Ritchie1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This library contained transposon insertions in&#x0003e;60% of all possible insertion sites (i.e., TA dinucleotides), while mutant recovery was highly variable between individual animals, ranging from 4&#x02013;48% of possible sites disrupted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004782.s003">Figure S2A,B</xref>). In contrast, the libraries recovered from all rabbits collectively contained insertions in 57% of TA sites when a saturating number of reads (&#x0003e;3&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup>) was sequenced, indicating that not all loss of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> library complexity in the host was due to selection. Similarly, the <italic>in vitro M. tuberculosis</italic> library contained insertions in &#x0223c;62% of potential insertion sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004782.s003">Figure S2C</xref>), but libraries recovered from individual infected animals only had insertions in 26&#x02013;41% of potential sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004782.s003">Figure S2D</xref>).</p><p>When a relatively small proportion of the input <italic>V. cholerae</italic> library was lost during <italic>in vivo</italic> growth, the number of reads per locus was extremely reproducible among output libraries (e.g., rabbits 2 and 4; R&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.95), whereas inter-animal correlation was less robust when the recovered libraries were less complex, presumably due to stochastic bottleneck-dependent processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004782.s003">Figure S2E</xref>). Thus, host bottlenecks, which are present in most experimental TIS infection models <xref rid="pgen.1004782-Troy1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004782-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004782-Skurnik1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, can present a major challenge for accurately discerning conditionally essential loci, and represent a stringent test of our method's ability to normalize TIS data.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Multinomial distribution-based simulations model stochastic drift in TIS libraries</title><p>Routinely, TIS datasets with differing library complexity are multiplicatively scaled to the same number of total reads using a single factor <xref rid="pgen.1004782-vanOpijnen1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004782-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, which presumes that there will be proportional retention of all neutral mutations in the library, when in fact stochastic events can cause these proportions to change markedly. To address this issue, we used a multinomial distribution to resample reads from the control data and simulate the effect that stochastic processes may exert on the experimental dataset. This simulation relies on the assumption that the observed frequencies of insertion mutants in the deeply sequenced control library approximate their true proportions in the population, such that we can use the control frequencies to define the probabilities of a multinomial distribution. Specifically, the multinomial distribution is scaled by a factor derived from the proportional difference in library complexity (i.e., number of unique sites disrupted) between the control and experimental datasets; this difference approximates the extent of genetic drift and sampling error in the experiment. Next, we use this multinomial distribution to simulate control datasets that have the same number of total reads as the experimental dataset, but have been subjected to a stochastic loss of library complexity that is similar to that experienced by the experimental library. The simulation is repeated to create independently simulated control libraries, and the variance between these libraries reflects the extent that noise from chance events can influence the validity of downstream statistical tests.</p><p>To assess whether simulation-based resampling enables more accurate downstream statistical analysis, we first tested the robustness of multinomial-based normalization when the <italic>in vitro</italic> grown <italic>V. cholerae</italic> library was subjected to increasingly severe simulated bottlenecks. Bottleneck-passaged libraries and the original TIS library were normalized either by multinomial-based resampling or simple multiplicative scaling of reads. The normalized libraries were then compared against the original <italic>in vitro</italic> TIS dataset using a Mann-Whitney U statistical test. In this test, no genes should appear significant since all libraries are derived from the same original source. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004782.s004">Figure S3A</xref>, we found that multinomial-based normalization (Resampling) produced dramatically (3&#x02013;5 fold) fewer false positive gene assignments when compared to multiplicatively scaling (MS) at all bottleneck stringencies. Thus, a multinomial-based normalization approach is more robust at mitigating the effects of population constrictions (i.e., bottlenecks) than the standard approach of multiplicative scaling.</p><p>Since we observed lower false positive rates in simulated data, we tested the merits of our multinomial normalization using animal infection data, which derives from a more complex and relevant biological system and thus offers a stringent test of our modeling approach. We re-analyzed previously published <italic>in vitro</italic> and mouse-grown <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> datasets <xref rid="pgen.1004782-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and identified genes that were differentially represented <italic>in vivo</italic> (p-value&#x0003c;0.01) by MWU test after multiplicative scaling of libraries to the same total reads (as was performed by Zhang et al. but without applying their secondary read count threshold for defining significance). We also performed 100 simulations and MWU tests in the Con-ARTIST pipeline using the same data to model the effect of stochastic population changes in the experiment. Finally, we determined how reproducibly significant (p-value&#x0003c;0.01) the read count changes in all genes were across all 100 simulations, and compared these data to the multiplicatively scaled result above. While multiplicative scaling produced 340 genes with significant p-values, nearly 100 of those genes failed to reach the same level of significance in the majority of our simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004782-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, blue shaded area), suggesting that modeling stochastic mutant loss due to genetic drift may limit false positive assignments.

Despite a relative paucity of transposon insertions in <italic>rv3710</italic> in the <italic>in vitro</italic> library, when compared to the mouse-passaged library, which lacks reads in the entire locus, the gene is found to be conditionally essential by MWU testing when the control library is normalized solely by multiplicative scaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004782-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). However, rare insertions often disappear in resampled controls, which makes the locus appear far less significantly different in the majority of 100 MWU tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004782-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Discrepancies between results from the two normalization approaches can also occur for loci that are well represented by insertions in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> libraries, as is the case for <italic>rv3343c</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004782-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). This gene is deemed significantly underrepresented <italic>in vivo</italic> when using multiplicative scaling, despite a relatively minor difference in reads between conditions (&#x0223c;2 fold), likely because the rank sum-based MWU test is prone toward significance with large numbers of datapoints. Since <italic>rv3343c</italic> contains over 160 potential insertion sites and is well disrupted, the locus may appear statistically different due to the large number of datapoints on which the MWU test is run. In contrast, when <italic>rv3343c</italic> is subjected to simulation-based normalization, the range in reads from the control library becomes narrower, and significant differences are only observed for a small subset of the MWU comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004782-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). The observations with <italic>rv3710</italic> and <italic>rv3343c</italic> indicate that noise introduced by genetic drift can account for apparently significant differences in read abundance for loci that are both under-disrupted or well-disrupted in the control dataset.</p><p>Simulation can also enhance the significance value and improve identification of genes that are conditionally overrepresented.

To circumvent these limitations, we incorporated a hidden Markov model-based module into Con-ARTIST, which seeks to predict &#x02018;hidden states&#x02019; (i.e., regions that belong to particular biological categories) by analyzing observed &#x02018;emissions&#x02019; (i.e., reads from transposon insertions). In TIS analysis, the HMM utilizes read counts from each insertion and those of the immediately preceding insertion to assign hidden states, and thus leverages the information inherent in bacterial genome architecture without aggregating insertions or restricting analysis to previously annotated genomic features.

We identified 16 genes in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and 22 genes in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> that appear to contain domains that are dispensable <italic>in vitro</italic> but required for <italic>in vivo</italic> growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004782.s008">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004782.s010">S3</xref>). For example, <italic>rv0018c</italic>, which encodes the phosphatase PstP, tolerates insertions in its C-terminus-coding region <italic>in vitro</italic>, but these mutants were not recovered from infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004782-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting that the product of this region is essential <italic>in vivo</italic>. In contrast, insertions within the N-terminus appear to prevent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> survival both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Interestingly, the essential and conditionally essential regions correspond closely with predicted protein domains within the gene and their likely subcellular localizations: the essential serine/threonine phosphatase domain (PP2Cc) appears to be cytosolic, whereas the conditionally essential proline-rich region (PRR) is largely periplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004782-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Similarly, the uncharacterized <italic>V. cholerae</italic> gene <italic>vc2041</italic> is predicted by Con-ARTIST to consist of an N-terminal domain required for growth <italic>in vitro</italic> and a C-terminal region that is conditionally essential for survival in the rabbit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004782-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). The essential region covers a domain of unknown function (DUF3413) that contains several putative transmembrane passes, while the <italic>in vivo</italic> essential region overlaps a predicted sulfatase domain that is likely periplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004782-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Thus, Con-ARTIST appears capable of defining sequence encoding protein domains that likely have functionally distinct roles. The ability of Con-ARTIST to interrogate both intergenic and sub-genic regions in an annotation-independent manner across the entire genome is a novel and compelling aspect of this approach, as these features are typically omitted or missed by the aggregative statistical methods routinely used for conditional TIS analyses.</p><fig id="pgen-1004782-g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1004782.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Con-ARTIST identifies conditionally essential regions required for host infection at sub-genic resolution.</title><p>Con-ARTIST identified domain-encoding regions in <italic>M. tuberculosis rv0018c</italic> (A) and <italic>V. cholerae vc2041</italic> (B) that exhibit conditional essentiality <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Users should note that while ARTIST takes certain TIS limitations into account, the analysis is most powerful when several TIS parameters are optimal: high starting library diversity, near sequencing saturation of every mutant and minimal impact from experimental bottlenecks. These metrics, however, are unique to different libraries, organisms and experimental setups. Consequently, we have provided scripts in the ARTIST package (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004782.s001">Dataset S1</xref>) to assess these experimental parameters and enable users to determine whether ARTIST can provide an appropriate analysis for custom TIS data (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004782.s014">Text S1</xref> for instructions and more in-depth discussion). We can report specifically from studies in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> that we were able to generate accurate TIS analysis using Con-ARTIST when the starting TIS library contained insertions at&#x0003e;60% of all potential insertion sites, and that &#x0223c;50% of these insertions were retained after selection in the host. Also, unique mutant discovery in control and experimental libraries began to plateau at around 500,000 reads, and sequencing depths of 2&#x02013;4 million reads typically produced 10&#x02013;100 reads per neutral insertion, which was sufficient for Con-ARTIST analysis.</p><p>In addition, the HMM module of Con-ARTIST is designed for the analysis of sequentially derived interrelated libraries (i.e., all mutants recovered from one growth condition are a subset of the control library), and HMM analysis of libraries derived in parallel (i.e., libraries that may contain a different complement of insertion mutants) may be problematic. Nonetheless, analyses of individually derived libraries can still be conducted using Con-ARTIST without invoking the HMM module (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004782.s014">Text S1</xref>), albeit these analyses will be restricted to annotated loci rather than providing high-resolution insight at single insertion level.</p><p>Finally, although ARTIST was developed to analyze TIS datasets generated using Mariner-based transposons, which insert specifically at TA dinucleotides <xref rid="pgen.1004782-Chiang1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004782-Rubin1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, it should be adaptable to analysis of TIS data generated using Tn5 transposons, which have no absolute sequence specificity <xref rid="pgen.1004782-Langridge1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004782-Kamp1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004782-Barquist2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004782.s014">Text S1</xref> for details). We expect that with such modifications ARTIST will allow for annotation independent analysis of Tn5 data; however, its utility with Tn5-based TIS data has not yet been tested.</p><p>Despite these caveats, ARTIST represents a major step forward in making high-throughput TIS analysis publically available to biologists. ARTIST's novel normalization and high-resolution methodologies enable statistically rigorous annotation-independent identification of loci that are required for growth in one condition (EL-ARTIST) or loci that are conditionally essential or enriched in different conditions (Con-ARTIST), and will enhance the power of TIS-based studies in variety of organisms and experimental conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Strains, media, and culture conditions</title><p>Wildtype <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> C6706 was grown on LB Miller (1% NaCl) supplemented with 200 ug/mL streptomycin (Sm), while the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> transposon mutant library was selected on LB+Sm+50 ug/mL kanamycin (Km). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> SM10 lambda <italic>pir</italic> carrying the conjugative suicide transposon vector pSC189 <xref rid="pgen.1004782-Chiang1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> was grown in LB Miller supplemented with 100 ug/mL ampicillin.

(A) The <italic>in vitro</italic> grown <italic>V. cholerae</italic> dataset was subjected to different bottlenecks <italic>in silico</italic>, where increasing numbers of unique transposon mutants were lost by chance. The <italic>in vitro</italic> library was passed through each bottleneck several times to create 10 independently passaged libraries. The read counts of mutants that remain after the bottleneck were then normalized to the master <italic>in vitro</italic> library (total of 2 million reads) either using multinomial-based simulation (&#x02018;Resampling&#x02019;) or simple multiplicative scaling (&#x02018;MS&#x02019;). Each normalized library was compared to the original <italic>in vitro</italic> dataset using a Mann-Whitney U test, and genes that were found to be significantly different (p-value&#x0003c;0.001) were considered false positive gene assignments. (B) <italic>rv3696c</italic> was found to be significantly different in reads between <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> grown <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> libraries when data is normalized by multiplicative scaling. This effect is more apparent in the difference in reads (and is more statistically significant) when the data is normalized by simulation-based resampling.

Importantly, increasing the p-value stringency cutoff in MWU tests using multiplicative scaling (green arrow) will not only remove like false positives that have low reproducibility of significance in MWU tests, but also genes like <italic>rv3696c</italic> that are consistently different in reads.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1004782.s004.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1004782.s005"><label>Figure S4</label><caption><p>Con-ARTIST identifies conditionally essential genes in important pathways in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.

(A) <italic>In vitro</italic> and rabbit-passaged <italic>V. cholerae</italic> TIS data was analyzed by Con-ARTIST for each individual rabbit. Insertions were defined as conditionally essential if their probability of being assigned to this category exceeded the stringency cutoffs tested&#x02014;85%, 90% or 95%. Insertions in each gene were combined and genes were then defined as conditionally essential (CE), in which every insertion probability has exceeded the stringency cutoff or domain conditionally essential (DCE), in which there are insertions in the gene that both exceed and do not pass the desired cutoff. In all animals, the total number of genes with conditionally essential regions stays the same regardless of the probability cutoff, though at higher levels of stringency some genes switch from being designated entirely conditionally essential to domain conditionally essential. (B) There were 19 genes that were similarly defined as conditionally essential by Kamp et al. and Fu et al., but were not found by Con-ARTIST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004782-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). These genes had significantly fewer disrupted TA sites in the <italic>in vitro</italic> input library compared to the 104 Con-ARTIST defined conditionally essential genes (*, p-value&#x0003c;0.005). (C) 13 candidate conditionally essential genes were deleted in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, barcoded with a unique tag at a neutral locus and grown in LB alongside a tagged WT strain. Growth was monitored with OD<sub>600</sub> measurements at 15-minute intervals. None of the deletion strains had an appreciable growth defect <italic>in vitro</italic> compared a non-barcoded WT strain that was grown in parallel.

Though all three studies defined genes in this pathway as being required for growth <italic>in vivo</italic>, Con-ARTIST found significantly more members than previous studies (p-value&#x0003c;0.05 by Fisher's exact test). Genes were classified as conditionally essential (CE) or non-essential (NE) for growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. Genes that were defined as defective for optimal growth <italic>in vitro</italic> by Kamp et al. are marked as &#x02018;Sick&#x02019;, and genes that were not evaluated by previous studies were marked as not determined (ND).
