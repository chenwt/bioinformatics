In adult <bold>V</bold>CMs, sarcolemmal (sarc) and mitochondrial (mito) ATP-sensitive potassium (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channels play crucial roles in excitability and cardioprotection. In this study, we aim to investigate the biological roles and use of sarcK<sub>ATP</sub> and mitoK<sub>ATP</sub> in hESC-<bold>V</bold>CM. We showed that SarcI<sub>K, ATP</sub> in single hESC-<bold>V</bold>CMs was dormant under baseline conditions, but became markedly activated by cyanide (CN) or the known opener P1075 with a current density that was ~8-fold smaller than adult; These effects were reversible upon washout or the addition of GLI or HMR1098. Interestingly, sarcI<sub>K, ATP</sub> displayed a ~3-fold increase after treatment with hypoxia (5% O<sub>2</sub>). MitoI<sub>K, ATP</sub> was absent in hESC-<bold>V</bold>CMs. However, the thyroid hormone T3 up-regulated mitoI<sub>K, ATP,</sub> conferring diazoxide protective effect on T3-treated hESC-<bold>V</bold>CMs. When assessed using a multi-cellular engineered 3D ventricular cardiac micro-tissue (hvCMT) system, T3 substantially enhanced the developed tension by 3-folds. Diazoxide also attenuated the decrease in contractility induced by simulated ischemia (1%&#x02009;O<sub>2</sub>).

We found that although sarcK<sub>ATP</sub> was expressed at a relatively low basal level in hESC-<bold>V</bold>CMs (~1/8 of adult), upon partial activation it was sufficient to cause APD shortening and therefore accelerated AP firing; when fully activated, sarcK<sub>ATP</sub> of hESC-<bold>V</bold>CMs even silenced automaticity without compromising the intrinsic cellular excitability. These effects were even more prominent after hypoxia-driven augmentation of sarcK<sub>ATP</sub> (by ~3-fold). By contrast, neither T3 treatment nor electrical conditioning (data not shown) affected sarcI<sub>K, ATP</sub>; this mirrored the upregulation of mito I<sub>K, ATP</sub> by T3 but not hypoxia, indicating cue-specific effects on sarc and mito I<sub>K, ATP</sub>. For hypoxia-treated hESC-<bold>V</bold>CMs, AP parameters were not changed under baseline condition when sarcoI<sub>K, ATP</sub> was dormant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Sarcolemmal KATP has long been shown to be involved in cardioprotection during metabolic stress including ischemia/reperfusion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. While more recent studies point to mK<sub>ATP</sub> as the key player in cardioprotection in ischemic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, sarcK<sub>ATP</sub> has been shown to have an increased expression during preconditioning, with the increase expression of SUR2A. Thus, though the role of sarcolemmal K<sub>ATP</sub> in cardioprotection is controversial, our results which demonstrates that sarcolemmal K<sub>ATP</sub> expression is increased in hESC-CMs after 2 days of hypoxia is in accord with previous studies in isolated cardiomyocytes. It has been shown that all subunits of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are expressed in low levels during fetal and prenatal phase, and continue to increase in expression after birth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Chronic mild hypoxia has also been shown to increase SarcK<sub>ATP</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Our observation that SarcK<sub>ATP</sub> is increased in hypoxia may not serve as a pre-conditioning signal but rather in response to a developmental cue.</p><p>Unlike sarcK<sub>ATP,</sub> mitoI<sub>K, ATP</sub> was not functionally expressed in hESC-VCMs. The protein of its molecular correlate ROMK was also absent. Given the defined role of mitoI<sub>K.ATP</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, these findings may provide a potential explanation, at least in part, for the poor graft survival after CM transplantation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> since the recipient milieu is often hostile and ischemic. Interestingly, upon T3 treatment, but not hypoxia, the expression of ROMK protein and mitoK<sub>ATP</sub> were induced, along with an improved survival of hESC-<bold>V</bold>CMs after hypoxic insult. T3 treated engineered ventricular tissues also maintained their contractile force after ischemic/hypoxic insult in the presence of the specific mitoK<sub>ATP</sub> opener diazoxide, confirming that the cardioprotective effect is conferred by mitoK<sub>ATP</sub>. The contractile forces of engineered ventricular tissue constructs were also enhanced after T3 treatment although the automaticity was not affected. Previous studies reported that T3 shortened action potential duration by decreasing L-type calcium channel (I<sub>ca-L</sub>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> and increasing transient outward potassium (I<sub>to</sub>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> and ultrarapid potassium (I<sub>Kur</sub>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> current density. However, such was not observed in hESC-VCMs even one week after T3 (100&#x02009;nM) treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>). Indeed, RNA-seq data on hESC-VCMs reveals that the expression of L-type calcium channels was increased while the expression of Kir 2.1 was found to be unchanged after 7 -days T3 treatment (data not shown). The increase in contractile forces observed in engineered tissues after T3 treatment is likely due to the demonstrated improvement in calcium handling, which is a well established role of thyroid hormone and is independent of the cardioprotective effects conferred by mitoK<sub>ATP</sub>. However, both effects are likely to be genomic in nature as long term treatment with T3 (in a matter of days) is required for these effects to be observed and that the effects persist after the removal of T3. The level of the thyroid hormone receptors TR&#x003b1; and TR&#x003b2; are also observed to increase with T3 treatment (data not shown).</p><p>Collectively, our data suggest that sarcK<sub>ATP</sub> is a prime candidate to target for electrophysiological stability and maturation, while mito I<sub>K, ATP</sub> engineering would improve the longevity of engraftment. We conclude that hypoxia and T3 enhance the functionality of hESC-<bold>V</bold>CMs and their engineered tissues by selectively acting on sarc and mitoI<sub>K, ATP</sub>. The results further implicate that multiple micro-environmental signaling cues uniquely interact to alter the expression and function of different gene products of hESC-VCMs. Therefore, a combinatorial approach will likely be needed for deriving more effective methods to drive maturation of hESC/iPSC-VCMs and their engineered tissues to a more adult-like state. A better understanding of the underlying key players and mechanisms is crucial to accomplish this goal.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Human ESC culturing and directed cardiac differentiation</title><p>Undifferentiated hESC (hES2) were maintained in mTeSR&#x02122;1 on matrigel (BD)-coated plates.
