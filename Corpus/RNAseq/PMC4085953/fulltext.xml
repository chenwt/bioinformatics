Primary fixation of CO<sub>2</sub> into C<sub>4</sub> acids occurs in the outer layer of mesophyll (M) cells using phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), while decarboxylation of C<sub>4</sub> acids and refixation of CO<sub>2</sub> by Rubisco in the C<sub>3</sub> pathway occur in the inner layer of bundle sheath (BS) cells (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Hatch, 1987</xref>). This CO<sub>2</sub>-concentrating mechanism restricts the competing ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) oxygenase reaction and synthesis of glycolate, and the loss of CO<sub>2</sub> by photorespiration. Glycine decarboxylase (GDC), which is essential for photorespiratory CO<sub>2</sub> release in the glycolate pathway, is confined exclusively to BS mitochondria (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Edwards and Walker, 1983</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Edwards and Voznesenskaya, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Sage <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">C<sub>4</sub> species are classified according to their biochemical subtype based on the predominant type of C<sub>4</sub> decarboxylase, NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME), NAD-malic enzyme (NAD-ME), or phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, used to release and concentrate CO<sub>2</sub> around Rubisco (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Hatch, 1987</xref>). The two main types of C<sub>4</sub> cycles in eudicots function either through NADP-ME, which is located in the chloroplasts, or through NAD-ME, which is located in the mitochondria of BS cells. There are structural differences in grana development between M and BS chloroplasts in NADP-ME- versus NAD-ME-type C<sub>4</sub> species associated with differences in photochemistry. For C<sub>4</sub> to function, NADPH is required to reduce 3-phosphoglycerate, the product of CO<sub>2</sub> fixation by Rubisco, to triose-phosphates. In NADP-ME-type C<sub>4</sub> species, the primary shuttle of malate from M cells to BS chloroplasts provides both CO<sub>2</sub> and NADPH, which reduces the requirement for photosystem II (PSII) activity, and the associated development of grana, in BS chloroplasts. In NAD-ME-type species, BS chloroplasts have increased grana development and PSII activity, since the primary shuttle of aspartate from the M to BS cells delivers CO<sub>2</sub>, but not reductive power (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Edwards and Walker, 1983</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Edwards and Voznesenskaya, 2011</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis is considered to have evolved independently &#x0003e;60 times (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Sage <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), resulting in much structural diversity in the forms of C<sub>4</sub> which evolved from C<sub>3</sub> ancestors (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Dengler and Nelson, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Peter and Katinas, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Muhaidat <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Edwards and Voznesenskaya, 2011</xref>). Among the forms identified, 16 develop Kranz around individual veins, while eight develop a compound Kranz unit near the periphery of the leaf, which surrounds all veins (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Edwards and Voznesenskaya, 2011</xref>). The diversity in forms occurs by special positioning of the M and BS layers in relation to the distribution of veins and other tissues, by the occurrence of different types of tissues in the leaf (e.g. mestome sheath in monocots, hypodermal, or water storage cells in dicots), by the way organelles (chloroplast and mitochondria) are arranged in BS cells and their differentiation between M and BS cells, and by structural diversity in developing gas diffusion barriers to support the CO<sub>2</sub>-concentrating mechanism (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Edwards and Voznesenskaya, 2011</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">The ontogeny of the complex C<sub>4</sub> system requires a highly coordinated selective expression of many genes during development, concurrent with establishment of Kranz anatomy. Genes controlling development of M and BS specialization for function of the C<sub>4</sub> system, and the degree of redundancy which has occurred during the multiple times C<sub>4</sub> has evolved is unknown. Among monocot and eudicot C<sub>4</sub> species which are being used as genetic models, concerted efforts are needed to identify regulatory factors along leaf developmental gradients which control the expression of specific C<sub>4</sub> traits (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Covshoff <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">There have been a number of studies on structural and biochemical development of forms of C<sub>4</sub> having Kranz anatomy around individual veins.

In <italic>C. gynandra</italic>, which has Atriplicoid-type anatomy with Kranz units around individual veins, the BS cells towards the adaxial side are sister to procambium cells arising from the adaxial derivative of the first periclinal division of the ground meristem cell (the abaxial derivative gives rise to the procambium initial). The rest of the BS cells ontogenetically originate from the ground meristem cells of the second, third, and fourth layers adjacent to the vein.

The plasmodesmata frequency between M and BS cells is also high at this time. In Stage 3, structural specialization of M and BS begins.

There was an increase in the length of the M cells with no change in width, while there was an ~2-fold increase in both the length and width of the BS cells.

The density of plasmodesmata at the interphase between M and BS cells increases or remains constant (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) despite the increase in size of M and BS cells (and contact between the two) due to the formation of secondary plasmodesmata during development. This indicates establishment of symplastic connections between M and BS from the earliest stages of development which enables intercellular movement of metabolites for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.

BS cells complete divisions, and initiate cell expansion with multiplication of chloroplasts and mitochondria earlier than M cells which continue to have active anticlinal divisions up to Stage 2.

Rubisco and GDC are selectively expressed in chloroplasts and mitochondria, respectively, in BS cells, and at the same time they are suppressed in chloroplasts and mitochondria of the M cells, characteristic of the C<sub>4</sub> system. So, while organelles, chloroplasts and mitochondria, do not become ultrastructurally differentiated in BS and M until full maturation of Kranz, biochemical specialization of organelles in the two chlorenchyma cells is occurring already in the meristematic stages right after the layers become positionally delimited. This shows that Rubisco and GDC expression in these two <italic>Cleome</italic> species is not directly associated with structural differentiation of M and BS cells.</p><p content-type="indent">Early cell-specific Rubisco expression during leaf development has also been observed in several other C<sub>4</sub> species, including <italic>Arundinella hirta</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Wakayama <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), <italic>A. rosea</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Dengler <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>), <italic>S. eltonica</italic>, and <italic>S. taxifolia</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Koteyeva <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011<italic>a</italic>
</xref>). In contrast, a C<sub>3</sub> default state with Rubisco appearing initially in both M and BS chloroplasts has been observed in other C<sub>4</sub> species, with selective expression of Rubisco in BS depending on light or developmental cues in maize (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Sheen and Bogorad, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Langdale <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988b</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Sheen, 1999</xref>), in <italic>A. hypochondriacus</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Patel and Berry, 2008</xref>), in three structural forms of C<sub>4</sub> in family Cyperaceae (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Soros and Dengler, 2001</xref>), and in <italic>Salsola richteri</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Voznesenskaya <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003b</xref>). Clearly these differences in transitions to C<sub>4</sub> suggest evolution of alternative cues for initiation of C<sub>4</sub> development; although there may be convergence in factors (transcriptional or transacting) controlling synthesis of components of the C<sub>4</sub> system.</p><p content-type="indent">PEPC levels were too low to detect in Stage 1. From its earliest detection in Stage 2, it was M specific and the level increased in parallel with M differentiation. In a number of other developmental studies, PEPC gene expression also appears to be initially M specific and increased depending on M differentiation (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Langdale <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988<italic>a</italic>

<italic>Cleome</italic> species indicate that intercellular compartmentation for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis is established early without a C<sub>3</sub> default state, that enzyme levels to support the C<sub>4</sub> system continue to rise during the four stages of leaf development, and that structural positioning of organelles and differentiation of chloroplasts and mitochondria occur later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). This suggests that development of C<sub>4</sub> biochemistry may be a driver for organelle differentiation, namely for M and BS chloroplasts to provide the balance in ATP and NADPH from photochemistry to support the NAD-ME-type C<sub>4</sub> cycle (see <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Edwards and Voznesenskaya, 2011</xref>), and for mitochondria to provide the capacity for transport and metabolism to support decarboxylation via NAD-ME. The same pattern of development in these two C<sub>4</sub>
<italic>Cleome</italic> species which have very different types of Kranz anatomy and independent evolutionary lineages is consistent with the concept that genes to support the C<sub>4</sub> cycle were already primed for recruitment and selective expression in M and BS cells (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Brown <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Kajala <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">A functional analysis of young versus mature leaves of <italic>C. gynandra</italic> was made by analysing the effect of O<sub>2</sub> on &#x00413; to determine if the response is indicative of C<sub>4</sub>, intermediate, or C<sub>3</sub> photosynthesis. C<sub>4</sub> plants have very low &#x00413; (1&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;bar) while C<sub>3</sub> plants have high values of &#x00413; (~40&#x02013;50 &#x003bc;bar at 25 <sup>&#x025cb;</sup>C and 20% O<sub>2</sub>). Additionally, &#x00413; in C<sub>4</sub> plants has little or no sensitivity to O<sub>2</sub>, while values in C<sub>3</sub> plants approximately double with a 2-fold increases in O<sub>2</sub>. C<sub>3</sub>&#x02013;C<sub>4</sub> species have intermediate &#x00413; values, which increase with the level of O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Krenzer <italic>et al.</italic>, 1975</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Brooks and Farquhar, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">von Caemmerer, 1989</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Ku <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Vogan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Voznesenskaya <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Mature leaves of <italic>C. gynandra</italic> show a clear C<sub>4</sub>-type response, with values of &#x00413; of ~2.5 &#x003bc;bar with insensitivity to O<sub>2</sub>. In young leaves, the lack of sensitivity of &#x00413; to O<sub>2</sub>, between 10% and 40%, is characteristic of C<sub>4</sub> plants. The higher &#x00413; values in young leaves (~14 &#x003bc;bar) are probably due to the higher <italic>R</italic>

Thus, in the absence of <italic>R</italic>

Thus, the results suggest that young leaves of <italic>C. gynandra</italic> are functionally C<sub>4</sub>. A factor which may minimize the occurrence of photorespiration and maintain a lower &#x00413; in young leaves is the selective localization of photosynthetic enzymes to M and BS cells for function of C<sub>4</sub> early in development. Also, the selective localization of GDC to the BS indicates the presence of conditions favourable for refixation of photorespired CO<sub>2</sub> around Rubisco from the very early stages of development. As leaves develop, there is an increase in the level of GDC in the two <italic>Cleome</italic> species; this may be associated with multiplication and increase in size of BS mitochondria (where GDC is localized), which was observed during development along a longitudinal gradient in young leaves (Stage 3). There is the possibility that sensitivity of photosynthesis to O<sub>2</sub> occurs at the base of young leaves, but its contribution to carbon assimilation is expected to be very low (due to low Rubisco, and undeveloped stomata).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s24"><title>Expression of C<sub>4</sub> enzymes in M cells which do not have contact with the BS</title><p>Both <italic>Cleome</italic> species have an additional layer of chlorenchyma cells on the abaxial side of leaves (SM) which is ontogenetically related to the abaxial M layer which is adjacent to the BS. They are not associated with BS, and structurally resemble M cells with well-developed chloroplasts. It was shown by confocal immunohistochemistry and TEM immunogold labelling that their cytosol contains PEPC at a similar level to that of adaxial and abaxial M cells which are in contact with BS. The expression of Rubisco and GDC in these distal M cells is suppressed, and structural and biochemical differentiation of these cells occurs in parallel with the M cells in contact with BS.</p><p content-type="indent">There are not many cases where C<sub>4</sub> plants have more than two M cells between neighbouring BS cells; analysis of 119 C<sub>4</sub> grasses (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Hattersley and Watson, 1975</xref>) showed that no M cell is separated from the nearest BS cell by more than one other M cell (the maximum cell distant count). Based on studies with maize, it has long been considered that M cells differentiate to form a C<sub>4</sub>-type cell only when they are in contact with BS; and that M cells distant from BS are deprived of PEPC expression and contain Rubisco in chloroplasts (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Langdale <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988b</xref>). In maize husk having &#x0003e;20 additional cells between BS cells, the structural and biochemical specialization for C<sub>4</sub> was shown only in M cells which are in contact with BS cells, which supports this hypothesis (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Langdale <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988b</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Pengelly <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Also, in <italic>A. rosea</italic> there is an extra layer of abaxial and adaxial cells which are not in contact with the BS cells; <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Dengler <italic>et al.</italic> (1995)</xref> found that PEPC expression was restricted to the M cells adjacent to BS cells along the whole maturation gradient. However, the authors noted that those cells contain few organelles and are non-photosynthetic (hypodermal cells, probably functioning in water storage). Thus, the results with the two C<sub>4</sub>
<italic>Cleome</italic> species, which clearly shows formation of C<sub>4</sub>-type M cells which are not adjacent to the BS, is an interesting variation on regulation of C<sub>4</sub> development.</p></sec><sec id="s25"><title>Signalling for tissue-specific development of BS and M cells</title><p>Veins in C<sub>4</sub> plants have been considered to play an organizing role in the differentiation of Kranz anatomy as a source of the positional signal which controls the coordinated development of at least two cells in a radius around individual veins, as in <italic>C. gynandra</italic>, generating the pattern of Vein&#x02013;BS&#x02013;M&#x02013;M&#x02013;BS&#x02013;Vein units (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Langdale <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988<italic>a</italic>

This is a logical hypothesis for the leaf structures where the anatomy consists of multiple simple Kranz units around individual veins which occur in many C<sub>4</sub> lineages coupled with increased leaf venation during evolution from C<sub>3</sub> to C<sub>4</sub> species (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">McKown and Dengler, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). However, the pattern of development of Kranz anatomy in the <italic>Cleome</italic> species in the current study is not compatible with this hypothesis. In <italic>C. gynandra</italic>, which has Atriplicoid-type anatomy, the structural development of M specialization is not correlated with BS cell development. Rather BS cell development is correlated with stages of differentiation of alternate veins, but not the M cells which have only a basipetal gradient of maturation. Also, the hypothesis of signalling from vascular tissue to control differentiation of the M cells adjacent to BS cells is not consistent with the same expression pattern of C<sub>4</sub> in the cells of the abaxial SM layer not adjacent to BS. These two abaxial M layers represent sister cells which originated from the division of the abaxial subepidermal ground meristem; but, their segregation occurs before, or simultaneously with, the start of procambial strand initiation. One could imagine that the &#x02018;M&#x02019; signal may come to the progenitor cell before its division, which could explain the existence of PEPC in both M layers; but, in this case, the signal cannot come from the undifferentiated vein. Also, the selective expression of PEPC in the M cells occurs later, during Stage 2, while the selective expression of Rubisco and GDC occurs during Stage 1, which suggests temporal differences in signalling.</p><p content-type="indent">With respect to <italic>C. angustifolia</italic>, recently it was shown that evolution of C<sub>4</sub> species having a single compound Kranz unit in C<sub>4</sub>
<italic>Salsola</italic> occurs not with increasing vein density, but by increased succulence and development of a layer of BS cells around veins and water storage tissue (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Voznesenskaya <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). For differentiation of tissue for this type of anatomy, veins could not be the centre for a positional signal since they are not evenly distributed relative to the position of Kranz anatomy, and their contact with BS is not essential (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Koteyeva <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011<italic>a</italic>
</xref>). The spatial positioning of M and BS cells relative to each other, unlike the positioning of Kranz around individual veins, is essential to the mechanism controlling their differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s26"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>The results indicate that two C<sub>4</sub>
<italic>Cleome</italic> species, which have different Kranz anatomy and evolved independently in family Cleomaceae, have a similar developmental pathway for C<sub>4</sub> during structural and biochemical maturation. The ontogenetic programme for this development involves control of cell-specific patterns of mitosis (rates and plane) and cell expansion, division of chloroplasts and mitochondria, structural differentiation and spatial distribution, cell wall modification, and plasmodesmata formation, with all of these characteristics occurring in close coordination with vascular system differentiation. The early partitioning of Rubisco, GDC, and PEPC expression between M and BS in both species shows that factors controlling their cell specificity must be activated as soon as the tissue become delimited. Further regulation occurs during development, with increased levels of expression of photosynthetic enzymes, and structural differentiation of M and BS cells and organelles. The results provide insight into stages to consider for transcriptome and proteomic studies to search for candidate genes which control structural and biochemical transitions in C<sub>4</sub> development.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s27"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>
