Here, to facilitate the study of early processes of retinal regeneration, we provide a <italic>de novo</italic> assembly transcriptome and inferred proteome of the Japanese fire bellied newt (<italic>Cynops pyrrhogaster</italic>), which was obtained from eyeball samples of day 0&#x02013;14 after surgical removal of the lens and neural retina. This transcriptome (237,120 <italic>in silico</italic> transcripts) contains most information of cDNAs/ESTs which has been reported in newts (<italic>C. pyrrhogaster</italic>, <italic>Pleurodeles waltl</italic> and <italic>Notophthalmus viridescence</italic>) thus far. On the other hand, <italic>de novo</italic> assembly transcriptomes reported lately for <italic>N. viridescence</italic> only covered 16&#x02013;31% of this transcriptome, suggesting that most constituents of this transcriptome are specific to the regenerating eye tissues of <italic>C. pyrrhogaster</italic>. A total of 87,102 <italic>in silico</italic> transcripts of this transcriptome were functionally annotated. Coding sequence prediction in combination with functional annotation revealed that 76,968 <italic>in silico</italic> transcripts encode protein/peptides recorded in public databases so far, whereas 17,316 might be unique. qPCR and Sanger sequencing demonstrated that this transcriptome contains much information pertaining to genes that are regulated in association with cell reprogramming, cell-cycle re-entry/proliferation, and tissue patterning in an early phase of retinal regeneration. This data also provides important insight for further investigations addressing cellular mechanisms and molecular networks underlying retinal regeneration as well as differences between retinal regeneration and disorders. This transcriptome can be applied to ensuing comprehensive gene screening steps, providing candidate genes, regardless of whether annotated or unique, to uncover essential mechanisms underlying early processes of retinal regeneration.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (23124502; 221S0002) and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (24650229; 25870096; 21300150; 24240062).

This animal has an outstanding ability, when metamorphosed or sexually matured, or even as an aged adult, to regenerate missing body parts &#x02013; including a part of a limb, the jaw, the tail (the spinal cord), the brain, the heart, the eye (the lens and the retina) &#x02013; from remaining tissues at the site of injury. This takes place through dedifferentiation&#x02013;redifferentiation/-transdifferentiation (or reprogramming) of terminally differentiated cells as well as recruitment of endogenous stem/progenitor cells, their proliferation and patterning, and physiological integration of regenerates into the body system <xref rid="pone.0109831-Alvarado1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109831-Eguchi1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Although ample endeavors have been made to understand these surprising phenomena for over a century, the underlying cellular mechanisms and molecular networks are still largely uncertain primarily because of our technical limitations. However, studies in this field are now moving forward with increasing speed by incorporating highly efficient technologies to analyze gene functions <xref rid="pone.0109831-Tsonis1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109831-CascoRobles1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and transcriptomes <xref rid="pone.0109831-Abdullayeva1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109831-Looso1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. For studies of the newt whose genomic size is too large to be sequenced (estimated &#x0223c;20 Gbp <xref rid="pone.0109831-Litvinchuk1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>), construction of an <italic>in silico</italic> transcriptome by RNAseq/<italic>de novo</italic> assembly is certainly cost effective, and the resulting data sets are highly informative for bench screening candidate genes.</p><p>Regeneration of the adult newt retina is a good system to study the early processes of regeneration, particularly the mechanisms underlying reprogramming, cell-cycle re-entry/proliferation and patterning, because of its simplicity. The cell source for retinal regeneration in the posterior eye is the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells only. The RPE, which is a highly specialized monolayer lining the back of the neural retina, expresses specific molecular markers such as RPE65, allowing the RPE cells and RPE-derived cells to be tracked in an early phase of retinal regeneration <xref rid="pone.0109831-Chiba1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In addition, this system has an obvious medical target, namely <italic>proliferative vitreoretinopathy</italic> (<italic>PVR</italic>) in which RPE cells proliferate and transform in response to retinal injury, leading to the loss of vision <xref rid="pone.0109831-Chiba2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Among all newt species, the Japanese fire bellied newt (<italic>Cynops pyrrhogaster</italic>) is the best choice for the study of retinal regeneration since: 1) a surgical procedure to induce retinal regeneration has been established; 2) morphological stages of retinal regeneration have been defined in detail; 3) both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> functional gene assay systems are being developed <xref rid="pone.0109831-CascoRobles1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109831-Chiba1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109831-Susaki1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109831-Yoshikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, to facilitate the study of retinal regeneration in this species, one considerable obstacle still remains: limited information on genes. Thus, in the current study, to overcome this problem we carried out mRNA-seq/<italic>de novo</italic> assembly in this species, providing an <italic>in silico</italic> reference transcriptome specialized for the study of early processes of retinal regeneration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study using the Japanese fire bellied newt <italic>C. pyrrhogaster</italic> was permitted by the University of Tsukuba Animal Use and Care Committee (AUCC).

This operation was completed within 5 min.</p><p>For quantitative PCR (qPCR), both the right (intact) and left (retinectomized) eyeballs of animals at day-10 and -14 po were used; that is, the right eyeballs were used for day-0 po sample containing intact RPE (stage E-0), and the left ones were for samples of day-10 po (stage E-1) or day-14 po (stage E-2). Tissue samples for RNA isolation were prepared as follows. After the animal was decapitated under anesthesia, the right and left eyeballs were collected in different dishes (filled with RNase-free PBS) on ice. The right eyeball was immediately dissected into the RLEC, and the RPE sheet together with the choroid tissues was isolated by separating these from the sclera using a fine pin and forceps. On the other hand, the left eyeball of day-10 or -14 po, which was put on the filter membrane and soaked in chilled RNase-free PBS as done for the right eyeball, was carefully opened from the wound at the time of retinectomy using a fine pin and scissors; after the anterior part of the eyeball containing the iris and the ciliary marginal zone was carefully removed, RPE -derived cells in the posterior eye were collected together with the choroid tissues as done for the right eyeball. After blood cells in the choroid were removed as much as possible by shaking them in the dish, each day samples were transferred into different tubes (containing RNase-free PBS) on ice with a pipette (3.5 ml Transferpipette, Sarsted, D-51588 N&#x000fc;mbrecht, Germany).

By applying the &#x02018;&#x02013;min_kmer_cov 2&#x02019; parameter (the default is 1), only k-mers that occur more than once are assembled. This parameter is used to reduce memory requirements and runtimes. Generally, this will eliminate super rare transcripts and sequencing errors, but will not usually affect assembly quality. ABySS was run with k-mer values form 51 to 95 in steps of 2, and then all 23 assemblies from AbySS were merged into one assembly using Trans-ABySS. Velvet was run with k-mer values from 45 to 95 in steps of 5, and then the contigs produced by Velvet at each k-mer value were further assembled into transcripts using Oases. Finally, the best result (k-mer&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;75) was selected as output.

Upon retinectomy, RPE cells are detached from each other and leave the basement membrane, forming cell aggregates, while entering the S-phase of cell-cycle (Stage E-1). This event typically occurs between day-5 and day-10 po. The RPE-derived cells at Stage E-1 form the pro-NR and pro-RPE layers by day-14 po (Stage E-2).</p><p>In the previous studies <xref rid="pone.0109831-Susaki2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109831-Kaneko1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, we demonstrated that an RNA-binding protein Musashi-1, whose expression is restricted in the nucleus of the intact RPE cells, changes its location into the cytoplasm upon retinectomy, although the amount of the transcripts tends to be decreased as suggested in the current qPCR. This pattern of Musashi-1 expression was observed in almost all of the RPE-derived cells at Stage E-1 uniformly. As the regeneration proceeds to Stage E-2, Musashi-1 expression was down-regulated along the pro-RPE layer, while sustained along the pro-NR layer <xref rid="pone.0109831-Kaneko1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Since the cytoplasmic expression of Musashi-1 is a character of neural stem/progenitor cells <xref rid="pone.0109831-Okano1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, these observations led us to an implication that the RPE cells are reprogrammed into a multipotent state of cells by Stage E-1, and specified into 2 cell populations forming the pro-NR and pro-RPE layers between Stage E-1 and E-2. However, the nature of the RPE-derived cells remains unclear.</p><p>The current qPCR revealed that gene expression suggesting multipotent properties of cells is up-regulated upon retinectomy, while gene expression for original RPE characters is down-regulated, giving us an insight for the cell reprogramming. Interestingly, certain pluripotency factors (<italic>c-Myc</italic>, <italic>Klf4</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic>) as well as <italic>Mitf</italic> were first detected in day-10 samples (Stage E-1). On the other hand, <italic>Pax6</italic> was detected only in day-14 samples. In the previous study, we detected <italic>Pax6</italic> expression at day-10 po, being earlier than <italic>Chx10-1</italic>/<italic>Vsx1</italic> (a retinal progenitor marker) at day-14 po <xref rid="pone.0109831-Chiba3" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. This inconsistency may be due to the difference in the template for PCR: in the previous study, we used a PCR-amplified library of cDNAs as the template, and therefore the detection sensitivity should have been higher. Taken together, our results suggest that the intact adult newt RPE cells are not comparable to either immature/uncommitted state of RPE cells or retinal stem/progenitor cells, as well as a possibility of reprogramming of RPE cells into such multipotent cells upon retinectomy. On the next stage of this study, we must carry out immunohistochemistry and single-cell qPCR to address the expression of these factors in the RPE-derived cells at Stage E-1 (our study on this subject was published <xref rid="pone.0109831-Islam1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> while the current article was under review).</p><p>The current qPCR with day-14 samples detected a factor (<italic>Chx10</italic>/<italic>Vsx2</italic>) suggesting the presence of retinal progenitor cells and that (<italic>Wnt2b</italic>) inferred to be involved in the RPE differentiation. <italic>Sox2</italic>, which is also a marker of retinal stem/progenitor cells <xref rid="pone.0109831-Hever1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, increased in its expression level between day-10 and day-14, whereas <italic>c-Myc</italic>, <italic>Klf4</italic> and <italic>Mitf</italic> were declined. These expression patterns seem to support our previous implication that the RPE-derived cells are specified into two cell populations from which the pro-NR and pro-RPE layers are formed, leading a possibility that the cells in the pro-NR and pro-RPE layers might be correspond to the retinal progenitor cells and RPE cells which just started their differentiation, respectively. In addition, the expression of <italic>&#x003b1;-SMA</italic>, which is observed in the choroid tissues (data not shown), was obviously declined to a minimal level at day-14, revealing a contrast to human <italic>PVR</italic> in which the RPE-derived multipotent cells transform into myofibroblasts. Thus, in the adult newt system, the RPE-derived cells (possibly in a multipotent state) direct properly and seem to generate retinal progenitor cells for regeneration of a missing neural retina.</p><p>In the current study, we did not carry out further analyses because the purpose of the study was to establish a good transcriptome database.
