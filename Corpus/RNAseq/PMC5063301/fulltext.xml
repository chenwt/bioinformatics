Host-induced gene silencing has shown great potential for controlling pest and diseases in crop plants. However, while delivery of inhibitory noncoding double-stranded (ds)RNA by transgenic expression is a promising concept, it requires the generation of transgenic crop plants which may cause substantial delay for application strategies depending on the transformability and genetic stability of the crop plant species. Using the agronomically important barley&#x02014;<italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> pathosystem, we alternatively demonstrate that a spray application of a long noncoding dsRNA (791 nt <italic>CYP3</italic>-dsRNA), which targets the three fungal cytochrome P450 <italic>lanosterol C-14&#x003b1;-demethylases</italic>, required for biosynthesis of fungal ergosterol, inhibits fungal growth in the directly sprayed (local) as well as the non-sprayed (distal) parts of detached leaves. Unexpectedly, efficient spray-induced control of fungal infections in the distal tissue involved passage of <italic>CYP3</italic>-dsRNA via the plant vascular system and processing into small interfering (si)RNAs by fungal DICER-LIKE 1 (<italic>FgDCL-1</italic>) after uptake by the pathogen. We discuss important consequences of this new finding on future RNA-based disease control strategies. Given the ease of design, high specificity, and applicability to diverse pathogens, the use of target-specific dsRNA as an anti-fungal agent offers unprecedented potential as a new plant protection strategy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>RNA interference has emerged as a powerful genetic tool for scientific research. The demonstration that agricultural pests, such as insects and nematodes, are killed by exogenously supplied RNA targeting their essential genes has raised the possibility that plant predation can be controlled by lethal RNA signals. We show that spraying barley with a 791 nt long dsRNA (<italic>CYP3</italic>-dsRNA) targeting the three fungal ergosterol biosynthesis genes (<italic>CYP51A</italic>, <italic>CYP51B</italic>, <italic>CYP51C</italic>), whose respective proteins also are known as azole fungicide targets, efficiently inhibited the necrotrophic fungus <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> in directly sprayed and systemic leaf tissue. Strong inhibition of fungal growth required an operational fungal RNA interference mechanism as demonstrated by the fact that a Fusarium DICER-LIKE-1 mutant was insensitive to <italic>CYP3</italic>-dsRNA in systemic, non-sprayed leaf areas. Our findings will help in the efficient design of RNAi-based plant disease control. We provide essential information on a fundamentally new plant protection strategy, thereby opening novel avenues for improving crop yields in an environmentally friendly and sustainable manner.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the German Research Council (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) KO1208/23-1 and was supported by grants from the LOEWE program Medical RNomics (State of Hessen; to OR).

Diseases of cereal crops such as Fusarium head blight (FHB) and Fusarium seedling blight (FSB), caused by necrotrophic fungi of the genus Fusarium, exert a particularly great economic and agronomic impact on global grain production and the grain industry [<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Food safety can be compromised by contamination of agricultural products with mycotoxins, which are produced during FHB and FSB development [<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and represent a serious threat to human and animal health. Currently, the major strategies to control Fusarium diseases include resistance breeding, crop rotation, and biological control along with the application of DMI (demethylation inhibitors) fungicides [<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. DMI fungicides, such as tebuconazole, triadimefon, and prochloraz inhibit ergosterol biosynthesis by binding to cytochrome P450 lanosterol C-14 &#x003b1;-demethylase (CYP51), thereby disrupting fungal membrane integrity [<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, heavy reliance on DMI fungicides since their discovery in the mid-1970s holds a risk of the emergence of DMI-tolerant strains of plant pathogens. Conventional plant breeding strategies have been only partly successful, as the quantitative nature of FHB and FSB resistance does not allow straightforward breeding programs.</p><p>Since the discovery in 1998 that exogenous double-stranded (ds)RNA triggers suppression of gene activity in a homology-dependent manner [<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], along with the identification of small RNAs (sRNAs) as a new class of regulatory molecules [<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] that functions via RNA interference (RNAi), our understanding of the essential cellular function of gene silencing has increased considerably [<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Mobile RNA silencing signals are capable of translocating from the host to its interacting organism, and vice versa [<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Recent evidence supports the significant contribution of sRNAs and RNAi to the communication between plant hosts and a pathogenic fungus [<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Exploiting the RNAi mechanism in plants also has a strong potential for agriculture. Indeed, expression of inhibitory dsRNAs in the corresponding host plant conferred protection from predation or infection by targeted gene silencing [<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], a phenomenon that has been termed host-induced gene silencing (HIGS).</p><p>Recently, we demonstrated that in Arabidopsis (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>) and barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>), transgenic expression of <italic>CYP3</italic>-dsRNA, a 791 nt long dsRNA targeting the three fungal <italic>CYP51</italic> genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis, confers resistance to infection with <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. While these results provided proof-of-concept that RNAi-based plant protection is an effective strategy for controlling diseases caused by devastating necrotrophic pathogens, the broad applicability of this transgenic method remains questionable due to the persisting weak acceptance of GMO strategies for food and feed production in many countries. More important, a broad application of this transgenic approach is hampered by the lack of transformability of various crop plants and the missing genetic stability of the silencing trait. Here we investigate the potential and the mechanism of an RNAi-based crop protection strategy using direct spray applications of <italic>CYP3</italic>-dsRNA to target <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic>. We show that the 791 nt long dsRNA is taken up by the plant and transferred in an unmodified form via the vascular system to fungal infection sites where it is processed by the fungal RNAi machinery as a prerequisite for its antifungal activity. We show a strong correlation between accumulation of <italic>CYP3-</italic>dsRNA at infection sites, silencing of <italic>CYP51</italic> expression, and fungal inhibition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Spray-induced gene silencing (SIGS) of Fusarium genes</title><p>To provide a proof of concept, we conducted an experiment targeting the expression of the jellyfish <italic>green fluorescent protein</italic> (<italic>GFP</italic>) in the <italic>GFP</italic>-expressing <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> strain Fg-IFA65<sub>GFP</sub> [<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] by using a <italic>GFP</italic>-specific 720 nt long dsRNA (<italic>GFP</italic>-dsRNA, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005901.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).

For instance, diverging questions are possible involvement of the silencing machineries of host and/or the pathogen/pest, the requirement of local and remote transport of channeled dsRNA molecules, and the problem of dsRNA transport at the apoplast&#x02013;symplast interface.</p><p>Using the <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic>&#x02014;barley pathosystem as a model to study the mechanism of exogenously applied inhibitory dsRNA was motivated by the fact that Fusarium Head Blight and Crown Rot cause serious problems worldwide including food and feed safety issues due to mycotoxin contamination of cereals and maize. Focusing on fungal <italic>CYP51</italic> genes as targets for silencing was reasonable because our previous work provided proof-of-concept that transgene-mediated silencing of these genes effectively reduced fungal development in Arabidopsis and barley. More than that, direct treatment of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> with inhibitory dsRNA matching <italic>CYP51</italic> gene sequences had been demonstrated to inhibit fungal development in axenic cultures [<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The previous finding of impaired fungal growth in axenic cultures, when treated with a 791 nt dsRNA (<italic>CYP3</italic>-dsRNA) targeting the three fungal genes <italic>CYP51A</italic>, <italic>CYP51B</italic>, and <italic>CYP51C</italic>, let us speculate that the fungus can process <italic>CYP3</italic>-dsRNA into siRNA that interfere with the expression of <italic>CYP51</italic> genes. Gene annotation of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic>&#x02019;s genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org">http://www.broadinstitute.org</ext-link>) predicted genes coding for two ARGONAUTE-like proteins, two DICER-like proteins and five RNA-dependent RNA Polymerases (RDR), suggesting that the RNAi pathway is functional [<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Consistent with these findings, RNAseq analysis of axenically grown <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic>, treated with <italic>CYP3</italic>-dsRNA, showed high numbers of reads of <italic>CYP3</italic>-dsRNA-derived siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005901.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Together these data showed that <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> possesses a functional gene silencing system, which is a prerequisite for disease control by SIGS.</p><p>To test the antifungal activity of <italic>CYP3</italic>-dsRNA and their siRNA derivatives, we used a detached leaf assay that enabled us to assess fungal growth in local (directly sprayed) and distal (semi-systemic, non-sprayed) leaf segments. Using this approach, we could demonstrate that inhibitory dsRNA translocated via the plant vascular system and eventually was absorbed by the pathogen from leaf tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005901.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The profile of inhibitory dsRNA accumulation, as demonstrated by northern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005901.g004">Fig 4</xref>) and RNAseq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005901.g006">Fig 6</xref>), showed that both long <italic>CYP3-</italic>dsRNA and plant-processed <italic>CYP3</italic>-dsRNA-derived siRNA accumulate in the plant vascular system, though translocation of siRNA seems to be less efficient and thus siRNA concentration at the remote infection sites probably was not high enough to induced SIGS. Consistent with this notion, <italic>in planta</italic> produced <italic>CYP3</italic>-dsRNA-derived siRNAs was detected in the distal leaf parts only by the more sensitive RNAseq technique but not by northern analysis. Nevertheless, spraying high concentrations of <italic>CYP3</italic>-dsRNA-derived siRNA (20 ng &#x003bc;L<sup>-1</sup>) induced the SIGS process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005901.s007">S7 Fig</xref>), demonstrating that the fungus is able to absorb siRNAs from barley leaves.</p><p>Because of the less efficient movement of siRNAs, transport and translocation of the unprocessed 791 nt dsRNA has a critical role in the SIGS process, demonstrated by a compromised SIGS phenotype of the Fusarium mutant Fg-IFA65<sub>&#x00394;dcl-1</sub> at distal leaf segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005901.g007">Fig 7</xref>) but not at local, directly sprayed leaf segments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005901.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Compromised DICER activity resulted in the fungus inability to cleave <italic>CYP3</italic>-dsRNA into siRNA, thus interrupting the RNA interference mechanism in case the concentration of <italic>CYP3</italic>-dsRNA-derived siRNA is not sufficiently high. Our finding that the unprocessed long dsRNA could be absorbed from leaf tissue has further implications for future disease control strategies using dsRNA. There are good arguments that application of longer dsRNAs might be more efficient than application of siRNAs given there more efficient translocation. Long dsRNA would be processed into many different inhibitory siRNA by the fungus, which not least also could be an issue when considering the risk of compound resistance emerging in a pathogen under field test conditions. Thus, based on our findings, further research is required to establish rules for optimal dsRNA structures, considering e.g. molecule lengths, combinatorial order of gene fragments, target sites in a given gene target, and the number of genes targeted by one dsRNA. Supporting the requirement for more information as to the design of dsRNA probes, RNAseq analysis revealed that most of the <italic>CYP3</italic>-dsRNA-derived siRNAs, accumulating in the axenic fungal mycelium, were not equally distributed at the <italic>CYP3-</italic>dsRNA scaffold, but accumulated at the <italic>CYP51A</italic> gene fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005901.g007">Fig 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005901.s010">S2 Table</xref>). Further analysis is required to explain this bias in the production of siRNAs from <italic>CYP3</italic>-dsRNA.</p><p>Our results are also consistent with the view that inhibitory dsRNA is more effectively absorbed by the fungus through infection hyphae that have intimate contact to plant tissue (compare <italic>CYP51</italic> gene expression in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005901.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005901.g003">3</xref>). How these hyphae differ from the fungal germ tubes and extracellular hyphae is however yet unclear although distinct biochemical modifications of fungal hyphae that penetrate host plants and are involved in nutrient uptake have been demonstrated [<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Thus it is likely that these specialized, leaf tissue colonizing hyphae show dsRNA uptake that is superior over germ tubes.</p><p>Our data are consistent with reports showing that silencing signals in plants are mobile [<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The design of our experiments based on the previous finding that sRNAs, just as viroids [<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], preferably move via the vascular system in the source-to-sink direction although some reports discussed transport in the opposite route (for review see [<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). Source-to-sink movement is one reason why the phloem rather than the xylem is generally considered as the conduit for movement of the silencing signal. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the xylem sap, which transports water and ions, commonly is free of RNA [<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, spray application of dsRNA onto detached leaves cannot be compared with the situation in an intact leaf. Exogenously applied dsRNA first reached the apoplast, including the xylem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005901.g005">Fig 5</xref>), and subsequently translocated into the symplast by a yet unknown mechanism. Consistent with this, we could also demonstrate acropetal movement of the silencing signal that resulted in the inhibition of the fungus in distal not sprayed leaf areas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005901.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Apoplastic movement of RNA has been proposed, e.g. to explain how maternally expressed siRNAs could be transferred from the endosperm of developing seeds into the symplastically isolated embryo [<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Regardless of how target-specific inhibitory RNAs are applied&#x02013;by transgene delivery (HIGS) or spray (SIGS)&#x02013;the use of target-specific inhibitory RNAs to confer plant protection potentially is an alternative to conventional chemicals because they are i) highly specific and solely depending on their nucleotide sequence and ii) can be developed against an unlimited range of pathogens provided that the RNAi machinery is in place. Given the accumulation of dsRNA in the plant phloem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005901.g005">Fig 5</xref>), sucking insects also are realistic SIGS targets as their efficient control by HIGS has been largely demonstrated [<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Certainly, many questions have to be addressed in the future to eventually judge the agronomical potential of SIGS, including the costs of RNA applications and their stability under field conditions. Hence, more research is required to develop application strategies, including improved uptake by compound design and use of chemical formulations. Another yet unassessed issue is the risk that microbial strains become insensitive to a commercial dsRNA product. Such scenario could probably be resolved by application of dsRNA mixtures that target different regions in one gene or even different genes. Moreover, a commercial dsRNA product should be designed not to have off-target effects in other organisms that might be relevant in the respective agroecosystem, including beneficial fungi and bacteria. In this respect, it is important to understand that both plants [<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and fungi [<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] support the production of secondary siRNAs, meaning there is a potential for transitivity and amplification. It is therefore possible that low abundance inhibitory dsRNA sprayed onto the plant triggered a large silencing effect in Fusarium via these secondary RNAs. Importantly, when considering the regulatory issue of RNA-based plant protection it is crucial to emphasize that the principles of SIGS and HIGS rely on the mechanisms found for trans-kingdom communication in mutualistic and parasitic interactions, and thus is a natural phenomenon [<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005901.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Apart from the dsRNAs prospects in future plant protection strategies, there is an additional technological potential in developing new pesticides. The simple phenotyping adopted by the SIGS screens renders them a powerful tool for genetic studies to assess compound targets with high efficiency and low costs. Thus, the present data provide essential scientific information on a fundamentally new plant protection strategy, thereby opening novel avenues for improving crop yields in an environmentally friendly and sustainable manner.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Plant and fungal materials</title><p>The spring barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>) cultivar (cv.)
