Of the approximately 110 Vanilla species (Orchidaceae, monocot) that have been identified, only two are important in terms of commerce and cultivation; <italic>Vanilla planifolia</italic> Andrews and <italic>V. tahitensis</italic> JW Moore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Among these, <italic>V. planifolia</italic> is the most valued for its flavor qualities and is therefore widely cultivated and used for the production of food additives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The fully-grown mature fruits of vanilla, also called beans or pods, develop characteristic aromatic properties by the process of curing. The cured beans are referred to as vanilla [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and the major flavor compound is vanillin (3-methoxy, 4-hydroxy-benzaldehyde).</p><p>In spite of its economic importance, there is little genetic diversity and few genetic or genomic resources in <italic>V. planifolia.</italic> The flavor industry generally disfavors genetically modified crops, so there have been virtually no attempts to modify the quantity or quality of the flavor of the vanilla bean through biotechnological approaches. Nevertheless, a better understanding of the genetic complement of <italic>V. planifolia</italic> could provide information on the still-disputed biosynthetic route to vanillin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], support mechanistic studies on other areas of the novel biochemistry of this species, such as the biosynthesis of novel seed coat lignins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and provide molecular markers to advance non-transgenic breeding programs targeting flavor quality, yield or disease resistance.</p><p>The chromosome number for <italic>V. planifolia</italic> has been reported as 2n&#x02009;=&#x02009;32. Most <italic>V. planifolia</italic> accessions are considered to be diploid with a 2C-value of 5.03&#x000a0;pg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], but due to the large size and complexity of the <italic>V. planifolia</italic> genome, limited sequence resources are currently available.</p><p>The rapid development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has enabled the efficient and economical high-throughput sequencing of entire genomes or transcriptomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. NGS systems are typically represented by Roche&#x02019;s 454 GS FLX and Illumina/Solexa Genome Analyzer. In general, Roche&#x02019;s sequencing technology produces long reads and is advantageous for assembly of sequences into longer contigs; however, the number of reads generated in each run is lower than that of other platforms and not enough to reach deep coverage for low-abundance genes. The Illumina technology provides a high number of reads for deeper coverage, which is beneficial for gene discovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Although its short read length limits de novo contig assembly efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], various strategies, algorithms and software have been developed for short-read assembly, especially for de novo assembly in the absence of a reference genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Using the above technologies, we have generated very large gene sequence datasets from vanilla pods at different times of development, and representing different tissue types, including the seeds, hairs, and placental and mesocarp tissues within the pod. Based on previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], this developmental series was chosen as reflecting the times of synthesis and accumulation of vanillin and catechyl lignin in the pod and seed, respectively. The annotated sequence data provide a foundation for understanding multiple aspects of the biochemistry and development of the vanilla bean, as exemplified by the identification of candidate genes involved in lignin biosynthesis and interrogation of their expression patterns in the developing pod and seed in relation to the accumulation of the C-lignin polymer in the seed coat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Biochemistry of greenhouse-grown vanilla beans</title><p>To determine if the green vanilla beans obtained from greenhouse-grown material retain the biosynthetic capabilities of plants grown in nature, we measured the vanillin content of the greenhouse grown vanilla bean. Without acid hydrolysis, only a very low amount of vanillin could be detected in the green beans. After acid hydrolysis, 0.53&#x000a0;g of vanillin per100g fresh green bean was measured in the six-month old vanilla beans, indicating that the beans used in this study maintain the biosynthetic capability of naturally-grown beans as regards glucovanillin accumulation. The ability of greenhouse-grown plants to accumulate C-lignin in the seed coats has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Next generation sequencing and assembly of reads</title><p>To obtain an overview of <italic>V. planifolia</italic> gene expression profiles in different organs at different developmental stages, RNA was extracted and cDNA prepared from 26 different tissue samples.

For the Illumina sequences, purity filtered reads ranged from 0.69 to 1.8 million reads per sample and the percentage of preserved reads ranged from 82.4% to 97.4%. Pooling of the Roche 454 sequencing runs resulted in 1,678,293 qualified reads with an average length of 397 bases after filtering and trimming (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Vanilla pod tissue samples for RNA isolation.

Velvet currently takes short reads, removes errors, and then produces high quality unique contigs. Oases uploads a preliminary assembly produced by Velvet, and then clusters the contigs into small groups, called loci. It then exploits the paired-end read and long read information, when available, to construct transcript isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Using these approaches, transcripts per library ranged from 44,403 to 94,637 with mean transcript length ranging from 1,694 to 2,159&#x000a0;bp (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). To demonstrate the quality of assembled transcripts, the size distribution of four selected samples is shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>.</p><p>An often used combination of current sequencing technologies is to mix de-novo 454 assembly and Illumina mapping assemblies; the 454 approach allows the building of long contigs, and the Illumina approach reduces problematic 454-generated homopolymer sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, to produce high quality vanilla transcripts, we employed an optimized two-step strategy. First, a combined assembly of all 26 Illumina samples (3,439,193,362 reads total) was produced using Velvet 1.2.03 with 27&#x000a0;k-mer length, producing 6,371,646 contig sequences. Then, Illumina contigs and qualified 454 reads were assembled together with MIRA 3.2.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This resulted in a total of 301,459 contigs which were considered as vanilla-expressed transcripts for further annotation and analysis. The size distribution of the total 301,459 contigs is shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The contig N50 is the length of the smallest contig in the set that contains the largest contigs whose combined length represents at least 50% of the contig assembly; this parameter is generally used as a standard metric for assembly size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Here size distribution at N50 was 1960&#x000a0;bp in length and average contig size was 1256&#x000a0;bp. All short reads obtained in this study have been submitted to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) [BioProject: PRJNA253813].

This consisted of 372&#x000a0;M bases of short 454 reads generated by the University of Copenhagen and deposited at [NCBI: SRX286672]. The combined assembled transcripts were mapped using Blast, and the results showed excellent consistency between the 454 reads in the public domain and the vanilla transcripts generated in this project. A total of 96.6% of the 454 reads from [NCBI: SRX286672] were able to be mapped back to 82,595 combined assembled transcripts. For further quality control analysis, we randomly selected 35 contigs and designed primers for RT-PCR amplification. In this analysis, 32 out of the 35 primer sets successfully resulted in a band of the expected size (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>), and the identities of all the resulting cloned sequences were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Mapping of transcripts to reference databases</title><p>The 301,459 vanilla transcripts were compared to five reference databases (the non-redundant (NR) NCBI database; the Conserved Domains Database (CDD); and the Arabidopsis, rice, and sorghum proteomes) using BlastX with a cut-off E-value of 1E-5. Using this approach, over 52% of all vanilla transcripts (157,191 transcripts) returned an above cut-off BLAST result in at least one of these five reference databases (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>). The homology search against NR resulted in 130,550 annotated genes. Seventy eight thousand and ninety three genes were identified as encoding proteins with conserved domains, while 113,857 genes, 127,510 genes and 143894 genes were identified as encoding proteins homologous to proteins in the Arabidopsis, rice and sorghum proteomes, respectively.

Furthermore, 37,538 transcripts showed above 10 RPKM value in at least one tissue or organ, and 2,156 transcripts were above 100 RPKM value in at least one tissue or organ.</p><p>The coefficient of variance (CV) reflects the variance of gene expression levels in each library. The coefficient of variance ranged from 0 to 496% for expressed genes, with an average of 60% (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). To identify a set of constitutively expressed genes, we applied several filters, including a CV of &#x0003c;40%, transcript level of &#x0003e;100 in at least one library, and a transcript ratio &#x0003c;4 when comparing the highest transcript level in any library with the lowest level in any library for a given gene. A set of 154 genes was identified as encoding transcripts that changed little during development, and 131 genes in the set were annotated with functions. Amongst these genes are homologs of common housekeeping genes, such as genes for ubiquitin (Ubi), actin and actin-like protein. Other potential reference genes include genes encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), HSP90 and ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. These stably expressed genes, listed in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>, can serve as reference genes for normalizing transcript levels of other vanilla genes prior to comparative gene expression analysis, as commonly used in gene expression atlas studies in other species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>

Overall, PCC values ranged from 0.099 (leaves vs. 10-week seed) to 0.96 (5-month mesophyll vs. 6-month mesophyll). As expected, transcript profiles in seed tissues from 6&#x000a0;weeks to 3&#x000a0;months were poorly correlated with transcript profiles in other tissues (PCC &#x0003c;0.50) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

These subsets of organ-specific genes will be a useful tool for research into biological processes during Vanilla pod development.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Identification of genes potentially involved in lignin and vanillin biosynthesis</title><p>Lignin is a phenylpropanoid polymer commonly found in terrestrial plant secondary cell walls. Lignin is assembled by oxidative polymerization of three major monolignols, <italic>p</italic>-hydroxycinnamyl alcohol (H unit), coniferyl alcohol (guaiacyl or G unit) and sinapyl alcohol (S unit). However, during the early stages of seed development in <italic>V. planifolia</italic>, a newly discovered polymer (C-lignin) is deposited to high concentrations in the seed coat. This lignin is naturally synthesized from the unusual monolignol caffeyl alcohol, whereas lignin in the vegetative tissues of <italic>V. planifolia</italic> is of the normal guaiacyl/syringyl (G/S) type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. To address potential pathways of C-lignin biosynthesis, we used annotated lignin pathway genes in Arabidopsis as query sequences (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A), searched by BlastX with the threshold as E-value &#x0003c;1E-5, and searched against the NCBI NR, GO and KEGG databases with the annotation of lignin pathway. Finally, 233 Vanilla genes were identified as homologous to genes potentially involved in the monolignol pathway (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">14</xref>). These included genes encoding phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL; 35 contigs), coumaroyl shikimate 3&#x02032;-hydroxylase (C3&#x02032;H; 5 contigs), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H; 14 contigs), 4-coumarate: CoA ligase (4CL; 41 contigs), cinnamoyl CoA reductase (CCR; 26 contigs), hydroxycinnamoyl CoA:shikimate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HCT; 9 contigs), caffeoyl-CoA 3-<italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT; 7 contigs), caffeic acid 3-<italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase (COMT; 1 contigs; characterized in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]), and caffeoyl-CoA <italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase-like (named as OMT-4 and OMT-5; 8 contigs; characterized in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]), cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD; 23 contigs), caffeoyl shikimate esterase (CSE; 64 contigs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>

This pattern was observed for most of the contigs representing each gene. However, although CAD transcripts were, overall, found at highest level in developing seeds, some CAD contigs were more highly expressed in the light mesocarp tissue. More strikingly, CCoAOMT transcripts were virtually absent from developing seeds, in spite of the high expression level of the other lignin biosynthetic genes. These digital expression patterns were confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of selected contigs corresponding to PAL, 4CL, CCR, CAD, C4H and CCoAOMT in early developmental stages of seeds as well as in stems. The sequences of the primers used for RT-PCR are given in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM15" ref-type="media">15</xref>. Consistent with the digital expression database, PAL, 4CL, CCR, CAD and C4H displayed very high transcript levels in 8&#x000a0;week seeds and relatively high levels in 10&#x000a0;week seeds, while low transcript levels in dark and light mesocarp tissues. In contrast, CCoAOMT transcripts were detected in dark and light mesocarp tissues, but barely in seed tissues (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). The low level of CCoAOMT transcripts is likely the biochemical basis for the production of the novel non-methylated C-lignin in the vanilla seed coats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This result is consistent with our earlier finding of low OMT enzyme activities in the C-lignin containing seed coat of <italic>Cleome hassleriana</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. It is currently not clear how the low expression of the <italic>O</italic>-methyltransferases is regulated in vanilla seeds.

The combined 454/Illumina RNA-seq platforms provide both deep sequence coverage and high quality de novo transcriptome assembly for this non-model crop species. The annotated sequence data provide a foundation for understanding multiple aspects of the biochemistry and development of the vanilla bean, as exemplified by the identification of candidate genes involved in an unusual lignin biosynthesis pathway in vanilla seed. Our transcriptome data indicate that C-lignin formation in the seed coat involves coordinate expression of monolignol biosynthetic genes with the exception of those encoding the caffeoyl coenzyme A 3-<italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase for conversion of caffeoyl to feruloyl moieties. This database provides a general resource for further studies on this important flavor species.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Plant materials and RNA isolation</title><p>Vanilla (<italic>Vanilla planifolia</italic>) vines were grown in the greenhouse in MetroMix 350 soil mix at 20&#x02013;23&#x000b0;C (24&#x02013;28&#x000b0;C in summer) with 45-60% relative humidity with a 16&#x000a0;h&#x000a0;day from 6:00&#x000a0;h to 22:00&#x000a0;h, 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/m<sup>2</sup>/s light intensity, facilitated by supplementary lighting. Plants were watered daily with weekly addition of Scotts peat-lite 20-10-20 fertilizer at 100&#x000a0;ppm&#x000a0;N. The flowers were hand pollinated in March and April of 2011. Green vanilla beans were harvested periodically after pollination. The selected 26 different tissue samples varied from early stages of pod development (seed, placental laminae (&#x0201c;light&#x0201d; for short) and mesocarp (&#x0201c;dark&#x0201d; for short) tissues at 6 , 8 and 10&#x000a0;weeks post-pollination), mature pods (seed, V-shaped hair cells (&#x0201c;hair&#x0201d; for short), placental laminae, and mesocarp tissues at 3, 5 and 6&#x000a0;months post-pollination), leaf and stem from mature plants harvested at 6&#x000a0;months and 1&#x000a0;year post-pollination of the flowers, and aerial roots harvested from one year old stems. Before tissue separation, the beans were cut into 2&#x000a0;cm sections to facilitate the isolation of seeds from mesocarp and placental tissue. At the later stages (after 3&#x000a0;months), the hair cells were also isolated from the placentae cells.
