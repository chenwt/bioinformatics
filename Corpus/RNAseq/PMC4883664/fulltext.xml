The initial induction of Tfh cell properties occurs within the first few days following activation by antigen recognition on dendritic cells (DCs), though how DCs promote this cell-fate decision is not fully understood<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Moreover, although Tfh cells are uniquely defined by expression of the follicle-homing receptor CXCR5<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, the guidance receptor promoting the earlier localization of activated T cells at the B cell follicle&#x02013;T zone interface has been unclear<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Here we show that the G-protein coupled receptor EBI2 (GPR183) and its ligand 7&#x003b1;,25-dihydroxycholesterol (7&#x003b1;,25-OHC) mediate positioning of activated CD4 T cells at the follicle&#x02013;T zone interface. In this location they interact with activated DCs and are exposed to Tfh cell-promoting ICOS ligand.

We demonstrate that activated DCs in the outer T zone further augment Tfh cell differentiation by producing membrane and soluble forms of CD25, the IL2 receptor &#x003b1; chain, and quenching T cell-derived IL2. Mice lacking EBI2 in T cells or CD25 in DCs have reduced Tfh cells and mount defective T cell-dependent plasma cell and GC responses. These findings demonstrate that distinct niches within the lymphoid organ T zone support distinct cell fate decisions, and they establish a function for DC-derived CD25 in controlling IL2 availability and T cell differentiation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">EBI2 is expressed by CD4 T cells<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, but whether it has a role in positioning T cells during the early stages of activation has been unclear. Using an ovalbumin (OVA) specific TCR transgenic (OTII) system involving transfer of OTII T cells to wild-type (WT) hosts, we found that EBI2 was upregulated on cognate splenic T cells within 12 hours of immunization with a particulate form of OVA (sheep red blood cell (SRBC) conjugated), and it remained high at day 2 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). Similar EBI2 induction occurred following immunization with OVA in LPS, on lymph node (LN) T cells after immunization with OVA in alum, and <italic>in vitro</italic> following T cell activation by anti-CD3 and -CD28 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1b&#x02013;e</xref>). Migration to 7&#x003b1;,25-OHC was augmented at these time points (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1f</xref>). Analysis of spleen sections showed that transferred WT T cells accumulated in the outer T zone at 12 hours and day 1 of the SRBC-OVA response and the cells remained enriched in this location at day 2 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). EBI2 knockout (KO) T cells, by contrast, failed to accumulate in the outer T zone at either time point and instead remained dispersed throughout the T zone (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Quantitative analysis using a mixed transfer system confirmed that the activated EBI2 KO cells had less access than control cells to the outer T zone (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1g</xref>). Similar findings were made at day 2 after immunization with OVA-expressing <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) and with OVA in LPS (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1h</xref>). WT OTII T cells also moved to the B&#x02013;T zone interface in LNs following immunization with alum-OVA, but EBI2-deficient T cells failed to relocalize (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1i</xref>). Activated T cell positioning in the outer T zone was directed by 7&#x003b1;,25-OHC as it was dependent on the enzymes needed for its synthesis (Cyp7b1 and Ch25h) and catabolism (Hsd3b7) (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1j</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Flow cytometric analysis for the early activation marker, CD69, showed that co-transferred EBI2 KO and WT T cells were comparably activated at day 2 of the SRBC-OVA response (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) indicating similar initial exposure to cognate MHC class II-peptide complexes. Upregulation of the costimulatory molecules ICOS and OX40 also occurred to an equivalent extent (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). Proliferation began by day 2 and at this time point the WT and EBI2 KO cells responded similarly (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b, c</xref>). However, by day 3, the EBI2-deficient cells were undergoing less proliferation and their numbers increased more slowly (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b, c</xref>). This was not due to a direct effect of 7&#x003b1;,25-OHC on T cell proliferation (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2b, c</xref>). Tracking of differentiation markers on the <italic>in vivo</italic> activated T cells revealed that EBI2 KO cells were compromised in their induction of a Tfh cell phenotype, as assessed by CXCR5, PD-1 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d, e</xref>), Bcl6, and <italic>Il21</italic> expression (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2d&#x02013;f</xref>). EBI2-deficient OTII T cells also differentiated less efficiently into Tfh cells in LNs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). We also observed reduced Tfh cell responses to <italic>Listeria</italic>-OVA, reduced polyclonal EBI2 KO Tfh cell responses to SRBCs, and reduced GC and plasma cell responses to these antigens (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Information</xref> and <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3a&#x02013;j</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Tfh cell differentiation is promoted by interaction with both DCs and B cells, and time course studies indicate that DCs are critical early while B cells play a later role<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Consistent with these requirements, WT OTII T cells showed a partial reduction in Tfh cell differentiation at day 3 of the response in MD4 Ig-transgenic mice that lack cognate B cells capable of OVA antigen presentation to OTII T cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Importantly, however, EBI2 KO OTII T cells formed less Tfh cells than WT OTII T cells in the MD4 recipients, indicating that T cell EBI2 expression augmented Tfh cell development at early time points in a B cell independent manner. Similar observations were made in B cell-deficient &#x003bc;MT mice (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>). These findings led us to test whether EBI2 was required in T cells for some type of interaction with DCs. Ablation of DCs using Zbtb46-DTR mice<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> caused a complete block in Tfh cell generation (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4b, c</xref>), consistent with previous studies using other DC ablation approaches<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Splenic CD4 and DCIR2 co-expressing DCs relocalize from bridging channels to the outer T zone within 6 hours of immunization with SRBCs<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, and the cells remain in this region for at least 2 days (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4d</xref>). At 12 hour, day 1 and day 2 time points, almost the entire population of activated WT OTII T cells colocalized with the activated DCIR2<sup>+</sup> DCs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b, c</xref> and <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4e</xref>). By contrast, activated EBI2 KO T cells were broadly distributed and only partially overlapped with the DCIR2<sup>+</sup> DCs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b, c</xref> and <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4e</xref>). Using mice with deficiencies in DCs we established that CD4<sup>+</sup> but not CD8<sup>+</sup> DCs were important for Tfh cell induction by SRBC-OVA (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Information</xref> and <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4f&#x02013;k</xref>).</p><p id="P5">ICOS signaling is important for Tfh cell differentiation<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and splenic DCs upregulated ICOSL mRNA following activation by SRBCs, with the extent of upregulation being greater in CD4<sup>+</sup> than CD8<sup>+</sup> DCs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). However, flow cytometric analysis showed 12 hour activated CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs had low surface ICOSL staining (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref> and <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4l</xref>). Since ICOSL undergoes rapid ectodomain shedding following ICOS engagement<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, we considered the possibility that surface levels were reduced due to interactions with ICOS-high activated T cells. Consistent with this idea, when SRBC-immunized mice were also treated with an ICOS blocking antibody to prevent ICOS-induced ICOSL shedding<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup> but not CD8<sup>+</sup> DCs showed increased ICOSL surface abundance compared to unimmunized mice (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref> and <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4l</xref>). We took advantage of the sensitivity of ICOSL to ICOS-induced shedding as a method to measure the amount of interaction between DCs and cognate T cells. Twelve hours following SRBC-OVA immunization, ICOSL levels were higher on CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs in mice harboring EBI2-deficient OTII T cells than WT OTII T cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). These data suggest that the reduced Tfh differentiation of EBI2 KO OTII T cells occurs at least in part due to lower ICOS engagement with ICOSL on CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs. However, in mice treated with an ICOS blocking antibody, though Tfh differentiation of control OTII T cells was reduced, EBI2-deficient OTII T cells were still more defective (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>), indicating an ICOS independent influence of EBI2 in augmenting Tfh cell fate. An assessment of mRNA levels of other factors established to have an effect on Tfh differentiation (IL6, TGF&#x003b2;) showed that they were similarly expressed in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> DCs and they were therefore not considered likely factors accounting for the EBI2-dependence of Tfh cell differentiation (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4n</xref>).</p><p id="P6">To search for surface or secreted DC-derived factors that might augment Tfh cell differentiation we performed RNAseq analysis on CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs from the spleens of saline or SRBC immunized mice. This analysis revealed CD25, the high affinity IL2 receptor &#x003b1;-chain, as one of the most strongly induced genes in SRBC-activated DCs (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). CD25 mRNA induction occurred rapidly after immunization and remained elevated for at least 2 days (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>) and many CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs were surface positive for CD25 over this time frame (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). CD8<sup>+</sup> DCs showed little induction of CD25 mRNA or protein under these immunization conditions (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a, b</xref>). Analysis of LN DCs following OVA plus alum immunization revealed upregulation of CD25 on migratory CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs at day 1 and 2 (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>). Staining of spleen sections identified CD25<sup>+</sup> cells in the unstimulated T zone that are likely CD25<sup>hi</sup> regulatory T cells, but also showed broad induction of CD25 in the outer T zone within 12 hours of SRBC immunization in a pattern resembling the DCIR2<sup>+</sup> DC distribution (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Similar appearance of CD25 staining in the T zone was seen in T cell-deficient mice, providing evidence that expression by activated DCs was being detected (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>). CD25 needs to associate with CD122 (IL2R&#x003b2;) and IL2R&#x003b3; to transmit signals in response to IL2<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Despite expression of CD25, activated CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs showed minimal CD122 mRNA and protein expression and they did not respond to IL2 as assessed by intracellular pSTAT5 staining (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5d&#x02013;f</xref>). These data led us to consider the possibility that activated DCs express CD25 to alter IL2 availability in the outer T zone.</p><p id="P7">IL2 has pleiotropic roles in directing T cell fate and this includes a negative influence on Tfh cell differentiation<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Despite equivalent IL2 production and receptor expression (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Information</xref> and <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5g&#x02013;i</xref>), EBI2 KO T cells showed more IL2R signaling than WT T cells at day 1 after immunization as evidenced by higher pSTAT5 levels (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>), suggesting that the EBI2 KO T cells were being exposed to more IL2. The elevated induction of pSTAT5 in EBI2 KO T cells was also seen in LNs following immunization with alum-OVA (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). Blimp1, encoded by <italic>Prdm1</italic>, is induced by IL2 and negatively regulates expression of Bcl6, a factor essential for Tfh cell development<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. In agreement with higher IL2 exposure, the EBI2 KO T cells showed greater <italic>Prdm1</italic> expression at day 3 (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5j</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The above findings led us to test whether DCs antagonize IL2 availability to activated T cells in the outer T zone. Consistent with this possibility, when <italic>in vivo</italic> activated DCs were incubated briefly <italic>in vitro</italic> they were found to release soluble CD25 (sCD25) into the culture supernatant (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). DC production of sCD25 was not dependent on interaction with T cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). Analysis of spleen tissue extracts showed elevated sCD25 production at 6 hours after SRBC immunization and this was maintained at 24 hours (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>) and occurred in a T cell-independent and DC-dependent manner (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h</xref>). To determine whether the sCD25 functioned as an IL2 antagonist, supernatants from cultures of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs were tested in a bioassay for their ability to inhibit IL2R signaling. Regulatory T cells were used as the reporter cells in this bioassay since they were more sensitive to low dose IL2 than Tfh cells (unpubl. obs.). Supernatants from cultured SRBC-activated WT but not CD25 KO CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs were able to antagonize IL2R signaling in T cells (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5l</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To determine whether DCs were regulating T cell differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic> by production of CD25 we generated BM chimeric mice that lacked CD25 in DCs (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Information</xref> and <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figs. 6a&#x02013;e</xref>). In these recipients, control (EBI2 Het) OTII T cells were compromised in their ability to take on a Tfh cell fate whereas EBI2 KO T cells were only mildly affected (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i</xref>). Staining of tissue sections from the DT-treated BM chimeras established that the high CD25 abundance in the outer T zone was dependent on CD25 expression by DCs (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6f</xref>). Splenic Tfh cell responses to <italic>Listeria-OVA</italic> and LN Tfh cell responses to alum-OVA were also diminished in mice lacking CD25 on DCs (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6g, h</xref>). Moreover, mice lacking CD25 in DCs and harboring transgenic B cells specific for hen egg lysozyme (HEL) mounted reduced plasma cell and GC responses to HEL-conjugated SRBCs (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4j</xref> and <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6i, j</xref>) and this was associated with reduced serum anti-HEL IgG1 and IgG2b antibody levels (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4k</xref>). To further test whether reduced exposure of EBI2 KO T cells to sCD25 could account for the defective Tfh cell induction, we treated mice with recombinant sCD25 at day 0 and 1 of the OTII T cell response to SRBC-OVA. This treatment was sufficient to elevate sCD25 levels in tissue extracts (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6k</xref>), to antagonize pSTAT5 over-induction in the EBI2 KO T cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4l</xref>) and to partially rescue Tfh cell differentiation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4m</xref>). A full restoration of the Tfh response was not expected given that EBI2-deficient cells are also compromised in accessing ICOSL and possibly other Tfh cell-promoting signals from cells in the outer T zone.</p><p id="P10">This work establishes a role for EBI2 and 7&#x003b1;,25-OHC in positioning of activated T cells at the follicle-T zone interface, promoting contact with Tfh cell-priming ICOSL<sup>hi</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> DCs (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Information</xref> and <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>). Given that interactions with both DCs and B cells are important for full Tfh cell differentiation<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, we suggest that T cell EBI2 upregulation initially acts to favor interaction with Tfh cell-promoting DCs and subsequently with activated B cells.

Mixed BM chimeras were made by mixing equal amounts of the two types of BM prior to transfer. The sample sizes were guided by previous studies in our laboratory. No animals were excluded from analysis, and sample size estimates were not used. The mouse genotype was not blinded from the investigator. Mice of a given genotype were randomly assigned to groups. However, littermate mice were evenly distributed into control or treatment groups and mice of both groups were co-caged whenever possible. In experiments involving transfers of OTII T cells, since the TCR transgene is on the Y chromosome, male mice were used as donors and recipients. In other experiments, similar numbers of male and female mice were used. All mice were adult and were studied between 7 and 20 weeks of age. Animals were housed in a specific-pathogen free environment in the Laboratory Animal Research Center at the University of California, San Francisco, and all experiments conformed to ethical principles and guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Adoptive transfer, immunizations, DC ablation and treatments</title><p id="P12">For analysis of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell position, activation or Tfh cell differentiation in spleens, 1&#x02013;5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> WT and/or EBI2 KO OTII cells were adoptively transferred into mice.

EBI2 guides cells to the 7&#x003b1;,25-OHC high outer T zone and in this location they interact with activated DCs producing membrane and shed CD25 that binds and quenches IL2. This limits IL2R signaling on the T cell via pSTAT5 and allows induction of Bcl6 by other inputs such as ICOSL. T cells that lack EBI2 or remain in the inner T zone for other reasons are exposed to autocrine IL2 and this induces Blimp1, a repressor of Bcl6<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, disfavoring the Tfh cell fate.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms773750f11"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S14"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>supp_info</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS773750-supplement-supp_info.docx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e1417" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S15"><p>We thank Chris Allen, Mark Ansel, Tony Defranco, Markus Muschen, and Shomyseh Sanjabi for mice, Jinping An for expert help with the mouse colony, Ying Xu for help with quantitative PCR, and Abul Abbas and Michael Barnes for comments on the manuscript.
