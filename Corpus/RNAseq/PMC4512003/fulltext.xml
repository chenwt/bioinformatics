Previous studies have shown that the presence of G rich sequences and
motifs may be significant for gene activity and function. We decided to focus our interest to identify G rich motifs in promoters of
oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. We used a set of 100 most common oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (TSG) for this
analysis. We collected 600nt long promoters with -500 and +100 TSS (transcription start site) from the oncogenes and TSG set.
Using a computer program, we calculated the G densities using numbers and locations of G forms with 100nt moving widow. We
included G numbers from 2 to 7 guanines. Analysis shows that G density increases from -500 to +100 and more from TSS. G density
is found to be maximum within -/+100 of TSS. The results of G densities were compared with the expression data of the selected
oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in patients with colon cancer (n=174).</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>The guanine rich region is a relatively unexplored part of the
human genome. Although there are some algorithms to detect
special motifs, such as G quadruplex, the algorithms to detect
other types of G rich motifs do not exist. It was first reported in
1910 that guanylic acid forms a gel at high concentrations 
[<xref rid="R01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].
Therefore, it is suggested that G-rich sequences may form some
other structures. About 50 years later, Gellert used X-ray
diffraction to display that guanylic acids can accumulate into
tetrameric structures [<xref rid="R01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The presence of G-rich sequences is
found in functional regions of many genomes. For example, Grich
regions have the potential to form G4 structures which
locate telomeres, promoters, mitotic and meiotic double-strand
break (DSB) sites [<xref rid="R02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Naturally occurring &#x02018;G&#x02019; rich sequences,
via non-Watson-Crick base pairing capable of forming Gquadruplexes
and stabilized by cyclic Hoogsteen hydrogen
bonding, have been implicated in some different genomic
activities such as: transcription pausing, FMRP binding, mRNA
stability, translation initiation as well as repression 
[<xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Although the G-quadruplex (G4) motif has been analyzed as a
non-B-form DNA secondary structure, there may be some
others which have not been given nomenclature yet 
[<xref rid="R04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It is
already known that G-quadruplex is involved in different
human cancers [<xref rid="R05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
<xref rid="R06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="R01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="R07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Thus G-quadruplexes may be targeted
for therapeutic purposes [<xref rid="R05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
<xref rid="R06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="R01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="R07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. DNA folding properties allow
it to make various inter- and intramolecular secondary
structures. Although the structures seem in vitro artefacts,
bioinformatics reveals that DNA sequences capable of forming
such structures which are conserved [<xref rid="R02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>It is known that there are some types of guanine rich regions
and motifs. Z-DNA motifs are mostly related to transcriptional
start sites in eukaryotic genomes [<xref rid="R08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Cruciform structures are
located close to replication origins, breakpoint junctions and
promoters in various organisms. Triplexes cause genomic
instability by breaking double-strand that result in
translocations [<xref rid="R09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The repeated expansion may relate to human
genetic disorders [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. G4 structures present different 
topologies and are separated into various groups depending on
the orientation of the DNA sequences. It is unclear how many
G-rich sequences form stable G4 structures in vivo, but G4
DNA motifs are common in G-rich micro and minisatellites, up
and downstream of TSSs, often near promoters, transcription
factor binding sites, and mitotic and meiotic DSB sites 
[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Telomerase activity in most human cancers can be
influenced by G4, because different small ligands target the
regions and bind, as has been tested in different experiments
[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. G4 motifs are most likely found within 1,000 nt upstream
of the TSS in 50% of human genes [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Special Bioinformatics
algorithms find that the promoters of human oncogenes and
regulatory genes have G4 motifs more than in the promoters of
housekeeping and tumor suppressor genes [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. G-rich
sequences or G4 may cause supercoiling in the structures are in
or near promoter regions, which can have both positive and
negative effects on transcription. First, the location of the G
motif is a very powerful factor for transcription.</p><p>Approximately ~ 400,000 presumed G4 motifs are found in the
human genome. The motifs are frequently located within the
promoter regions of oncogenes, assuming that G4 motifs may
act in a key role for regulation of different cellular activities
such as transcription, translation, telomere maintenance, and
replication [<xref rid="R02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The G4 motif importance in the regulation of
gene transcription came from v-myc viral studies, oncogene
homolog (MYC), the transcription factor regulates the
expression of different genes which are altered in human
cancer, is a non-regulated in around half of the tumors 
[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].
Guanine-rich nucleic acid sequences which form G-quadruplex
structures are key regulators of some biological processes and
are targeted for therapeutic medicine such as Quarfloxin, a
fluoroquinolone [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Guanine numbers and densities are very distinctive parts of the
genome. The aim of this study is to find repeating G motifs
consisting of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 guanines in the promoter
sequence of selected genes important for carcinogenesis (50
tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes). Previous studies have
analyzed G quadruplexed for oncogenes, but not other types of
motifs and genes like tumor suppressor genes [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, in
this paper the promoter sequences of oncogenes and tumor
suppressor genes (TSG) are the candidates for finding G-type
densities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>Data types</italic>:</title><p>Three different databases have been used, including Genecards,
EPD (Eukaryotic Promoter Database), and TCGA (The Cancer
Genome Atlas). The workflow has been described as a flow
chart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The names of the oncogenes and tumor
suppressor genes (TSG) most related to colon cancer are taken
from Genecards [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Fifty oncogenes and fifty TSGs are
selected from Genecards for each group. According to the
chosen oncogenes and TSGs, promoter sequences are
downloaded from EPD [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The genes&#x005f3; promoter sequences
consist of 600 nucleotides, -500 before Transcription Start Site,
(TSS), and +100 after the Transcription Start Site. The database,
EPD, which promoter sequences are downloaded has supplied
the promoter sequence 500 before TSS and 100 after TSS 
[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].
The cancer genomic data portal is TCGA [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] from which 174
colon cancer patients with gene expression Level 3 and the 46
control data are downloaded on 01/02/2015.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title><italic>Guanine density detection</italic>:</title><p>The guanine nucleotide number is reported in other studies,
especially in genomic locations such as, telomere, promoter,
exon and intron [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. G types including GG, GGG, GGGG,
GGGGG, GGGGGG, GGGGGGG, have been produced to detect
guanine density (GD) in the promoter sequences [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For each
promoter sequence, GD is detected by a computational
program which was created for this study. The program
searches GD types of the sequences between -500 to +100 in a
100 nucleotide group for both oncogenes and TSG in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>.
According to the guanine density of each group, oncogenes and
TSG promoter sequence profiles are characterized and listed
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table 1</xref> (see supplementary material).</p><p>Our results indicate that the oncogenes and TSG G profiles
present increasingly high density between -100 to 0, where they
achieved maximum density after Transcription Start Site (TSS)
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table 1</xref> &#x00026; 
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table 2</xref>, respectively). The G types, G2, G3, G4, G5,
G6, G7, show increasing order and reach the maximum level
after TSS, 0 to +100. The G-types show diverse density in
different groups of the promoter sequences. Especially, G2, G3,
G4, G5 types are detected more than other types. In addition to
that, in the -100 to 0 locations of the sequence, the G6 types
appear 8 times in both oncogenes and TSG, which is especially
rare. G2 is the most commonly found type and followed G3, G4
and G5 in the all small groups. Unexpectedly, G7 type is found
2 times between -200 to -100 in both promoter sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table 1</xref> &#x00026; 
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table 2</xref> (see supplementary material)).</p><p>If we analyze the promoters of oncogenes only, the G profiles
consist of maximum G3, G5, G6, G7 types in -100-0 and G2, G4
types maximum 0-100. In the TSG promoters, the maximum
profile of G types is demonstrated as G4, G5, G6, G7 in -100-0
and G2, G3 in 0-100. The maximum G density is found before
and after 100 nucleotides after TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>G-type density is compared before and after TSS; the average
G-type density of all 5 nucleotide groups between -500 and 0, is
compared to the G-type density of the group between 0 and
+100. Before TSS, on average, starting from -500, the oncogenes
have 336 and TSG have 332 G types, but after TSS, to +100, the
oncogenes have 402 and TSG have 435 G types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).
Surprisingly, 200-100 location of both promoters has distinct G
types, such as G9 and G11 in oncogenes and 2 times G8 in TSG.
The G types number increases between the segments 400-300 to
300-200 around and then a little bit decrease after that.
However, the last segment before the TSS and 100 nucleotides
after TSS have the maximum G type number over all
comparison.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title><italic>Gene expression comparison</italic>:</title><p>Since G profiles are found in promoters sites, which are
important for the regulation of gene expression, we decided to
compare the G profiles of selected cancer-related genes to their
expression in the colon cancer patients. The expression data
were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data
portal which supplies many different patient genomics data,
including gene expression, microRNA, RNAseq, methylation,
mutation and others. We downloaded the expression data from
17815 genes from 174 colon cancer patients and 46 controls. The
average expression level of all 17815 genes was determined and
compared with control data (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table 2</xref>). Abnormal fold
change of 50 selected oncogenes and 50 selected TSGs has been
found. According to the fold change, high-expressed and lowexpressed
genes are profiled with G Density <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table 3</xref> (see

consisting of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 guanines in the promoter

tumor suppressor genes and 50 oncogenes). Previous studies
presented different algorithms and methods to find guanine
rich regions and potential motifs. In those studies, different Gscore
for G quadruplex calculation methods were developed
[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, no previous study has shown the densities of
other G repeats such as GG, GGG, GGGG, GGGGG, GGGGGG,
GGGGGGG and GGGGGGGG. Our study is the first to

quantitatively evaluating the conservation of different guanine 
types and densities. Guanine types, G (2-7), can be identified by
guanine density (GD) program in order to detect potential
sequence motifs which are conserved in promoters of
oncogenes and TSGs. The computer program quickly and
efficiently identifies conserved Guanine Types Density regions
where there is a relatively high probability of sequence
conservation. The program reported in this study has
application for the analysis of large datasets.</p><p>Our results show that depending on the exact locations of the
guanine types and density, the gene promoter sequences
demonstrate conserved characteristics. In other words, the G
densities increase closer to the transcriptional start site of both
oncogenes and TSGs. The G density is the highest within the
100 base pairs proximal to the transcriptional start site.
Identifying common conserved GDs may help us validate these
findings on larger datasets to show the role of G densities in
pathogenesis and disease. </p><p>Moreover, the G types density demonstrates that the location
and number of G repeates are conserved in oncogenes and TSG
promoter sequence. The paper may help elucidate the potential
role of the specific G types in therapeutic and diagnostic
pursuits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Data 1</title></caption><media
