Native to Asia, BMSB was first observed in Allentown, PA, USA, in 1996, and this pest is now well-established throughout the US mid-Atlantic region and beyond. In addition to the serious threat BMSB poses to agriculture, BMSB has become a nuisance to homeowners, invading home gardens and congregating in large numbers in human-made structures, including homes, to overwinter. Despite its significance as an agricultural pest with limited control options, only 100 bp of BMSB sequence data was available in public databases when this project began.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Transcriptome sequencing was undertaken to provide a molecular resource to the research community to inform the development of pest control strategies and to provide molecular data for population genetics studies of BMSB. Using normalized, strand-specific libraries, we sequenced pools of all BMSB life stages on the Illumina HiSeq. Trinity was used to assemble 200,000 putative transcripts in &#x0003e;100,000 components. A novel bioinformatic method that analyzed the strand-specificity of the data reduced this to 53,071 putative transcripts from 18,573 components. By integrating multiple other data types, we narrowed this further to 13,211 representative transcripts.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Bacterial endosymbiont genes were identified in this dataset, some of which have a copy number consistent with being lateral gene transfers between endosymbiont genomes and Hemiptera, including ankyrin-repeat related proteins, lysozyme, and mannanase. Such genes and endosymbionts may provide novel targets for BMSB-specific biocontrol. This study demonstrates the utility of strand-specific sequencing in generating shotgun transcriptomes and that rapid sequencing shotgun transcriptomes is possible without the need for extensive inbreeding to generate homozygous lines. Such sequencing can provide a rapid response to pest invasions similar to that already described for disease epidemiology.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/1471-2164-15-738) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Brown marmorated stink bug</kwd><kwd><italic>Halyomorpha halys</italic></kwd><kwd>Transcriptome</kwd><kwd>Hemiptera</kwd><kwd>Invasive species</kwd><kwd>Lateral gene transfer</kwd><kwd>Horizontal gene transfer</kwd><kwd>Mannanase</kwd><kwd>Lysozyme</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p><italic>Halyomorpha halys</italic> (St&#x000e5;l) (Insecta: Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), otherwise known as the Brown Marmorated Stink Bug (BMSB), is an invasive pest that has ravaged farms and distressed homeowners in the mid-Atlantic region of the US in recent years. It is a polyphagous insect pest that causes economically important damage to many crops including vegetables, tree fruit, field crops, and ornamentals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Native to Asia, BMSB was first observed in North America in Allentown, PA, USA in 1996 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. BMSB is now well-established in the mid-Atlantic regions of the US and has spread to 41 different states and DC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There is also evidence for established populations in Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and Switzerland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It is a pest of tree fruit; grapes; other small fruit; row crops including vegetables, legumes and cotton; shade trees; ornamentals; and nursery crops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. BMSB crop damage reached economically significant levels during the 2010 growing season. Growers considered BMSB to be the single most important pest in the mid-Atlantic region, leading to &#x02018;desperate measures&#x02019; including increased use of broad-spectrum pesticides to control BMSB, detracting from sustainable Integrated Pest Management practices. In keeping with this, the EPA granted emergency approval for the use of several pesticides, including one approved for use in organic farming, to prevent further economic loss in the mid-Atlantic region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition to being an agricultural pest, many mid-Atlantic homeowners are troubled by BMSB. Unlike native stink bugs, BMSB aggregates in human-made structures, including houses, to overwinter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. One home owner reported removing 26,000 BMSB from his residence in the first half of 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>BMSB has a long history of hitchhiking to new areas. The successful introduction in Allentown, PA, USA, was preceded by the successful interception of BMSB by the USDA preventing such invasions including an interception of BMSB on a 1983 flight from Japan, an interception in baggage from Korea in 1984, and eight further interceptions from China, Korea, and Japan from 1989&#x02013;1998 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. BMSB has been unintentionally shipped from Japan to New Zealand in a used vehicle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In 2005, over a dozen BMSB were recovered from a storage unit in Vallejo, Solano County, CA, that was rented by an individual who had relocated from Pennsylvania [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Ecological niche modelling and climate data predict that areas between 30&#x02013;50 degrees latitude are at risk of invasion including Northern Europe, north-eastern North America, the northern portions of the North American west coast, southern Australia, the North Island of New Zealand as well as Angola in Africa and Uruguay in South America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>As summarized above, BMSB are significant agricultural pests with limited treatment options and an ability to spread, making it a particularly difficult invasive pest to manage. Over sixty researchers funded by the USDA and commodity organizations are conducting experiments aimed at better understanding the biology and ecology of this pest and to find management solutions. When this project began, only 100 bp of sequence data was available in the public database. Transcriptome sequencing was undertaken to provide a molecular resource to the research community for basic and applied research purposes. The data can be used to examine the population genetics of BMSB, including gaining a better understanding of the original invasion in Allentown, as well as subsequent invasions throughout the US and the world. Understanding these invasions will increase our knowledge, preventing future invasions. Our study demonstrates that the transcriptomes of invasive species can be rapidly sequenced, providing a resource to the research community without extensive breeding to create homozygous lines (e.g. generating 8 generations of an isofemale line). Such sequencing can provide a rapid response to pest invasions similar to that already described for epidemiology of infectious disease (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]) and jumpstart molecular biology and genetic-based studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sequencing results</title><p>Whole transcriptome sequencing was undertaken in order to obtain gene sequences and jumpstart molecular biology studies focused on BMSB.

Strand-specific sequencing allows for assignment of the strand of transcription while normalization decreases the sequencing of the most abundant transcripts allowing for sequencing of more rare variants. Sequencing of these libraries on the Illumina HiSeq2000 resulted in 196,233,912 reads totaling &#x0003e;19 billion bases for Pool A and 170,455,294 reads totaling &#x0003e;17 billion bases for pool B. All of the reads were pooled and assembled with Trinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], which uses Inchworm to produce contigs via greedy k-mer extension, Chrysalis to produce components containing related contigs, and Butterfly to generate transcripts using the various de Bruijn graph paths in the components. We will refer to the assemblage of sequences generated by Butterfly as putative transcripts, given that some of the sequences that Butterfly assembles are not actually transcripts, as described below.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>
<bold>Strand-specific sequencing with DSN normalization.</bold> In strand-specific sequencing, the final sequencing reads can be assigned to a particular strand of DNA. This is accomplished by a second-strand synthesis with dUTP, ligation of adaptors to double-stranded DNA, and degradation of the second strand with UNG. The result is a fragment to be sequenced that is differentially labeled on the two ends in a manner that dictates how they are loaded on the sequencer and thus the order in which the ends are sequenced.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2014_6471_Fig2_HTML" id="d30e549"/></fig></p><p>The resulting assembly contained 194,729 putative transcripts with 50,599 that were &#x0003e;1,000 bp and 20,076 having a top BLASTX match (e&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup> and over &#x0003e;80% of the reference) to 8,354 unique Uniref90 protein sequences.

This can be particularly true for organisms where good reference annotation is lacking, like insects. Sequencing a strand-specific library should assist in identifying the transcribed strand (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), reducing the number of possible ORFs by half. However, strand-specific libraries can have leakage, where experimentally the wrong strand is sequenced, that needs to be addressed.</p><p>To measure strand specificity, we calculated the log ratio of sense reads to antisense reads using Bowtie2 mappings that allowed for multiple matches, which will be referred to as the SSLR for strand-specific log ratio. We were able to show that overall the library is strand-specific with the plus strand preferred to the minus strand 3.40:1 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). While the SSLR demonstrates the plus strand was preferred, there was a significant amount of leakage that results in two putative transcripts that are reverse complements to one another. Leakage transcripts were identified as those that (a) matched another putative transcript in the alternate orientation using BLASTN, and (b) had a positive SSLR as described above. Using this approach, we discarded 32,308 putative transcripts originating from 24,507 components. Of those putative transcripts, there were 20,795 that had an ORF predicted on only one of the strands, and thus in only one direction. Not unexpectedly, 20,350 had their ORFs predicted on the minus strand compared to only 445 that had their ORFs in the plus strand. Overall, those with a SSLR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;&#x02212;5 had &#x0003e;10-fold increase in ORFs on the plus strand relative to the minus strand and those with a SSLR &#x0003e;5 had &#x0003e;10-fold increase in ORFs on the minus strand relative to the plus strand (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). This indicates that using a SSLR can correctly predict the right strand.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>
<bold>Assessment of the strand-specificity of the RNA-Seq library.</bold> The strand specificity of the sequencing library was based on comparing the number of first-in-pair reads mapped to the plus strand, to the corresponding number of second-in-pair reads. In a strand-specific library, the strand-specific log ratio (SSLR) should be away from zero. In the protocol used in this study, where the second-in-pair read comes from the sense strand, a negative SSLR is expected. <bold>(A)</bold> The distribution of SSLRs for putative transcripts having at least one proper read pair mapping to them demonstrates a preference for those with a negative SSLR. <bold>(B)</bold> When the plot is limited to those with twenty read pairs mapping to them, the bimodal distribution becomes more distinct, likely from the removal of contigs arising from contaminating genomic DNA.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2014_6471_Fig4_HTML" id="d30e619"/></fig></p><p>Upon mapping the distribution of putative transcripts by strand specificity, one observes a bimodal distribution. The bimodal distribution becomes more symmetrical upon applying a coverage threshold. In particular, there are numerous putative transcripts with a strand specificity slightly less than zero that disappeared completely as more coverage was required to support the underlying putative transcript (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2). One explanation for this would be that these putative transcripts arise from contaminating genomic DNA that lacks strand specificity. This would manifest as short contigs supported by few reads and little strand specificity. Consistent with genomic DNA being present in the samples, applying a coverage cutoff of only two removed &#x0003e;10,000 putative transcripts that are &#x0003c;300 bp. In other projects, we have observed contaminating <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA that we suspect arrives in the sample through molecular biology reagents that may allow for an examination of our ability to detect genomic DNA contamination. In BMSB, bacterial DNA may also come from the microbiome, for example from an endosymbiont. However, regardless of the source, <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA could serve as a proxy for identifying genomic DNA in this sample<italic>.</italic> A coverage cutoff of two removed 3,501 putative transcripts that matched <italic>E. coli.</italic> If we plot the mean length, number of putative transcripts of size &#x0003c;300 bp, and number of reads with a match to <italic>E. coli,</italic> the greatest improvements are obtained with a coverage cutoff of 20 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Three putative transcripts still persist with homology to <italic>E. coli.</italic> One of these (comp3244_c38_seq1) has little strand specificity (SSLR&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.45) and matches PhiX, which is added to Illumina sequencing runs and is not always completely removed through standard filtering. The remaining two, comp1098_c0_seq1 and comp1100_c0_seq1, are strand-specific, unique, and have BLASTN matches to the 16S and 23S rRNA, respectively, with best matches to the genome of an endosymbiont of the BMSB (GenBank: AP012554). This highlights that combining the results of the SSLR, a coverage threshold, and the BLASTN search significantly improves the transcriptome assembly and aids in identifying transcripts from both the host and its endosymbiont(s). The SSLR would be an easy and useful addition to implement into Trinity and other assemblers that would provide the greatest gains.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>

Applying the thresholds above reduces this to 53,071 putative transcripts from 18,573 components. However, analyses related to function, particularly those that result in statistical analyses, need the data to be reduced to a representative number of genes, thereby removing splice variants. Using an integrated approach, we were able to score each putative transcript based on two types of evidence including similarity to known sequences and the intrinsic features of each contig. We calculated a score for each of the remaining 53,071 putative transcripts of the Trinity assembly based on (a) similarity to known sequences, (b) features of any predicted ORFs, and (c) sequencing coverage along the putative transcript. The exact metrics used for calculating the score are described in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Methods. This filtering resulted in 13,211 putative transcripts representing a 14-fold reduction in the number of putative transcripts and a 9-fold reduction in the number of components (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

While there was at least one bottleneck in founding the colony, the assembled sequences were expected to have heterogeneity that reflects some of the genetic heterogeneity of the US BMSB population. Of the 26.6 million positions in the 13,211 transcripts that were examined with MPILEUP, 23.7 million positions were supported by &#x0003e;20 reads when all reads were aligned with Bowtie2. Of those positions, 212,422 had a substitution mutation that differed from the consensus base call that was supported by &#x0003e;5% of the underlying reads, which represents ~1% of the positions. If more stringent requirements are applied, 109,920 of these positions had &#x0003e;20% of the underlying reads with a substitution mutation. These positions were identified in 11,462 different putative transcripts, which is 86.8% of the total number of putative transcripts. The genetic heterogeneity observed may be significantly less than that found in the native Asian population, since the founder population in the US was likely small, representing a significant bottleneck, and an additional bottleneck occurred when founding the laboratory population. However, these polymorphisms may be a useful resource for population studies examining the spread of BMSB in the US.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Differential expression between adults and non-adults</title><p>In order to compare the expression of juveniles and adults, the normalized log<sub>2</sub>Ratio of the read count was calculated between the two pools (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S1).

These results were confirmed by qRT-PCR using the original RNA samples, prior to pooling. For qRT-PCR we examined comp549_c0_seq3, instead of comp549_c0_seq1, as it is slightly longer and contains part of the latrotoxin domain discussed below. These qRT-PCR experiments demonstrate a specific 20,000-fold and 17,000-fold increase in expression of comp549_c15_seq3 and comp2753_c5_seq1 in active adult females when compared to all other stages, and a specific 170-fold increase in expression of comp18511_c0_seq1 in 5<sup>th</sup> instar nymphs.</p><p>While all three putative transcripts have homology to known ankyrin-repeat containing proteins, comp2753_c5_seq1 and comp549_c15_seq3 do not contain ankyrin (ANK) repeats.

The homology for comp549_c15_seq3 spans a portion of the latrotoxin domain and the adjacent ANK repeats, while the homology for comp2753_c5_seq3 spans only part of this region. This region of homology is at the C-terminus of BMSB ORFs while the 560 and 223 amino acids at the N-terminus have little homology for comp549_c15_seq3 and comp2753_c5_seq1, respectively. No changes in sequencing coverage around these regions were identified in either transcript that would suggest a misassembly. The N-terminus of the ORF encoded in comp549_c15_seq3 contains a JNK_SAPK-associated protein-1 domain.</p><p>Examination of the phylogenetic relationship of comp549_c15_seq3 and comp2753_c5_seq1 with homologous sequences in GenBank (&#x0003c;e-15), reveals that while they have homology to <italic>Wolbachia</italic> endosymbionts (&#x003b1;-Proteobacteria), collectively they also have homology to coding sequences (CDSs) in <italic>Rickettsiella grylii</italic> (&#x003b3;-Proteobacteria) and <italic>Diplorickettsia massiliensis</italic> (&#x003b1;-Proteobacteria) (Additional files <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Figures S7-S8). The phylogenetic diversity of the bacterial taxa suggests that there have been lateral gene transfers involving diverse arthropod-associated bacterial lineages and the precise donors and recipients of these bacteria-bacteria lateral gene transfers are not clear. While we suspect that this may also be a lateral gene transfer involving BMSB, we cannot rule out the presence of these genes arising from an endosymbiont of BMSB. By qPCR, these genes were at the same relative abundance as BMSB nuclear genes, but we were not successful at placing these genes in the BMSB genome using inverse PCR. The ongoing BMSB genome sequencing project will likely clarify this issue. Should this prove to be a lateral gene transfer, it is not clear whether the gene moved from bacteria into insects, or vice versa.</p><p>The third transcript (comp18511_c0_seq1) contains an ORF with full length matches to <italic>Wolbachia</italic> proteins that contain ANK repeats and a PRANC domain. PRANC domains were at one time described only in Pox viruses, where PRANC-containing proteins inhibit NF-&#x003ba;B activation by TNF-&#x003b1;, thereby altering the innate immune response of the mammalian host. More recently PRANC domains were identified in the human pathogen <italic>Orientia tsutsugamushi</italic> (Bacteria: Rickettsiales), multiple <italic>Wolbachia</italic> endosymbionts (Bacteria: Rickettsiales), <italic>Wolbachia</italic> phage, and <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic> (Eukaryota: Hymenoptera). Previous phylogenetic analysis suggests that the <italic>Nasonia</italic> lineage acquired one or more of these proteins from a <italic>Wolbachia</italic> endosymbiont via lateral gene transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Examination of the phylogenetic relationship of the BMSB sequence with homologous sequences in GenBank (&#x0003c;e-15), reveals that while it has homology to <italic>Wolbachia</italic> endosymbionts (&#x003b1;-Proteobacteria), it is distinct from the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> proteins. It is not clear if the BMSB protein represents an ANK-PRANC protein in another bacterial lineage or arthropod lineage. As with the genes described above, qPCR results revealed the same relative abundance as BMSB nuclear genes and is consistent with these genes being in the BMSB nuclear genome. However, in both cases it is possible an endosymbiont is present whose genome also has the same relative abundance as the BMSB genome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Sugar polysaccharide metabolism proteins with bacterial homology</title><p>The next most abundant proteins with homology to bacterial proteins were those encoding mannanases and amylases. These genes are of particular interest as they could aid in the degradation of plant cell wall polymers and storage molecules.</p><p>While the amylase transcripts had best homology to bacterial genes in NR, they had very good homology to transcripts from other diverse insect genera including <italic>Drosophila, Nasonia, Aedes, Anopheles, Rhodnius,</italic> and <italic>Apis.</italic> A phylogenetic analysis had poor bootstrap support for most branches and thus did not adequately resolve the amylase genes. The results are therefore inconclusive, but most consistent with vertical inheritance of these genes within insects. The copy number in genomic DNA, as assessed by qPCR, is consistent with the presence of the amylase gene in the host chromosome and its qRT-PCR results are consistent with it being constitutively expressed from the insect nuclear genome.</p><p>The mannanase genes, however, showed no homology in NR to any insect genes. A complete mannanase transcript was not assembled. Instead, the assembly includes multiple fragments for the 5&#x02032;-end and the 3&#x02032;-end of the gene that may constitute 3&#x02013;4 complete mannanase genes. PCR was used to demonstrate that comp17117_c0_seq1 and comp14839_c0_seq1 were part of a larger transcript that would encode a complete mannanase as would comp2467_c6_seq1 and comp1797_c0_seq1.

By qRT-PCR, comp2467_c6_seq1 clustered with constitutively expressed nuclear genes and had Ct values similar to BMSB nuclear genes. Comp7015_c0_seq1 and comp11444_c0_seq1 were poorly expressed in all stages consistent with transcription from the endosymbiont genome, but had their highest levels of expression in active females.</p><p>All of the mannanase and non-mannanase primer pairs designed for qRT-PCR and qPCR experiments generated an appropriately sized amplicon on RNA and generated no amplicon when reverse transcriptase was omitted. However, numerous of those primer pairs failed to produce the same amplicon on DNA. In the case of the L27 control primer pair, we suspect the primers may span an intron; as such they fail in qPCR but perform well for qRT-PCR. An intron may also be present for one of the mannanase genes (comp2467_c6_seq1) where the wrong size fragment was observed with genomic DNA. In contrast to L27, the comp2467_c6_seq1 primers still resulted in good Ct values in the qPCR and qRT-PCR. The qPCR Ct values are similar to those for genes in the BMSB chromosome, so we suspect that this mannanase gene is in the BMSB genome. However, two other mannanase primer pairs (comp7015_c0_seq1 and comp11444_c0_seq1), and all of the control primer pairs targeting endosymbiont transcripts, failed to produce an amplicon or valid qPCR results. As such, we suspect that the corresponding mannanase genes are found in an endosymbiont genome. We could not identify it in the publicly available endosymbiont genome (GenBank: AP012554), but it is possible that there are multiple endosymbionts. Taken together, this suggests that related mannanase genes are present in both BMSB and its endosymbiont(s) and that both are abundant enough to be detected in this experiment. This suggests that mannanase may play a significant role in BMSB. All of the genes ascribed to the endosymbiont based on qPCR results had good Ct values in qRT-PCR experiments with RNA from active females. This may indicate that the active female examined here had a robust endosymbiont transcriptional response.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Bacteria-to-hemiptera lateral gene transfer</title><p>Previously, 12 genes or gene fragments have been identified in the pea aphid genome that resulted from LGT from bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

The hemipteran lysozyme transcripts are not well supported in the phylogeny of lysozymes with less than 70% bootstrap support (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). However, the heteropteran lineage transfers are monophyletic, albeit not well supported.

Using histone H3 (which is highly conserved and essential in insects) to query the transcriptome shotgun assemblies deposited at NCBI with TBLASTN, we were able to identify seven Hemiptera in the repository including <italic>Rhodnius prolixus</italic> (Heteroptera), <italic>Aphis craccivora</italic> (Sternorrhyncha), <italic>Graminella nigrifrons</italic> (Auchenorrhyncha), <italic>Clavigralla tomentosicollis</italic> (Heteroptera), <italic>Triatoma matogrossensis</italic> (Heteroptera), <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> (Sternorrhyncha), and <italic>Anoplocnemis curripes</italic> (Heteroptera).

Absence of these genes in the other four insects could be due to many factors, including incomplete sampling of genes with transcriptome sequencing as well as removal of bacterial transcripts prior to deposition. As an example of the latter screening, the bLys proteins encoded in these transcriptome assemblies were missing from the corresponding protein database at NCBI when searched with BLASTX. Likewise, the contigs containing the bLys proteins in the aphid genome have been removed recently, despite numerous pieces of experimental evidence demonstrating their presence in the aphid genome.</p><p>However, the presence of bLys genes in all hemipteran genomes sequenced thus far, their presence in several transcriptomes including BMSB, their relative abundance as measured by qPCR, and their presence in a clade dominated by &#x003b1;-proteobacterial lysozymes suggests that these genes are not in an endosymbiont genome but instead in the hemipteran genome. This suggests the existence of one or more ancient transfers of bacterial lysozyme into this lineage. Both bLys transcripts contained only the bacterial 1,4-beta-N-acetylmuramidase, and not the eukaryotic peptidase that is fused to it in aphids. Neither of the BMSB bLys transcripts were differentially expressed between the adult and pre-adult RNA pools. Examination by qRT-PCR reveals constitutive expression across all of the life stages with transcript abundance levels similar to other constitutively expressed genes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Rapid sequencing of an insect pest</title><p>BMSB is a major agricultural pest of the mid-Atlantic region of the US and is one of the top priorities for control set forth by the USDA. Yet there has been a lack of sequence data to facilitate molecular biology studies of this species. One barrier to genome sequencing is the need to have a sizable inbred population in order to obtain the necessary amount of nucleic acid for sequencing while maintaining the homogeneity necessary to facilitate whole genome assembly. This is particularly true for complex eukaryotic genomes, for which large quantities of DNA are needed to generate either large insert libraries or long sequence reads. However, many organisms do not have established laboratory colonies, and for emerging pests, methods have to be developed <italic>de novo</italic> to maintain such colonies for the many generations needed to successfully generate an inbred population.</p><p>Transcriptome sequencing can fill the void in these instances by rapidly providing the sequence of much of the coding potential of the genome. Because coding sequences are under constraint, they tend to be less variable and, at least in this instance, seem to be reasonably well resolved without the time-consuming measures needed to create genetically homogenous lines. Rapid sequencing has gained a great deal of interest for bacteria in clinical settings (e.g.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]). Clinical samples can be obtained, sequenced, and analyzed in less than a week&#x02019;s time. In a similar manner, improvements to whole transcriptome sequencing for eukaryotes with larger genomes could aid in rapid development of resources for emerging ecological pests that threaten agriculture or the environment.</p><p>One might expect transcriptome sequencing to be simpler than whole genome sequencing given the short sequences to be assembled and the absence of introns. However, <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly and analysis can still prove to be quite challenging. One problem arises from the variable coverage between different transcripts. The other main challenge comes from alternative splicing and the sequencing of incompletely spliced transcripts. Alternative splicing can be observed in different tissues and at different developmental stages. As a result, a larger number of alternatively spliced mRNAs are expected from samples derived from multiple tissues and/or developmental stages. Coincidentally, transcriptome assemblies generally use data from a wide variety of tissues and stages in order to increase our ability to find more genes, which compounds this problem.</p><p>While knowing the splice variants in a transcriptome can be important, in some cases a single &#x0201c;representative&#x0201d; transcript of each gene is a necessary first step, in order to reduce complexity and facilitate downstream comparative analyses. One approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] is to take the longest transcript, with the rationale that it is probably the full-length transcript. However, we found long transcripts in this dataset that resulted from the erroneous joining of two smaller transcripts through misassembly, suggesting this is not always a good metric. Other studies have used filtering based only on BLAST results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], or filtering based on only intrinsic properties of the assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Our approach combined both intrinsic properties of the putative transcripts, as well as their similarity to sequence databases, in order to find the representative transcript from a group of related transcripts (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) in Trinity components. The most important intrinsic properties include (a) sequencing coverage, (b) strand specificity, (c) length, (d) strand of predicted ORFs, and (e) sequencing coverage changes. Assessment of these properties results in a highly integrated pipeline for filtering the list of putative transcripts generated by Trinity that examines multiple dimensions, giving different user-specified weights to properties of different biological importance to best address the researcher&#x02019;s biological question. Applying the technique here revealed many novel observations about transcripts of bacterial ancestry.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Mannanase</title><p>Several transcripts were identified with homology to mannanase genes. <italic>Hypothenemus hampei</italic> (Coleoptera) has acquired a mannanase gene from bacteria through lateral gene transfer that enables parasitism of coffee berries relative to sister taxa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. However, it has little sequence similarity to the putative mannanase genes discovered here. Prior to discovery of the mannanase gene in <italic>H. hampei</italic> through sequencing genes in the secretome, mannanase genes were not described in insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Therefore, the presence of mannanases in the BMSB and its endosymbiont is intriguing. Mannanase degrades mannan, a plant polysaccharide storage molecule composed primarily of mannose that is frequently found in seeds. BMSB has been a major pest on soybeans where they feed directly on individual soybean seeds after piercing through the pods, which results in flattened pods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. As such, mannanase could be an important addition to the metabolic repertoire of BMSB and its endosymbiont, leaving them well-adapted to feed on soybeans. This also suggests that mannanase may be a good target for RNAi-mediated control of BMSB. The relative abundance of the mannanase genes measured suggests multiple genomes contribute mannanase genes. The results are most consistent with the presence of mannanase in one or more endosymbionts and the BMSB nuclear genome. The <italic>H. hampei</italic> mannanase had little sequence similarity to the putative mannanase genes discovered here, suggesting that any lateral gene transfer would be an independent acquisition of these genes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Ankyrin repeat proteins</title><p>Two transcripts, comp2753_c5_seq1 and comp549_c15_seq3, were identified as having strong similarity to a specific ankyrin repeat protein of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> endosymbionts that contains a C-terminal latrotoxin C domain. Latrotoxin is best known for being the active component in black widow spider venom, but a homologue has also been identified in <italic>Wolbachia</italic> endosymbionts and <italic>Rickettsiella grylli</italic>

However, they do not contain ankyrin repeats or the complete latrotoxin domain nor do they have similarity to any protein domain in the PFAM database. We demonstrate that these transcripts are up-regulated in adult females (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>) and that they are most likely encoded in the BMSB nuclear genome.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>

Within each sample the &#x02206;Ct is illustrated in a heat map and was calculated as the difference between the average Ct across the four constitutively expressed genes (ThRS, L30, Tubulin, and L27) and the Ct value for the gene being interrogated. In this way the color coding represents the difference in expression between the gene queried and the average constitutively expressed housekeeping gene, which all had similar abundance levels. In most samples, comp18511_c0_seq1, comp549_c15_seq3, comp2753_c5_seq1, comp7015_c0_seq1, and comp11444_c0_seq1 were poorly expressed relative to the constitutively expressed genes. However, in fifth instar nymphs (dark green), comp18511_c0_seq1 was transcribed at levels similar to the constitutively expressed genes while in active adult females, comp549_c15_seq3 and comp2753_c5_seq1 were transcribed at levels 64-fold higher than the average constitutively expressed gene. Both bLysB, the putative amylase, and the putative BMSB mannanase transcripts were transcribed constitutively at levels similar to the other constitutively expressed genes. For RNA that did not amplify a Ct value was assigned of 43, which was the lowest Ct value measured across the dataset. This reflects the low abundance of a transcript that did not amplify, but still allowed for clustering. The value for comp11444_c0_seq1 in the 4<sup>th</sup> instar larvae replicate 3 is missing due to an aberrant amplification curve.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2014_6471_Fig9_HTML" id="d30e2039"/></fig></p><p>These transcripts are intriguing given their differential and increased expression in BMSB and the interesting functions of their homologues in other insects. For example, the salivary gland secreted (SGS) family of proteins in mosquitoes are in the same family of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. SGS proteins are specifically transcribed in the salivary glands, localized to the basal lamina, and are necessary for successful invasion of the mosquito salivary glands by sporozoites of the protozoan parasite <italic>Plasmodium gallinaceum</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].

However, these protein families are also not widely distributed among bacteria, and thus far seem to only be associated with insect endosymbionts.

This suggests an ancient transfer or transfers that we sought to investigate further.</p><p>In aphids, it was suggested that the bacterial lysozyme might compensate for the lack of the canonical c-type lysozyme found in metazoans, including insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].

This suggests that the presence of the bacterial lysozyme is not strictly related to the loss of the c-type lysozyme in all Hemiptera.</p><p>Hemiptera include many phloem-feeding insects including aphids and other pests, where economically important crop damage is related to the piercing of the plant tissue. Hemiptera have also received a great deal of attention for frequently containing primary mutualistic endosymbionts. These two traits are likely related since phloem is nutritionally incomplete and the primary mutualistic endosymbionts often provide the essential nutrients that the insect requires that are not provided by the phloem. Therefore, Hemiptera-specific differences relative to other insects may be associated with acquisition of such endosymbionts and a transition of these insects to this food source.</p><p>We hypothesize that to obtain primary endosymbionts Hemiptera may have had to relax their immune response to bacteria, relative to their ancestors. The lysozyme LGT could have played a role in this. Aphids are reported to lack homologues to many of the innate immune genes that target bacteria including peptidoglycan receptor proteins (PGRPs), the IMD signaling pathway, and antimicrobial peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The BMSB transcriptome had 95 of the 97 identified aphid immune-related proteins using BLASTP (e&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>), but were lacking transcripts for Galectin 1 and Sp&#x000e4;tzle 6 using these criteria. Using a BLASTP search (e&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) with <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genes from ImmunomeBase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], we were able to identify numerous immune-related genes in BMSB that were absent in the pea aphid including those encoding PGRPs, Eater, Traf6, Kayak, and Defensin. We speculate that with a complement of PGRPs, BMSB may be able to activate defenses against bacteria more readily than the pea aphid, although this would have to happen in the absence of a functional IMD signaling pathway.</p><p>However, this response is likely still not as robust as that of <italic>D. melanogaster.</italic> A TBLASTN search of the entire NCBI shotgun transcriptome database with the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> homolog to <italic>dFadd</italic> (NP_651006.1) failed to identify a homolog in any Hemiptera despite allowing the search to return 5000 results, which yielded many more divergent metazoan homologs. This is consistent with widespread loss of IMD signaling in multiple Hemiptera. Analogous searches failed to identify <italic>imd</italic>, <italic>Dredd</italic>, or <italic>kenny</italic> homologs in any Hemiptera shotgun transcriptome except the <italic>Gramminella</italic> transcriptome. This is intriguing since the <italic>Gramminella</italic> bacterial lysozyme is the only one that does not cluster with the lysozymes from &#x003b1;-Proteobacteria. <italic>Gramminella</italic> is also the only representative of Auchenorrhyncha examined. Given the relationship of the Hemiptera suborders (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, inset), this raises the possibility that both the loss of the IMD pathway and acquisition of an &#x003b1;-proteobacterial lysozyme occurred independently in the Sternorrhyncha and Heteroptera lineages.</p><p>Acquisition of lysozyme and loss of IMD may be features that are common to many Hemiptera given this examination of the shotgun transcriptome database. It has been proposed that the loss of immune genes in the pea aphid may be compensated for by an equally effective alternate response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], although the genes of this alternate response could not be identified by suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) upon challenge with a Gram-negative bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. It was also proposed that &#x0201c;defensive&#x0201d; endosymbionts may be able to compensate for the loss of these functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. However, this was noted as a chicken and egg problem since loss of these functions would be necessary for endosymbiont colonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. We propose that acquisition of lysozyme provides broad-spectrum protection against a subset of bacteria (e.g. Gram-positive bacteria) facilitating loss of more general pathways that respond to all bacteria (e.g. IMD). Such an alteration would facilitate colonization by primary and secondary endosymbionts, most of which are Gram-negative Proteobacteria. A Gram-positive response would be consistent with the SSH experiments that were only conducted with a Gram-negative species. While intriguing, the hypothesis that acquisition of lysozyme enabled immune function loss and subsequently endosymbiont gain is only conjecture, but it could be the focus of future investigations. Of note, bLys could be a useful target for the development of insecticides, given its bacterial origin, potential role in defending against bacterial invasion, and its presence in this clade with numerous agriculturally significant pests.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>BMSB is a particularly difficult invasive agricultural pest to manage with limited treatment options and an ability to spread. Transcriptome sequencing was undertaken to provide a molecular resource to the research community for genetic- and genome-based research. The polymorphisms identified in this data set can be used to examine the population genetics of BMSB, which will allow for a better understanding of the original invasion in Allentown and its movement throughout the US and world. Understanding these invasions will increase our understanding of how to prevent the introduction of invasive pests in the future. Our study demonstrates that the transcriptomes of invasive species can be rapidly sequenced providing a resource to the research community without extensive breeding to create homozygous lines. Furthermore, strand-specific transcriptome sequencing can facilitate the identification of transcripts. Here, transcriptome sequencing enabled us to identify putative lateral gene transfers between bacteria and insects including ankyrin-repeat related proteins, lysozyme, and mannanase.

TransDecoder more accurately predicts start codons, compared to Getorf, because it is trained on the 500 longest ORFs, which are more likely to be real genes. As a result, predictions made by TransDecoder have a priority over the ORFs found by getorf. However, supplementing with Getorf predictions was important when identifying ORFs of bacterial origin, either from the metatranscriptome or from lateral gene transfer as they have properties that differ from the TransDecoder training set. We kept only the ORFs found in the strand in which the longest ORF is located. Additionally, if two ORFs overlapped for &#x0003e;50% of the length of the shorter putative transcript, only the longest of the two was retained.</p><p>Since the library is strand-specific, the ORFs predicted by TransDecoder in the plus strand of the putative transcripts were taken into account first. Subsequently, the TransDecoder minus strand ORFs that did not overlap with any TransDecoder plus strand ORFs were also added. Finally, ORFs found by the Getorf program in any strand were also added if they did not overlap with any TransDecoder ORF. A penalty is given if multiple ORFs are found in a transcript. An additional penalty occurs if the different ORFs have different best hits in Uniref100 and NR databases, or if they occur in both the plus and minus strand. All of these are indicative of incompletely spliced mRNAs or misassemblies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Coverage assessment for post-processing</title><p>To measure the evenness of the sequencing read coverage, all reads were mapped against the putative transcripts using Bowtie2. Given the presence of multiple sequence variants, the Bowtie2 parameter &#x0201c;-k 5000&#x0201d; was used in order to ensure that all mappings of each read are reported. In this way, all reads used for assembling each putative transcript were reported. SAMtools MPILEUP was used to obtain coverage for each position of a putative transcript and the mean coverage for each node calculated using a custom Perl script. A &#x0003e;5-fold difference in sequencing coverage of adjacent nodes in a putative transcript was considered a coverage dip. Sequencing coverage dips can be signs of misassemblies or alternative splicing. Therefore, it is important to consider that this step may remove valid transcripts in order to generate a representative set of transcripts for annotation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Annotation</title><p>ORFs that were predicted by TransDecoder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and Getorf from EMBOSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] were assigned putative function with the IGS Eukaryotic Functional Annotation Pipeline protocol 2 in a manner analogous to the IGS Prokaryotic Functional Annotation Pipeline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. ORFs were searched against an HMM library comprising models from TIGRFAMs 13.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] and PFAM 26.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] using HMMER3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. ORFs received the annotation associated with that HMM for all equivalog-level matches. Subsequently, ORFs without a significant HMM match were annotated using a homologous sequence (e-value &#x0003c;1e-30) identified with BLAST against UniProtKB/SwissProt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], a curated protein database. ORFs with no HMM or BLAST matches were annotated as &#x0201c;hypothetical protein". ORFs with annotation were associated with appropriate gene symbols, E.C. numbers, and GO terms from a large collection of annotation assertions that are associated with the HMMs and proteins identified through BLAST.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Differential gene expression</title><p>The sequencing reads from each pool were aligned separately to the Trinity assembly with TopHat v1.4.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] allowing for up to 2 mismatches per 25 bp segment and removing reads that aligned to more than 20 genomic locations. Duplicates were removed with Picard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], coverage calculated with SAMtools MPILEUP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], and read counts per transcript calculated with a local Perl script. For the 61,606 genes with &#x0003e;50 reads per transcript, the log<sub>2</sub>((Coverage Tube A1)/(Coverage Tube B2)) was calculated for each transcript and normalized by centering the mode of a histogram with intervals of 0.1, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Putative transcripts with no reads mapped were given the value of 0.5 to enable analysis of transcripts present in only one pool.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>qRT-PCR</title><p>Primers were designed based on putative transcripts in order to determine transcript abundance for genes with similarity to a known bLys, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> ankyrin genes, and to constitutively expressed aphid genes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">12</xref>: Table S2). Primers were designed with Primer3 and synthesized by Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The same RNA from each of ten life stages that was used for pooling was now used separately as a template in three replicate transcription reactions, performed with the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Specifically, 1 &#x003bc;g of total RNA was incubated with gDNA Wipeout Buffer (7&#x000d7;) and RNase-free water at 42&#x000b0;C for 2 min to remove contaminating genomic DNA. The cDNA was synthesized from the RNA using Quantiscript Reverse Transcriptase (RT), Quantiscript RT Buffer (5&#x000d7;), and RT Primer Mix at 42&#x000b0;C for 30 min and then at 95&#x000b0;C for 3 min to inactivate the Quantiscript RT. Dilutions of the cDNA (0.5 &#x003bc;L of cDNA per 25 &#x003bc;L reaction) were used as templates in a qPCR reaction containing QuantiTect 2&#x000d7; SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, gene-specific primers, and RNase-free water, using the standard protocol. The assays were conducted using an ABI 7900HT instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The reactions were denatured at 95&#x000b0;C for 15 min followed by amplification with 45 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 15 s, 55&#x000b0;C for 30 s, and 72&#x000b0;C for 30 s. Reactions were followed by a melt curve analysis starting at 55&#x000b0;C, with a dissociation step at 95&#x000b0;C for 1 min plus 0.5&#x000b0;C/cycle for 80 cycles. Data was analyzed by comparing the Ct values for the eight loci of bacterial ancestry with the average Ct of four BMSB loci thought to be constitutively expressed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Testing for presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>endosymbionts</title><p>A previously described set of 42 degenerate primers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] were used to test for the presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> DNA in the stink bug genome.

Following DNA isolation, the 42 degenerate primers were used in a PCR reaction using Qiagen HotStarTaq DNA Polymerase with activation at 95&#x000b0;C for 15 min, followed by amplification with 45 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 30 s, 55&#x000b0;C for 30 s, and 72&#x000b0;C for 1 min, with a final extension of 72 &#x000b0;C for 10 min.
