Besides environmental triggers and hormones, inherited mutations in the <italic>breast cancer 1</italic> (<italic>BRCA1</italic>) or <italic>BRCA2</italic> genes markedly increase the risk for the development of breast cancer. Here, using two different mouse models, we show that genetic inactivation of the key osteoclast differentiation factor RANK in the mammary epithelium markedly delayed onset, reduced incidence, and attenuated progression of <italic>Brca1;p53</italic> mutation-driven mammary cancer. Long-term pharmacological inhibition of the RANK ligand RANKL in mice abolished the occurrence of <italic>Brca1</italic> mutation-driven pre-neoplastic lesions. Mechanistically, genetic inactivation of <italic>Rank</italic> or RANKL/RANK blockade impaired proliferation and expansion of both murine <italic>Brca1;p53</italic> mutant mammary stem cells and mammary progenitors from human <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutation carriers. In addition, genome variations within the <italic>RANK</italic> locus were significantly associated with risk of developing breast cancer in women with <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutations. Thus, RANKL/RANK control progenitor cell expansion and tumorigenesis in inherited breast cancer. These results present a viable strategy for the possible prevention of breast cancer in <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutant patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>BRCA1</italic></kwd><kwd>RANK</kwd><kwd>RANKL</kwd><kwd>inherited breast cancer</kwd><kwd>mammary progenitor cells</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Risk factors for breast cancer development include exposure to environmental factors such as synthetic sex steroid hormones, endogenous hormones, or genetic predisposition. In particular, germline mutations in <italic>breast cancer 1</italic> (<italic>BRCA1</italic>) and <italic>BRCA2</italic> account for 2%-10% of breast cancer cases depending on the ethnic population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup>. Although BRCA1/2 are involved in the repair of double-strand breaks in DNA, human evidence suggests a relationship between <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutations, sex hormone levels, and cancer risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup>. In addition, progesterone has been shown to play a role in mammary tumorigenesis of <italic>Brca1/p53</italic> mutant mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup>. However, the molecular mediators of <italic>BRCA1/2</italic>-associated risk and sex steroid exposure have not been identified.</p><p>RANKL (receptor activator of NF-&#x003ba;B ligand), its receptor RANK, and the natural inhibitor osteoprotegerin (OPG) are essential for the development and activation of osteoclasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup>. Based on these findings, RANKL inhibition with a monoclonal antibody has been successfully developed as a rational therapy against osteoporosis and skeletal-related events in cancer patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup>. In addition, RANKL/RANK are essential for the formation of a lactating mammary gland during pregnancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup>. RANKL is secreted by estrogen receptor (ER)- and progesterone receptor (PR)-positive mammary epithelial cells in response to progesterone, and subsequently acts in a paracrine fashion on ER/PR-negative epithelial progenitor cells, promoting proliferation and expansion of mammary epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup>. Using genetic mouse models, we and others have previously shown that RANKL/RANK control progestin-driven mammary cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup>. Interestingly, RANK signaling acts on progenitor cells, which are also believed to be &#x0201c;seed cells&#x0201d; for triple-negative breast cancer in carriers with <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup>. We therefore speculated that RANKL/RANK might have a role in the etiology of <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutation-driven breast cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Genetic inactivation of Rank protects from <italic>Brca1</italic> deletion-driven tumorigenesis</title><p>In mice the incidence of mammary tumors in the presence of only <italic>Brca1</italic> mutation is low. Therefore, to directly assess the role of RANKL/RANK in <italic>Brca1</italic> mutation-mediated tumorigenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>, we first deleted <italic>Brca1</italic> and <italic>p53</italic> in basal mammary epithelial cells and mammary progenitor cells using K5Cre mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> to induce mammary cancer as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup>. This line was then crossed into <italic>Rank<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice to examine <italic>Brca1</italic> deletion-induced tumorigenesis in the presence or absence of RANK expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figures S1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S2</xref>). All mouse lines examined appeared to develop normal mammary glands at puberty. In 4-month-old control <italic>K5Cre;Brca1;p53</italic> double-mutant mice, we observed widespread epithelial hyperplasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S3</xref>) as well as low and high-grade mammary intraepithelial neoplasias (MINs) and invasive carcinomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1C</xref>). The mammary glands of age-matched females with concomitant ablation of <italic>Rank</italic> appeared largely normal, displaying a significantly lower number of MINs and no detectable carcinomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S3</xref>). Quantification of branching points in whole mount stainings from female littermates further showed that loss of RANK significantly decreased proliferation and pre-neoplasia observed in the absence of <italic>Brca1</italic> and <italic>p53</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S1C</xref>). Enhanced proliferation of mammary epithelial cells in <italic>K5Cre;Brca1;p53</italic> double-mutant mice was confirmed using Ki67 immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S1D</xref>). Importantly, we observed marked DNA damage in both double- and triple-mutant mice as determined by &#x003b3;H2AX immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S1E</xref>). DNA damage was confirmed using a second marker, p53BP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S4A</xref>). Moreover, low- and high-grade MINs that developed in 4-month-old double- and triple-mutant mice expressed Cytokeratin5 (KRT5/CK5) and &#x003b2;-catenin, confirming the basal epithelial origin of these tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S4C</xref>). These data show that genetic deletion of <italic>Rank</italic> in basal mammary epithelial cells markedly abrogates the development of intraepithelial neoplasms and invasive carcinomas as a consequence of <italic>Brca1;p53</italic> mutations.</p><p>The occurrence of skin cancer commonly observed in the <italic>K5Cre;Brca1;p53</italic> double-<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> as well as <italic>K5Cre;Rank;Brca1;p53</italic> triple-mutant mice precluded further analysis of mammary tumorigenesis beyond the 4 month time point. We therefore switched the Cre deleter line and introduced all three conditional alleles onto a WapCre<sup>C</sup> mouse background<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S5A</xref>). Of note, in this mouse line, the whey-acid protein (Wap) activity is independent of doxycycline and pregnancy, and the Cre activity is present in both luminal and basal epithelial cells in the mammary gland<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S2</xref>). As expected from our previous work using whole-body <italic>Rank</italic> mutants or MMTVCre- and K5Cre-driven <italic>Rank</italic> deletion, WapCre<sup>C</sup>-mediated <italic>Rank</italic> deletion had no apparent effect on formation of the mammary gland during puberty (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S5B</xref>). While all <italic>WapCre<sup>C</sup>;Brca1;p53</italic> mutant females developed palpable tumors starting around day 100 after birth, concomitant <italic>Rank</italic> deletion in the mammary epithelium significantly delayed tumor onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The median tumor onset for <italic>WapCre<sup>C</sup>;Brca1;p53</italic> mice was 158 days, whereas the median onset for <italic>WapCre<sup>C</sup>;Rank;Brca1;p53</italic> triple-mutant mice was 184 days. Importantly, while all <italic>WapCre<sup>C</sup>;Brca1;p53</italic> double-mutant females developed mammary carcinomas, 25% of <italic>WapCre<sup>C</sup>;Rank;Brca1;p53</italic> triple-mutant littermates never developed any tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This was also reflected by the overall survival rates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S5C</xref>), even when we followed these females up to 2 years of age. Once mammary tumors developed in both double- and triple-mutant mice, their growth curves appeared to be similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S5D</xref>). Thus, <italic>WapCre<sup>C</sup></italic>-driven deletion of <italic>Rank</italic> delays the onset and in 25% of cases even completely prevents the development of <italic>Brca1;p53</italic> mutation-driven mammary cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Loss of RANK impairs tumor progression to high-grade malignancies</title><p>Histopathologic analysis revealed that double-knockout <italic>WapCre<sup>C</sup>;Brca1;p53</italic> mice feature high-grade tumors (60%) as well as intermediate-grade tumors (40%). These high-grade tumors typically exhibit more foci with higher degrees of anisocytosis and anisokaryosis, higher mitotic rates and fewer regions of glandular differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S6A</xref>). By contrast, triple-knockout mice never developed high-grade tumors but displayed intermediate-grade tumors characterized by low to intermediate anisocytosis and anisokaryosis, low to moderate mitotic rate and some foci of glandular differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S6A</xref>). In these tumors we observed effective deletion of <italic>Rank</italic>, <italic>Brca1</italic> and <italic>p53</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S6C</xref>). All intermediate-grade tumors that developed in double- and triple-mutant mice expressed the basal epithelial marker CK5; however, in high-grade tumors from <italic>WapCre<sup>C</sup>;Brca1;p53</italic> double-mutant females we observed marked downregulation of CK5 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S7B</xref>), supporting the notion of manifest epithelial dedifferentiation of these high-grade mammary cancers. Similar to CK5, we detected high expression of the basal myoepithelial marker p63 in <italic>Rank</italic> mutant tumors, whereas p63 expression was largely lost in the high-grade tumors from <italic>WapCre<sup>C</sup>;Brca1;p53</italic> double-mutant females (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S7C</xref>). Tumor cells of both cohorts still expressed &#x003b2;-catenin, confirming the epithelial lineage, whereas ER&#x003b1; and PRs were not detectable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S7D-S7F</xref>), confirming that these tumors are hormone receptor negative.

Therefore, they better mimic the genetics of the human situation prior to the development of overt breast tumors, which is when a prophylactic would be used. 3/10 (33%) <italic>MMTV-Cre;Brca1<sup>flox11/flox11</sup></italic> females developed pre-neoplastic lesions in the control group (Mu-Fc-treated).

Further characterization of the mammary lesions by immunohistochemistry verified that these lesions were of epithelial origin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S11B</xref>).

To assess this hypothesis, we performed ovariectomy (ovx) on female mice followed by sham treatment (no hormones) or reconstitution with estrogen and progesterone (E+P). As previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup>, sex hormone treatment resulted in a marked expansion of Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup>CD49f<sup>hi</sup> basal mammary progenitor cells in both control as well as <italic>WapCre<sup>C</sup>;Brca1;p53</italic> double-mutant mice; however, this expansion was markedly reduced in the absence of RANK expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S12A</xref>). We also observed expansion of the basal Lin-CD24<sup>+</sup>CD49f<sup>hi</sup> progenitor compartment in sham operated <italic>WapCre;Brca1;p53</italic> double-mutant mice, a phenotype that was again dependent on the expression of RANK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S12A</xref>). Sex hormone-driven proliferation in ovx females was further determined by <italic>in vivo</italic> BrdU labelling. <italic>WapCre<sup>C</sup></italic>-driven deletion of <italic>Brca1</italic> and <italic>p53</italic> resulted in markedly increased numbers of cycling mammary epithelial cells; this sex hormone-induced proliferation of mammary epithelial cells was significantly reduced in <italic>Rank</italic> mutant females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Importantly, deletion of <italic>Rank</italic> significantly abrogated the <italic>in vitro</italic> colony formation capacity of basal Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup>CD49f<sup>hi</sup> mammary progenitors from <italic>WapCre<sup>C</sup>;Brca1;p53</italic> mutant mice; the colony formation capacity within the ER<sup>&#x02212;</sup>PR<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Sca1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> alveolar progenitor compartment was also lower in the absence of RANK, albeit less pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Similar to our data using <italic>WapCre<sup>C</sup></italic> deleter mice, sex hormone treatment resulted in expansion of the basal Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup>CD49f<sup>hi</sup> progenitor compartment in ovarectomized <italic>K5Cre;Brca1;p53</italic> double-knockout mice as compared with sham operated mice, while this expansion was not observed in the absence of RANK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S12B</xref>). Thus, RANKL/RANK control sex hormone-induced expansion and activity of <italic>Brca1;p53</italic> mutant basal mammary progenitor cells. To determine the relevance of these results for the human disease, we isolated mammary progenitor cells from three women carriers of heterozygous <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutations who underwent prophylactic mastectomy, which is the standard of care. Importantly, <italic>in vitro</italic> colony-forming cell (CFC) assays performed on these human breast epithelial cells showed that RANKL inhibition using the clinically approved RANKL blocking antibody Denosumab significantly decreased the frequency of colony-forming cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S12C</xref>), indicating suppression of human mammary progenitor activity.

A similar pattern was observed for RANKL protein expression which was detectable in 40.8% of tumors from <italic>BRCA</italic> WT patients, with intermediate or high expression in only 5.1% of breast cancer samples, but which was found in 59.1% of malignant tumors from <italic>BRCA1</italic> germline mutation carriers with intermediate or high expression in 14.8% samples. Similarly, 69.6% of tumors from <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutation carriers expressed RANKL with intermediate or high expression in 12.5% samples (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). There was also a highly significant correlation between tumor grade and RANK protein expression in the overall series. While low-grade (G1) tumors expressed intermediate or high RANK levels in 28% of cases, 50.8% of grade 2 (G2) and 73.3% of all grade 3 (G3) tumors exhibited intermediate or high RANK protein expression (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S12D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Table S1</xref>). RANKL protein staining was detected in 41.7% of G1 tumors, 56.3% of G2 tumors, and 51.2% of G3 tumors and there was no significant difference in respect to grading (<italic>P</italic> = 0.47) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S12D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Table S1</xref>). We next analyzed whether RANK expression was already present in the earliest tumor lesions detectable in the breast tissue of <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutation carriers. In all cases of such early lesions analyzed (<italic>n</italic> = 11 patients) including flat epithelial atypia and intraductal papillomas we detected high RANK expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, RANK is highly expressed in pre-malignant lesions as well as in breast cancer that has developed in <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutation carriers.</p></sec><sec><title>Common variants in RANK are associated with increased breast cancer risk in human <italic>BRCA</italic> mutation carriers</title><p>Since RANK/RANKL critically influence <italic>Brca1</italic> mutation-driven breast carcinogenesis in mice, we assessed the role of genetic modifiers of breast cancer risk in women with inherited <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutations at the corresponding locus encoding for human RANK, <italic>TNFRSF11A</italic>. This analysis was performed using data from the Collaborative Oncological Gene-environment Study (iCOGS) that included 51 <italic>TNFRSF11A</italic> single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in &#x0223c;15 200 <italic>BRCA1</italic> and &#x0223c;8 200 <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutation carriers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Table S2</xref>). Using a retrospective likelihood approach, we identified six SNPs that were significantly associated with breast cancer risk in the overall series of <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutation carriers and/or in ER-negative or triple-negative subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Table S2</xref>).

Interestingly, the rs884205 change (C&#x02192;A) introduces an ATTAAA motif in the 3&#x02032;-untranslated (3&#x02032;-UTR) region of <italic>TNFRSF11A</italic>, providing a poly(A) signal for the nearby alternative polyA site (PolyA_DB Hs.204044.1.8; PolyA-seq GSE30198). Of note, the minor A allele, which we find predicts increased risk of breast cancer, correlates with enhanced RANK expression in various tissues using GTEX analysis, and the same allele has been previously associated with decreased bone density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup>, consistent with an over-activation of RANK-mediated signaling. Moreover, the G allele of rs4485469 was found to be associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer in the <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutation carriers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Tables S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S3</xref>), and we again find increased RANK expression linked to the complementary allele (A) in GTEX data. To assess these observations further, we analyzed data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup>. While rs884205 was not present in TCGA, it was partially correlated (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x02248; 0.45) with two included variants, rs2957137 and rs3018354; a survival analysis using the recessive model for these variants revealed a significant association in ER-negative, but not in ER-positive breast cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These two SNPs were not genotyped in iCOGS, but their imputed results (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x0003e; 0.94) again revealed significant associations (<italic>P</italic> = 0.021) with breast cancer risk in <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutation carriers, with effect estimations similar to rs884205: rs2957137 HR = 1.079, rs3018354 HR = 1.052. Moreover, expression analyses revealed that the ER-negative tumors with poorer prognosis have activated RANK signaling, as shown by their positive expression correlation with time series signatures of RANK overexpression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

Since RANKL is induced by progesterone, these data could explain why sex hormones, in particular progesterone, play an important role in <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutation-driven tumorigenesis in mouse models and humans. Studies have also demonstrated that <italic>Brca1</italic> deficiency increases the activity of E+P signaling pathways during mammary gland development and promotes mammary epithelial cell growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup>.

The importance of PR signaling in mutant <italic>Brca1</italic> tumorigenesis was further demonstrated by Poole <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> who showed that tumor development in <italic>Brca1/p53</italic> deficient mice could be prevented by the PR antagonist RU-486. Together, these findings highlight the potential value for RANKL inhibition in <italic>BRCA1</italic>-associated cancers at the early stages of tumorigenesis. Whether RANKL inhibition has an advantage over Tamoxifen and/or oophorectomy needs to be demonstrated in future experiments, especially in careful, clinical trials.</p><p>We also report, analyzing iCOGS data for more than 23 000 women with germline <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutations, that common variation in <italic>TNFRSF11A</italic>, linked to altered <italic>RANK</italic> expression, may be associated with breast cancer risk in <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutation carriers and, furthermore, the survival of patients with ER-negative tumors. Some of these identified polymorphisms are directly associated with altered gene expression and function of RANK. Further fine-scale mapping genetic analyses and studies on the regulation of RANK expression, and also expression of RANKL and the natural RANK inhibitor OPG, are warranted, since the 3&#x02032;-UTR of RANK can be additionally regulated by various microRNAs, some of which have been directly associated with human breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup>. Since <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutation carriers are at high risk of ovarian cancer, it will be important to also explore the role of RANKL/RANK blockade in ovarian carcinogenesis. Most importantly, our work here shows that pharmacological inhibition of RANKL almost completely prevents the development of pre-neoplastic lesions due to a <italic>Brca1</italic> mutation. Our findings therefore raise the possibility that inhibition of RANKL, for which there is an already approved drug with a good safety record, could offer a novel, targeted approach for breast cancer prevention in <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutation carriers.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p><italic>Rank<sup>floxed</sup></italic> (<italic>Tnfrsf11</italic><sup>tm1.1Pngr</sup>) and <italic>WapCre<sup>C</sup>;Brca1<sup>floxed</sup>;p53<sup>floxed</sup></italic> (<italic>Tg-WapCre<sup>C</sup></italic>, <italic>Brca1</italic><sup>tm2Cxd</sup>, and <italic>Trp53</italic><sup>tm1Elee</sup>) knockout mice have been previously generated in our laboratories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup>.

Significantly differentially expressed (DE) genes were selected with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%. Pathway enrichment was evaluated using GSEA against the Molecular Signature Database MSigDB v5 gene-set collection. For GSEA, human to mouse conversion of official gene symbols was performed using HomoloGene ortholog assignment. Gene sets with significant enrichment were selected based on a FDR <italic>q</italic>-value cut-off of 1%. RNAseq data and GSEA analysis data have been deposited to the NCBI Expression Omnibus and all data are accessible through the GEO accession number GSE71362 (NCBI tracking system &#x00023;17490198).

Using Hallmark GSEA analysis, we found enhanced expression of genes annotated to Wnt-catenin signaling, Notch signaling, the p53 pathway, late estrogen response, and Ras signaling in <italic>Rank</italic>-deficient tumors, whereas genes annotated to Myc and E2F targets, mTORC1 signaling, G2M checkpoint and mitotic spindle, inflammation and allograft rejection, as well as the unfolded protein response (UPR) were significantly upregulated in the double-knockout tumors. Of note, the UPR has recently been associated with triple-negative breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup>, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have been linked to tumorigenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup>, and multiple cross-talks have been established between the Wnt and RANKL/RANK pathways, including molecular cross-talks that control mammary progenitor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup>. Thus, <italic>Rank</italic> inactivation in a <italic>WapCre<sup>C</sup>;Brca1;p53</italic> mutant background results in mammary tumors that exhibit expression differences in genes annotated to oncogenesis, basic metabolism, RNA metabolism, or the regulation of mammary stem cells. The GSEA tool was run using default values for all parameters and using the <italic>t</italic>-statistic of the difference of gene expression between ER-negative tumors with the AA+AB and BB genotypes.
