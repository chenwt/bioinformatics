How cells compete is poorly understood, but it is generally accepted that molecular exchange between cells signals elimination of unfit cells. Here we report an orthogonal mechanism of cell competition, whereby cells compete through mechanical insults. We show that MDCK cells silenced for the polarity gene <italic>scribble</italic> (<italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup>) are hypersensitive to compaction, that interaction with wild-type cells causes their compaction and that crowding is sufficient for <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cell elimination. Importantly, we show that elevation of the tumour suppressor p53 is necessary and sufficient for crowding hypersensitivity. Compaction, via activation of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) and the stress kinase p38, leads to further p53 elevation, causing cell death. Thus, in addition to molecules, cells use mechanical means to compete. Given the involvement of p53, compaction hypersensitivity may be widespread among damaged cells and offers an additional route to eliminate unfit cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="i1" xlink:href="ncomms11373-i1.jpg"/>Cell competition is a quality control mechanism to eliminate unfit cells.

However, the mechanisms by which <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells are killed by wild-type cells are largely unknown.

We find that <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells are hypersensitive to compaction and that this is due to elevation of baseline p53 levels, which is both necessary and sufficient to induce hypersensitivity to crowding and confer a mechanical loser status. We further show that on contact with wild-type cells, <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells become compacted into a high-density arrangement and that compaction is not only required but also sufficient to eliminate <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells. We also delineate the mechano-transduction cascade that leads to <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cell death. Specifically, we show that <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells' compaction causes activation of the Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), which in turn activates p38 leading to further p53 elevation and cell death. Overall, this work demonstrates that mechanical forces can be responsible for the elimination of cells during cell competition and that p53 levels play a key role both in instructing the mechanical loser status and in the execution of mechanical cell competition.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Compaction of <italic>scrib</italic>

</sup> cells induces mechanical competition</title><p>It has previously been shown that <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> MDCK cells are eliminated when co-cultured with wild-type MDCK cells through cell death and delamination (see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>, left), while monocultures of <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells are viable (see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>, right). To investigate the mechanisms of <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup>-mediated cell competition, we first asked whether it is mediated by soluble factors, as in other cases of <italic>in vitro</italic> cell competition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Growth rate (doubling time) profiles showed that <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells in pure cultures divide, albeit at a reduced rate, to reach a steadily maintained number (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>), whereas under competing conditions, their numbers collapse following initial growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the growth rate of <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells is not affected by conditioned medium from competing cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). Similarly, in transwell systems that allow exchange of solutes but prevent cell contact, <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells grown together with co-cultures of competing (wild-type/<italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup>) cells grew comparably to <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells grown with other <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). This indicated that soluble factors are not sufficient to induce cell competition and that cell contact is required. We hypothesized that cell contact enables molecular interactions essential for cell competition, as observed by others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. However, to our surprise, we found that sustained contact with wild-type cells is not sufficient for elimination of <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>, black arrow and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 2</xref>) and that <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> clones are efficiently eliminated only when fully surrounded by wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>, white arrow and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 2</xref>). This suggested that a type of exchange other than molecular signalling (which would be enabled by contact) may be needed, and prompted us to look for differences between <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> clones that were surrounded and peripheral clones that were simply contacted.</p><p>One striking feature of surrounded clones, which is not shared by peripheral clones, is that they reach a dramatically higher cell density than confluent <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> pure cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e&#x02013;g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>). <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells acquire a flattened morphology upon gene silencing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, which at confluence results in a much lower (&#x0223c;1/3) final density compared with wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e&#x02013;g</xref>). However, <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> clones surrounded by wild-type cells do not flatten and reach a density that is &#x0223c;4.5-fold higher than that of pure <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e&#x02013;g</xref>). Furthermore, competing <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells are taller than when grown in single cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h&#x02013;j</xref>). Together, this indicates that as a result of their interaction with wild-type cells, <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells become more compacted than in their default state and this correlates with and precedes their elimination.</p><p>We next asked whether cell compaction plays a role in <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cell elimination, by assessing its effect on <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells in complete absence of wild-type cells. To that end, we used micropatterns to form <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> microcultures of a defined, homogenous density and size (&#x000d8;=800&#x02009;&#x003bc;m, ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). When plated at high density, control cells that had not undergone <italic>scribble</italic> silencing (without tetracycline, &#x02212;TET) continued to grow until they reached a maximal density of 61&#x000b1;4 cells per 10,000&#x02009;&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>, which they maintained homeostatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1k,l</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 3</xref>, left), as previously shown<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Remarkably, <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cultures (&#x0002b;TET) instead saw their numbers and densities drop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1m,n</xref>, dark green and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 3</xref>, right), due to a combination of increased cell death and extrusion, the same two events that lead to the elimination of <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells during cell competition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>, left and ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Notably, <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells seeded at a lower density maintained that initial density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1n</xref>, light green) indicating that the drop in cell number observed at higher density is not a general response of <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells to plating. This suggested that <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells are hypersensitive to compaction. To test this directly, we seeded confluent monolayers of control (&#x02212;TET) or <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> (&#x0002b;TET) cells on stretched polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates, which we then released to induce cell compression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Control cultures showed no increase in apoptosis upon compression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1o&#x02013;q</xref>). The <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells, however, displayed a 3-fold increase in apoptosis over their uncompressed baseline cell death, which was already higher than control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1p,q</xref>). Altogether, these experiments show that <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells display hypersensitivity to cell density and cannot sustain levels of crowding normally reached by wild-type cells. They further indicate that compaction of <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells into higher cell densities, like those imposed on them by wild-type cells during competition, is sufficient to induce cell death. This suggests that wild-type cells eliminate <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells through crowding-induced compaction. We name this new mode of selective elimination of one cell population by another due to differential sensitivity to crowding &#x02018;mechanical cell competition', to contrast it with forms of cell competition that rely on molecular exchange.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Corralling promotes but is not needed for <italic>scrib</italic>

<italic>KD</italic>
</sup> elimination</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f,g</xref>, in subconfluent competing cultures, the density of <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells surpasses that of surrounding wild-type cells. This indicates that their acquired density does not simply reflect the density of the mixed culture, but is the result of an active process. To understand how <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells become compacted during competition, we plated cells at low density and observed what happens when wild-type and <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> clones first come into contact. Strikingly, we saw that, on contact, both <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> and wild-type cells engage in collective cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 4</xref>). This behaviour was specific to wild-type/<italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> encounters, as it was not observed upon homotypic encounters of either cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 5</xref>). Interestingly, this migration was highly directional with <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells always at the migrating front and, conversely, wild-type cells always at the back. We next characterized this migratory behaviour and assessed its contribution to cell compaction and elimination. First, we repeated the above experiment using a fluorescent nuclear label in each population to facilitate cell tracking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Kymograph analysis showed rapid activation of collective cell migration at the time of contact between wild-type and <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells, with both populations moving synchronously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>, top and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). By contrast, similar kymographs of homotypic collisions did not show significant cell displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>, centre and bottom; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). To further characterize the features of this collective cell migration, we carried out single-cell tracking of both cell populations before and after contact. The analysis of individual cell trajectories shows that single-cell movement is faster and more persistent for both wild-type and <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells upon heterotypic collision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a&#x02013;d</xref>). We then looked more closely at the dynamic interplay between wild-type and <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells at the onset of migration. Interestingly, analysis of cell shape at the interface between the two populations revealed that both wild-type and <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells become elongated at the site of contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g,h</xref>), indicating that they are under anisotropic stress. Moreover, the cells in both populations move in the direction of their short axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2i</xref>), suggesting that they could be locally compressed. This could be the result of wild-type cells beginning migration and locally &#x02018;piling up' against the <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells. In agreement with this, particle image velocimetry (PIV) and single-cell tracking revealed that wild-type cells begin migrating towards <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells on average &#x0223c;2&#x02009;h before the <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells start migrating away (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2j,k</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 6</xref>). Together, the chronology of these events and the local cellular deformations suggest that cells might engage in a behaviour similar to the &#x02018;chase and run' migration reported for other cell types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. These experiments do not distinguish whether <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells are pushed by wild-type cells or, conversely, whether <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells self-compact to avoid closer interaction wild-type cells. However, it is clear that as migration progresses, <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells become corralled by wild-type cells and are compacted and eliminated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 7</xref>), indicating that this behaviour may facilitate compaction and outcompetition of <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells.</p><p>To directly test the relevance of directional cell migration in the elimination of <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells, we next sought to disrupt this behaviour. Adhesion molecules play an important role in collective cell migration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> and have also been implicated in &#x02018;chase and run' among mesenchymal cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. In addition, <italic>scribble</italic> downregulation has previously been shown to induce intracellular accumulation of E-cadherin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> and we found that it causes an increase of both total and cell surface E-cadherin levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2e&#x02013;g</xref>). We therefore reasoned that targeting E-cadherin-mediated adhesion might disrupt directional migration between the wild-type and <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells. We undertook two separate approaches and found that either blocking E-cadherin function in both populations, through a combination of low calcium and addition of a blocking antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2l&#x02013;o</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 8</xref>), or silencing E-cadherin only in wild-type cells (<italic>E-cad</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2p</xref>) was sufficient to inhibit directional migration. Interestingly, disruption of E-cadherin inhibited active cell compaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2l,m</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 8</xref> and quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2n</xref>) and resulted in delayed elimination of <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2l,m</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 8</xref> and quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2o</xref>). However, it did not rescue the <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells from cell competition, since they were eventually eliminated as the culture became progressively more crowded due to proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2l,m</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 8</xref>).</p><p>Having established that E-cadherin-mediated adhesion is involved in contact-induced migration between wild-type and <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells, we next asked whether the upregulation of E-cadherin observed in <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2e&#x02013;g</xref>) plays a role in this directional cell movement.

Consistent with an involvement of p38, we found that compression alone causes an increase in active phosphorylated (T180/Y182) p38 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>; P-p38) in <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>) and that chemical inhibition of this pathway partially rescues both the homeostatic density of <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>) and their compaction hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Moreover, the upregulation of p53 in competing <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup>cells was reduced by p38 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). We conclude that in <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells, compression induces p53 via activation of p38.</p><p>We next asked how compression of <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells causes p38 activation. We monitored cytoskeletal changes induced by compression and found that both cortical Actin (by phalloidin staining) and active phosphorylated-myosin (P-Myosin) are upregulated in compacted <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells during competition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f,g</xref>). Since the cytoskeletal regulator ROCK<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> is one of the main kinases responsible for Myosin phosphorylation, this suggested that ROCK might be activated. Indeed P-Myosin upregulation was reduced in the presence of a ROCK inhibitor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a,b</xref>) and the ROCK target phospho-MYPT1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>; p-MYPT1) was also elevated in compacted <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4h</xref>), indicating that ROCK is activated in compacted <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells. This was potentially relevant because ROCK has been shown to phosphorylate p38 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). Thus, to ask whether ROCK is upstream of p38 activation, we compressed pure cultures of <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells in the presence or absence of a ROCK inhibitor and looked at P-p38 levels. ROCK inhibition led to a partial reduction of P-p38 levels, thus placing ROCK upstream of p38 signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4i,j</xref>). In addition, ROCK inhibition was sufficient to partially rescue the homeostatic density of <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4k</xref>) and compression-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4l</xref>). Importantly, inhibition of ROCK was also sufficient to prevent the out-competition of <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells, with no appreciable cell death observed even though cells were compacted far beyond standard competition densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4m</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 12</xref>). Altogether, these experiments indicate that mechanical cell competition is caused by compaction-induced ROCK activation, which activates p38, leading to p53 elevation and cell death. Interestingly, ROCK has also been implicated in apical extrusion of dying or crowded MDCK cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. However, in the case of Scribble competition, ROCK has a different function, as it is involved in p53 activation and cell death. In addition, while in that context ROCK was activated by S1P2 and Piezo signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, inhibition of these pathways had no effect on Scribble cell competition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a,b</xref>), suggesting a distinct upstream activation mechanism.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>p53 activation turns wild-type cells into mechanical losers</title><p>Finally, we decided to address how <italic>scribble</italic> knockdown earmarks cells as losers. Our data indicated that a loser cell status is not an obligate outcome of <italic>scribble</italic> silencing, as we could isolate <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells that are competition resistant (<italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>RES</italic></sup> cells; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>). Instead, our data showed that p53 is necessary for competition and that mild p53 elevation is required for <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells to acquire key features of the mechanical loser status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h,i</xref>). This prompted us to investigate whether p53 might actually be sufficient to induce the mechanical loser status and cell competition. Nutlin-3, a chemical inhibitor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (Mouse Double Minute 2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>)), activates p53 in a dose-dependent manner. This allowed us to establish conditions to induce mild p53 activation in wild-type MDCK cells. Strikingly, low-level p53 activation was sufficient to induce cell flattening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>) and to lower the homeostatic density of wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Remarkably, Nutlin-3 treatment was also sufficient to induce compaction hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Thus, mild p53 activation is sufficient to induce in wild-type cells all the features that we observed in <italic>scrib</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> cells that are hallmarks of their mechanical loser status. Therefore, we next asked whether differential p53 levels are sufficient to induce mechanical cell competition. To test this, we generated a p53 knockout cell line (<italic>p53</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>), which we then co-cultured with wild-type cells. Not surprisingly, simply mixing wild-type and <italic>p53</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells was not sufficient to induce competition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>). Strikingly however, mild p53 activation in wild-type cells, by Nutlin-3 addition at sublethal doses, caused the elimination of these cells specifically in the co-culture, but not when they were cultured alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 13</xref>). Importantly, p53-induced cell competition was indistinguishable from <italic>scribble</italic> cell competition, as it resulted in loser cell compaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>) and only caused elimination when cells were compacted by <italic>p53</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrate that mild elevation of p53 is sufficient to phenocopy Scribble cell competition and induce both hypersensitivity to cell crowding and the mechanical loser status in otherwise wild-type cells.</p><p>To demonstrate the existence of p53-mediated mechanical cell competition beyond the MDCK experimental paradigm, we turned to primary cultures of epithelial cells, specifically to mouse tracheal epithelial cells (MTECs), and looked for evidence of this process.

Interestingly however, when we induced mild elevation of p53 (by Nutlin-3 treatment) in these cultures, we found that this results in a 26&#x00025; average reduction in cell density, accompanied by cell extrusion, suggesting acquired hypersensitivity to crowding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f,g</xref>, compare before and after Nutlin-3 addition, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 14</xref>, left, after Nutlin-3 addition). To test whether differential levels of p53 could induce cell competition in MTECs, we mixed Tomato-labelled wild-type MTECs (MTEC Tomato; from <italic>Rosa</italic>26R-nTomato-nGFP mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>) either with unlabelled wild-type MTECs or with unlabelled p53 null MTECs (MTEC <italic>p53</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>; from p53 null mice). Before Nutlin-3 addition, the proportion of wild-type (Tomato) MTECs in the monolayer did not change for several days when co-cultured with either <italic>p53</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells or more wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f&#x02013;i</xref>, first two time points, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 14</xref>, before Nutlin-3 addition). However and strikingly, Nutlin-3 addition induced robust cell competition specifically in wild-type/<italic>p53</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MTEC co-cultures, causing the number of wild-type cells to plummet within 6 days to &#x0223c;17&#x00025; of their starting number, with pronounced cell death and fragmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5h,i</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 14</xref>, right).
