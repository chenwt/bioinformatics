There is no common genetic molecular feature that would allow for the identification of patients at risk for developing recurrences and thus selecting patients who would benefit from more stringent therapies still poses a major clinical challenge. Recently, an international multicenter consortium (CRC Subtyping Consortium) was established aiming at the classification of CRC patients in biologically homogeneous CRC subtypes. Four consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) were identified, of which the mesenchymal CMS4 presented with worse prognosis signifying the importance of identifying these patients. Despite the large number of samples analyzed and their clear association with unifying biological programs and clinical features, single-driver mutations could not be identified and patients are heterogeneous with regard to currently used clinical markers. We therefore set out to define the regulatory mechanisms underlying the distinct gene expression profiles using a network-based approach involving multiple molecular modalities such as gene expression, methylation levels and microRNA (miR) expression. The miR-200 family presented as the most powerful determinant of CMS4-specific gene expression, tuning the majority of genes differentially expressed in the poor prognosis subtype, including genes associated with the epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition program. Furthermore, our data show that two epigenetic marks, namely the methylation of the two miR-200 promoter regions, can identify tumors belonging to the mesenchymal subtype and is predictive of disease-free survival in CRC patients. Importantly, epigenetic silencing of the miR-200 family is also detected in epithelial CRC cell lines that belong to the mesenchymal CMS. We thus show that determining regulatory networks is a powerful strategy to define drivers of distinct cancer subtypes, which possess the ability to identify subtype affiliation and to shed light on biological behavior.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease, which until recently has only been reflected by (i) histopathological classification, (ii) single molecular conditions such as microsatellite instability (MSI) and (iii) mutation status of major cancer genes. However, the diversity of the disease has made it difficult to accurately classify and treat CRC patients. Only lately, CRC patients have been categorized using unsupervised classification of gene expression profiling which resulted in the identification of distinct CRC subtypes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> In an effort to generate a unified classification system, the CRC Subtyping Consortium (CRCSC) was established, which identified the existence of four consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) in a large panel of CRC patients (<italic>n</italic>=4151).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Different CMSs associate with specific molecular, biological and clinical features and thus present distinct entities. Linking the subtypes to disease outcome revealed that the mesenchymal CMS4 displayed worse prognosis, highlighting the clinical relevance of this approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup></p><p>To date subtyping of CRC based on gene expression data has not taken regulatory networks into account, thus the underlying determinants remain elusive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> In glioblastoma such a transcriptional network driving the expression of mesenchymal genes of a poor prognosis subtype was identified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> Also in ovarian and gastric carcinoma a poor prognosis mesenchymal subtype was detected, driven by a microRNA (miR) regulatory network.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> miRs are short noncoding RNAs that regulate translation of mRNAs into proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> Individual miRs can affect an extensive number of genes simultaneously,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> explaining their ability to influence expression of complete networks defining a cancer subtype. Of special interest with regard to driving poor prognosis subtypes is the ability of miRs to regulate the expression of genes associated with aggressive features of malignancies, such as the epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition (EMT).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Cancer cells undergoing EMT lose epithelial characteristics, such as polarity and cell&#x02013;cell adhesion, and gain mesenchymal features that allow them to disseminate to distant organs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> A direct link between miRs and EMT was firmly established and specifically the miR-200 family has been implicated in repressing the EMT-inducing zinc-finger E-box binding homeobox transcription factors ZEB1 and ZEB2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> thereby inhibiting the EMT program. Also in CRC miR-200 family members have been shown to regulate the transition between distinct cellular states,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> and to play a role in development of metastatic disease. Cells at the invasive front of tumors downregulate miR-200 expression, allowing them to undergo EMT and leave the primary tumor. This process is reversed in metastatic lesions, leading to the re-acquisition of an epithelial phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> The expression of miR-200 family members, and thus the orchestration of the EMT program, has been shown to be regulated by miR-200 promoter methylation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup></p><p>Herein, we describe a network-based approach enabling the identification of subtype-specific drivers to gain insight into the molecular determinants of distinct CRC subtypes. The dominant regulatory network identified in the CMS4 group consists of the miR-200 family. Methylation of the miR-200 promoter regions controls the activity of this network and is responsible for tuning the gene expression of the poor prognosis CMS. We show that in CRC the miR-200 family cannot only be used to define distinct cellular states, such as associated with the EMT program, but regulates subtype-specific gene expression, thus being a determinant for the subset of poor prognosis, mesenchymal CRCs. Defining the underlying regulatory network of CMS4 tumors allowed us to identify miR-200 promoter methylation as a molecular marker that can be used to determine subtype affiliation at early stages in tumor development and that presents an independent prognostic factor in stage II CRC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Gene expression profiling identifies a heterogeneous group of poor prognosis CRCs</title><p>Based on gene expression profiling, CRCs can be divided into four main CMSs using a random forest classifier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> To illustrate this finding, the classifier was applied to a large publicly available data set of 566 colon cancer patients (Cartes d'Identit&#x000e9; des Tumeurs, CIT) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1a</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> A total of 557 patients were classified in one of the four CMSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1a and b</xref>). This gene expression-based classification allowed for the identification of distinct subsets of CRC. The largest CMS2 subgroup, for instance, associated with the well-characterized chromosomal-instable (CIN) type of CRC, as 95.5&#x00025; of the tumors identified as CMS2 were CIN&#x0002b; and mainly anatomically left-sided, displaying <italic>KRAS</italic> and/or <italic>TP53</italic> mutations. The CMS1 group contained a high level of MSI and CIMP&#x0002b; right-sided tumors, therefore associating with the reported MSI/CIMP&#x0002b; type of CRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> However, none of these molecular markers was able to unequivocally point to one subtype and especially tumors belonging to the CMS3 and CMS4 subtypes represented heterogeneous groups of CRC patients with respect to molecular aberrations commonly occurring in this disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). There was however a strong association of clinical characteristics, as the CMS1&#x02013;3 subgroups were enriched in stage I&#x0002b;II tumors, whereas more than 55&#x00025; of CMS4 tumors were classified as stage III&#x0002b;IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Although representing a mixed group based on molecular markers, we observed a significantly poorer prognosis for patients with CMS4 tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Therefore the clinical relevance of this approach was confirmed as it allows the identification of a subtype with significantly decreased disease-free survival (DFS).</p></sec><sec><title>A microRNA regulatory network accounts for differential gene expression between CMS1&#x02013;3 and CMS4 tumors</title><p>Mutation status or molecular characteristics such as MSI do not allow the distinction between the different CMSs, indicating that the driving force for specific cancer subtypes is more complex. To investigate which regulatory network is predominantly responsible for differences in gene expression between the subtypes we generated three regulatory networks comprising various dimensions of molecular regulation. In particular we studied (i) transcription factors (TFs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>), (ii) methylation marks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>) and (iii) microRNAs (miRs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) as putative subtype-specific regulators. Network analyses were performed to identify which level of regulation was most stringently associated with the subtype-specific gene expression distinction in the TCGA data set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1a</xref>). We chose to investigate the differences between CMS1&#x02013;3 and CMS4 tumors, as this mesenchymal subtype is associated with worse clinical outcome. The miR network, consisting of miRs significantly lower expressed in CMS4 compared with CMS1&#x02013;3 tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4a</xref>), was found to be the most powerful determinant of subtype-specific regulation of gene expression. The largest regulatory element was predicted to be responsible for 74.8&#x00025; of the variation in gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4b</xref>; based on reference networks; for comparisons with the other networks the percentage was calculated based on the transcriptional network with redundant edges removed based on ARACNE which resulted in a percentage of 61.9&#x00025;). The largest elements in the TF- and methylation mark-based regulatory networks account for approximately 10.3 and 10.4&#x00025;, respectively. The dominant regulatory element in the miR network was generated by the miR-200 family, namely miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141 and miR-429, representing miRs whose expression levels differ significantly between CMS1&#x02013;3 and CMS4 tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5a</xref>). The network analysis predicted that these miRs target similar genes, suggesting that the miR-200 family members are functionally related, which was confirmed by analyzing the overlap of genes most strongly predicted (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) to be regulated by one of the miR-200 family members based on the network analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5b</xref>).</p><p>These findings point to a critical role of the miR-200 regulatory network in orchestrating subtype-specific gene expression. As reported before, expression of the miR-200 family associated with low expression of mesenchymal genes and inhibition of the EMT program by modulating ZEB1 levels,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> thus the low abundance of mi-200 family members in CMS4 tumors could explain their mesenchymal phenotype.</p><p>Highlighting the genes belonging to an experimentally derived EMT signature in the inferred regulatory network revealed that many of the EMT-associated genes were indeed predicted to be regulated by the identified miRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> Most of the EMT genes belonged to the miR-200 family cluster, and reversely, further analysis revealed that 12 miRs, including all miR-200 family members, function as master regulators of the EMT signature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4c</xref>). Consistent with the idea that miR-200 members are instrumental in orchestrating an EMT signature in CMS4 tumors, the expression of genes present in an experimentally derived EMT signature was highly enriched in CMS4 tumors of the CIT data set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Methylation of promoter regions underlies differential expression of miR-200 family members</title><p>The members of the miR-200 family are organized as polycistronic transcripts on chromosome 1 (miR-200ba429) and chromosome 12 (miR-200c141).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> The methylation mark regulator network identified the methylation of the miR-200 loci as regulator of subtype-specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>) and promoter methylation has been described to regulate expression of miR-200 family members.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> Indeed, both miR-200 loci displayed significantly higher methylation levels in CMS4 CRC samples from the TCGA set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The methylation of the two loci was highly correlated, confirming the role of all miR-200 family members in regulating a common gene expression program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Furthermore, methylation of each locus significantly correlated with expression of the respective miR-200 family member (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S5c&#x02013;e</xref>), suggesting it to be decisive for the differential miR-200 expression. Additionally the EMT-inducing TF ZEB1, which is a direct target of the miR-200 family,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> was significantly higher expressed in tumors belonging to the CMS4 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>).</p><p>Recently, two independent studies reported that not the epithelium, but the abundance or activation of the stroma accounts for the mesenchymal status of this CRC subtype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> As miR-200 family expression is suggested to be regulated by methylation in stromal fibroblasts as well,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> the elevated levels of methylation could therefore simply reflect the amount of stroma in these tumors. However, our data point to the expression of ZEB1 in the epithelium of mesenchymal tumors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> suggesting that this mechanism of gene regulation is active in the malignant, epithelial part of CMS4 tumors. Indeed, the analysis of primary tumors and cell lines or xenografts derived from these cancers confirmed this observation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). In primary tumors, whose corresponding cell lines or xenografts do not display any miR-200 promoter methylation, this signal probably reflects the stromal content of these cancers. Yet, if miR-200 promoter methylation displays high levels in the primary tumors, it can also be detected in matching cell lines and xenografts, therefore methylation signals derived from the epithelial tumor cell fraction importantly contribute to this signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). To study miR-200 promoter methylation in the epithelial compartment more closely we made use of CRC cell lines stratified into the CMSs using gene expression data. Also in this <italic>in vitro</italic> culture system, we could detect methylation of the miR-200 promoter regions. Seventy-one percent of cell lines classified as CMS4 (5/7) presented with high miR-200 promoter methylation levels, whereas only one CMS1 cell line (14&#x00025;) and none of the cell lines classified as CMS2 and CMS3 displayed these methylation marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). The highest levels of miR-200 promoter methylation were detected in cell lines that also displayed low levels of miR-200 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Using decitabine the miR-200 loci were demethylated in two cell lines belonging to the mesenchymal subtype, which resulted in the upregulation of miR-200 family member expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Interfering with another component of epigenetic gene regulation, namely acetylation, by histone deacetylase inhibition using Panobinostat, did not modulate miR-200 family expression in a meaningful and consistent way (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>). These results indicate that repression of the miR-200 regulatory network by methylation is instrumental in controlling miR-200 expression and is indeed active in the epithelial compartment of CMS4 tumors.</p></sec><sec><title>miR-200 family members are instrumental for subtype-associated gene expression</title><p>To confirm the role of miR-200 family members in regulating subtype-specific gene expression, miR-200 family members were introduced in three CMS4 cell lines resulting in high levels of miR-200 family member expression, downregulation of ZEB1 and upregulation of E-Cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S10a</xref>). Gene expression profiles were derived from these lines and gene set enrichment analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> revealed that genes that were putatively regulated by miR-200 family members, that is, the miR-200 family regulon in the network analysis, were significantly enriched in the gene set that is regulated by miR-200 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S10b</xref>). Moreover, miR-200 overexpression in cell lines suppressed EMT-associated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>) and genes involved in matrix remodeling, migration and transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S10c&#x02013;e</xref>). Importantly, genes upregulated in CMS4 compared with CMS1&#x02013;3 tumors were significantly inhibited in the miR-200-overexpressing cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). To assess whether overexpression of miR-200 family members also has a functional impact, we introduced the two clusters into the primary colon cancer cell line RC511 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S11a</xref>). RC511 cells show high methylation of miR-200 promoter regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>) and classify as CMS4 based on gene expression (data not shown). Overexpression of miR-200 family members resulted in similar gene expression changes as observed in the above-mentioned cell lines: the EMT-inducing TF ZEB1 was downregulated and E-Cadherin expression was induced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S11b</xref>). Subcutaneous injection of RC511 cells into NSG mice revealed that overexpression of miR-200 family members renders the cells less aggressive, evidenced by slower tumor growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S11c</xref>) and longer survival time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S11d</xref>). In combination, these findings validate the notion that the miR-200 family represents an important determinant of subtype-specific gene expression and functional properties.</p></sec><sec><title>Methylation of the miR-200 loci is a determinant of CMS4 affiliation and is predictive of DFS</title><p>As miR-200 family members orchestrate subtype-specific gene expression, we speculated that the methylation of the miR-200 loci is a predictor of disease subtype and in consequence identifies patients with poor prognosis. We computed a binary logistic regression model using both miR-200 loci methylation levels as covariates. The resulting predicted probabilities were used to calculate the receiver operator characteristics curve, revealing that miR-200 loci methylation was indeed able to identify CMS4 affiliation in the TCGA data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Next, we sought to validate the utility of this test in an independent patient series. We therefore determined the methylation of the miR-200 promoter regions in the AMC-AJCCII-90 data set comprising only stage II CRC patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S1a and b</xref>). Tumors of the CMS4 group showed a significantly higher methylation of the miR-200 loci compared with tumors belonging to the other subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). The methylation of these two loci was highly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>); however, the methylation levels were not influenced by the CIMP status of the tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>), indicating that it is not a feature of tumors with overall higher DNA methylation, but that these regions are specifically methylated. DNA methylation in the patients displayed a gradient for both loci, in which CMS4 samples were enriched in the quartile displaying the highest DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S12a and b</xref>). Also in this data set, the combined methylation of the miR-200 loci was able to predict CMS4 affiliation with high confidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>).</p><p>Because detection of stage II CRC patients that harbor a poor prognosis is of utmost importance as this provides the opportunity to treat these patients with adjuvant therapy, we investigated if miR-200 methylation directly predicts patient prognosis.</p><p>DFS data are available for all patients of the AMC-AJCCII-90 set, in which disease recurrence largely represents detection of metastases in the liver, the lung or the peritoneal cavity. miR-200 promoter methylation was able to identify patients developing recurrences using a Cox proportional hazards regression model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). A Kaplan&#x02013;Meier (KM) curve was generated making use of a cutoff determined using this receiver operator characteristics curve. Indeed patients containing highly methylated tumors displayed a significantly poorer DFS compared with patients whose tumors showed lower methylation of the miR-200 loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). To exclude that the miR-200-based stratification leads to a separation of MSI samples that are known to have a better prognosis, the above-described analyses were performed using only microsatellite stable (MSS) patients of the TCGA and AMC-AJCCII-90 data sets, resulting in similar outcomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S13</xref>).</p><p>Multivariate analyses confirmed that miR-200 promoter methylation is an independent prognostic factor (<italic>P</italic>=0.002) in the AMC-AJCCII-90 data set also when taking T-stage, differentiation grade, MSS/MSI and <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation status into account (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). Hence, we identified the miR-200 promoter methylation as a critical molecular determinant of the mesenchymal CMS, therefore strongly correlating with the patient group that is at high risk for developing recurrences.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Gene expression profiling is a powerful tool to detect different patient subgroups and four distinct CRC CMSs have been identified in a large international multicenter study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Tumors belonging to the different CMSs present distinct entities characterized by unifying biological programs and specific survival rates. Yet, it is not clear whether there is a common underlying mechanism for differences in gene expression or distinct clinical outcome. Herein, a network-based approach was applied to investigate the drivers of specific CRC subgroups. Making use of the TCGA data set, we studied gene expression regulation on several dimensions, such as methylation and miRs. As CMS4 tumors display worse prognosis and are thus in need of early identification, we chose to validate our approach using the CMS1&#x02013;3 vs CMS4 distinction. This way, the miR-200 family was identified as subtype determinant.</p><p>The idea of an aggressive mesenchymal CMS in which epithelial cells gain malignant features by undergoing an EMT program has recently been challenged. Two studies report that not the epithelium, but the abundance or activation of the stroma causes the mesenchymal appearance of CMS4 tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> Indeed, stromal cells display methylation of the miR-200 loci and thus likely contribute to the observed miR-200 promoter methylation levels in primary tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> However, we demonstrate that this epigenetic regulatory loop is also active in epithelial cells, as the miR-200 promoter regions display high methylation levels in cell lines mainly belonging to the CMS4 subtype. We speculate that a shared, yet unidentified upstream mechanism is responsible for EMT induction in tumor epithelial cells, as well as for attracting abundant and activated mesenchymal cells to the cancer site.</p><p>The EMT is a process during which epithelial cells lose their cell&#x02013;cell junctions, and gain a mesenchymal, migratory and invasive phenotype, allowing them to leave the primary site and spread to distant organs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> Indeed, EMT has been linked to dismal outcome before.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> Two recent reports using mouse models enforce this notion, yet link EMT to therapy resistance rather than enhanced metastatic spread.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> Notwithstanding the exact mechanism, the mesenchymal phenotype has been linked to poor prognosis in patients for many cancer types, including CRC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup></p><p>As we describe here, the methylation of the miR-200 promoter regions&#x02014;an epigenetic modification allowing for the activation of the EMT program&#x02014;could serve as a tool to identify poor prognosis CRC lesions early on. This epigenetic mark is prognostic in stage II CRCs and could be used to select individuals that are likely to benefit from more aggressive therapy. It remains to be examined whether high methylation levels could also be used as a marker to identify patients within this group that benefit from adjuvant therapy. In this regard, the simplicity and highly robust nature of the miR-200 promoter methylation assay might be of great benefit to the field as this will allow for improved retrospective analysis of clinical studies and design of novel trials aiming to improve therapeutic outcome in these patients.</p><p>Taken together, our data demonstrate that employing networks to study subtype-specific gene expression is a powerful approach to identify drivers of distinct cancer subgroups. The regulators determined in this way grant insight into the biological behavior of the subtype. Herein, we show that the miR-200 network is a determinant for mesenchymal CRCs and that its activity is regulated by promoter methylation. This methylation mark is predictive of disease outcome, can be detected already early in the development of CRC and thus presents a tool to identify poor prognosis patients at early stages.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Sample collection</title><p>Frozen tissues were collected from pathology (AMC), following the institute's guidelines (Medical Ethical Committee, AMC, Amsterdam, the Netherlands).
