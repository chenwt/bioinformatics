The main study limitation is that the RNA sequencing methodologies captured changes in RNA transcripts, missing out on processes that differ due to protein modifications, assembly and/or localization. We expect this is the reason why findings for oxidant pathways were not particularly striking. Given intrinsic variability due to differing genomic repertoires and baseline iron status, the relatively small number of biological replicates is a limitation, although the extrapolations back to endothelial cells from multiple donors suggest the core findings are likely to be broadly applicable. Since biological clustering analyses did not detect any differentially expressed biological processes between untreated dermal and pulmonary-derived EC, and validations were performed in HUVEC, this suggests the general conclusions on iron treatment may be cautiously extended to any endothelial cell type.</p><p>Previous studies evaluating iron toxicity have examined much higher iron concentrations, pertaining to iron overload disorders or experimental endothelial toxicity models.

Normal total serum iron concentrations reach 27&#x003bc;mol/L, but the majority of iron is protein-bound so the circulating concentrations of &#x02018;free&#x02019; iron are usually in the low micromolar range: it is not known what proportion of iron is bound by protein in endothelial cells. Cellular absorption of iron (II) citrate <italic>in vitro</italic> may differ from cellular absorption of iron <italic>in vivo</italic>, therefore it is plausible that the demonstrated effects may be occurring at lower true cellular iron concentrations than those apparent in circulating human blood. Furthermore, specific cellular absorption rates will likely differ between cells, potentially mediated by ferroportin expression (which is regulated <italic>in vivo</italic> by circulating concentrations of hepcidin that differ according to the iron status of the whole organism [<xref rid="pone.0147990.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0147990.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]).

The time course of our assays appear to have captured some of these early DNA repair responses, before transcriptional upregulation of late targets of p53, such as regulators of the IGF-1/AKT and mTOR pathways (not seen at either the 1 or 6 hour timepoints).</p><p>Further study is required to evaluate whether it is iron itself, reactive oxidative species (ROS), or other molecules mediating the observed effects. It remains to be seen whether differing genomic repertoires, baseline iron status, dietary intakes and/or other clinical variables contribute to the varying patterns observed in EC. It will also be crucial to evaluate at a cellular level, whether differing iron concentrations, absorption rates and expression of regulatory molecules such as ferroportin differ according to vascular bed origin, and/or previous iron exposure of the cell, including repeat dosage treatment regimens.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that the experimental treatments in the current study were an order of magnitude lower than those used in recent studies of iron toxicity [<xref rid="pone.0147990.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and may encroach on the ranges encountered in the general population following currently recommended iron dosage regimes,[<xref rid="pone.0147990.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and/or iron supplements bought without medical prescriptions.
