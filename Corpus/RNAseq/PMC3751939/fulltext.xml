Its success is thought to be due to a diverse collection of ginsenosides that serve as its major bioactive compounds. However, few genomic resources exist and the details concerning its various biosynthetic pathways remain poorly understood. As the root is the primary tissue harvested commercially for ginsenosides, next generation sequencing was applied to the characterization and assembly of the root transcriptome throughout seasonal development. Transcripts showing homology to ginsenoside biosynthesis enzymes were profiled in greater detail.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>RNA extracts from root samples from seven development stages of North American ginseng were subjected to 454 sequencing, filtered for quality and used in the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of a collective root reference transcriptome consisting of 41,623 transcripts. Annotation efforts using a number of public databases resulted in detailed annotation information for 34,801 (84%) transcripts. In addition, 3,955 genes were assigned to metabolic pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. Among our results, we found all of the known enzymes involved in the ginsenoside backbone biosynthesis and used co-expression analysis to identify a number of candidate sequences involved in the latter stages ginsenoside biosynthesis pathway. Transcript profiles suggest ginsenoside biosynthesis occurs at distinct stages of development.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The assembly generated provides a comprehensive annotated reference for future transcriptomic study of North American ginseng. A collection of putative ginsenoside biosynthesis genes were identified and candidate genes predicted from the lesser understood downstream stages of biosynthesis. Transcript expression profiles across seasonal development suggest a primary dammarane-type ginsenoside biosynthesis occurs just prior to plant senescence, with secondary ginsenoside production occurring throughout development. Data from the study provide a valuable resource for conducting future ginsenoside biosynthesis research in this important medicinal plant.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>North American ginseng</kwd><kwd>Transcriptome</kwd><kwd>Next generation sequencing</kwd><kwd>Ginsenoside</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Ginseng belongs to species within the genus <italic>Panax</italic> (family Araliaceae) that comprises approximately 14 species of slow-growing perennial plants with fleshy roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. North American ginseng (<italic>Panax quinquefolius</italic> L.) is native to eastern North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and <italic>Panax</italic> species have been used for thousands of years to improve the overall health of human beings, as a remedy to promote vitality, assist the body functions, improve the immune system and protect against stress. It also has been recommended for years as a traditional medicine for a multitude of diseases such as cancer, inflammation, diabetes, cardiovascular ills and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] as well as being a recent source of natural extracts mass marketed as a cold prevention treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Ginsenosides are considered to be the major bioactive compounds behind many of the claims of ginseng&#x02019;s health benefits; they are triterpenoid saponins found nearly exclusively in ginseng and have been the target of considerable research effort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. To date, more than 150 naturally occurring ginsenosides have been isolated from <italic>Panax</italic> species and most of them can be classified into two groups based on the skeleton of their aglycones, namely dammarane-type and oleanane-type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The dammarane-type consists mainly of three varieties, classified according to their genuine aglycone moieties: 20S-protopanaxadiol (PPD), 20S-protopanaxatriol (PPT), and ocotillol. Rb1, Rb2, Rc, Rd (PPDs) and Re and Rg1 (PPTs) are the most abundant six ginsenosides found in North American ginseng. Over 90% of total ginsenoside content from North American ginseng belongs to these two groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>North American ginseng contains high levels of Rb1, Rd and Re ginsenosides&#x02014;higher than those of <italic>Panax ginseng</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Ro is the only saponin of the oleanane-type ginsenoside, found as a minor component in North American ginseng [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Ginsenosides are biosynthesized via the mevalonate pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Using expressed sequence tag analysis, it has been possible to identify several candidate genes encoding for the enzymes farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPS) and squalene synthase (SQS), involved in the various biosynthetic steps from isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate to squalene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The cyclization of oxidosqualene is the branch point for the biosynthesis of ginsenosides and plant sterols. The common steps from acetyle-CoA to 2, 3-oxidosqualene have been widely studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The 2, 3-oxidosqualene cyclases (OSCs) that synthesize &#x003b2;-amyrin and dammarenediol-II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], as well as the Cyt P450 enzyme CYP716A47 that catalyses the formation of protopanaxadiol from dammarenediol-II during ginsenoside biosynthesis have been found in <italic>Panax ginseng</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, the rest of the downstream pathways of ginsenoside biosynthesis remain largely unexplored.</p><p>Over the past several years, next-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized the analysis of genomic information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. As applied to the transcriptome with RNAseq, it has been successfully used for transcript profiling, as well as SNP discovery in a number of plant species and has dramatically improved the efficiency and speed of gene discovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The application of 454 next generation sequencing technology has seen a rapid improvement in throughput, read length and accuracy in the past few years, with the GS FLX Titanium server used in this study able to generate one million reads with an average length of 400 bases with 99.5% accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Meanwhile, the analysis of transcriptomic data often relies on aligning reads to a reference which is often not feasible for non-model plant species in which little genomic research has been performed. We applied the transcriptome assembly program Trinity to the assembly of a high quality reference transcriptome for North American ginseng. Trinity has been shown to recover most expressed transcripts as full-length sequences, and is also able to resolve alternative isoforms and duplicated genes, outperforming other <italic>de novo</italic> assembly tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Our application to ginseng resulted in 41,623 ginseng root transcripts. We fully annotated 84% of these transcripts using sequence similarity searches and protein domain scanning with publicly available databases. In our results, we were able to identify predicted representatives for all of the known enzymes involved in the ginsenoside backbone biosynthesis and also profile their expression levels across seasonal development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Commercial production of ginseng usually results in harvests after 3 to 5&#x000a0;years.

Overall, these efforts annotated 83.6% of transcripts in the assembly.</p><p>Comparison against the Genbank nr database yielded 33,366 hits (E&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1e<sup>-10</sup>), accounting for 80.16% of transcriptome sequences. A full 87.2% of these hits showed strong homology (E&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;e<sup>-20</sup>). As the nr database contains few ginseng proteins, we examined the different species with which homology was found. The majority of hits (55.7%) were found to be against grape (<italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>), followed by castor oil plant (<italic>Ricinus communis</italic>) (14.5%), black cottonwood poplar (<italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic>) (12.4%), and soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic>) (1.6%). Similar results were found with searches against the Plant Protein Annotation Program (PPAP) database from Uniprot and the TAIR10 release of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome yielding 33,522 (80.54%) and 30,990 (74.45%) transcripts with significant hits (E&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1e<sup>-10</sup>) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>).</p><p>As <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is the most thoroughly annotated plant, sequence homology to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> was also used to characterize the transcriptome based on Gene Ontology (GO) information. GO annotation provides descriptions of gene products in terms of their associated molecular functions, cellular components, and biological processes. Using sequence homology to TAIR10, 14,537 GO terms were assigned to 24,110 sequences categorized into 80 functional groups. GO assignments were most frequently related to biological processes (6,431), followed by cellular components (12,489) and molecular function (5,190) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Functional classification of North American ginseng based on gene ontology categories.</bold> Gene ontology categories and classifications as identified by feeding the assembled transcriptome to the BLAST2GO web server.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-14-564-4"/></fig><p>The assembly was scanned with protein domain HMM models from the Pfam database in order to catalogue any significant matches (E&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;e<sup>-10</sup>) to known protein domains. Overall, 32,277 HMMs were scanned against the assembly resulting in annotation for 21,263 transcripts possessing 17,266 different protein domains. This added annotation information to an additional 77 transcripts that had no hits in the prior homology searches. The most abundant domain found was the protein kinase domain, present in 1,310 transcripts. This is a similar number to the 1,719 kinases present in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome and not surprising, as protein kinases play a role in a multitude of cellular processes, including division, proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation.</p><p>Finally, in order to assign metabolic information to our transcripts, the KAAS tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.jp/tools/kaas/)">http://www.genome.jp/tools/kaas/)</ext-link>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] was used to assign pathway information from the KEGG database. This resulted in a KEGG orthology (KO) number for 5,717 transcripts that possessed homology with metabolic enzymes in the KEGG database. The pathways most strongly represented in the results were protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, nucleotide excision repair, arginine and proline metabolism, peroxisome, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, proteasome, starch and sucrose metabolism and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. All annotation information and significance scores were summarized and concatenated with transcript identifiers into a single line of annotation for each sequence in a Fasta formatted transcriptome file (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Expression profiles across development</title><p>To evaluate the contribution of each stage of development to the reference transcriptome and profile the relative expression levels of transcripts throughout development, we mapped all high quality reads from each stage back to the assembled transcriptome using the BWA tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. While this is useful in determining relative transcript abundance, it did have the unfortunate side effect of reporting unmapped reads for 6,113 transcripts. Investigating further, it was found that nearly all unmapped transcripts were involved in alternative splicing and of the shortest transcripts in the assembly (mean length: 414&#x000a0;bp). We presume that this is a consequence of the k-mer (k&#x02009;=&#x02009;25) assembly process used by Trinity, perhaps creating isoform transcripts that are shorter than the long 454 reads from which they originally derive or possibly from read trimming by the alignment program. Nevertheless, expression information was obtained for over 85% of the transcriptome which comprised the longer contigs.</p><p>Counts for mapped reads were then used to generate RPKM (reads per kilobase transcript per million reads mapped) values for each putative transcript in each developmental stage.

plant. To limit the complexity in the number of comparisons needed, the seven developmental stages sampled were grouped into the broader developmental categories of budding (stages 1/2), flowering (stage 3), fruiting (stages 4/5) and senescence (stages 6/7). Overall, 26,681, 17,990, 26,162 and 26,772 predicted transcripts showed positive expression in each category respectively. Each category possessed around two thousand predicted transcripts uniquely expressed during that stage of root development, with the exception of flowering, which had 621 specific transcripts. However, this is likely influenced by the fact that flowering is the only single stage group and thus represents a snapshot from a shorter period of developmental time compared to the other stages. Interestingly, the senescence stage had the largest number of predicted transcripts overlapping with other developmental stages. Altogether, a total of 13,074 transcripts were found to be expressed throughout all stages of development (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Venn diagram of transcript abundance across development.</bold> The 7 developmental stages sampled were grouped into four categories for a simplified comparison of transcript abundance: Budding &#x02013; stages 1 &#x00026; 2; Flowering &#x02013; stage 3; Fruiting &#x02013; stages 4 &#x00026; 5; Senescence &#x02013; stages 6 &#x00026; 7.

We therefore took all KEGG orthology numbers associated with enzymes in the mevalonate pathway of terpenoid backbone biosynthesis along with those from the sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis pathways leading to chair-chair-chair-boat conformation triterpenoids (of which ginsenosides belong) and pulled all transcripts annotated with corresponding KO numbers in the assembly. This returned 14 predicted genes (43 transcripts including isoforms) annotated and identified by KEGG orthology. In addition, as there was no appropriate assigned KEGG EC for &#x003b2;-amyrin synthase, five &#x003b2;-amyrin synthase annotated genes (6 transcripts including isoforms) were pulled for analysis

Although, we found 3 putative genes (i.e. Pq71210, Pq96200, Pq28280) with a significant squalene/phytoene synthase domain (Pfam: PF00494), only one (Pq28280) was annotated with KEGG orthology to SQS.

Dammarenediol-II produces protopanaxdiol and protopanaxtriol, and ginsenosides are thought to be synthesized from subsequent hydroxylation of these products by cytochrome P450 enzymes and glycosylation by glycosyltransferases (GTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Our assembly contained 175 predicted transcripts annotated as Cytochrome P450s; with 63 of these possessing high similarity to P450 sequences from <italic>Panax ginseng</italic> and <italic>Panax notoginseng</italic> EST collections. Similarly, the assembly contained 164 predicted transcripts annotated as glycosyltransferases with 54 of these previously identified in <italic>Panax ginseng</italic>, <italic>Panax notoginseng</italic> and <italic>Panax quinquefolias</italic>. In order to identify potential candidates from these gene families that may be functioning in the latter stages of ginsenoside biosynthesis, we conducted a co-expression analysis with the transcript profiles for our putative dammarenediol synthase (DS) and squalene expoxidase (SQE) found immediately upstream in the ginsenoside biosynthesis pathway.</p><p>The expression profiles for the two strongest SQE (Pq129610.1) and DS (Pq41740.1) annotated transcripts in our assembly showed very high co-expression (r&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.89). This is not unexpected given that DS follows SQE in the biosynthesis pathway. We reasoned that candidate downstream P450 and glycosyltransferase genes may be similarly co-expressed. Co-expression analysis between all putative P450s and our predicted DS transcript identified 6 candidate P450s highly co-expressed with DS (r&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.85) across the 7 developmental stages sampled (Pq75200.2, Pq7360.1, Pq9780.1, Pq10460.1, Pq142430.1 and Pq108220.1). In the case of Pq75200.2, co-expression with DS was extremely high (r&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.96). Similarly, 6 glycosyltransferases annotated transcripts were highly co-expressed with our predicted DS (r&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.85) (Pq137680.1, Pq47050.2, Pq177130.1, Pq117050.1, Pq158770.1, and Pq10160.3). As before, one transcript (Pq137680.1) showed extremely high co-expression (r&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.94). Similar results were found in co-expression with the upstream SQE (data not shown). It should be noted that two splice variants from a single gene were also returned in the glycosyltransferase co-expression analysis. However, these transcripts derived from a gene (Pq315) for which 96 splice variants were identified by Trinity. As the annotation information for these 96 isoforms showed no strong consistency across isoforms, we concluded that this may be an artefact of the assembly, perhaps from the misinterpretation of a gene family, and were therefore dropped to simplify the analysis.</p><p>In order to provide biological validation to the 12 predicted transcripts showing coexpression with our putative DS gene, we conducted real-time PCR against the DS gene itself, the 6 putative glycosyltransferase genes and 6 putative cytochrome P450 genes across the final 3 stages of development. We were able to successfully amplify all 13 genes using RT-PCR analysis and confirmed strong coexpression between our predicted DS, 5 of the glycosyltransferase transcripts and 4 of the P450 transcripts (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).

RPKM values for all predicted transcripts were thus hierarchically clustered, and displayed in a heat map to create a transcriptome-wide display of developmental expression (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>a). Many transcripts showed maximum expression within one or two specific stages of root development relative to other stages, with all stages of development possessing distinct clusters of genes showing dominant expression within that stage.

For representatives of downstream candidates, the most highly co-expressed P450 and glycosyltransferase transcripts identified in the co-expression analysis were also included in the collection. As seen with the entire transcriptome, many enzymes displayed abundant expression, specific to one or a few developmental stages relative to the other stages. To our surprise, stage 3 (Flowering) and stage 6 (Fruit drop) both possessed obvious clusters that encompassed putative representatives for almost all the enzymes in the biosynthesis pathway, suggesting that these two developmental stages are important points of ginsenoside biosynthesis in the developing plant. In the case of stage 7, this makes intuitive sense considering the traditional time of ginseng harvest after the fruit drop stage and onset of leaf senescence. Interestingly, when different isoforms of genes were present, they tended to exhibit expression maxima in different stages of development. This was most apparent with the 9 different isoforms of SQE1 (Pq7190), for which at least one instance of an isoform with stage specific expression was found in all developmental stages except senescence stage 7 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>c). Of course, due to the computational limitations of assembly and mapping, both the isoforms identified and the expression profiles should be interpreted with caution without further <italic>in planta</italic> validation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Ginsenosides are found exclusively in the plant genus <italic>Panax</italic> and are viewed as the primary active compounds behind the claims of ginseng's health efficacy. The ginsenosides, also known as triterpenoids belong to the class of terpenoid saponines and are synthesized via the mevalonate pathway, which shares a common pathway with sterol. Oxidosqualene is a precursor common to the biosynthesis of both steroid and triterpenoids in higher plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The cyclization of 2, 3-oxidosqualene to oleanane and dammarane triterpenes is the first step in ginsenosides synthesis. The primary enzymes of triterpenoid saponions synthases are &#x003b2;-amyrin synthase (AS), and lupeol or dammarenediol-II synthase (DS). Putative orthologs for DS and AS were both identified in our assembly. &#x003b2;-amyrin synthase synthesizes oleanane-type triterpene and oleanane-type ginsenosides; however, they are found in only minor amounts in North American ginseng. On the contrary, over 90% of the total ginsenosides of North American ginseng belong to the dammarane-type. Interestingly, in our results, predicted AS transcripts appear most abundantly within developmental stages in which predicted DS enzymes are not abundant (i.e., flowering and fruiting). Moreover, they are not associated with the distinctive co-expression clusters of abundant putative ginsenoside biosynthesis genes as seen with DS in stages 3 and 6. This potentially emphasizes the minor role of AS derived ginsenosides in North American ginseng. At the same time, the clusters of predicted biosynthesis enzymes during flowering and fruit drop highlight a potential significance of damamarane-type synthesis and suggest that flowering and fruit drop could be primary points of ginsenoside biosynthesis during seasonal development, with most emphasis on the latter.</p><p>While we observed distinct stages of specific up-regulation for most predicted enzymes in the assembly, the presence of different isoforms with expression abundance specific to different stages of development is intriguing. In particular, our putative SQE1 possessed 9 different isoforms that showed stage specific expression abundance in all stages of development save stage 6 (fruit drop). Curiously, an alternate predicted SQE1 (Pq129610.1) with only a single isoform was strongly expressed in this stage. This seems to suggest that variation in alternative splicing may be a mechanism for producing varied forms of ginsenosides during seasonal development. Generally speaking, it also implies that alternative splicing may function as a means for directing variation in secondary metabolite production throughout the course of plant development. However, due to the inherent computational limitations involved in assembly and mapping, further analysis in the form of qPCR and associated metabolic assays is needed to prove or disprove any such hypotheses.</p><p>Of course, the assembly process will not be perfect with respect to isoform prediction and the transcripts themselves. There is a strong potential for misassembly in the form of merged gene families, close paralogs, or even alleles of the same gene being misreported as isoforms. While the comparison with Ginseng ESTs in Genbank is reassuring of the assembly quality, all predictions should be treated with caution in the absence of biological validation. Similarly, the mapping of reads to the assembly is limited by the presence of isoforms, as the actual point of origin for the read is confounded by the presence of potential multiple sources. This introduces a level of stochastic noise to the expression analysis that is mostly confined to genes with several isoforms.</p><p>That said, real-time PCR was able to validate the presence of a number of transcripts within expected developmental stages, as well as confirm their coexpression and upregulation within the fruit drop stage of development. Transcripts for a predicted DS gene, six putative P450s and six putative glycosyltransferases were all confirmed as present <italic>in planta</italic> and expression levels for four of the P450s and five of the glycosyltransferases confirm a tight coregulation with the predicted DS gene across the last stages of development as seen in our expression data. These predicted enzymes are thus strong candidates for controlling ginsenoside biosynthesis in the late stages of plant development.</p><p>While this study, as any next-generation sequencing study, would have benefited from an even larger amount of sequence data, additional sequencing over so many stages of development was unfortunately cost prohibitive. Nevertheless, the overall structure of the assembly with regard to number of genes, isoform frequency, length of transcripts and level of homology with existing EST libraries and annotation patterns identified among the transcripts is all very supportive and indicative of a strong representation of the biology. Overall, we believe the analysis benefited considerably from the use of the much longer reads that 454 sequencing is capable of generating. This added information translates into more reliable, longer, and complete transcripts, as well as more information for improved accuracy in the calling of alternative splicing among sequenced transcripts.</p><p>Recent work by Sun et al., found similar benefits to the use of 454 sequencing in the assembly of a transcriptome for North American ginseng [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Our work has expanded on these initial efforts through the generation of over six times the amount of high quality 454 reads sampled over seven stages of seasonal root development. This provides an unprecedented snapshot of North American ginseng root development and a means to comprehensively capture root expressed transcripts and their relative abundance through developmental time. In addition, we have also taken advantage of the recent Trinity assembly algorithm, which is designed specifically for assembling transcriptomes. Altogether, this provides the benefit of a high confidence, reliable assembly of putative transcripts that includes potentially valuable splice variant information. In the end, the combination of a fully annotated assembly along with corresponding expression data as sampled across developmental time has provided for an insightful look into the transcriptome of North American ginseng.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Ginseng is a valuable medicinal herb that is widely used in traditional medicine and has considerable commercial value. This study has focused on the ginseng root as it is the tissue almost exclusively used for medicinal applications and contains the majority of the commercially and medicinally valuable ginsenosides. Using extensive sampling of root tissue across seasonal development and next-generation sequencing we have generated a reliable North American ginseng transcriptome with extensive annotation and isoform information. Expression profiling of all ginsenoside backbone biosynthesis genes suggests that ginsenoside biosynthesis is tightly linked with the developmental stages of flowering and fruit drop.
