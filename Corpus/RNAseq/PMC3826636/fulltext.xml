However, it has remained a point of controversy whether these mutations are sufficient to activate the pathway or require additional upstream signals. Here we show that colorectal tumours express elevated levels of Wnt3 and Evi/Wls/GPR177. We found that in colon cancer cells, even in the presence of mutations in APC or &#x003b2;-catenin, downstream signalling remains responsive to Wnt ligands and receptor proximal signalling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that truncated APC proteins bind &#x003b2;-catenin and key components of the destruction complex. These results indicate that cells with mutations in APC or &#x003b2;-catenin depend on Wnt ligands and their secretion for a sufficient level of &#x003b2;-catenin signalling, which potentially opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions by targeting Wnt secretion via Evi/Wls.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="i1" xlink:href="ncomms3610-i1.jpg"/>Activating mutations in the Wnt signalling pathway are associated with colon cancer.

Canonical Wnt signalling through &#x003b2;-catenin is of particular importance for the development of colorectal cancer, with more than 80% of tumours carrying loss-of-function mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and about 5% carrying activating mutations in &#x003b2;-catenin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. In the normal intestinal epithelium, Wnt signalling regulates the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem and progenitor cells. Mutations in APC and &#x003b2;-catenin are among the earliest events of colon cancer development and lead to hyperplasia in the intestinal crypts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Recent studies have shown that Wnt signalling activity is also required in colon cancer cells during tumour progression and metastasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p><p>The secretion of Wnt proteins requires Evenness interrupted/Wntless/G protein-coupled receptor 177 (Evi/Wls/GPR177)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. This multipass transmembrane protein acts as a cargo receptor for Wnt proteins, shuttling them from the Golgi to the plasma membrane where they act in an autocrine or paracrine manner to activate Wnt signalling pathways. Upon binding to receptors of the Frizzled family and their coreceptors, Wnt proteins activate different downstream signalling pathways. In the so-called canonical pathway, signals are transmitted through Dishevelled (Dvl) adaptor proteins, leading to the stabilization of cytosolic &#x003b2;-catenin and its translocation to the nucleus. In the absence of Wnt signalling, &#x003b2;-catenin degradation is initiated by the &#x02018;destruction complex&#x02019;, which comprises, among other proteins, APC, GSK3&#x003b2; and Axin1. APC acts as a scaffold, binding &#x003b2;-catenin and recruiting CK1&#x003b1; and GSK3&#x003b2; to phosphorylate &#x003b2;-catenin. This event marks &#x003b2;-catenin for ubiquitination by the SKP1&#x02013;Cullin-1&#x02013;F-box (SCF<sup>&#x003b2;KP1-</sup>) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequently triggers its proteasomal degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. When &#x003b2;-catenin translocates to the nucleus as a consequence of Wnt signalling, it acts as a cofactor for transcription factors of the T-cell factor (TCF) family, leading to the transcription of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin target genes such as <italic>AXIN2</italic>, <italic>SMAD7</italic>, <italic>CCND1</italic>/<italic>CyclinD</italic> and <italic>MYC</italic>.</p><p>Given that mutations in APC and &#x003b2;-catenin are thought to lead to a constitutively active Wnt pathway that renders cells insensitive to upstream regulation, many drug development efforts for colon cancer have focused on downstream targets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. However, other experimental data challenge the assumption that mutant APC alone is sufficient to sustain Wnt pathway activity. For example, secreted Wnt antagonists such as the secreted Frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs) have been found to attenuate Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signalling in colorectal cancer cell lines carrying APC mutations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>; this observation has also been explained by proposing novel, Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin-independent functions for these factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Other studies have shown that &#x003b2;-catenin expression patterns across a colon tumour are heterogeneous, suggesting that the Wnt pathway activity across a tumour can be variable irrespective of the homogeneous distribution of the activated &#x003b2;-catenin mutant protein throughout that tumour<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. These observations highlight the need to dissect the mechanisms that underlie the effects of APC and &#x003b2;-catenin mutations on the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signalling cascade.</p><p>Here we show that the levels of both Wnt3 and Evi/Wls are frequently higher in adenomas and differentiated carcinomas than in normal colon epithelium. We also demonstrate that interfering with the secretion of Wnt proteins in colon cancer cell lines that harbour APC or &#x003b2;-catenin mutations impairs the ability of the cells to proliferate and to form colonies <italic>in vitro</italic> and tumours <italic>in vivo</italic>. We provide evidence that autocrine Wnt secretion via Evi/Wls is required for maintaining the Wnt activity in cell lines and tumour-initiating cells (TICs). Taken together, these results support a model, wherein colon cancer cells acquire the ability to secrete canonical Wnt proteins continuously, and require such autocrine secretion for survival.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Evi/Wls and Wnt3 are highly expressed in colon carcinomas</title><p>In the normal mouse small intestinal epithelium, Wnt3 is highly expressed in Paneth cells where it has a crucial role in maintaining LGR5<sup>+</sup> intestinal stem cells at the bottom of the crypt<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Here we asked whether a similar expression pattern of Wnt3 and its cargo receptor Evi/Wls can be detected in human colon tissue. To this end, we stained normal human colon and matched carcinoma tissue sections (from the same patient) for Wnt3 and Evi/Wls protein, using Keratin20 and Eph receptor B2 as markers of cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1b</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. We found that Wnt3 and Evi/Wls proteins were low or were not detectable in enterocytes and goblet cells, whereas their expression was more prominent in the underlying lamina muscularis mucosae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). In addition, high Wnt3 expression was observed in scattered cells, which showed characteristics of endocrine and Paneth-like<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> cells localized at the bottom of the crypt, with eosinophilic granula in the cytoplasm and the basal nuclei. These results suggest that an important source of Wnt proteins in the human colon is located at the bottom end of the crypts.</p><p>Surprisingly, in carcinoma sections from the same patients, Evi/Wls and Wnt3 staining was stronger and detectable throughout the epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). To confirm these data, we also stained tumour tissue arrays for Evi/Wls and Wnt3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>; representative immunohistochemical stainings are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1b</xref>). Wnt3 and Evi/Wls expression in the epithelial cells of normal colon tissue (colon) was generally weaker compared with tumuor tissues. However, it was elevated in adenomas and showed strong expression in well- (G1) and moderately (G2) differentiated (adeno-) carcinomas, whereas poorly (G3) differentiated tumours showed heterogeneous Evi/Wls expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Our expression data are also consistent with the TCGA messenger RNA expression data set (Oncomine, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oncomine.org">www.oncomine.org</ext-link>, TCGA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, which shows that the Wnt3, Wnt1 and Wnt3a mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1c</xref>) are more highly expressed in colorectal adenocarcinomas than in normal colon/rectum.</p><p>Next, we tested whether overexpressing the cargo receptor Evi/Wls in colon cancer cells leads to an increase in Wnt signalling activity, as previously shown in embryonic stem (ES) cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.

Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated silencing of the Evi/Wls significantly reduced lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF)/Wnt-reporter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> induction to levels comparable to those achieved by Bcl9 knockdown, an essential transcriptional cofactor for the expression of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2a</xref>). This effect was rescued by adding recombinant Wnt3a (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2b</xref>). Furthermore, knockdown of Evi/Wls with a doxycycline (dox)-inducible shmirRNA led to downregulation of the canonical Wnt target gene <italic>AXIN2</italic> in both DLD1 and HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>), an effect that was likewise rescued by applying recombinant Wnt3a (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2c,d</xref>).</p><p>RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated downregulation of Evi/Wls reduced the phosphorylation of Lrp6 on Ser1490 in both DLD1 and HCT116 cells, confirming that pathway activity was reduced at the receptor level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Evi/Wls depletion in these cell lines also reduced the levels of active &#x003b2;-catenin (non-phosphorylated-S33/S37/T41) and of Axin2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). To confirm the specificity of knockdown, we rescued Wnt pathway activation in HEK293T cells after knockdown of Evi/Wls, using modified Evi/Wls expression constructs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> not targeted by the short interfering RNAs (siRNAs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3a</xref>).

RNAseq data from seven colon cancer cell lines indicated that several canonical Wnt ligands are expressed in each cell line, the most prominent among these being Wnt3 and Wnt10b (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4a</xref>). To test whether these ligands are secreted and functional, we cocultured SW480 and DLD1 cells with a MDA-MB231 or HEK293T reporter cell line. We found that both colon cancer cell lines induced canonical Wnt signalling in a cell-number-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4b,c</xref>), producing a range of reporter activity similar to that observed when recombinant Wnt3a was applied (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4b</xref>). To exclude the possibility of confounding effects from increased reporter cell proliferation, we assessed the activity of a TCF/LEF&#x02013;GFP reporter at the single-cell level by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Consistent with our results from the luciferase assays, coculturing the reporter cell line with SW480 cells enhanced TCF/LEF&#x02013;GFP fluorescence in reporter cells in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5a</xref>). These experiments indicated that colon cancer cells secrete functional Wnt proteins.</p><p>Next, we investigated whether the Evi/Wls phenotype is equivalent to that resulting from the loss of canonical Wnts. Depleting HCT116 cells of Wnt3 and Wnt3a, and DLD1 cells of Wnt3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>), strongly reduced the reporter activity. Silencing of Wnt3a was rescued by adding recombinant Wnt3a (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5b</xref>). Combined knockdown of both Wnt3 and Wnt3a led to a further reduction of Wnt signalling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5c</xref>). We also observed reduced expression of the Wnt target genes <italic>AXIN2</italic> and <italic>SMAD7</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5d</xref>), a reduction of Lrp6 phosphorylation (Ser1490) and a decrease in Axin2 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>) after RNAi-mediated silencing of Wnt3 or Wnt3a. As expected, the ability of the Wnt ligands to activate signalling was dependent on the presence of Evi/Wls in the secreting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Consistent with these findings, silencing of Lrp6, Dvl1 and Dvl3 led to a decrease in TCF4/Wnt-reporter activity, despite the presence of APC and &#x003b2;-catenin mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), and silencing of Dvl1 and Dvl3 led to downregulation of <italic>AXIN2</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p><p>In summary, colon cancer cell lines express canonical Wnt ligands, whose Evi/Wls-dependent secretion is regulating canonical Wnt signalling, regardless of the presence of mutated APC or &#x003b2;-catenin.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Truncated APC can regulate canonical Wnt pathway</title><p>Eighty per cent of colon cancers have biallelic APC mutations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, often with complete lack of expression from one allele and expression of a truncated from the other.

We detected &#x003b2;-catenin phosphorylation at sites S33 and S37 (as also shown in refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>), as well as the presence of the major components of the destruction complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7a</xref>), indicating that truncated APC proteins are partly functional. Thus, loss of &#x003b2;-catenin-binding sites in colon cancer cells, such as DLD1 and SW480, leads to a reduction in APC levels rather than its complete inactivation.</p><p>We also investigated whether a reduction in APC functionality, although insufficient to activate the pathway on its own, sensitizes cells to the Wnt ligands. We used RKO that expresses wild-type APC and shows only basal Wnt pathway activity as a model system. To assess the effects of a partial reduction of APC levels, we stably transduced RKO TCF4/Wnt-reporter cells with shRNA constructs that target APC at different efficiencies of knockdown, as assessed by their effects on expression of the <italic>AXIN2</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b,c</xref>). We found that efficient reduction of APC expression (85% reduction, shAPC#2) induced strong reporter activity, even in the absence of the Wnt3a ligand. In contrast, moderate downregulation of APC expression (50% reduction, shAPC#1) did not induce the reporter by itself, but resulted in a stronger response when combined with exposure to Wnt3a ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). We further tested the effects of APC levels in HEK293T cells that had been transfected with various siAPCs and treated with Wnt3a. Although partial silencing of APC (using either siAPC#1 or siAPC pool) did not induce TCF4/Wnt-reporter activity on its own, we observed a stronger induction when combined with Wnt3a treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7b,c</xref>).</p><p>Together, these findings indicate that colon cancer cells expressing truncated APC can assemble a partially functional destruction complex. We conclude that truncated APC does not lead to full pathway activation, but can instead sensitize cells to upstream signals.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Evi is required for the proliferation of colon cancer cells</title><p>To evaluate whether Wnt secretion is required for the proliferation of colon cancer cells, we stably transduced colon cancer cell lines with lentiviral shRNA constructs targeting the Wnt cargo receptor Evi/Wls.

These results demonstrate that silencing of the Wnt cargo receptor Evi/Wls reduced both the initial engraftment of the tumour and subsequent tumour growth.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Evi is important for the survival of colon cancer stem cells</title><p>Vermeulen <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> showed that colon cancer stem cells are characterized by high Wnt activity, which is essential for stemness capacity of these cells. We hypothesized that Wnt signalling in these cells might be dependent on canonical Wnts and Evi/Wls expression in an autocrine or a paracrine manner, even in the presence of APC mutation.</p><p>To investigate the role of Wnt secretion in TICs, we enriched these cells from primary human colorectal cancer tissue or derived metastases from three patients (P1&#x02013;3) in serum-free medium in the presence of cytokines. Under these conditions, floating tumour spheroids are formed, which are enriched for self-renewing TICs and depleted of non-neoplastic cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. P1 and P3 TICs harbour a truncated APC, whereas in P2 cells no truncations of APC was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>). We confirmed that the three TICs expressed Evi/Wls and Wnt3 on an mRNA level.</p><p>We then tested whether truncated APC in colon cancer stem cells is functional as shown above for colon cancer cell lines. Consistently, we found that GSK3&#x003b2; and Axin1 bind to truncated APC and &#x003b2;-catenin in all three spheroid cultures independent of their APC mutation status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>). We further tested whether inhibition of Wnt secretion by a Porcupine inhibitor (IWP12) reduced the LEF/TCF&#x02013;Wnt-reporter signalling in TICs with truncated APC. Similar to colon cancer cell lines, inhibition of Wnts secretion led to a reduction of Wnt signalling and reduces viability of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b,c</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, we conclude that high Wnt pathway activation in primary colon cancer cells relies on Wnt secretion, despite mutation in APC, indicating that the level of Wnt signalling is modulated by the secretion of Wnt proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In colon cancer, mutations in APC or &#x003b2;-catenin are known to be tightly associated with the transformation of normal epithelia, leading to dysplasia and early adenomas. However, the functional effects of these mutations on the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signalling pathway and the mechanisms whereby they contribute to carcinogenesis are not yet fully understood. Here we provide evidence that sustained Wnt secretion is important for the proliferation and survival of colon cancer cells, both <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Cells carrying mutations in APC or &#x003b2;-catenin are still dependent on the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway activation upstream of the &#x003b2;-catenin destruction complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9</xref>). Blocking upstream signalling by depleting the Wnt cargo receptor Evi/Wls significantly reduces the proliferation of colon cancer cells. Our results suggest that truncations of the APC tumour suppressor do not render cells independent of exogenous Wnt ligands, but rather lower the threshold of pathway activation by Wnt proteins.</p><p>Our findings are interesting with regards to the observation that extracellular inhibitors of the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signalling, Dkk4 and Sfrps, are frequently downregulated in colorectal cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. These proteins had been proposed to have novel functions given the earlier assumption that mutations in APC or &#x003b2;-catenin would render cells completely independent of canonical Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signalling. Our results offer a different explanation: as Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signalling remains critical for proliferation, reduced expression of secreted Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin antagonists and high expression of Wnts and Evi/Wls promotes tumourigenesis.</p><p>The discovery of Evi/Wls as the cargo receptor for all Wnt proteins opened new avenues for addressing whether the production of Wnt ligands is required in cells that harbour APC or &#x003b2;-catenin mutations. Evi/Wls was found to be essential during development, because it is required for the export of all Wnt proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. We observed increased expression of Evi/Wls and Wnt ligands in colon cancers, and detected them throughout the whole tissue, as opposed to weak or very localized expression in healthy tissue (for example, Paneth-like cells, lamina muscularis mucosae). This suggests that colon cancer cells are not only dependent on secreted Wnt ligands but also acquire autocrine Wnt secretion capabilities. Notably, upregulation of Wnts or Evi/Wls in colorectal cancer is associated with lower overall survival. Consistently, TCGA recently showed that colon cancer (tissues) display upregulation of Fzd10 and downregulation of DKK1-4 mRNA levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. This, as well as the silencing of SFRPs, supports a model whereby the destruction complex is regulated by upstream signals in colorectal cancers.</p><p>These results also provide possible explanations for the uneven distribution of nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> and the clustering of mutations in APC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> in colon cancer. Mutations in APC most often occur in the mutation cluster region (1,286&#x02013;1,513 aa), whereas a complete deletion of the APC locus is extremely rare<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. The retention of truncated APC has alternatively been attributed to its role in cell division<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>, C-terminal binding protein (CtBP)-dependent oligomerization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref> or to limit excessive levels of &#x003b2;-catenin in the nucleus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. It has also been proposed that certain truncations of APC are selected to ensure that the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signalling pathway is activated to a degree optimal to support tumour growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Regulation of &#x003b2;-catenin in colon cancer cells could also be dependent on the APC-like protein, the closest homologue of APC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Our results are consistent with previous studies on overexpressed APC protein fragments of different length, which were shown to retain the &#x003b2;-catenin-binding ability and reduce the signalling activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Importantly, such a model requires that mutant forms of APC remain, at least in part, a functional component of the destruction complex. Accordingly, truncating mutations in APC represent hypomorphic rather than complete loss-of-function alleles, as suggested by Gaspar and Fodde<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, based on experiments in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) mouse models. Genetic studies in mice also demonstrated that APC truncations select for a certain amount of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway activation and show a dosage effect in TopFlash reporter assays conducted in mouse ES cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. Our study provides further mechanistic evidence that endogenous truncated APC indeed retains the ability to bind &#x003b2;-catenin. Notably, APC proteins have several &#x003b2;-catenin-binding repeats (15 amino-acid repeats (AARs) and 20 AARs), which enable the wild-type form to bind to multiple &#x003b2;-catenin proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figs 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">8</xref>). Truncated APC proteins that have been associated with colorectal cancer usually retain several of these AAR repeats. Thus, they have the ability to productively engage &#x003b2;-catenin in the destruction complex. Further, we observed that even the shortest APC protein (in Colo320 cells) is able to bind to &#x003b2;-catenin despite a complete lack of known &#x003b2;-catenin-binding repeat regions, indicating that additional interfaces between APC and &#x003b2;-catenin may exist. It has recently been shown that partial silencing of APC can lead to colon cancer in the absence of biallelic mutations in APC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. This directly relates to our finding that partial reduction of APC can sensitize RKO cell to Wnt ligands, arguing that mutations in APC create a special situation of reduced &#x003b2;-catenin binding and processing ability. Taken together, these data support a model, whereby colon cancer cells with truncated APC remain susceptible to regulation by upstream signals.</p><p>Do colon cancers create their own Wnt-dependent niche? High Wnt pathway activity is essential to maintain the stem cell and transient amplifying progenitor compartment in intestinal crypts, and elevated Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway activity is associated with stem cell signatures in cancer. It is tempting to speculate that colon cancer cells generate a &#x02018;niche&#x02019; that enables them to retain an undifferentiated and stem cell-like behaviour, whereas non-cancerous colon stems cells require the crypt microenvironment to provide Wnt and other &#x02018;stemness&#x02019; signals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. In the case of tumours, the secretion of Wnt ligands and autocrine activation of canonical receptors may have a crucial role in maintaining stem cell populations independent of signals from the microenvironment. Thus, despite the presence of pathway-activating mutations in APC or &#x003b2;-catenin, the survival of colon cancer cells remains dependent on secreted Wnt ligands, and thus requires the activity of the Wnt cargo receptor Evi/Wls. The expression levels of both Wnt3 and Evi/Wls correlate with the degree of colon tumour differentiation, that is, the grade, which in turn correlates with prognosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p><p>The development of small-molecule Wnt antagonists for the treatment of colon cancer has focused on targets downstream of, or at the same level as, the destruction complex. Large-scale sequencing of human colon cancers has revealed recurrent genetic aberrations in a number of signal transducers, including components of the canonical Wnt pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. In addition, functional screening has uncovered a number of potential targets that act just upstream of the destruction complex. Our results indicate that the pathway can be inhibited further upstream, for example, through inhibitors of Wnt production acting at the level of Porcupine or the Wnt cargo receptor Evi/Wls to regulating Wnt signalling in colon tumours at the site of production.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell culture</title><p>All cell lines were obtained from ATCC.

Low amounts of Wnt signalling lead to differentiation of epithelial cells of the colon. Under these conditions, wild-type APC serves as a scaffold, binding &#x003b2;-catenin and catalytic components of the destruction complex, thus sequestering it in the cytoplasm and causing its degradation. (<bold>b</bold>) In colon cancer cells, APC is truncated but retains some ability to bind &#x003b2;-catenin and act as a scaffold for the destruction complex. However, the efficiency of &#x003b2;-catenin retention is reduced in a manner related to the length of the truncated APC protein. Thus, APC truncations sensitize to canonical Wnts, allowing cancer cells to be more sensitive to activation by Wnt ligands, while retaining regulatory activity throughout the signalling cascade. Further, colon cancer cells acquire the ability to secrete Wnts in an autocrine manner, rendering the tumour increasingly independent of the original Wnt sources of the colonic crypts.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ncomms3610-f9"/></fig></floats-group></article>
