We previously demonstrated that the neuroprotective compound Cu<sup>II</sup>(atsm) rescues nigral cell loss and improves dopamine metabolism in the MPTP model. The mechanism of action of Cu<sup>II</sup>(atsm) needs to be further defined to understand how the compound promotes neuronal survival. Whole genome transcriptomic profiling has become a popular method to examine the relationship between gene expression and function. Substantia nigra samples from MPTP-lesioned mice were evaluated using whole transcriptome sequencing to investigate the genes altered upon Cu<sup>II</sup>(atsm) treatment. We identified 143 genes affected by MPTP lesioning that are associated with biological processes related to brain and cognitive development, dopamine synthesis and perturbed synaptic neurotransmission. Upon Cu<sup>II</sup>(atsm) treatment, the expression of 40 genes involved in promoting dopamine synthesis, calcium signaling and synaptic plasticity were restored which were validated by qRT-PCR. The study provides the first detailed whole transcriptomic analysis of pathways involved in MPTP-induced Parkinsonism. In addition, we identify key therapeutic pathways targeted by a potentially new class of neuroprotective agents which may provide therapeutic benefits for other neurodegenerative disorders.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD) is characterised by the presence of Lewy bodies, increased synucleinopathy, dopamine reduction in the striatum and degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). The consequence of such disease leads to motor impairments, including tremor dyskinesia, rigidity, instability and tremors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The major pathological hallmarks include mitochondrial impairment, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation leading to neuronal cell death.</p><p>Neurotoxin models of PD are widely used and often require a pathological lesion that results in an approximate 50% decrease of dopaminergic neurones in the SNpc to produce the phenotypic features of late-stage PD. One of the most commonly used neurotoxin based animal models to study PD is the 1-methyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyidine (MPTP) induced mice model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Traditional biochemical methods have permitted researchers to explore the molecular functions and dissect the pathways implicated during neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the MPTP-induced models. Upon intraperitoneal injection of MPTP, the neurotoxin crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB) and is subsequently converted to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP<sup>+</sup>) by glial monoamine oxidase B. MPP<sup>+</sup> is a substrate of the dopamine transporter. MPP<sup>+</sup> then enters the mitochondria and disrupts oxidative phosphorylation by inhibiting complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and results in a mitochondrial-initiated mode of cell death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Molecular approaches using microarrays have shown various changes in gene expression observed in MPTP models, such as, an increase in Bax messenger RNA (mRNA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. In addition, a number of PD associated genes (<italic>Th;</italic> tyrosine hydroxylase, <italic>Nd4;</italic> NADH dehydrogenase, subunit 4, <italic>Sncb;</italic> &#x003b2;-synuclein, <italic>Uchl1;</italic> ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1, <italic>Hsp70;</italic> heat shock protein 70, <italic>Park2;</italic> E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, <italic>NFkB</italic>; nuclear factor kB and <italic>iNOS</italic>; inducible nitric oxide synthase) are found to be altered at various time-points during the course of MPTP lesioning<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Investigating gene alterations in the MPTP mice model that may be involved in the etiology of PD is an approach to identify new potential neuroprotective targets, therapeutic targets and biomarkers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p><p>Several studies have used the MPTP model to demonstrate the effectiveness of potential neuroprotective drugs for PD such as the iron chelator, M30, and others including ladostigil and TV-3326 (N-propargyl-3R-aminoindan-5yl)-ethyl methylcarbamate) which have been found to regulate a number of neuroprotective-adaptive mechanisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Previously, we identified a potential therapeutic for PD, copper(II)diacetylbis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazonato (Cu<sup>II</sup>(atsm)), which rescued PD-relevant phenotypes in multiple animal models including the MPTP mice model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. The administration of MPTP in C57BL/6 mice (40&#x02009;mg/kg i.p.) caused significant reduction (50%; P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) in the number of dopaminergic neurons within the SNpc which caused impairment of motor function and decrease of <italic>Th</italic> and dopamine metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Cu<sup>II</sup>(atsm) treatment was able to rescue nigral cell loss and improve dopamine metabolism in the MPTP model. The potential mechanism behind the neuroprotective affect of Cu<sup>II</sup>(atsm) is the ability of this compound to inhibit peroxynitrate-mediated nitrative stress and consequently the formation of &#x003b1;-synuclein aggregates. It is possible that Cu<sup>II</sup>(atsm) acts on other pathways to promote neuronal survival which needs to be investigated.</p><p>Until now, studies have employed the use of qRT-PCR and microarray technology to decipher the molecular mechanism behind potential therapeutics for PD within mice models. Here, we have employed an RNAseq whole transcriptomic sequencing approach to evaluate the SNpc from MPTP lesioned mice and the changes upon Cu<sup>II</sup>(atsm) treatment. This unbiased high-throughput approach enables the identification of genes relevant to PD that have not been previously associated with the disease and the cellular genes and pathways targeted by Cu<sup>II</sup>(atsm). Furthermore, in addition to Cu<sup>II</sup>(atsm), new targets could be identified to assist in the development of neuroprotective drugs that may exert their protective effect through their ability to modulate target gene expression. In our previous study, MPTP induced decreases in <italic>Snca, Th</italic> and <italic>Vmat2</italic> (vesicular monoamine transporter 2) mRNA expression which recovered to normal levels upon treatment with Cu<sup>II</sup>(atsm). Our previous study provides a rationale to identify all deregulated genes in MPTP-lesioned mice to understand the pathways targeted by this compound <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.</p><p>Here, we identified significantly altered gene expression in targets associated with perturbed synaptic neurotransmission, stress response, Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signalling, cell adhesion, nervous system development and vascular smooth muscle contraction (VSMC) in MPTP-lesioned mice. Additional intrinsic signalling pathways in respect to activated calcium signalling, phosphatidylinositol 3&#x02032; &#x02013;kinase&#x02014;protein kinase B (PI3k-AKT) signalling, and neuronal junctions were also identified and were found to recover upon Cu<sup>II</sup>(atsm) treatment. This study unveils a consistent pattern of expression changes in the transcriptome that correlates with injured or dying neurons under neurotoxic stress by acquiring either adaptive, compensatory or restoratory molecular responses.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Distribution of gene expression in SNpc of MPTP-lesioned mice</title><p>Upon whole transcriptome RNA deep sequencing, the bioinformatics pipeline schematically represented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> was utilised to analyse the data.

The heat map highlights the degree of correlation in gene expression changes across all replicates and their experimental groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>). The variability within experimental groups may be due to effectiveness of the neurotoxic lesioning as Nissl stains of these mice were observed to display the correct pathology.

These genes were of particular interest due to evidence in the literature of their association with PD.

Biological processes were found to be related to brain and cognitive development, neuroplasticity, regulation and cellular response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>).

In the search for new neuroprotective drugs, various compounds have been shown to rescue PD phenotypes in MPTP-induced mice models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.

In our previous study, the beneficial effects of the potential neuroprotective drug Cu<sup>II</sup>(atsm) seen in MPTP-lesioned mice was attributed to its peroxynitrite scavenging abilities thus decreasing protein nitration and retaining neuronal integrity. However, it is likely that Cu<sup>II</sup>(atsm) also mediates other biological activities thus we performed whole transcriptome gene expression sequencing. Unlike microarray<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and qRT-PCR methodology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> whole transcriptome sequencing performed in this study has allowed an in-depth global assessment of all genes Cu<sup>II</sup>(atsm) may target in the SNpc. This study is also the first unbiased whole transcriptome analysis performed on MPTP-lesioned mice which covered 25, 902 genes. This study also addresses whether the MPTP lesioning represents similar aspects of PD in humans at the transcriptional level, and by doing so determine to what degree MPTP toxicity can predict translational targets in PD research. The deregulated genes we identify in the network collectively point towards dopamine synthesis impairment and perturbed synaptic neurotransmission, consistent with their involvement in PD.</p><p>In this study, the level of <italic>Th</italic>, <italic>Ddc and Slc6a4</italic> gene expression decreased which supports the destruction of dopaminergic neurons and loss of dopamine in injured neurons observed in the MPTP model system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.

Low levels of dopamine contribute to the clinical manifestations of muscle stiffness and slowness of movement in PD as these neurotransmitters control coordination and smooth movement. Deregulated <italic>Ddc</italic> not only perturbs the normal biosynthesis of dopamine but also serotonin regulated by the <italic>Slc6a4</italic> (SERT) gene. <italic>Slc6a4</italic> is involved in serotonin uptake and synaptic vesicle trafficking making this transporter protein a potential neuroprotective target. For example, Dextromethorphan, a SERT inhibitor, was found to be neuroprotective for dopaminergic cells in the MPTP-diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) model of Parkinsonism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Furthermore, serotonin and dopamine levels were found to increase upon treatment of MPTP-lesioned mice with M30<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Compared to other studies, other members of the solute carrier family were found to be deregulated such as <italic>Slc6a11</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.

Nonetheless, the alterations of these key PD associated genes within the SNpc reveal that the site of MPTP toxicity may be within the presynaptic terminal of the dopaminergic neurones which subsequently causes the loss of neurotransmission and the phenotypic observations seen in the model. These observations support that the MPTP model is able to recapitulate major hallmarks of the human disease. Furthermore, this exposes possibilities to design neuroprotective compounds that specifically modify gene expression.</p><p>It has been reported that the MPTP neurotoxin also causes an increase in nitrosative stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> however, we did not detect gene expression changes directly associated with nitrostative stress. Rather we detected changes in genes associated with nitrogen-glutamate metabolism (<italic>Shank3</italic>; SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3 and <italic>Car12</italic>; carbonic anyhydrase 12) and calcium signalling (<italic>Adcy1, Oxt, Sphk</italic>; Sphingosine kinase 1 and <italic>Atp2b</italic>) as identified through KEGG pathway analysis. Overall, calcium homeostasis is critical in neuronal cells and regulates many functions such as cell survival and promoting neuronal function and communication<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Calcium also modulates both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) generation, including clearance in the mitochondria and cytosol. The roles of these genes indirectly and directly associated with calcium signalling within the MPTP model need to be further validated to understand whether the alteration causes an upstream or downstream effect in calcium dysregulation or neuronal stress through ROS/NO.</p><p>Cellular communication through tight junctions, gap junctions, adherens junctions and focal adhesion molecules are essential in the nervous system for the transmission of nerve signals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. In this study, increased gene expression of <italic>Igsf5</italic> (immunoglobulin superfamily, member) and <italic>Cldn2</italic> (claudin 2) were perceived to maintain cell polarity upon the loss of neurons after MPTP treatment.

Gap and adheren junctions are critical in cell-to-cell communication through maintaining the homeostasis of the epithelium layer of the BBB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> and communicating changes between the brain and blood stream<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Thus, future studies should involve whole transcriptome sequencing on other sections of the brain in MPTP lesioned mice such as the striatum.</p><p>A major hallmark of PD is the malfunction of presynaptic signalling, however what occurs post-synaptically and intracellularly is less defined. It has been shown that chemokine signalling increases in MPTP-induced mice and activation of this pathway leads to cell adhesion, cell survival, neuronal polarity and synaptic transmission<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. The attributes of chemokine signalling were reflected in the enrichment analysis of GO biological processes and pathways identified in this study. Genes involved in intracellular signal transduction relating to cell stress, cell death or survival<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> include <italic>Mapk13</italic>, <italic>Mef2c</italic> (Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2c) and <italic>Lef1</italic> (lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1). PI3k-Akt signaling pathway is well-known for cell growth and survival. Activation of genes for <italic>Kitl</italic> (kit ligand), <italic>Prlr</italic> (prolactin receptor) and <italic>Vav3</italic> (vav 3 oncogene) may mediate signals for reduction of apoptosis to avoid a major cascade of neuronal death in response to MPTP neurotoxicity. Other chemokine signalling genes identified were <italic>Prkcd</italic> and <italic>Pla2g5.</italic> Although these genes are enriched in the GO enrichment pathway related to vascular muscle, these genes also mediate membrane phospholipid synthesis. Studies have shown that phospholipase A2 show less activity in the SNpc of PD patients which may result in the inability to turnover phospholipids at the neuronal membrane upon oxidative stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. The loss of phospholipase A2 activity may illicit a positive feedback loop to upregulate the transcription of the phospholipase A2 family of enzymes such as <italic>Pla2g5</italic> as seen in MPTP-lesioned mice. Group 6 of the phospholipase A2 (also known as <italic>Park14</italic>) family has been well-characterised to be associated with PD in which single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified in PD patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Conversely, Group V of the phospholipase A2 family have been implicated in inflammation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. These genes identified in post-receptor signalling show activation of cell survival and growth with compensational activation of cell stress and death. This may explain the lack of therapeutic drugs aimed at targeting post-receptor signalling molecules.</p><p>The <italic>Ttr</italic> (transthyretin) gene was found to be one of the most upregulated (FC&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.9, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) genes in SNpc of MPTP-lesioned mice. Transthyretin has been shown to be indirectly associated with PD by its presence in serum and cerebrospinal fluid in Lewy body disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Conversely, the most downregulated gene was <italic>Fat2</italic> (FAT Atypical Cadherin 2, FC&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;4.1, P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.00), a cadherin protein found restricted to the nervous system in the brain, which initial studies have shown its involvement in the development of neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. In addition, a number of homeobox genes (<italic>Hoxc4, Hoxb3os, Hoxb3</italic> and <italic>Hoxb5, FC</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;<italic>1.2</italic>, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;<italic>0.05</italic>) were also found to be significantly downregulated in MPTP mice. These represent a highly conserved family of transcription factors involved in neurogenesis such as neuronal differentiation and neuronal connectivity (reviewed in<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). Other homeobox genes associated with neurogenesis such as <italic>Pitx3</italic> (paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 3) has been shown to in involved in the development of dopamine neurons of the SNpc<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. In this study, <italic>Pitx2</italic> (paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2) was found to show a modest but significant fold change (FC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.9, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). The role of <italic>Hoxc4, Hoxb3os, Hoxb3</italic> and <italic>Hoxb5</italic> should be investigated further in the MPTP mice which may further support the possibility of regenerating neurones in the SNpc through new therapies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>.</p><p>This is the first report revealing possible neuroprotective mechanisms of Cu<sup>II</sup>(atsm) through understanding changes in gene regulation. Some of the restored genes include <italic>Ddc</italic>, <italic>Th</italic>, <italic>Calml</italic>, <italic>Kcne2</italic>, <italic>Sphk1</italic>, <italic>Ptk2b</italic>, <italic>Prkcd</italic> and <italic>Ramp3</italic> which are associated with dopamine synthesis, synaptic neurotransmission and calcium signalling all required for coordination and smooth movement<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. This may explain the significant improvement of motor function in MPTP lesioned mice upon treatment with Cu<sup>II</sup>(atsm) where an increase of TH and dopamine was confirmed by stereological counting of Nissl stained SNpc neurones and Western blotting<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Other restored genes were carbonic anhydrases such as <italic>Car12</italic> which can also modulate neuronal excitability through mediating levels of H<sup>+</sup> ions. H<sup>+</sup> controls pH within and outside of neurones which is fundamental to neuronal development and synaptic plasticity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Furthermore, the regulation of H<sup>+</sup> in the brain requires the conductance of ionic channels and gap junctions to function which associated genes were found to be DE in MPTP-lesioned mice (<italic>Kcne2</italic>, <italic>Slc10a4</italic>, <italic>Col27a1</italic>, <italic>Thbs3</italic>, <italic>Lama 1 and Spp1)</italic> and the majority restored upon Cu<sup>II</sup>(atsm). This suggests that Cu<sup>II</sup>(atsm) may not only promote the survival of dopaminergic neurones but has downstream effects to restore excitability within tissue by promoting the flow of ions through junctions of adjoining cells. Furthermore, Cu<sup>II</sup>(atsm) treatment restored metallothionein 1 and 2 (<italic>Mt1</italic> and <italic>Mt2</italic>) to unlesioned levels by up regulating their expression supporting reported neuroprotective effects of metallothionein (MT) observed in the literature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Overexpression of metallothionein in the brain of MT-transgenic mice inhibited the nitration of &#x003b1;-synuclein and peroxynitrite-induced cell death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. <italic>Ttr</italic> was also restored in MPTP-lesioned mice treated with Cu<sup>II</sup>(atsm). Using qRT-PCR, changes in <italic>Ttr</italic> expression were observed across various sections of the brain in adult unlesioned C57BL mice treated with M30<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. The detection of <italic>Ttr</italic> before and after treatment may support its use as a potential biomarker for monitoring disease progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>.</p><p>The current transcriptomic data provides detailed signalling insights into potential drug targets where disease-modifying drugs can aim to restore dopamine metabolism, promote neurogenesis and re-establish normal homeostatic balance in the synaptic space and within neurons. Here, Cu<sup>II</sup>(atsm) may serve as a promising neuroprotective drug to prevent the destruction of dopaminergic neurons and impairment of dopamine synthesis in PD. The validation of gene expression levels highly associated with PD such as <italic>Th, Ddc</italic> and solute carrier family genes suggests that the other differentially expressed genes identified in this study should be investigated further to uncover new insights into PD pathology and new potential treatments.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Study design</title><p>All studies and analysis were conducted in a blinded fashion to remove any bias associated with analysis.
