We measured gene expression in a set of manually degraded RNAs, nine pairs of matched fresh-frozen, and FFPE RNA isolated from breast tumor with the hybridization based, NanoString nCounter (226 gene panel) and with whole transcriptome RNA-Seq using RiboZeroGold ScriptSeq V2 library preparation kits. We performed correlation analyses of gene expression between samples and across platforms. We then specifically assessed whole transcriptome expression of lincRNA and discovery of eSNVs and fusion transcripts in the FFPE RNA-Seq data. For gene expression in the manually degraded samples, we observed Pearson correlations of &#x0003e;0.94 and &#x0003e;0.80 with NanoString and ScriptSeq protocols, respectively. Gene expression data for matched fresh-frozen and FFPE samples yielded mean Pearson correlations of 0.874 and 0.783 for NanoString (226 genes) and ScriptSeq whole transcriptome protocols respectively, p&#x0003c;2x10<sup>-16</sup>. Specifically for lincRNAs, we observed superb Pearson correlation (0.988) between matched fresh-frozen and FFPE pairs. FFPE samples across NanoString and RNA-Seq platforms gave a mean Pearson correlation of 0.838. In FFPE libraries, we detected 53.4% of high confidence SNVs and 24% of high confidence fusion transcripts. Sensitivity of fusion transcript detection was not overcome by an increase in depth of sequencing up to 3-fold (increase from ~56 to ~159 million reads). Both NanoString and ScriptSeq RNA-Seq technologies yield reliable gene expression data for degraded and FFPE material. The high degree of correlation between NanoString and RNA-Seq platforms suggests discovery based whole transcriptome studies from FFPE material will produce reliable expression data. The RiboZeroGold ScriptSeq protocol performed particularly well for lincRNA expression from FFPE libraries, but detection of eSNV and fusion transcripts was less sensitive.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Technology Development Team, Center for Individualized Medicine, Mayo Clinic, the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, and by the 26.2 with Donna Foundation.

More than one billion samples are preserved with formalin fixed paraffin embedding (FFPE) in hospitals and tissues banks across the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Unfortunately, this method of preservation causes chemical modification and degradation of RNA, compromising the use of genomic technologies such as whole transcriptome sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. </p><p>Formalin induces chemical modification by crosslinking between nucleic acids and proteins, limiting the reverse transcription of mRNA into cDNA, a key step in the process of library preparation for transcriptome sequencing. Further challenges originate from the enrichment procedure of mRNA from the total RNA fraction and subsequent 3&#x02019; amplification bias when starting material is fragmented. There are three potential solutions.</p><p>First, formalin induced chemical modifications are partially reversible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], a process now included in many commercially available nucleic acid extraction kits for FFPE material, such as the one used in this study. A second alternative for accurate gene expression quantitation from FFPE or fragmented material is to avoid cDNA synthesis and subsequent amplification steps altogether, a method employed by the NanoString nCounter system, based on direct measurement of transcript abundance using multiplexed color-coded probe pairs (up to 800 per assay). There are now a number of publications demonstrating the accuracy and precision of the NanoString platform with FFPE material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and its superiority to real-time quantitative PCR with RNA extracted from FFPE material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The NanoString platform relies on prior selection of gene probes, making it the ideal platform for analytical validation of a subset of several hundred genes. The third alternative is to use a whole transcriptome sequencing protocol which avoids 3&#x02019; amplification bias in fragmented RNA. This can be achieved by mRNA selection using depletion of rRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and cDNA synthesis steps with random hexamers. There are now several commercially available kits that employ these methods, but as far as we know, their capability with FFPE material is unquantified.</p><p>The goal of this study was to first assess gene expression using degraded material with the hybridization-based, NanoString nCounter platform (thus avoiding 3&#x02019; amplification bias) and RiboZeroGold / ScriptSeq library preparation (Epicentre) (a rRNA depletion method of mRNA enrichment, designed to avoid 3&#x02019; amplification bias of degraded material), followed by Illumina sequencing. Our experimental design compared manually degraded RNA against the same sample in its original undegraded condition and matched fresh-frozen / FFPE pairs. A high degree of correlation of gene expression between degraded and undegraded sample sets with these genomic applications would indicate the potential of archival material for discovery of gene expression patterns relevant to breast cancer. In addition, use of whole transcriptome RNA-Seq is often described as advantageous over hybridization-based platforms such as the NanoString nCounter or microarrays because next generation sequencing based technologies allow not only quantitation of gene expression, but also simultaneous discovery of genomic features such as single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and fusion transcripts. Hence, we also assessed the capability of the RiboZeroGold / ScriptSeq protocol for discovery of expressed SNVs and fusion transcripts within FFPE material. </p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Sample sets</title><p>Gene expression was assessed in two sample sets.

In addition, two fusion transcripts (ARID4B&#x0003e;LRRN2 and ERBB2&#x0003e;TOM1L1) were detected in TruSeq libraries from frozen material and ScriptSeq FFPE libraries but not in ScriptSeq frozen libraries.</p><p>We next asked the question, could the sensitivity to detect fusion transcripts in FFPE libraries be improved by increased depth of coverage? Of the 19 fusions identified in both TruSeq and ScriptSeq libraries from fresh-frozen material, only 2/19 were detected in FFPE material when using all available reads, in this case ~159 million (~ three-fold increase). We also note that for exactly the same FFPE library (BRB-277), 4/19 fusion transcripts present in the matched fresh-frozen libraries prepared with TruSeq and ScriptSeq were not identified in the FFPE library, despite increasing read depth to 159 million reads. These data suggest that an increase in read depth, at least up to ~3-fold, does not compensate for FFPE specific exonic loss.</p></sec><sec id="s3.10"><title>Expressed single nucleotide variants (eSNVs)</title><p>The library preparation methods used in this study employ different techniques for mRNA enrichment and cDNA synthesis, as demonstrated by a decrease of ~27% of reads mapped to RefSeq genes and exon junctions between TruSeq and ScriptSeq protocols in the same high quality RNA samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081925-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) and the significantly higher number of SNV calls in all ScriptSeq libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081925-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). </p><p>As a measure of data quality, we calculated Transition / transversion (Ti/Tv) ratios for known and novel SNV&#x02019;s and mean quality scores for the alternate allele.

Ti/Tv ratios in both fresh-frozen and FFPE datasets lie within this range, with some differences between the ScriptSeq and TruSeq protocols, and some differences between fresh-frozen and FFPE samples. For known SNV, the fresh-frozen TruSeq libraries showed the highest Ti/Tv ratio (fresh-frozen TruSeq, mean Ti/Tv 2.44, range 2.4-2.51; fresh-frozen ScriptSeq, mean Ti/Tv 2.15, range 2.06-2.27; FFPE ScriptSeq, mean Ti/Tv 2.21, range 2.17-2.25). For novel SNV, the highest Ti/Tv ratio was observed in the FFPE samples (fresh-frozen TruSeq, mean Ti/Tv 1.91, range 1.51-2.39; fresh-frozen ScriptSeq, mean Ti/Tv 1.81, range 1.52-2.39; FFPE ScriptSeq Ti/Tv ratio 2.23, range 2.08-2.39).

Next generation sequencing approaches applied to large clinical samples with detailed phenotypic data are potentially invaluable but sample preservation by formalin-fixation has hindered this application. In this study we assessed the feasibility of RNA sequencing of formalin-fixed material for gene expression including lincRNA expression, discovery of single nucleotide variants and discovery of fusion transcripts. </p><p>RNA sequencing of FFPE material is not possible with methods that require mRNA enrichment by polyA pull-down due to sample degradation. Alternative protocols and platforms are available, but differentiation between artifact due to FFPE and artifact due to different protocols and platforms is equivocal. In this study we break down these differences. We used both a hybridization based platform (NanoString nCounter) and a rRNA depletion protocol for transcriptome sequencing (RiboZeroGold ScriptSeq library preparation with Illumina sequencing) in a set of manually degraded RNAs and a set of nine matched fresh-frozen and FFPE pairs. Correlative analyses of matched fresh-frozen and FFPE pairs on the same platform and for the same samples (both fresh-frozen and FFPE) across platforms demonstrates 1) gene expression data from RNA isolated from FFPE breast tumor is viable; 2) Both the NanoString platform and RiboZeroGold ScriptSeq whole transcriptome sequencing protocols generate reliable gene expression data for degraded and FFPE RNA. </p><p>Our initial study design systematically assessed gene expression as a function of RNA integrity, by correlation of a set of manually degraded RNA samples against undegraded, high quality aliquots of the same sample. Both platforms performed well with no systematic difference between degraded and undegraded states. RNA expression study designs depend on accurate estimation of fold change in expression between different samples. By using two different samples, one from a breast cancer cell line and a universal human reference RNA (a pool of ten different cell lines), we were also able to correlate log<sub>2</sub> fold change between samples in their undegraded and degraded states, further demonstrating the robustness of both the NanoString nCounter platform and the RiboZeroGold ScriptSeq protocol. </p><p>Correlative analyses with manually degraded samples were encouraging for both platforms. However, it is unknown if these artificial changes are representative of the biological changes that we seek in degraded material. Certainly, they do not account for the cross-linking caused by formalin fixation. We next moved to assess three critical issues for gene expression studies in FFPE samples. Firstly, we used technical replicates of RNA isolated from FFPE to assess reproducibility with the NanoString and ScriptSeq protocols, which yielded Pearson correlation &#x0003e;0.99 for both platforms. Secondly, for study designs using a discovery sample from FFPE material, we need to know that the genes that appear to be associated with disease outcome, are not systematic artifacts of FFPE material. This issue was assessed for both platforms by correlation of gene expression in matched pairs of fresh-frozen and FFPE RNA. In agreement with Reis et al (2011), we observed a high degree of correlation between fresh-frozen and FFPE pairs with the NanoString platform, Pearson r=0.874. Using the RiboZeroGold/ScriptSeq protocol, fresh-frozen and FFPE pairs showed slightly lower correlation, (Pearson r=0.783), although significantly better than that reported with quantitative PCR, (Pearson r=0.53), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. </p><p>The third gene expression issue we addressed relates to orthogonal platform validation. Genome-wide studies in discovery samples will generate a high number of disease or disease associated genes, requiring validation and further replication samples. For this reason, it is important to identify genome-wide and replication platforms which achieve high correlation for FFPE material. The two protocols we assessed in this study are very different. The RNA-Seq protocol is based on rRNA depletion and PCR amplification of the cDNA, whereas the NanoString protocol is based on hybridization of selected probes to total RNA, with no cDNA synthesis and no PCR amplification. Despite these differences, these platforms showed excellent correlation for nine FFPE samples, Pearson r=0.838. We believe this combination, ScriptSeq then NanoString is ideally suited for discovery and analytical validation, respectively.</p><p>We next moved to assess the performance of a rRNA depletion protocol for whole transcriptome sequencing of FFPE RNA. By generation of libraries from the same nine RNAs isolated from fresh-frozen tumor, with both TruSeq and ScriptSeq complete kits, we were able to separate those characteristics due to protocol from those due to FFPE. Comparison of sequencing statistics between RNA-Seq protocols revealed a marked (~50%) decrease in the percentage of reads mapping to RefSeq genes and exon junctions in FFPE material, that was not observed in the matched frozen and manually degraded libraries prepared with the same RiboZeroGold ScriptSeq protocol. The exonic loss from RiboZeroGold ScriptSeq FFPE libraries was also reflected in the lower number of fusion transcripts detected, although a significant number (22.2% of total detected fusions) were still identified. </p><p>When comparing the same fresh-frozen samples with TruSeq and RiboZeroGold ScriptSeq protocols, the TruSeq libraries generated a higher percentage of reads mapping to genes, exon junctions and hence a higher number of fusion transcripts. 86.7% of total fusion transcripts identified were present in the TruSeq libraries compared to 68.9% in the ScriptSeq libraries for the same high quality RNA sample. To make these comparisons, we extracted ~56 million reads from each sample (the number of reads observed across all samples ranged from 56 million to 361 million), such that the starting number of total reads was the same. Application of our fusion pipeline to the fully available reads for each sample suggest that an increase in read depth, at least up to ~3-fold would not compensate for these differences.</p><p>However, on the other side of the coin, the RiboZeroGold ScriptSeq protocol is suitable for low starting amounts of FFPE material and also generated a higher proportion of reads mapping to non-coding genes and genes lacking a polyA tail, an aspect which may prove an important characteristic of the breast cancer genome. This was demonstrated both in our own study where we observed superb correlation of lincRNA expression between matched fresh-frozen and FFPE pairs (mean Pearson r = 0.988) and a higher proportion of reads mapping to lincRNAs with the RiboZeroGold ScriptSeq protocol, and independently by Sinicropi et al, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Sinicropi used a novel ribosomal RNA depletion method in combination with the ScriptSeq protocol to prepare libraries from FFPE tumor material of 136 breast cancer patients. The study identified 1,698 transcripts mapping to introns that were associated with breast cancer recurrence. </p><p>Finally, we assessed the quality and sensitivity of SNV detection in our FFPE libraries compared to matched fresh-frozen pairs, and accounting for difference between TruSeq and ScriptSeq protocols. Transition:transversion (Ti/Tv) ratios of the RiboZeroGold ScriptSeq FFPE libraries were within the range reported from DNA sequencing studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and highly similar to their matched RiboZeroGold ScriptSeq counterparts for known SNVs, 2.21 and 2.15 respectively. However, for novel SNVs, the Ti/Tv ratio was slightly higher in FFPE than fresh-frozen material, 2.23 and 1.81 respectively, likely a result of formalin-fixation. </p><p>FFPE samples detected on average 52.2% of SNVs that were detected with high confidence in matched fresh-frozen samples. Lower sensitivity correlated with smaller library insert size, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.73, a parameter that could be used to predict performance of SNV detection specifically for each FFPE sample. Performance of gene expression from FFPE material has previously been correlated with time of fixation rather than age of sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], although not with RNA-Seq or SNV detection and in reality, for many available FFPE samples, fixation time will be unknown. If the sensitivity can be predicted from parameters such as library insert size, this will enable power calculations on required sample size to identify genes with cancer associated SNV.</p><p>In conclusion, we observed a high correlation of gene expression between fresh-frozen and FFPE RNA with both hybridization based and next generation sequencing platforms. The high degree of cross-platform correlation suggests the NanoString nCounter<sup>TM</sup> will provide an excellent platform for analytical validation of gene expression generated from FFPE whole transcriptome datasets. Our data suggest that RiboZeroGold ScriptSeq libraries are also suitable for eSNV and fusion transcript detection with some reduction in sensitivity, the proportion of which may be estimated by library insert size. Library preparation protocols that do not rely on polyA pull-down for mRNA enrichment may allow detection of non-coding genes and genes that lack polyA tails that may be relevant to cancer genomics. </p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0081925.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>A.
