Effective targets to treat advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and biomarkers to predict treatment response are still lacking because of the complexity of pathways involved in ovarian cancer progression. Here we show that miR-181a promotes TGF-&#x003b2;-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition via repression of its functional target, Smad7. miR-181a and phosphorylated Smad2 are enriched in recurrent compared with matched-primary ovarian tumours and their expression is associated with shorter time to recurrence and poor outcome in patients with EOC. Furthermore, ectopic expression of miR-181a results in increased cellular survival, migration, invasion, drug resistance and <italic>in vivo</italic> tumour burden and dissemination. In contrast, miR-181a inhibition via decoy vector suppression and Smad7 re-expression results in significant reversion of these phenotypes. Combined, our findings highlight an unappreciated role for miR-181a, Smad7, and the TGF-&#x003b2; signalling pathway in high-grade serous ovarian cancer.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="i1" xlink:href="ncomms3977-i1.jpg"/>Ovarian cancer is often diagnosed at a late stage when metastasis has already occurred.

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), which accounts for ~90% of all ovarian cancers, has the highest mortality rate among all gynaecological malignancies. This is primarily due to advanced stage at diagnosis and the recurrence of chemotherapy-resistant tumours, resulting in poor overall survival (OS) in the majority of patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. An incomplete understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate disease development poses a major challenge to improving clinical outcome. Hence, elucidating functionally relevant molecular drivers of ovarian cancer progression is crucial for the development of targeted therapy that can help improve survival outcomes in affected patients.</p><p>Recent data from large-scale analysis of numerous high-grade serous ovarian cancer samples suggests that acquisition of invasiveness in ovarian cancer cells is accompanied by the emergence of a mesenchymal subtype of tumours with a transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) gene signature that is associated with poor patient outcome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The driving molecular events behind the mesenchymal subtype in ovarian cancer, however, remain poorly understood. TGF-&#x003b2; is a multifunctional protein that can function either as a tumour suppressor or as a promoter, depending on cellular context. Typically, in cancer cells, TGF-&#x003b2; has been shown to induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which plays a critical role in metastasis and is associated with chemotherapy resistance in numerous cancers. EMT is characterized by loss of epithelial morphology and cytoskeletal reorganization rendering epithelial cells more motile and invasive. Although several studies have uncovered an association between EOC outcome and TGF-&#x003b2;-mediated EMT, the mechanism by which TGF-&#x003b2; signalling is modulated in the disease and the functional relevance of this pathway remain unknown.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in a sequence-specific manner, primarily via base pairing to the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (3&#x02032;UTR) of the target messenger RNA transcripts. Mounting evidence implicates miRNAs as regulators of the tumour phenotype through their ability to modulate the expression of critical genes and signalling networks involved in tumorigenesis and downstream malignant processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Numerous miRNA profiling studies in EOC have identified miRNAs associated with chemotherapy resistance and disease progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In a study analysing 443 advanced EOC specimens from The Cancer Genome Atlas, it was found that high expression of miR-181a was associated with shorter recurrence time (23 versus 59 months, <italic>P</italic>=0.013), possibly implicating a significant role for this miRNA in ovarian cancer pathogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. In addition, miR-181a expression is shown to be regulated by numerous signalling networks, including TGF-&#x003b2;, MYC, oestrogen, STAT3 and Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin, indicating a potential role in regulating cancer-relevant signalling pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Lastly, miR-181a-1 resides in the 1q &#x02018;hotspot&#x02019; region of gain (1q31.3&#x02013;1q32.1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, which is overexpressed in ovarian carcinomas compared with normal tubal and ovarian surface epithelia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. However, the functional relevance of this miRNA in ovarian cancer progression has been unknown.</p><p>In this study, we identify miR-181a as an inducer of TGF-&#x003b2;-mediated EMT, via suppression of Smad7, in ovarian cancer and define a unique mechanism by which the TGF-&#x003b2; signalling pathway is activated in EOC tumours. Our data highlight a functional role for miR-181a in ovarian cancer biology and uncover a potential prognostic biomarker and molecular target for the treatment of EOC.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Elevated expression of miR-181a in advanced-stage EOC</title><p>To assess the clinical relevance of miR-181a in EOC, we analysed its expression in a clinically annotated patient cohort of high-grade stage-III primary papillary serous ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) by Taqman-based real-time quantitative reverse transcription&#x02013;PCR (qRT&#x02013;PCR). Using the median expression value of miR-181a as a cutoff point, the cohort was dichotomized into miR-181a-high- or miR-181a-low-expressing tumours. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 59.9 months for patients with low miR-181a expression, whereas in patients with high levels of miR-181a the median PFS was 7.1 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <italic>P</italic>=0.002, odds ratio (OR): 7.8, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 7.2&#x02013;8.4, log-rank Mantel&#x02013;Cox test). Furthermore, patients with low miR-181a levels exhibited a median OS of 66.6 months in contrast to a median OS of 24.9 months in patients with high expression levels of miR-181a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>, <italic>P</italic>=0.002, OR: 2.7, 95% CI: 2.1&#x02013;3.3, log-rank Mantel&#x02013;Cox test). In addition, tumours of patients with PFS&#x0003c;6 months (clinically described as platinum resistant) had higher expression of miR-181a (<italic>P</italic>=0.01, two-tailed Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test) when compared with patients with PFS&#x0003e;6 months (platinum sensitive; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the clinicopathological features of these two groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Given that miR-181a belongs to a miRNA family that consists of miR-181a, -b, -c and -d, we also analysed the expression of all four miR-181 family members in our clinically annotated patient cohort. Only miR-181a and -b were readily detectable in all patient samples. Consistent with the fact that these two miRNAs are transcribed as a single polycistronic transcript from the same chromosomal locations, similar to miR-181a, miR-181b also showed a correlation with patient outcome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Interestingly, other miRNAs previously reported to be overexpressed in EOC, specifically miR-183 and miR-203, did not have similar correlations with clinical outcomes in our patient cohort<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). Taken together, these data support the association between high miR-181a expression and poor patient outcome. Given that miRNA gene families that are coexpressed from the same cluster and share the same seed region tend to have redundant biological functions and regulate the same sets of target genes, we focused on elucidating the biological effect of miR-181a.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>miR-181a promotes EMT transition</title><p>Given the clinical evidence of its association with both poor PFS and OS, we assessed the functional role of miR-181a in ovarian cancer biology. We stably expressed miR-181a (p181a), an empty vector (pBABE) and a vector expressing a mutant form of miR-181a (p181a mut) in the A2780 cell line (derived from chemotherapy-naive primary epithelial ovarian tumour), which expresses the lowest relative levels of miR-181a compared with a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines and primary patient samples. The miR-181a expression in the two independently derived polyclonal pools of miR-181a-transduced cells (p181a 1 and p181a 2) was comparable to the basal expression in the other ovarian cancer cell lines, as well as patient samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). Functional assessment of the exogenous miR-181a was achieved using lentiviral-based miRNA sensor vectors carrying the mCherry reporter gene with either four miR-181a-binding sites in the 3&#x02032;UTR or no binding site, serving as a transduction control. Only p181a 1 and p181a 2 cells exhibited strong downregulation of reporter expression when infected with the mCherry-based miR-181a sensor, confirming enhanced expression of functionally active miR-181a (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). Ectopic expression of miR-181a resulted in a fibroblast-like mesenchymal appearance of cells with loss of epithelial features consistent with EMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). These morphological features were consistent with defined molecular alterations that occur during the induction of EMT as demonstrated by decreased expression of epithelial markers, E-cadherin and keratin 8, and a concomitant increase in the expression of mesenchymal markers, N-cadherin, fibronectin and Col3A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>). In addition, immunofluorescence staining for pan-cytokeratin and vimentin further supports miR-181a&#x02019;s ability to induce EMT; the miR-181a-expressing cells have significantly higher vimentin expression and lower pan-cytokeratin staining compared with both the pBABE and p181a mut cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>). The miR-181a-induced EMT-like features were also observed in an additional ovarian serous adenocarcinoma cell line, HEY (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>).</p><p>EMT plays an important role in cell motility, cellular survival, drug response and tumour dissemination <italic>in vivo</italic>; therefore, we next assessed whether miR-181a-induced EMT affected these biological processes. Colony-formation assay revealed that enhanced miR-181a expression increased cellular survival and conferred platinum resistance without affecting cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>). In addition, wound-healing, transwell migration and invasion assays showed that miR-181a overexpression significantly increased cellular motility and invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c&#x02013;e</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, we examined the effects of miR-181a on cancer cell dissemination <italic>in vivo</italic>, using two preclinical orthotopic mouse models of ovarian cancer. First, to assess the ability of miR-181a to promote survival and implantation of ovarian tumours within the peritoneal cavity during late-stage disease, miR-181a-overexpressing or pBABE cells were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) into nude mice. After 3 weeks, tumour cell dissemination and overall tumour burden was measured on necropsy. Interestingly, although the cell lines were injected i.p., all mice formed tumours within the ovary but, remarkably, only the miR-181a-overexpressing cells formed disseminated nodules within the peritoneal cavity (<italic>P</italic>=0.01, OR: 47.67, 95% CI: 1.6&#x02013;1424, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test), which correlated with increased overall tumour burden (<italic>P</italic>=0.03, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). On average, each mouse injected with p181a 1-expressing cells had &#x0003e;10 intraperitoneal nodules disseminated throughout the omentum and peritoneum, and some had metastasized to the diaphragm. We confirmed that transcriptional changes in EMT markers were maintained in the miR-181a-expressing cells <italic>in vivo</italic> through qRT&#x02013;PCR of epithelial and mesenchymal markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>).</p><p>Next, to assess the effect of miR-181a on the early events of metastasis, we utilized an orthotopic ovarian xenograft model wherein the pBABE or the p181a-expressing cells were directly injected under the ovarian bursa. Similar to the intraperitoneal model, mice injected with miR-181a-expressing cells had a greater degree of metastatic dissemination compared with the pBABE control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d,e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Specifically, miR-181a-expressing cells had increased invasion through the ovarian bursa followed by peritoneal spread with colonization to organs within the peritoneal cavity. Significantly larger peritoneal nodules and a higher percentage of nodules that disseminated to the surface of the peritoneum, bowel mesentery, omentum, spleen, and diaphragm were observed in the mice injected with miR-181a-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d&#x02013;f</xref>). Interestingly, there were no observed differences in the primary ovarian tumour burden between pBABE- and p181a-injected mice, highlighting that miR-181a affects the invasive capacity of the cells rather than the proliferative state. In addition, immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of the intraperitoneal nodules revealed that the miR-181a tumours had spindle-like, mesenchymal features, whereas the pBABE tumours had a more uniform cuboidal, epithelial growth pattern (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3f</xref>). To definitively quantify these differences in morphology, the per cent of pan-cytokeratin and N-cadherin staining was determined for all tumours, and consistent with the morphological differences the miR-181a-expressing tumours had significantly less pan-cytokeratin <italic>(P=</italic>0.04, two-tailed Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test) and more N-cadherin staining (<italic>P</italic>=0.05, two-tailed Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>miR-181a inhibition suppresses migration and cell survival</title><p>A tough decoy (TuD) vector specific to miR-181a was utilized to determine the effect of miR-181a inhibition on EMT-driven phenotypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. The SKOV3 ovarian cancer line, which has relatively high expression levels of miR-181a, was stably transduced with either the TuD&#x02013;miR-181a (miR-181a decoy) or TuD&#x02013;miR-331.3p (control decoy) vector. Cells transduced with TuD&#x02013;miR-181a exhibited decreased expression levels of miR-181a when compared with cells transduced with TuD&#x02013;miR-331.3p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). In addition, the mCherry miR-181a sensor reporter vector confirmed a &#x0003e;80% inhibition of miR-181a function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p><p>Stable inhibition of miR-181a led to differences in morphology and gene expression consistent with mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, wherein the cells reverted from a more spindle-like morphology to an epithelial-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Western blot analysis confirmed a significant increase in the epithelial marker (E-cadherin) and a decrease in mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin and Col3A1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). In addition, immunofluorescence staining for E-cadherin and F-actin corroborated that targeted inhibition of miR-181a resulted in cells losing their mesenchymal characteristics and becoming more epithelial as indicated by localization of E-cadherin and F-actin at cell&#x02013;cell junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Functionally, miR-181a inhibition led to a decrease in cellular survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>) and rendered the cells less migratory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>miR-181a is a novel modulator of the TGF-&#x003b2; signalling pathway</title><p>To identify the cellular pathways modulated by miR-181a and define specific targets driving the observed EMT phenotype, we performed high-throughput RNA sequencing (Illumina) on A2780 pBABE and p181a cell lines with a combination of computational target prediction, global transcriptome- and pathway-based analysis. Using a threshold of a minimum fold change &#x0003e;5 or fold change &#x0003c;5 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, Fisher exact test,) we identified a total of 739 differentially expressed genes: 705 downregulated and 34 upregulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1 and 2</xref>). The high-throughput mRNA sequencing data revealed alterations in the epithelial and mesenchymal markers consistent with global activation of an EMT-like genetic programme (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). Interestingly, nearly 7% of the significantly downregulated genes had putative miR-181a-binding site(s) as predicted by TargetScan (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). We next utilized the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (Ingenuity, Inc.) to further define potential targets and the major pathways/networks driving the miR-181a-mediated EMT phenotypes. The TGF-&#x003b2; signalling pathway was the most significantly dysregulated pathway among those with significant number of genes altered by &#x0003e;5-fold (<italic>P</italic>=1.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>).</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2; is among several growth factors that can act as inducers of EMT and has been found to play an important role in cancer invasion and metastasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Thus, we sought to explore the role of miR-181a in the regulation of TGF-&#x003b2; signalling in ovarian cancer. Given that the receptor-regulated SMADs (R-Smads), Smad2 and Smad3, are key intracellular mediators of cellular responses to TGF-&#x003b2; signalling, we assessed the effects of miR-181a expression on the phosphorylation of Smad2 (P-Smad2) and Smad3 (P-Smad3). In both stable cell lines expressing miR-181a, P-Smad2 and P-Smad3 expressions were increased with a concomitant decrease in the inhibitory Smad, Smad7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Consistent with the activation of the TGF-&#x003b2; signalling pathway, the activin receptor (ACVR2A) and the type-I TGF-&#x003b2; receptor were also increased in miR-181a-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Next, we utilized both a TGF-&#x003b2;/activin-responsive p3TP reporter and the SBE4-luc reporter to assess TGF-&#x003b2; transcriptional response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. We found that miR-181a overexpression induced both p3TP and SBE4-luc reporter activities and, conversely, stable inhibition of miR-181a led to a decrease in SBE4-luc reporter expression by &#x0003e;20% and reduction of the phosphorylation of Smad2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c,d</xref>). Furthermore, the addition of a type-I TGF-&#x003b2; receptor kinase inhibitor, SB431542, blocked miR-181a-induced phosphorylation of Smad2 and restored Smad7 expression in the miR-181a-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>TGF-&#x003b2; activation correlates with poor patient outcome</title><p>Given that our data support a role for miR-181a in regulating TGF-&#x003b2; signalling in ovarian cancer and recent studies have shown that a TGF-&#x003b2; gene signature correlates with poor patient outcome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, we next sought to assess whether TGF-&#x003b2; activation and miR-181a expression correlate with EOC disease progression and recurrence in patient samples. Unlike previous studies, which relied on gene expression analysis to assess TGF-&#x003b2; activation, we utilized a protein-based functional target, P-Smad2, which is phosphorylated on activation of the TGF-&#x003b2; pathway. The distribution of P-Smad2-positive cells, as well as the intensity of staining, varied depending on progression-free interval (PFI) and were mainly localized to the nuclei of tumour cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Overall immune scores in our patient cohort, which were calculated using the Allred scoring system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, ranged from 0 to 7 with an overall median score of 2.

Specifically, patient tumours that either had low miR-181a or low P-Smad2 expression had median PFI&#x02019;s of 56 and 53 months, respectively, whereas in patient tumours with both low miR-181a and P-Smad2 expressions the median PFI doubled to 123 months (<italic>P</italic>=0.0007, OR: 18.7, 95% CI: 9.2&#x02013;37.8, log-rank Mantel&#x02013;Cox test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S7</xref>); differences for OS were similar.

Given the clinical and functional relevance of miR-181a we have uncovered in our initial patient cohort, we next wanted to assess whether miR-181a was differentially expressed in recurrent tumours compared with matched-primary tumours. The expression of miR-181a was assessed in patient matched-tumour biopsies that were taken at primary surgery (PS-O, chemotherapy-naive ovarian tumour) and at secondary surgery (SCR, after tumour has recurred after at least two lines of chemotherapy). In the SCR tumours, miR-181a expression was upregulated 2.51-fold compared with that in PS-O (<italic>P</italic>=0.0006, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S8</xref>).

In accordance with all previous data, we observed that the SCR tumours with distinct molecular features of TGF-&#x003b2;-activated EMT (group A) had elevated miR-181a expression (<italic>P</italic>=0.0006, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S8</xref>). In recurrent tumours lacking a distinct EMT signature (group B), miR-181a was also upregulated but not as significantly as those with the EMT signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S8</xref>). In addition, in the tumours with an EMT signature, there was a significant correlation between the expression of miR-181a and several EMT markers. Notably, the mesenchymal markers, <italic>Col5A1</italic> and <italic>Col3A1</italic>, drew a positive correlation (<italic>Col5A1</italic>: <italic>R</italic>=0.42, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.047 and <italic>Col3A1</italic>: <italic>R</italic>=0.45, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.033, Pearson&#x02019;s correlation; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>) and the epithelial marker, <italic>E-cadherin</italic>, had a significant inverse correlation with miR-181a expression (<italic>E-cadherin</italic>: <italic>R</italic>=&#x02212;0.44, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.03, Pearson&#x02019;s correlation; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Smad7 is a direct functional target of miR-181a</title><p>We next sought to identify the functional target(s) driving miR-181a-mediated TGF-&#x003b2; pathway activation. The expression of Smad7, a key negative regulator of TGF-&#x003b2; signalling, was decreased ~30-fold in miR-181a-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). In addition, correlation analysis using miRConnect revealed that Smad7 expression was significantly negatively correlated with miR-181a levels (summed Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient=&#x02212;6.2, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>To verify that Smad7, whose miR-181a seed target region is highly conserved among species, is a direct target of miR-181a, a luciferase-based reporter assay containing the Smad7 3&#x02032;UTR was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a,b</xref>). Enhanced expression of miR-181a significantly decreased luciferase reporter activity, whereas no change in luciferase expression was evident in the p181a mut cells as compared with the pBABE control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). In addition, a mutated Smad7 3&#x02032;UTR, in which four nucleotides of the miR-181a binding site is abolished, no longer responds to miR-181a modulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). Conversely, sequestration of miR-181a by the aforementioned decoy vectors abrogated the inhibitory effect of the miRNA on the Smad7 3&#x02032;UTR reporter constructs and led to an increase in both Smad7 mRNA and protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c,d</xref>). Consistent with Smad7 3&#x02032;UTR reporter results, endogenous levels of Smad7 were also significantly downregulated at both the RNA and protein levels in cells stably expressing miR-181a compared with pBABE or p181a mut cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figs 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">7e</xref>); this downregulation was also observed in our <italic>in vivo</italic> intraperitoneal tumour tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7f</xref>).</p><p>To determine the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of the miR-181a&#x02013;Smad7&#x02013;TGF-&#x003b2; axis, we next assessed the expression of Smad7 in primary ovarian tumours. First, we found that Smad7 was significantly downregulated in recurrent ovarian tumours compared with matched-primary tumours (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.00001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7g</xref>). Second, analysis of the matched-primary and recurrent ovarian tumours revealed a significant negative correlation between miR-181a and Smad7 expression, consistent with the notion that miR-181a regulates Smad7 expression (<italic>r</italic>=&#x02212;0.96, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001, Pearson&#x02019;s correlation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7h</xref>). In addition, given that our data supports the direct regulation of Smad7 by miR-181a and miR-181a correlates with poor patient outcome, it is important to assess whether there were a correlation between Smad7 expression and patient outcome. Smad7 qRT&#x02013;PCR was performed on all ovarian tumours and a significant correlation between low Smad7 expression and poor patient outcome was observed (Supplementary Fig. S8). Specifically, the median PFI for patients with tumours that had low Smad7 expression was 8.7 months compared with 29.6 months for patients that were expressing higher levels of Smad7 <italic>(P=</italic>0.05, OR: 3.4, 95% CI: 2.9&#x02013;3.9, log-rank Mantel&#x02013;Cox test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S8</xref>). In addition, OS also significantly varied between the two groups, wherein patients with low expression of Smad7 in their tumours had a median survival of 36.8 months compared with 76.2 months for those who had high expression (<italic>P</italic>=0.05, OR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.5&#x02013;2.6, log-rank Mantel&#x02013;Cox test). Together, this data highlight a hitherto unappreciated role of Smad7 in ovarian cancer and define a unique mechanism by which the TGF-&#x003b2; pathway is activated in ovarian cancer tumours and contributes to poor patient outcome.</p><p>Next, to determine whether Smad7 inhibition can phenocopy the effects of miR-181a overexpression on ovarian cancer cells, we generated two independent cell lines expressing short hairpin RNA targeting different sites of the Smad7 gene (<italic>shSmad7-54</italic> and <italic>shSmad7-55</italic>). Our data reveals that targeted knockdown of Smad7 results in EMT-like features in which there is a decrease of epithelial markers E-cadherin and keratin 8, and an increase in the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>). Although we see these changes in EMT marker expression, there are no marked phenotypic changes as observed with miR-181a overexpression, thus suggesting that possibly there are other pathways and genes contributing to the miR-181a-induced EMT phenotype. In addition, we observe that Smad7 inhibition can activate TGF-&#x003b2; signalling as indicated by the induction of phosphorylated Smad2 and a concomitant increase in p3TP and SBE4-luc reporter activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a,b</xref>). Consistent with the induction of EMT-like features and activation of the TGF-&#x003b2; signalling pathway, Smad7 inhibition leads to a marked increase in the invasive potential of ovarian cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8c</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, to further assess whether Smad7 is a functional target of miR-181a that is mediating the EMT phenotypes, experiments were performed wherein Smad7 lacking the 3&#x02032;UTR was re-expressed in the pBABE and p181a 1 cells. Smad7 re-expression, which was confirmed to be localized to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S9</xref>), was able to attenuate miR-181a-induced EMT as demonstrated by morphological changes and the relative expression of epithelial and mesenchymal cellular markers E-cadherin, keratin 8, N-cadherin and Col3A1 on both the mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9a&#x02013;c</xref>). Re-expression of Smad7 also abrogated the ability of miR-181a to activate TGF-&#x003b2; signalling as shown by SBE4-luc activity assay, as well as phosphorylation of Smad2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9d</xref>). In addition, the functional effects of miR-181a overexpression on cellular survival were also abolished by the re-expression of Smad7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9e</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The issues of tumour recurrence, drug resistance, enhanced invasion and metastasis remain a challenge in the treatment and the clinical management of EOC. Despite a better understanding of EOC genetic alterations in the recent years, our ability to translate these findings into more effective treatments have been limited by the difficulty in identifying functionally relevant drivers of the disease.

In addition, ovarian tumours and paired ascites fluid secrete significant amounts of TGF-&#x003b2;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, thus making it imperative to understand the effects of TGF-&#x003b2; on ovarian tumour biology and the factors that regulate this signalling pathway. In addition, the importance of further understanding the molecular underpinnings involved in TGF-&#x003b2;-induced EMT in EOC was recently highlighted in a comprehensive analysis, which demonstrates that tumours, which display a TGF-&#x003b2;-induced mesenchymal signature, correlate with poor OS. In this study, they also uncovered that a miRNA regulatory network, which consisted of a set of 19 miRNAs that were downregulated and inhibited EMT, governed the ovarian cancer mesenchymal phenotype. However, this study does not explore miRNAs that are upregulated in the more aggressive mesenchymal subtype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Our present study provides an understanding of how enhanced expression of miR-181a can confer malignant and invasive traits through the modulation of a canonical signalling pathway and a consequent maintenance of a mesenchymal state. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-181a led to a reversion of EMT and subsequent events through decreased TGF-&#x003b2; signalling. Our data confirmed <italic>Smad7</italic> as a functional target through which TGF-&#x003b2;-mediated EMT occurs; re-expression of Smad7 lacking its 3&#x02032;UTR was able to rescue miR-181a-mediated phenotypes, deeming Smad7 as a critical mediator of miR-181a-induced EMT. Other recent studies support the crucial role(s) that miRNAs play in mediating EMT and consequent aggressive disease traits.

Our study suggests that the use of biomarkers that regulate the EMT process, such as miR-181a, P-Smad2 and Smad7, may provide a more functionally relevant prognostic marker(s).

Consequently, we show that the expressions of miR-181a, Smad7, and P-Smad2, significantly correlate with PFS and OS in a well-annotated advanced-stage EOC patient cohort. Stratifying patients by miR-181a, Smad7, or P-Smad2 expression in their primary tumour before chemotherapy treatment predicted clinical response and survival. Through the use of both an intraperitoneal and intrabursal mouse models of ovarian cancer, we confirmed the functional relevance of miR-181a in ovarian cancer dissemination and progression; we consistently observed that mice implanted with cells expressing miR-181a had increased overall tumour burden with a significantly higher incidence of metastatic nodules in the peritoneum. Importantly, mRNA and IHC analyses of these tumours showed the maintenance of EMT <italic>in vivo</italic>, as well as decreased levels of <italic>Smad7</italic>. Furthermore, the analysis of a second clinical cohort of patient matched-primary and recurrent EOC tumours revealed a significant enrichment of miR-181a expression in recurrent tumours compared with primary chemotherapy-naive tumours.

Cheng, Stanford University) was utilized to generate miR-181a-overexpressing cell lines. Mutations in the miR-181a seed sequence were generated using Change-IT Multiple Mutation Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (USB). Retrovirus was generated by co-transfection of the above constructs with packaging plasmids into Phx cells. Transduced A2780 and HEY were FACS-sorted for green fluorescent protein (GFP) positivity. The FACS data were acquired using the BD LSR II machine and analysed using FlowJo 8.8.7 software.</p><p>The pCDNA3.1-Smad7 construct (donated by Dr Carl-Hendrik Heldin, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Sweden), containing <italic>Smad7</italic> cDNA lacking the 3&#x02032;UTR, was excised out of the pCDNA3.1 vector backbone using <italic>Bam</italic>H1 and <italic>Xho</italic>1 (NEB) and amplified by PCR; the purified cDNA was then ligated into the pBABE-puro vector backbone post digestion with <italic>Bam</italic>H1 and <italic>Sal</italic>1 (NEB).

For the generation of the shSmad7 stable cell lines, the A2780 cell line was stably transduced with shScrambled and shSmad7 retroviral-based constructs (OriGene) for stable knockdown of Smad7. Retrovirus was generated using the Phx cells and serial infections over 72&#x02009;h was achieved with polybrene (2&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).

A sterile 200&#x02009;&#x003bc;l pipette tip was used to scratch the cells to form a wound. The cells were washed with PBS and cultured in serum-free medium (and full media for SKOV3 cells). Wound closure was visualized with an inverted Nikon Eclipse TS100 phase-contrast microscope and measured using Nikon NIS-Element Basic Research v3.2 software. For the transwell migration assay (Cell BioLabs), 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells (in serum-free media) were plated into the upper chamber. The cells were incubated in 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 24&#x02009;h and migratory cells were subsequently harvested for quantification via a colorimetric absorbance reading at 560&#x02009;nm.</p><p>For the invasion assay, 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells were suspended in serum-free medium and seeded into the inserts of a 24-well BD BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chamber (catalogue number 354480) in triplicate. Inserts were co-cultured in a well of fetal bovine serum-containing media as an attractant. Chambers along with inserts were incubated at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere for 48&#x02009;h. Inserts were then removed and the upper surface of the membrane was scrubbed to remove non-migrating cells. Inserts were then fixed with 100% methanol and stained with Millipore Cell Satin (catalogue number 90144). Multiple &#x000d7; 10 images per well were acquired and average counts were calculated.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Gene expression analysis using RNA-sequencing data</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from two polyclonal pools of A2780 cells expressing exogenous miR-181a (p181a 1 and p181a 2) and pBABE control cells. The Illumina RNASeq kit was used to prepare sequencing libraries. The method is as follows: 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;g of high-quality total RNA was incubated with oligo(dT) magnetic beads (SeraMag) to enrich for mRNA with poly-A tails. Eluted RNA was randomly cleaved by incubation at 94&#x02009;&#x000b0;C with a magnesium buffer. The RNA is ethanol precipitated and then reverse transcribed (Invitrogen SuperScript II). DNA polymerase is added to generate a second strand. Double-stranded DNA after second-strand synthesis contains ends with 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-overhangs, and these are filled in using T4 polymerase and T4 polynucleotide kinase, resulting in a blunt-ended DNA molecule. Then a deoxyadenosine 5&#x02032;-tail is added to DNA strands using the Klenow fragment (exo-). Double-stranded DNA adapters with 3&#x02032;-thymidine overhangs are ligated to the deoxyadenosine-tailed library using T4 ligase. The library was then size selected on a 2% agarose gel and amplified with 15 cycles of PCR (NEB Phusion polymerase). This procedure adds the sequences needed for binding to the Illumina flow cell and sequencing primer-binding sites. RNA-Seq libraries were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 for a 100-nt read length. Transcriptome raw reads were mapped to the human reference genome (hg19). The coverage over the length of the gene is variable due to various biases inherent to the sequencing and sample preparation process. To avoid problems arising from this, we generated a density profile using windows of 50&#x02009;bp sliding over the length of each gene, and the median of this density profile was picked as the representative coverage for the gene using an in-house mRNA-seq expression profile pipeline. The coverage is corrected using log-transformation and quantile normalization. Putative miRNA targets were predicted using TargetScan ( <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.targetscan.org">http://www.targetscan.org</ext-link>) and miRConnect ( <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mirconnect.org">http://mirconnect.org</ext-link>).
