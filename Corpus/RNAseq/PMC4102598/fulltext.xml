The precise molecular mechanisms that shape the latent histone modification landscape, however, remain unknown. Promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NB), also called nuclear domain 10 (ND10), have emerged as mediators of innate immune responses that can limit viral gene expression via chromatin based mechanisms. Consequently, although ND10 functions thus far have been almost exclusively investigated in models of productive herpesvirus infection, it has been proposed that they also may contribute to the establishment of viral latency. Here, we report the first systematic study of the role of ND10 during KSHV latency establishment, and link alterations in the subcellular distribution of ND10 components to a temporal analysis of histone modification acquisition and host cell gene expression during the early infection phase. Our study demonstrates that KSHV infection results in a transient interferon response that leads to induction of the ND10 components PML and Sp100, but that repression by ND10 bodies is unlikely to contribute to KSHV latency establishment. Instead, we uncover an unexpected role for soluble Sp100 protein, which is efficiently and permanently relocalized from nucleoplasmic and chromatin-associated fractions into the insoluble matrix. We show that LANA expression is sufficient to induce Sp100 relocalization, likely via mediating SUMOylation of Sp100. Furthermore, we demonstrate that depletion of soluble Sp100 occurs precisely when repressive H3K27me3 marks first accumulate on viral genomes, and that knock-down of Sp100 (but not PML or Daxx) facilitates H3K27me3 acquisition. Collectively, our data support a model in which non-ND10 resident Sp100 acts as a negative regulator of polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2) recruitment, and suggest that KSHV may actively escape ND10 silencing mechanisms to promote establishment of latent chromatin.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>KSHV is the etiological agent of several cancers including Kaposi's sarcoma, one of the most frequent tumors in Sub-Saharan Africa. Since the proliferating cells in these cancers are latently infected with KSHV, there is an urgent need to elucidate the molecular basis underlying latency establishment. While it is well established that intricate histone modification patterns preserve the latent state, the mechanisms that lead to primary establishment of such patterns and subsequent formation of repressive heterochromatin remain largely unknown. During the last years, components of distinct nuclear compartments, so called ND10 or PML bodies, have emerged as modulators of viral chromatin and gene expression. Here, we present the first systematic analysis of the mutual influence between KSHV and ND10 components during the early infection phase. We find that latent KSHV infection dramatically alters the sub-nuclear distribution of the soluble form of a ND10 core protein termed Sp100. This relocalization likely serves to facilitate the recruitment of polycomb repressive complexes and formation of facultative heterochromatin, and we hence propose that soluble Sp100 is an antagonist of KSHV latency establishment. Our findings have important implications for the understanding of viral latency establishment and also provide valuable insight into cellular chromatin regulation pathways.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology is supported by the Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg and the Bundesministerium f&#x000fc;r Gesundheit (BMG).

The majority of proliferating tumor cells in these malignancies are latently infected with KSHV and do not produce viral progeny. In such cells, the virus persists as an extrachromosomal episome that undergoes licensed DNA replication and faithful segregation to daughter cells upon cell division. A key mediator of these processes is the latency associated nuclear antigen (LANA), a multifunctional protein which recruits the cellular DNA replication machinery to the latent origin of replication at the onset of S-phase, and which furthermore tethers viral episomes to host chromosomes during meiosis <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Verma1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004274-Garber1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. While constitutive LANA expression is a principal requirement for establishment and maintenance of latency, expression of lytic genes must be suppressed in order to prevent productive cycle entry. We have previously shown that latent viral chromatin of PEL-derived cell lines as well as <italic>de novo</italic> infected cells exhibits highly distinct patterns of activating and repressive histone modifications <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Gunther1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Especially in <italic>de novo</italic> infected cells, the latter comprise almost exclusively tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a facultative heterochromatin mark that is abundantly present on viral genomes at day 5 of a <italic>de novo</italic> infection. In contrast, DNA methylation patterns require weeks to evolve, indicating that this epigenetic mark does not contribute to primary latency establishment <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Gunther1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. While the LANA promoter stays exempt from H3K27me3 modification, we and others have observed that the simultaneous presence of activating H3K4me3 and repressive H3K27me3 marks creates a bivalent state of repression at the promoter of the lytic master switch transactivator Rta encoded by ORF50 <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Gunther1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004274-Hilton1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, suggesting that H3K27me3-mediated suppression of lytic gene transcription is an important feature of viral latency.</p><p><italic>De novo</italic> acquisition of H3K27me3 marks is catalyzed by the methyl-transferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2), which together with Suz12 and Eed forms the core components of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). It is thought that the primary mediator of transcriptional repression at H3K27me3-marked loci is the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), a multiprotein complex which binds to H3K27me3 via its CBX subunit and subsequently catalyzes ubiquitination of histone H2A at lysine 119 (H2AK119ub). In accord with this model, a recent study found that both PRC1 and H2AK119ub are recruited to H3K27me3-modified regions on the KSHV genome during latency, and that shRNA-mediated depletion of Ezh2 significantly reduces levels of H3K27me3 as well as H2AK119ub and PRC1 occupancy <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Toth2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

<xref rid="ppat.1004274-Owerbach1" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>. As for other nuclear structures, protein accumulation at ND10 does not necessarily indicate that these bodies also represent the primary (or only site) of protein activity. For instance, ND10s respond to stress by releasing Daxx and Sp100, leading to an alteration of heat-shock-protein synthesis <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Nefkens1" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>. Hence, whereas some proteins may be active within ND10 <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Borden1" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>, others may initially be sequestered at these structures, leading to the so called depot hypothesis for protein accumulation and function at ND10s <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Negorev1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Since viral replication centers are often located near ND10s, however, and since many viruses including KSHV <xref rid="ppat.1004274-MarcosVillar1" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004274-Full1" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref> disrupt or reorganize ND10s during productive replication, it has been proposed that ND10s may serve as mediators of innate immune responses that induce transcriptional silencing of invading nucleic acids.

Although proposed for a number of herpesviruses, however, such models have never been rigorously tested in experimental systems. We here present the first such study in which we have performed a detailed investigation of the role of ND10s and ND10 components on the primary establishment of KSHV latency and the acquisition of repressive H3K27me3 marks.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The epigenetic landscape of latent KSHV episomes is established independently of virion-associated factors</title><p>In order to begin elucidating the mechanisms that control the establishment of latent histone modification patterns, we first sought to clarify whether such patterns are shaped by virion-associated factors and/or signaling events induced by virion binding or entry. For this purpose, we analyzed histone modification patterns acquired by KSHV bacmid DNA (BAC16, kindly provided by J.

As shown in the upper panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, we find that the earliest detectable epigenetic event is the emergence of the distinct peak profiles of activating H3K4me3 marks. These profiles were almost fully established at the 24 h time point, after which only a few loci exhibited relative changes in their modification status. The latter exclusively comprise peaks that are present at the earliest time point, but are diminished or eradicated over the following two days (see, for example, the arrow-marked peaks upstream of K2, or the three peaks located between ORFs 61 and 64 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g001">Figure 1B</xref>); we did not observe any major peaks that were newly established after the initial 24 h sampling point. In contrast to the activating H3K4me3 modification, H3K27me3 profiles were established with markedly different dynamics, evolving more slowly and not reaching their full extent until 72 h post infection (lower panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The overall validity of this finding was furthermore confirmed by conventional ChIP-qPCR performed at a number of selected loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004274.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Interestingly, we did not find any evidence for the hypothesis that the H3K27me3 modification may spread from initial nucleation sites. Instead, all regions that ultimately become H3K27me3-modified acquire the modification simultaneously and in a gradual fashion. As a consequence, the KSHV genome evolves from a predominantly open chromatin state to one that is progressively defined by heterochromatic and putative bivalent chromatin regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The majority of changes occur between the 24 h and 48 h post infection; comparison to the chromatin state of the previously investigated <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Gunther1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> SLK cells at 5 days post infection (lower panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) indicates that establishment of latent chromatin was complete at 72 h post infection.</p><p>Although a significant number of loci may acquire a bivalent chromatin state (which we and others have previously confirmed for the Rta promoter), we found H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 patterns to be anti-correlated at all time points (Pearson correlation coefficients of &#x02212;0.28, &#x02212;0.45 and &#x02212;0.57 at 24, 48 and 72 h post infection, respectively). This observation suggests that the few loci which ultimately stay exempt from or acquire only low levels of H3K27me3 are pre-defined by a number of regions that are already occupied by high levels of H3K4me3 early in the infection. Hence, establishment of latent histone modification patterns represents the result of two independent processes: First, local acquisition of distinct activation-associated H3K4me3 peaks, likely due to the binding of sequence specific factors, and second, genome-wide acquisition of repressive H3K27me3 marks, with a preference for regions that do not already carry high levels of H3K4me3. The finding that H3K27me3 marks do not spread, but rather evolve gradually over the entire episome, furthermore indicates that the latter process involves a global mechanism that does not require distinct sequence elements. Given that ND10 have been shown to repress the transcription of many DNA viruses via chromatin-based mechanisms, we considered the possibility that ND10 or individual ND10 components may contribute to the repression of KSHV episomes during early latency establishment.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>KSHV episomes do not reside near ND10 bodies during the early phase of a <italic>de novo</italic> infection</title><p>In latently infected PEL cells, the LANA protein accumulates in nuclear dot-like structures that perfectly co-localize with viral episomes <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Ballestas1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Xiao1" ref-type="bibr">[94]</xref>, a finding which we formally confirmed for <italic>de novo</italic> infected SLK cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004274.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

However, it seemed possible that KSHV episomes may transiently communicate with ND10 during the establishment phase, after which the viral genomes may be released while maintaining their repressed state in a ND10-independent manner. If so, we would expect to observe co-localization of LANA and ND10 especially around the 24 and 48 h time points, when repressive marks are acquired. To test this hypothesis, we determined the sub-nuclear localization of LANA and the ND10 core component PML during the early stages of a <italic>de novo</italic> infection by confocal immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy.

We reasoned that such changes may contribute to KSHV latency establishment without resulting in a microscopically detectable alteration of ND10s. We therefore infected SLK cells for 48 hours and prepared low-salt RIPA extracts, followed by detection of the ND10 core proteins PML, Daxx and Sp100 by Western blot (WB) analysis. Surprisingly, we observed that KSHV infection resulted in the complete removal of Sp100 from soluble extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, top panel) at 48 h post infection.

To further investigate the temporal dynamics of this phenomenon, we performed a time course experiment with samples collected after 2, 8, 24, and 48 h of infection, and additionally analyzed SLKp cells (a pool of long-term infected single cell clones that stably maintains a wt KSHV infection without any selection <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Grundhoff2" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>). The time course experiment confined the disappearance of soluble Sp100 to a time period between 24 and 48 h post infection.

As shown in lane 6 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, SLKp cells were furthermore completely devoid of soluble Sp100, indicating that the phenotype is stable in long-term latently infected cells. To investigate whether depletion of Sp100 was specific for soluble fractions, we next analyzed total protein extracts. Indeed, total protein levels in <italic>de novo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) SLK cells as well long-term infected SLKp cells (right panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) were not diminished when compared to the mock control or uninfected SLK cells, respectively. Instead, we observed that total Sp100 protein levels exhibited a mild increase at 8 and 24 hours post infection, but had returned to baseline levels at the 48 h time point. Detection of LANA in these fractions furthermore demonstrated that the protein had accumulated to detectable levels at the 24 h time point, i.e. the time after which Sp100 disappears from soluble fractions (center panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the observed effects may be specific for SLK cells, we next sought to confirm our results in other cells.

To investigate this possibility, we treated uninfected SLK cells and long-term infected SLK<sub>P</sub> cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 for 8 h. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, proteasome inhibition led only to a slight increase of soluble Sp100 protein levels, but failed to restore them to levels comparable to those in uninfected cells (compare lanes 2 and 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). We attribute the slight increase in MG-132 treated cells to pleiotropic effects and concluded that proteasomal degradation is unlikely to be responsible for the disappearance of Sp100 from soluble extracts of latently infected cells. We next wondered whether KSHV-induced transcriptional silencing of the Sp100 gene may be responsible for our observations. To investigate this possibility, we inspected levels for these factors in a time course RNA-seq experiment performed at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48 and 96 h post infection (the complete dataset of expressed genes is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004274.s013">Dataset S1</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, for PML as well as Sp100 (but not Daxx) we observed a transient transcriptional increase, with a marked peak at the 8 h time point.

Neither transcript was further reduced, clearly indicating that loss of soluble Sp100 was not due to transcriptional repression.

We furthermore suspect that the matrix-associated entity which receives the relocalized protein may be ND10 bodies themselves, a hypothesis which would be in accord with the observed increase in total number and volume of Sp100 foci at 72 h post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), a time point when total Sp100 protein levels are similar to those observed in mock infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). However, at present it remains equally possible that Sp100 may be relocalized to another insoluble matrix fraction.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Depletion of Sp100, PML or Daxx does not interfere with latency establishment</title><p>The fact that the major latent nuclear antigen LANA, a protein which has been reported to suppress lytic replication of KSHV <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[99]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Lan1" ref-type="bibr">[100]</xref>, induces massive relocalization of soluble Sp100 during a <italic>de novo</italic> infection suggests that this mechanism serves to promote latency. We hypothesized that either the presence of soluble Sp100 may negatively influence latency establishment and is thus actively sequestered by LANA to abrogate such effects (loss of function scenario), or that the SUMOylated and relocalized Sp100 fraction may actively support latency establishment (gain of function scenario). If the latter model were true, then abrogation of Sp100 expression should interfere with latency establishment and result in increased levels of lytic replication upon a <italic>de novo</italic> infection. To investigate this possibility, we stably depleted Sp100 from SLK and EA.hy cultures by using shRNA encoding lentiviruses <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Everett3" ref-type="bibr">[101]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004274-Schreiner1" ref-type="bibr">[104]</xref>.

LANA staining confirmed that more than 95% of the cells were infected in each of the cultures (exemplarily shown for EA.hy cells in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004274.s008">Fig. S8</xref>). To determine the amount of cells containing lytically replicating KSHV, we performed intracellular staining and FACS analysis using an antibody against the ORF59 gene product, a marker for lytic gene expression. Detection of ORF59 in BCBL1 cultures lytically induced by treatment with TPA and sodium butyrate confirmed accuracy of the FACS assay (right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g009">Fig. 9C</xref>). As an internal positive staining control for SLK cells (which do not well respond to TPA or sodium butyrate treatment), we employed long-term cultures of SLKp cells that had been grown for three weeks without sub-culturing, resulting in lytic cycle induction in a substantial fraction of cells (likely due to hypoxic conditions in basal cell layers; Tessmer and Grundhoff, unpublished). As shown in the left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g009">Figure 9C</xref>, approximately 60% of the SLK cells in our positive control exhibited positive ORF59 staining. In contrast (and in agreement with our previous findings in SLK cells <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Gunther1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>) the frequency of <italic>de novo</italic> infected SLK-shGFP cells exhibiting ORF59 staining was very low (approx. 0.02%). Interestingly, knock down of the individual core components did not substantially facilitate lytic KSHV replication. Although depletion of Sp100 resulted in a slight increase of ORF59-positive cells (&#x0223c;0.06%), this observation may be explained by the fact that this population was also slightly more prone to apoptosis (data not shown), a pathway which has been reported to induce lytic replication <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Prasad1" ref-type="bibr">[107]</xref>. As shown in the leftmost columns of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g009">Fig. 9D</xref>, although EA.hy cells generally exhibited a slightly higher frequency of spontaneously reactivated cells, this frequency was not significantly altered in the knockdown cultures. When treated with sodium butyrate, the percentage of ORF59 positive cells was increased to approximately 2% (rightmost columns of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g009">Fig. 9D</xref>). Although the average frequency in shPML cells was slightly higher, these cultures exhibited some variability between individual experiments and the differences were not statistically significant. To also directly investigate transcript levels of lytic genes, we performed quantitative RT-PCR for ORF50 (early), ORF59 (delayed early) and ORF64 (late), as well as the latent ORF73 encoding LANA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g009">Figure 9E</xref>). In accord with our FACS analysis, the transcript levels for these genes were not significantly altered in the knockdown compared to the shGFP control cultures.</p><p>Lastly, we sought to confirm our results in primary HUVEC cells. Although we were unable to efficiently deplete Daxx, transduction of shRNAs against PML or Sp100 resulted in considerable reduction of protein levels as judged by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g010">Fig. 10A</xref>) or immunofluorescence analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004274.s009">Fig. S9</xref>). As seen in SLK and EA.hy cells, knockdown of PML or Sp100 did not lead to a significant increase of the frequency of ORF59 positive cells, be it in uninduced or sodium butyrate treated cultures (left- and rightmost columns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g010">Fig. 10B</xref>, respectively). Interestingly, we observed a substantial increase in the total levels of ORF59 transcript levels in shPML (but not shSp100) HUVEC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g010">Figure 10C</xref>). Since the total number of ORF59-positve cells was not increased, we suspect that PML-knockdown, while not interfering with latency establishment, may facilitate ORF59 transcription in the small fraction of cells that spontaneously enter the lytic cycle. Presently, it is unclear why ORF50 and ORF64 levels do not show a similar increase, or why ORF59 transcript levels are not increased in shPML EA.hy cells. Clearly, however, since knockdown of ND10 components did significantly increase the frequency of ORF59-positive cells in SLK, EA.hy or HUVEC cells, our data collectively suggest that neither the presence of intact ND10 bodies, nor that of soluble Sp100, PML or Daxx is a principal requirement for the establishment of KSHV latency and prevention of lytic cycle entry.</p><fig id="ppat-1004274-g010" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1004274.g010</object-id><label>Figure 10</label><caption><title>Depletion of PML or Sp100 does not interfere with latency establishment in HUVEC cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot analysis of HUVEC cells transduced with shRNA-expressing lentiviruses directed against PML, Daxx, Sp100 or GFP. shDaxx transduced cells did not show a reduction of Daxx protein levels and were thus not included in further analyses.

Given that Sp100 has been shown to be capable of inducing epigenetic alterations on viral promoters <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Newhart1" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>, we hypothesized that KSHV actively displaces soluble Sp100 from chromatin to influence the formation of eu- or heterochromatin on viral episomes during latency establishment. Unfortunately, LANA relocalized Sp100 protein with such efficiency that we were unable to increase levels of soluble Sp100 protein by overexpression from an ectopic construct (data not shown). However, since our time course experiments had suggested that the acquisition of heterochromatic H3K27me3 marks coincides with the disappearance of soluble Sp100 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g003">3</xref>), we expected that shRNA depletion of Sp100 may circumvent the need for Sp100 relocalization that occurs only after accumulation of <italic>de novo</italic> expressed LANA protein. If so, then acquisition of heterochromatic marks should be facilitated in <italic>de novo</italic> infected shSp100 knock down cells. To test this hypothesis, we infected the stable SLK-shSp100, SLK-shPML and SLK-shDaxx knock down cell lines and the control cell line (SLK-shGFP) with KSHV for 36 h and subsequently performed ChIP using antibodies against activating (H3K4me3) and inactivating (H3K27me3) histone modifications. We then measured the enrichment of the respective modification by qPCR at a number of selected loci that predominantly carry activating or repressive marks in latently infected SLK cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g011">Figure 11A and -B</xref>, the overall pattern for either modification was not altered in SLK-shGFP when compared to those seen in our initial ChIP analysis at early time points of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004274.s001">S1</xref>). Depletion of PML or Daxx resulted in only a slight (but nevertheless consistent) increase or decrease, respectively, of H3K4me3 levels compared to the control, whereas H3K27me3 levels remained unaffected. In contrast, depletion of Sp100 dramatically increased H3K27me3 levels, but did not alter levels of H3K4me3 at loci which do not carry this repressive mark. The fact that overall patterns of activating and repressive marks remained unaltered suggested that Sp100 depletion results in an enhanced rate of H3K27me3 acquisition, but not a qualitative change of the underlying recruitment process. To further confirm these findings, we verified the increased H3K27me3 in shSp100 cells by ChIP-qPCR in a time-course experiment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g011">Figure 11C</xref>, acquisition of repressive chromatin marks was indeed highly accelerated in Sp100-depleted cells. To exclude cell type specific effects, we additionally investigated H3K27me3 acquisition in Sp100-depleted EA.hy cells. Interestingly, while overall the patterns of H3K27me3 in shGFP-EA.hy control cultures were very similar to those observed in shGFP-SLK cells, the repressive mark evolved more slowly in the EA.hy cells (compare blue graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g011">Figure 11C and -D</xref>).

Conversely, these viruses have evolved mechanisms to counteract repressive capabilities of individual ND10 components <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Tavalai2" ref-type="bibr">[108]</xref>. Since ND10 components exhibit chromatin modulatory functions <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Torok2" ref-type="bibr">[109]</xref> and can cause epigenetic alterations on viral promoters <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Newhart1" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>, it has been speculated that ND10 components may also be able to impose a repressive chromatin state that could potentially represent a necessary - or even sufficient - event during herpesvirus latency establishment. In such a scenario, ND10 bodies would serve as interferon-induced host restriction factors that are universally recruited to incoming viral DNA genomes, e.g. via recognition of unmethylated DNA. Normally, ND10 recruitment would serve to globally silence and, ultimately, eradicate the virus. However, herpesviruses may have subverted this mechanism by allowing transient silencing while preventing elimination of viral episomes. <italic>Bona fide</italic> latency may then ensue if the repressive state becomes self-sustaining, a condition which is met by a number of repressive chromatin marks, including the H3K27me3 modification that is a hallmark of KSHV latency <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Margueron1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004274-Hansen2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>We here report the first systematic study of the role of ND10 bodies as well as individual ND10 components on the establishment of KSHV latency. Although we uncover an unexpected role for soluble fractions of Sp100 (discussed further below), our data collectively suggest that silencing activities of intact ND10 bodies in fact only play a minor, if any, supportive role during the establishment of primary KSHV latency. In accord with previous studies reporting cytokine responses of primary cells to latent KSHV infection <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Chandran1" ref-type="bibr">[reviewed in 110]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Sathish1" ref-type="bibr">[111]</xref>, we find that <italic>de novo</italic> infection of SLK cells results in a marked (but brief) induction of cytokines and subsequent transcriptional upregulation of Sp100, PML and other interferon response genes. However, immunofluorescence analysis strongly suggests that KSHV episomes do not reside near ND10s at the time when repressive H3K27me3 marks are first acquired, and also do not communicate with these bodies during later phases of viral latency. This conclusion is based on the fact that foci of the episome-binding LANA-protein do not co-localize with PML or Sp100 speckles during the first 24 to 72 hours of a <italic>de novo</italic> infection. LANA foci have been previously shown to accurately mark the location of episomes in latently infected cells <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Ballestas1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Xiao1" ref-type="bibr">[94]</xref>, and we have confirmed perfect co-localization between LANA and viral episomes in SLK cells at 72 h post infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004274.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Given that the focal accumulation of LANA is induced by high-affinity binding to the terminal repeat elements of viral episomes and represents a pre-requisite for latent replication of KSHV genomes <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Grundhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004274-Garber1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, it is very likely that the LANA foci observed at 24 or 48 h post infection do likewise contain viral DNA, even though we have not explicitly investigated these time points by IF/FISH analysis. It may be argued, however, that especially at earlier time points of infection a sub-fraction of viral episomes may not be complexed with LANA and could potentially interact with ND10s. Of course, this could be especially true during the first few hours of an infection, before <italic>de novo</italic> expressed LANA protein has accumulated to sufficient amounts. In fact, given ND10s role as antiviral factors we consider it probable that such early events may indeed occur and could lead to terminal silencing (and subsequent elimination) of a considerable fraction of incoming KSHV episomes. However, for the following reasons we find it unlikely that such episomes could also represent a founder population of KSHV latency: Firstly, we observe acquisition of the repressive H3K27me3 mark between 24 and 72 h post infection, at a time when LANA is well expressed and localizes in episome-containing speckles that are distinct from ND10s. Since the histone modification patterns that evolve during this time are precisely those which are observed in long term latently infected cells, there is every reason to believe that it is this population of episomes which goes on to establish latency. More importantly, however, knockdown of the ND10 components PML, Daxx or Sp100 did not interfere with latency establishment. We did not observe any increase in the percentage of KSHV-infected cells undergoing lytic replication, or any delay in the acquisition of repressive H3K27me3 marks by KSHV episomes. We point out that these experiments were carried out at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI), leading to the establishment of latency in more than 90&#x02013;95% of cells. In systems such as HSV or CMV, interference with productive infection is often only observed when low MOIs are used, arguing that high levels of viral genomes can readily outcompete suppressive functions of ND10s. By the same token, if ND10-mediated repression mechanisms were indeed a pre-requisite for KSHV latency, at the high MOI levels used here we would expect that even a modest knockdown of one of the ND10 core components would allow at least some viral genomes to escape ND10s and proceed to enter the lytic cycle. As this is not the case, we consider it very unlikely that ND10s serve as nucleators of KSHV latency.</p><p>Instead of intact ND10 bodies, our study has uncovered an unexpected role of soluble Sp100 during latency establishment (strictly speaking, this fraction should be referred to as &#x02018;solubilizable&#x02019; Sp100 since it involves nucleoplasmic as well as low-salt extractable chromatin-bound protein; for simplicity, however, we have referred to it as the soluble fraction throughout this manuscript). We consistently observed that this fraction was efficiently relocalized to the insoluble matrix between 24 and 72 hours post infection, i.e. precisely the time period when repressive H3K27me3 marks accumulate on viral episomes. This phenotype is likely mediated by <italic>de novo</italic> expressed LANA protein, given that ectopic expression of LANA alone is sufficient to induce relocalization and massive SUMOylation of Sp100. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observe that UV-irradation of virion preparations prevents the disappearance of Sp100 from soluble fraction, and that accumulation of LANA protein in de novo infected SLK cells is concomitant with the disappearance of soluble Sp100. Interestingly, LANA has been demonstrated to exhibit SUMOylation-enhancing activity towards histone proteins <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[112]</xref>, and was very recently reported to contain a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) that is specific for SUMO-2 <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Cai1" ref-type="bibr">[113]</xref>. The latter study further demonstrated that LANA itself is SUMO-2-modified, a phenotype which is dependent on the presence of its SIM domain. Strikingly, a recombinant virus with a mutant LANA SIM was unable to establish latency and exhibited severely reduced lytic gene silencing <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Cai1" ref-type="bibr">[113]</xref>. Given that LANA-induced SUMOylation of Sp100 also shows a marked preference for SUMO-2, we suspect that the LANA SIM is also required for Sp100 modification, and that furthermore inability to induce Sp100 relocalization may have contributed to the latency deficiency observed in the SIM mutant virus investigated by Cai and colleagues <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Cai1" ref-type="bibr">[113]</xref>. Our results extend the SUMO targetome of LANA by Sp100, and it appears likely that further targets may exist. Interestingly, the master lytic switch protein Rta has been recently shown to exhibit SUMO-targeting ubiquitin ligase (STUbL) activity, resulting in ubiqitinylation and subsequent degradation of SUMOylated proteins bound to the Rta SIM domain <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Izumiya1" ref-type="bibr">[114]</xref>. This may hint towards the existence of novel protein regulatory networks in which LANA may create a set of SUMOylated proteins to support latency, which in turn can be readily targeted for degradation by Rta once the lytic cycle has been induced. Whether or not such a mechanism indeed exists is currently under investigation.</p><p>Since SUMOylation has been shown to facilitate protein recruitment to ND10s we suspect that massive accumulation of Sp100 in the insoluble matrix is indicative of its relocalization to these bodies. This is consistent with the observation that Sp100 foci are increased in number and volume at 72 h post infection, at a time point when the (likely interferon induced) mild increase of total Sp100 protein levels has abated. We cannot fully exclude the possibility, though, that the protein may instead be diffusely redirected to some other part of the matrix, in a manner that precludes its detection by immunofluorescence analysis. However, considering the extent of relocalization especially in PEL cells we find this scenario rather unlikely. In accord with previous studies <xref rid="ppat.1004274-ViejoBorbolla1" ref-type="bibr">[98]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Ohsaki1" ref-type="bibr">[115]</xref>, we find that also a sizeable fraction of LANA protein is associated with the insoluble matrix. Since this fraction has previously been found to associate with viral episomes it is likely to be spatially distinct from relocalized Sp100 protein. This notion is also supported by the fact that we did not observe any significant co-precipitation of LANA and Sp100 (data not shown), indicating that any putative direct interaction is likely to be transient and restricted to the SUMOylation process.</p><p>Our infection studies of Sp100 knock down cells strongly argue for the hypothesis that soluble Sp100 hinders latency establishment rather than suggesting a latency promoting activity of the relocalized protein. Based on the observations made in this study, we propose a model as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g012">Figure 12</xref>: After nuclear delivery of viral episomes, the DNA becomes rapidly occupied by histones, but remains accessible to the binding of factors that facilitate the site-specific acquisition of H3K4me3 marks by recruitment of MLL/SET protein complexes. Such factors are likely to include host transcription or other chromatin-modifying factors such as CTCF, but may also include virally encoded factors - the finding that transfected KSHV bacmids ultimately carry the same H3K4me3 profile as in infected cells does not preclude the possibility that their acquisition may be accelerated by virion-delivered proteins. The acquisition of these early activation marks then allows a &#x02018;relaxed&#x02019; transcription program that includes LANA, but also a limited set of other genes that are usually not expressed during latency <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Krishnan1" ref-type="bibr">[116]</xref>. We propose that during this immediate phase, i.e. before accumulation of LANA protein, deposition of repressive H3K27me3 marks is hindered by soluble Sp100 protein. The mechanisms by which Sp100 may prevent this process remain unknown, but could potentially include negative regulation of the catalytic activity of PRC2 complexes or interference with PRC2 recruitment. We find the latter possibility particularly attractive since LANA preferentially depletes the chromatin bound Sp100 fraction, and since furthermore the SAND domain of the SP100B splice variant has been shown to exhibit broad binding activity towards unmethylated DNA <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Isaac1" ref-type="bibr">[117]</xref>. Given that CpG methylation is completely absent from <italic>de novo</italic> infecting episomes <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Gunther1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, it seems possible that non-ND10 resident Sp100 may be rapidly attracted to KSHV episomes and may either competitively block PRC2 recruitment, or sequester viral genomes in subnuclear regions that are not readily accessible to PRC2. LANA depletion of chromatin-bound Sp100 then serves to alleviate this effect, allowing PRC2 recruitment and establishment of &#x02018;mature&#x02019; latent chromatin characterized by the distinct patterns of predominantly H3K27me3-, H3K4me3-, or bivalently marked regions as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g001">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="ppat-1004274-g012" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1004274.g012</object-id><label>Figure 12</label><caption><title>Model of events during early KSHV latency establishment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immediately after infection, MLL/SET containing complexes are recruited to viral episomes by as of yet unknown cellular and/or viral factors, resulting in the establishment of the early activation marks and transcription of a subset of KSHV genes that includes ORF73/LANA.

Depletion of soluble nucleoplasmic or chromatin-associated Sp100 allows widespread recruitment of PRC2 complexes via molecular mechanisms that remain to be determined. PRC2 recruitment establishes H3K27me3 patterns, allowing repression of lytic genes after extinction of activation marks (e.g., on the K2 promoter) or establishment of bivalent chromatin (e.g. at the ORF50/Rta promoter). The major latency promoter upstream of ORF73/LANA is protected from H3K27me3 acquisition and remains active throughout latency.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1004274.g012"/></fig><p>Collectively, our data suggest that KSHV does not depend upon ND10-mediated silencing to establish latency, but rather actively escapes such mechanisms in order to promote a chromatin state that is more amenable to latent replication and reactivation of the lytic cycle. Notably, this model does not exclude the possibility that innate immune responses do actively contribute to latency establishment. It is entirely possible that PRC recruitment reflects an alternate host defense silencing mechanism that come into effect once first line ND10 defenses have failed to efficiently repress viral DNA. By removing chromatin-associated Sp100 fractions, KSHV may skew host defenses towards the preferred formation of facultative heterochromatin by polycomb repressive complexes</p><p>Whether this strategy is uniquely employed by KSHV or shared by other herpesviruses remains to be established. Clearly, the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g006">Figure 6B</xref> demonstrate that EBV does not relocalize soluble Sp100 to the matrix in latently infected BL-cell lines. This finding is in accord with a previous study which reported that the latent EBNA-LP protein displaces Sp100 from ND10s and relocalizes it to the soluble fraction <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Ling1" ref-type="bibr">[118]</xref>. Furthermore, a recent study reported that EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1) can induce expression of the H3K27me3 specific demethylase KDM6B <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Anderton1" ref-type="bibr">[119]</xref>, indicating that EBV may have evolved a fundamentally different approach to establish latency. In line with this notion, we have observed that EBV episomes carry fundamentally lower levels of H3K27me3 compared to KSHV (Guenther et al., unpublished observations). A question that emerges from these observations is whether EBV and KSHV may mutually influence each other on the chromatin level. This is a particular interesting scenario since the great majority of PELs carry both viruses, and since EBV shows a non-typical latency expression pattern in dually infected PEL-derived cell lines as well as primary PEL tissues <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Callahan1" ref-type="bibr">[120]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Horenstein1" ref-type="bibr">[121]</xref>. We have observed that dually infected cells do not differ from KSHV-only infected PEL in their exclusive matrix-association of Sp100 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Whether this is simply due to the fact that dually infected PEL cells do not express EBNA-LP (and only low levels of LMP-1) <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Callahan1" ref-type="bibr">[120]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Horenstein1" ref-type="bibr">[121]</xref>, or whether LANA may be able to reverse EBNA-LP functions remains to be established. We are currently investigating whether such a mutual influence indeed exists.</p><p>The temporally ordered acquisition of activating H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 marks as observed here suggests that KSHV transits from an open chromatin state to one that becomes progressively repressed. Unfortunately, our RNAseq experiments, although carried out at a standard depth of approximately 20 million mapped paired-end reads per sample, were not sensitive enough to allow reliable comparison of global viral transcription patterns to the evolving histone modification landscape. On average, only about 800 reads per sample (i.e. less than 0.005% of all mapped reads) were of viral origin. The only viral genes that produced significant expression values were PAN, K2, and the ORF73/72/71 latency cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004274.s011">Figure S11</xref>). In accordance with the observation that activation-associated H3K4me3 marks were prominently present in the K2 region at 24 h post infection, but were progressively diminished upon accumulation of H3K27me3 (see leftmost arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), transcript levels for K2 peaked between the 16 to 24 h RNA-seq time points and sharply declined thereafter. In contrast, transcripts from the major latency ORF73/72/71 locus remained fairly stable after the 24 h time point. Interestingly, we observed a transient peak of ORF73/72/71 transcription at 8 h post infection. The significance of this observation is currently unknown, however we noted that at least one interferon-inducible cellular factor known to transactivate the ORF73/LANA promoter was sharply upregulated at 4 h post infection (HIF1A; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004274.s011">Figure S11</xref>, lower panel). Hence, the immediate response may help to ensure early transcription of ORF73/LANA.</p><p>Considering that the viral genome length is about 0.2% of the combined exon length of all expressed host transcripts (&#x0223c;55.000 kbp), the fact that less than 0.005% of all reads originated from KSHV indicates that the remainder of the viral genome is transcribed at considerably lower levels than host genes, even though the episome is in a mostly open chromatin configuration during the early stages of infection. More detailed RNA-seq experiments will be required to investigate this issue. However, if so, it seems possible that either much of the early viral chromatin is &#x02018;immature&#x02019; and does not allow effective transcription even in the absence of repressive marks, or that other factors may contribute to repression at this stage. Interestingly, while this study was being prepared for submission, Toth et al. <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Toth2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> reported results which confirm the biphasic acquisition of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 histone marks as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g001">Figure 1B</xref>. While Toth and colleagues show that knockdown of PRC2 components considerably lowers PRC1 recruitment and enhances viral transcription of a number of lytic genes, some loci were found to attract PRC1 complexes even before H3K27me3 marks had evolved, indicating that direct recruitment of PRC1 may also contribute to transcriptional regulation of early viral chromatin.</p><p>An important question that remains to be answered is how the KSHV genome initially attracts polycomb repressive complexes. In insect cells, polycomb repressive complex bind to DNA sequence elements (polycomb response elements; PREs), yet the mechanisms that lead to polycomb recruitment in mammalian are poorly understood. The fact that Sp100 knock down accelerated the acquisition of the H3K27me3 mark without altering its overall patterns suggests that Sp100 does not modulate PRC2 recruitment in a qualitative manner. Hence, our study suggests that LANA-mediated depletion from Sp100 primarily serves to allow attraction of polycomb repressive complexes, presumably by an inherent feature of viral genomes or early viral chromatin. Consistent with the notion that mechanisms other than PREs may mediate polycomb recruitment in mammalian cells, our temporal investigation as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004274-g001">Figure 1B</xref> clearly indicates that H3K27me3 does not spread from initial nucleation sites, but gradually evolves over the entire episome. Features such as absence of DNA methylation, biased histone variant deposition, production of non-coding RNAs or the presence of stalled RNA Polymerase on immature viral chromatin are all potential factors that could contribute to initial recruitment of polycomb repressive complexes <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Son1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004274-Barrero1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[122]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Farcas1" ref-type="bibr">[123]</xref>. To what extent these factors contribute to KSHV latency, and whether or not KSHV may also actively modulate one or more of such mechanisms will be interesting topics for future studies. We expect that the results from such studies will not only fundamentally advance our understanding of latency establishment by KSHV and other herpesviruses, but will also allow valuable insights into as of yet poorly understood mechanisms of cellular chromatin regulation pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell lines and culture conditions</title><p>SLK <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Herndier1" ref-type="bibr">[124]</xref>, SLKp <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Grundhoff2" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>, EA.hy <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Edgell1" ref-type="bibr">[125]</xref>, human dermal fibroblasts (HDF), HEK293 <xref rid="ppat.1004274-Graham1" ref-type="bibr">[126]</xref> and HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin-streptomycin (5 &#x000b5;g/ml).
