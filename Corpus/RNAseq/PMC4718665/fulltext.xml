In both humans and livestock, protective immunity can be achieved through vaccination. Earlier and more recent vaccine trials in cattle and sheep demonstrated a strong neutralizing antibody and total IgG response induced by the RVF vaccine, authentic recombinant MP-12 (arMP-12). From previous work, protective immunity in sheep and cattle vaccinates normally occurs from 7 to 21 days after inoculation with arMP-12. While the serology and protective response induced by arMP-12 has been studied, little attention has been paid to the underlying molecular and genetic events occurring prior to the serologic immune response. To address this, we isolated RNA from whole blood of vaccinated calves over a time course of 21 days before and after vaccination with arMP-12. The time course RNAs were sequenced by RNASeq and bioinformatically analyzed. Our results revealed time-dependent activation or repression of numerous gene ontologies and pathways related to the vaccine induced immune response and its regulation. Additional bioinformatic analyses identified a correlative relationship between specific host immune response genes and protective immunity prior to the detection of protective serum neutralizing antibody responses. These results contribute an important proof of concept for identifying molecular and genetic components underlying the immune response to RVF vaccination and protection prior to serologic detection.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>United States Department of Homeland Security - Foreign Animal &#x00026; Zoonotic Disease Center <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iiad.tamu.edu">http://iiad.tamu.edu</ext-link> 2010-ST-061-AG0002; National Institutes of Health <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov">http://www.nih.gov</ext-link> NIH-NIAID-DMID-02-24; Texas AgriLife Research <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://agriliferesearch.tamu.edu">http://agriliferesearch.tamu.edu</ext-link> 504064.

The initial outbreak of RVF occurred in 1931 in the Rift Valley of Kenya in sheep, cattle and humans [<xref rid="pone.0147027.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Currently, RVFV is considered endemic across Africa from Mauritania and Senegal in the west, Mozambique, South Africa and Namibia in the south, and north into Egypt and the Sinai peninsula [<xref rid="pone.0147027.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The spread outside the African continent was likely related to trade of livestock and presence of competent vectors [<xref rid="pone.0147027.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0147027.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Implicit to the transmission of RVFV are three genuses of mosquitos, <italic>Aedes</italic>, <italic>Culex</italic>, and <italic>Anopheles</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0147027.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0147027.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Importantly, the natural range of at least one of these vectors, <italic>Aedes</italic>, has expanded from tropical regions in south China and Indian Ocean Islands to other tropical and temperate zones in all continents, due to the passive transport of viable eggs and subsequent adaptation (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0147027.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]). In addition, alterations to the global climate, as well as local forestation, development and biodiversity, likely to play significant roles in expanded vector range, habitat and density [<xref rid="pone.0147027.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0147027.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. RVFV outbreaks have had significant health, social and economic consequences, requiring considerable expenditure of resources to interrupt the infectious cycle, monitor susceptible populations and treat exposed individuals. An outbreak of RVF in a developed country or densely populated (people or livestock) region would be expected to have major health, economic and social impacts, as livestock movement would be severely limited, and affected animals quarantined or culled, and human populations would have high morbidity with variable levels of mortality [<xref rid="pone.0147027.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0147027.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>While susceptibility of na&#x000ef;ve individuals to RVFV infection is high, protection can be achieved by humoral immune responses or colostrum [<xref rid="pone.0147027.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0147027.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In an outbreak scenario, great energy, fiscal resources as well as human and animal lives could be saved with the single administration of a vaccine that elicits rapid humoral responses and a long-term protective immunity. Several vaccines have been developed to achieve this goal, including recombinant RVFV protein vaccines, formalin-inactivated vaccines NDBR-103 and TSI-GSD-200 strains as well as live-attenuated versions MP-12, Clone13 and various derivatives (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0147027.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]). In our previous work, we reported a rapid immune response with high serum neutralizing antibody titers as measured by the plaque reduction neutralizing test (PRNT<sub>80</sub>), and a strong long-term immune response measured by a RVFV antigen-specific IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) induced by authentic recombinant MP-12 (arMP-12) in both pregnant sheep and cattle [<xref rid="pone.0147027.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0147027.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In 2014, arMP-12-NSm21/384 vaccinated sheep demonstrated excellent protection against development of RVFV viremia and fever after a single dose when challenged with wild type ZH501 RVFV four weeks post vaccination [<xref rid="pone.0147027.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0147027.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies assessing vaccine protection have gone beyond the traditional serologic analysis and employed transcriptomic sequencing techniques and bioinformatic analyses to better characterize and understand the molecular and genetic underpinnings of the vaccine response. A seminal work from Querec <italic>et al</italic>. assessed the transcriptome of CD8+ T and B cells from humans vaccinated with the Yellow Fever vaccine YF-17D by microarray and identified a gene expression pattern correlating to seroconversion [<xref rid="pone.0147027.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Efforts were made to analyze the immune response to influenza vaccination that identified not only high resolution molecular signatures at 7-days post inoculation, but also identified gene signatures to predict antibody response [<xref rid="pone.0147027.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A meticulous serologic, cellular and bioinformatic analysis of pre&#x02013;and post&#x02013;vaccination samples from influenza vaccinates identified correlative biomarkers for vaccine response quality in pre&#x02013;vaccination samples [<xref rid="pone.0147027.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Strides have been made in understanding vaccine response in the veterinary sciences using transcriptome sequencing techniques also. In response to vaccination against <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic>, cattle protection was highly correlated with IFN-gamma and IL-22 expression [<xref rid="pone.0147027.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>To further our understanding of the genetic and cellular mechanisms underlying vaccination and seroconversion in arMP-12 vaccinated livestock, we hypothesized that bioinformatic analysis of the RNASeq sequenced transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PMBC) will identify highly correlated gene transcripts for protective seroconversion as measured by PRNT<sub>80</sub>. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the global transcriptome of PBMCs from cattle vaccinated with arMP-12 against RVFV before and after vaccination, followed by a bioinformatic correlative analysis between perturbed cellular pathways and serologic analysis for protective immunity. To more completely utilize the data, we analyzed resulting RNASeq sequences by: 1) standard day-by-day analysis oriented from the day of vaccination, or 2) a time-shifted mechanism in which the time points were oriented around the day that each calf had protective 1:80 serum neutralizing antibody titers. For both of these orientations, sequence data from each time point were analyzed by standard differential gene expression analyses [<xref rid="pone.0147027.s021" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>] and Dynamic Bayesian Gene Group Activation (DBGGA) methodology to identify both perturbed cellular pathways and gene ontology (GO) terms [<xref rid="pone.0147027.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Using the time-shifted data, we then employed a two-step approach to build a Dynamic Bayesian Network to predictively correlate gene/pathway perturbation patterns with immune response and 1:80 protective antibody titers. We identified specific highly correlated cellular pathways and constitutive genes that were perturbed preceding protective seroconversion. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the underlying biology of protective vaccine immune responses, as well as underscoring the utility of bioinformatic analysis of high-density sequence data to identify transcriptomic precursors to protective seroconversion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Vaccine Strain and Plaque Reducing Neutralizing Titer Assay</title><p>Retrospective RNASeq analysis was performed on PBMCs taken from five healthy 4&#x02013;6 month <italic>Bos taurus</italic> steer calves as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0147027.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

DBGGA analysis was performed to determine temporal signatures of canonical pathways (PW) and gene ontology (GO) groups in response to the RFV vaccine post inoculation (p.i.) or pre-serum neutralization (pSN). DBGGA enables the determination of which PW and GO groups are most perturbed (activated or repressed) in one condition relative to another and which genes are the significant sources of the perturbation (designated as &#x0201c;influential regulator genes&#x0201d; (IRG). The DBGGA scoring method relies on posterior Bayesian network sampling and interrogation methods to measure a complete PW or GO group perturbation and can determine a single gene&#x02019;s influence in a gene set and transform this influence measure (log-likelihood deviation) to a z-score test statistic (hereafter referred to as the Bayesian z-score to depict its association with DBGGA scoring method). Unlike other pathway analysis or gene set enrichment [<xref rid="pone.0147027.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] methods based on classical statistical tools, this method identifies gene regulatory relationships that are most involved in the context of biologically related genes and their interactions (the DBGGA influence score is not reliant on identifying differentially expressed genes prior to PW/GO analysis).

The SWC procedure measures the temporal trajectory correlation of a pathway or GO term Bayesian z-scores and their associated gene Bayesian z-scores for an incremental series of three time points to a fixed PRNT<sub>80</sub> temporal response signature that is also comprised of three time points surrounding the PRNT<sub>80</sub> serum neutralization point.

Activation or repression is determined by the overall numeric average of the DBGGA Bayesian z-score for all associated genes within a pathway. If the average is positive, indicating the dominance of up-regulated genes, the overall pathway score is designated as activated, else if the average is negative the pathway is designated as repressed and the pathway score is annotated accordingly with a plus or minus sign.

For the second step, the output of the GRN provided a unique approach to identifying high probability relationships between the highly correlated genes and other upstream and downstream genes. The GRN identified correlated genes and their relationships to other genes in which the relationships were found through either known canonical relations, predicted based on protein domain binding likelihood, sequence similarity to know binding domains, or through transcription factor binding. Through this technique, we narrowed the choice of DBN model genes to 50 employing a selection method that focused on SWC genes and their upstream and/or downstream GRN learned relationships that resulted in the selection of cell receptors, signaling processing, and gene end products. The complete descriptions of these 50 genes are provided in <xref rid="pone.0147027.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Table</xref>. By interrogating the GRN model for key regulatory relationships, we found strong supporting evidence that upon vaccination, the vaccine RNA could be recognized by the Toll-like Receptors (TLR), or more specifically, TLR4, a negative SWC correlate to PRNT<sub>80</sub> response. Expression of other specific genes having learned relationships downstream of TLR4 were found to include MYD88, MAP2K7, IL1B, FOS, and JUN, where FOS and JUN form the well-known transcription factor complex AP-1. TLR mediated signaling pathway predominately signal through interferon regulatory factors (IRF) as well as Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NFKB) and AP-1, eliciting the induction of the Interferon type-1 response and the expression of inflammatory cytokines. In support of interferon activation, GRN learning identified IFNAR1/2 and IFNGR1/2 as influential regulators in the GRN model. These genes encode proteins that function as antiviral factors. We found IFNAR2 to be a positive SWC correlate to PRNT<sub>80</sub>, and through our GRN learning, we found evidence supporting an activation relationship with STAT1 and a STAT1 relationship with the cytokines CISH and SOCS2.</p><p>In addition, we found other type I interferon associated GRN model genes that included MYD88, JAK2, SOCS2/5, CCL5, IL8, IL15, IL12RB1, and IRF9. The genes MYD88, SOCS2, IL8 and IL15 were negative SWC correlates to PRNT<sub>80</sub> response while IL12RB1, JAK2 and SOCS5 were positive correlates. Also found by GRN learning was the gene, SYK, which is critical to innate and adaptive immunity having strong evidence regulating the downstream gene, PIK3R3, which is a positive SWC correlate to PRNT<sub>80</sub> response. Also, the RIG-I-like receptor related genes, IFIH1 and DDX58, were identified by the GRN model as strong regulators. However, these genes were not found to be SWC correlates, but were significantly expressed and indirectly linked to other SWC correlate genes such as TBKBP1 and IL8. IFIH1 and DDX58 genes are known to encode for proteins of the RIG-I-like receptor family and functions as pattern recognition receptors that sense viral nucleic acids or other viral/vaccine products.</p><p>The genes ERBB4 and ADORA2B (positive and negative SWC correlates to PRNT<sub>80</sub> respectively) were found to be important receptors and perhaps novel to the correlated response to RVF vaccine. ERBB4 encodes a protein that is a receptor for neuregulins and EGF family members and is known to regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis. ADORA2B encodes a G-protein receptor and is known to inhibit monocyte and macrophage functions and stimulate mast cell mediator release. GRN learning found ERBB4 to have strong relationships with PLCB1 and PLCE1 that is a positive SWC correlate. PLCE1 belongs to the phospholipase family involved in the cascade of intracellular responses that result in cell growth and differentiation. GRN learning associated ADORA2B with the downstream genes GNAL, ADCY7, PRKX and ATP2B2 are positive SWC correlates to PRNT<sub>80</sub> response suggesting a novel role as correlates to protective immunity. Vaccine viral replication and expression were strongly indicated in the early phase post immunization. Numerous genes encoding for ribosomal proteins were SWC correlates to PRNT<sub>80</sub>. We chose four of the most highly correlated to include in the DBN model, namely, RPS14, RPL14, RPL29 and RPLP2.</p><p>In the later times (Times &#x02013;4, &#x02013;3, &#x02013;2, &#x02013;1, 0 pSN) where the time begins to overlap with the onset of serologic protective response, there were fewer SWC correlates to PRNT<sub>80</sub>. Interestingly, antigen processing and presentation stood out to have several later phase PRNT<sub>80</sub> correlates with the genes CD4, CD8B, CTSB. CD4 is a T-cell surface glycoprotein on T lymphocytes and also in B cells and macrophages. CD4 is thought to be associated with T-cell activation. GRN learning found relationships with three forms of Major Histocompatibility Complex, class II genes, namely, BOLA-DQB, BOLA-DQA1, and BOLA-DRB3, all are expressed on antigen presenting cells (B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages). CD8B is a CD8 antigen found on most T lymphocytes. CTSB is a gene encoding a lysomomal cysteine proteinase believed to participate in intracellular degradation of proteins.

Host genome-wide transcript abundance and signaling pathway profiling provides a means to identify changes in gene expression and biological function occurring immediately following vaccination that may play a role in the development of protective immunity. Here, we used the hypothesis that bioinformatic analysis of deeply sequenced peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PMBC) transcript will identify highly correlated gene transcripts for protective seroconversion as measured by PRNT<sub>80</sub>. This approach has revealed transcriptomic signatures underlying the host response to vaccination with arMP-12, as well as a distinct set of genes that would be expected to be predictive of a protective immunological response.</p><p>There were 1587 unique genes differentially regulated following immunization by arMP-12, of which 678 were uniquely up regulated genes compared to 909 uniquely down regulated. Consistent with other previously reported gene expression results in the mouse model infected with RVFV [<xref rid="pone.0147027.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], the larger number of down regulated genes is likely a reflection of the high amount of arMP-12 vaccine NSs that is able to inhibit the transcription activity of constitutive promoters [<xref rid="pone.0147027.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0147027.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Germline-encoded receptors (e.g. TLRs, RIG-I-like) recognize viral nucleic acids of the vaccine. Complex networks of signal transduction converge on multiple transcription factors that included AP-1, STAT1/3/6, and IRF9. The interplay of these transcription factors determines the transcriptional response profile of downstream genes and leads to a dynamic expression of genes that produce a cascade of biological responses necessary to initiate and achieve long-term immune protection to RVFV.</p><p>Immediately following vaccine inoculation, it appears that the vaccine viral components have successfully invaded the host cells, triggering the induction of a family of pleiotropic cytokines known as the IFNs (interferons) as evidenced by the activation of the type I interferon signaling and the significant perturbation of the interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) IFI16, MX1, IFIH1, IFI44, IFNAR2, IFITM1/2, IRF2BP2, IR12RB1, IRF1, IRF3 and IRF9 within the first 5 days post immunization. IFN interactions with their receptors induce a set of IFN-stimulated genes that inhibit viral replication and increase the lytic potential of natural killer (NK) cells. It has been reported [<xref rid="pone.0147027.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] that Type-I IFNs modulate the adaptive immune response by increasing MHC-I or MHC-II (Major Histocompatibility Complex Class-I/II) expression to promote antigen presentation, also promoting T-Cell survival and stimulating dendritic cell maturation. However, in our study, the MHC-I genes were only minimally expressed and the only significantly expressed MHC gene was HLA-DOA, (MHC class II) and the MHC-II transactivator gene, CIITA. The gene, CIITA, encodes a protein essential for transcriptional activity of the HLA-II promoter. This protein is located in the nucleus and acts as a positive regulator of MHC-II transcription. This gene has been functionally associated with cellular response to exogenous dsRNA and interferon-gamma-mediated signaling pathway.</p><p>At later time points, we observed the triggering/activation of T cells and B cells, suggesting that cell-mediated immunity was beginning as early as day 3 post vaccination. A number of genes were expressed that are associated with T cell activation and signaling that included PIK3R1, PIK3R3, CHUK, ICOS, NFkappaB2, RNUX2, AKT2, CCR2, CD48, RELA, STAT5A, TNFSF14, TLR4, CD72, ITFG2, NR1D1, and PTPN6. Interestingly, the majority of these genes was significantly modulated at days 5 and 6 and became less expressed at day 7 and beyond. Complementary to our work, a recent study using a deletion mutant of arMP-12, arMP12-deltaNSm21/384, showed rapid progression of protective antibodies after vaccination and after challenge with the wild-type strain ZH501 [<xref rid="pone.0147027.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This rapid antibody response to wild-type challenge was concomitant with INF-&#x003b3; expression, indicating a cell-mediated immune response. Our data indicate that the parent arMP-12 strain is capable of inducing the adaptive immune response machinery quickly after vaccination.</p><p>The primary objective of this retrospective study was to identify a set of genes for predicting protective immunity. The selection of the genes was based on a systems biology top-down approach in which we narrowed our focus on genes within pathways and GO terms that were significantly perturbed and had SWC correlates to the PRNT<sub>80</sub> onset of protective immunity. Novel in this approach was the fact that we employed a sliding time window to find trajectory responses at earlier time points that have high positive or negative correlation to the PRNT<sub>80</sub> response trajectory at time points just prior to and at the point of protective seroconversion.</p><p>An additional novel step was then employed to learn the gene regulatory network (GRN) from the selected set of genes. This step allowed us to further identify genes that had strong regulatory relationships among other upstream and downstream genes. Finally, the combination of SWC correlates to PRNT<sub>80</sub> and the GRN relationships were used to select the genes used in constructing and training the predictive DBN model. The model performance was quite good when the model was tested with gene expression profiles from Time -5, -4, or -3 pSN and was successful in predicting a future PRNT<sub>80</sub> value at Time &#x02013;1, &#x02013;0, and 1 pSN. In summary, the model had an overall sensitivity = 93% and specificity = 100%. While the limited number of replicates restricts our ability to fully test the robustness of this model, it does allow us to access our approach to developing models predicting protective immunity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0147027.s001"><label>S1
