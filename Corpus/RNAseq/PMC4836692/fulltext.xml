A few sequencing studies performed on limited number of samples have revealed potential disease-driving genes in SCLC, however, much still remains unknown, particularly in the Asian patient population. Here we conducted whole exome sequencing (WES) and transcriptomic sequencing of primary tumors from 99 Chinese SCLC patients. Dysregulation of tumor suppressor genes <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>RB1</italic> was observed in 82% and 62% of SCLC patients, respectively, and more than half of the SCLC patients (62%) harbored <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>RB1</italic> mutation and/or copy number loss. Additionally, Serine/Arginine Splicing Factor 1 (<italic>SRSF1</italic>) DNA copy number gain and mRNA over-expression was strongly associated with poor survival using both discovery and validation patient cohorts. Functional studies <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> demonstrate that SRSF1 is important for tumorigenicity of SCLC and may play a key role in DNA repair and chemo-sensitivity. These results strongly support SRSF1 as a prognostic biomarker in SCLC and provide a rationale for personalized therapy in SCLC.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>SCLC patients are initially highly chemo-sensitive with response rates of greater than 80% in both limited and extensive diseases, but suffer uniform disease recurrence or progression in a very short period of time. In the absence of well-defined genomic biomarkers and insights into the resistance mechanism, many targeted treatments have yielded negative results in the last decade Using integrated next generation sequencing (NGS) technology in combination with a high quality surgical sample set with comprehensive clinical annotation, our study not only identified novel recurrent genetic alterations in genes such as CDH10 and DNA repair pathways which may influence outcomes in SCLC patients, but also discovered the expression of SRSF1, an RNA-splicing factor which can both regulate key oncogenic and survival pathways such as BCL2, and play a critical role in patient survival.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by MedImmune/AstraZeneca.

It is an aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy with a unique natural history of a short doubling time, high growth fraction, and early development of widespread metastases [<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Most patients are very sensitive to thoracic radiotherapy and platinum drugs such as cisplatin and carboplatin, but suffer disease recurrence or progression in a very short period of time following initial treatment [<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Currently, for recurrent or progressive SCLC, the only drug approved in the United States and Europe is topotecan, a topoisomerase 1 (<italic>Top1</italic>) inhibitor which provides some benefit, though the five year survival rate of SCLC has remained unchanged at~5% for the last four decades [<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>To improve patient outcomes in SCLC, it is critical to understand the key genetic alterations that contribute to the specific disease phenotypes and their utility for potential therapeutic targets. However, systematic genetics and genomics analyses of large cohorts of SCLC patients remains a challenge, primarily because SCLC usually presents as extensive disease upon diagnosis and hence is rarely treated surgically, thus causing a lack of suitable tumor specimens for comprehensive analysis. To date, these types of extensive genome-wide molecular analyses have been performed on relatively small patient cohorts, which provide utility restricted to the disease population sampled [<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Within these studies, among genes recurrently affected by genomic alterations in SCLC, <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>RB1</italic>, as well as the amplification of <italic>MYC</italic> family members and <italic>SOX2</italic> have been identified. However, the molecular factors related to chemo-sensitivity or resistance remain unknown. Additionally, clinical outcome such as survival in relation to genetic alterations remains unreported, particularly in the SCLC Chinese patient population.</p><p>Here, we conducted the first comprehensive genetic landscape survey of Chinese SCLC patients with whole exome sequencing (WES) and transcriptomic sequencing of primary tumors from 99 SCLC patients with detailed clinical history and survival data. Our study not only identified novel recurrent genetic alterations such as <italic>CDH10</italic> and DNA repair pathways which may influence outcomes in SCLC patients, but also revealed <italic>SRSF1</italic>, an RNA-splicing factor which can form complexes with TP53 and Top1, and plays a critical role in SCLC patient survival.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Recurrent mutations in SCLC Chinese patients</title><p>WES of 25 normal [normal adjacent tissue (NAT) or blood] and matched tumor pairs, and 74 tumors only (no normal tissue) from Chinese SCLC patients revealed 32,566 somatic non-silent single nucleotide variants (SNVs) or insertion/deletions (indels), an average of 329 per patient and non-silent/silent ratio of 2.11.

However, by leveraging our data with these previous SCLC studies, we were able to identify three additional common significantly mutated genes <italic>(TMEM132D</italic>, <italic>NCAM2</italic>, and <italic>CDH10</italic>) with over 10% prevalence in SCLC. Interestingly, all three genes encode transmembrane proteins involved in neural cell adhesion. This finding will need to be further evaluated for the impact on neuroendocrine association in SCLC.</p><p>Cadherins (CDHs) are important in maintenance of cell adhesion and polarity, alterations of which contribute to tumorigenesis. Recurrent mutations in <italic>CDH10</italic> have recently been reported in <italic>EGFR/KRAS/ALK</italic> mutation-negative lung adenocarcinoma in never-smokers [<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and as a prognostic mutation signature in colorectal cancer [<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Our study indicated that <italic>CDH10</italic> is not only the most commonly and significantly mutated gene in SCLC but also associated with poor survival in SCLC. CDH1/E-cadherin, the founding member of the CDH/cadherin family, undergoes loss-of-function mutations across multiple tumor types such as breast, gastric, colorectal and ovarian cancer. Its functional inactivation contributes to cancer progression by increasing cell invasion, migration, metastasis and proliferation and EMT process [<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We speculate that the recurrent CDH10 mutations we detected in SCLC may perform similar roles as CDH1 mutations in other cancers to promote SCLC aggressiveness, leading to poor patient survival. We are currently conducting experiments to test this hypothesis.</p><p>Our study suggests that genetic alteration of DNA repair pathways influence chemotherapy outcomes in SCLC patients. The Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway is essential for the repair of DNA inter-strand cross-linking agents, such as cisplatin, which has been used as first-line treatment in SCLC. It was demonstrated several decades ago that the FA patient-derived cells which contain genetic defects in FA genes display hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents [<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Our data strongly suggest that high prevalence mutations in FA pathway genes may contribute to initial hypersensitivity of SCLC to platinum-based treatment such as cisplatin. Multiple reports with experimental evidence show that the efficacy of various chemotherapeutic agents, including cisplatin, requires a functional TP53 protein for efficient induction of apoptosis and that loss of TP53 function enhances resistance to cytotoxic agents used in cancer therapy [<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Further, a combination of TP53 inactivation and MMR deficiency has also been observed to confer cisplatin resistance [<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Our data suggest that high frequency mutations in <italic>TP53</italic> combined with other DNA repair mutations such as mismatch repair, nucleotide excision repair, homologous recombination, and key DNA polymerases may confer early sensitivity and latent resistance to cisplatin in SCLC.</p><p>Of particular importance is our discovery of the prevalence of <italic>SRSF1</italic> CN gain and mRNA over-expression, and its role as a prognostic marker for poor patient survival&#x02014;reported for the first time in SCLC. <italic>SRSF1</italic> occurs in the same protein complex with topoisomerase 1 (<italic>Top1</italic>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Topotecan is a <italic>Top1</italic> inhibitor and the only agent with regulatory approval for the treatment of relapsed SCLC [<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In normal cells, Top1 cooperates with SRSF1 to prevent the formation of DNA-RNA hybrids (R-loops), unscheduled replication fork arrest, and genomic instability. In <italic>Top1</italic> deficient cells, R-loops are formed and lead to replication fork stalling, phosphorylation of H2AX, and genomic instability. Treatment of <italic>Top1+</italic> cells with diospyrin, to inhibit <italic>Top1</italic>phosphorylation of SRSF1 or with a siRNA targeting SRSF1 mimics a Top1-deficient phenotype [<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Although significant correlation between <italic>SRSF1</italic> and <italic>Top1</italic> gene expression is not observed in our data, our experiment clearly demonstrates that SRSF1 loss induces phosphorylated H2AX signal in SCLC cell lines, which suggests that SRSF1 may help maintain the genomic integrity of SCLC to safeguard against DNA-damage and cell death. With these factors in mind, we propose that SRSF1 may also rely on modulating H2AX signal to sustain the tumorigenicity in some SCLC tumor patients.</p><p>In the absence of specific limited stage (LS) or extensive stage (ES) disease determination in this study and a recent comprehensive SCLC study [<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], a simplified approach was used to classify SCLC patients into early and late stage disease activity. Based on known TNM information, early stage (TNM stage I/II) patients are M0, who are usually designated as LS patients, while late stage (TNM stage III/IV) patients are M1a or M1b, and usually classified into ES patients. We then evaluated <italic>SRSF1</italic> expression between early (TNM stage I/II) and late stage (TNM stage III/IV) SCLC patients. Results indicated that <italic>SRSF1</italic> gene expression does not significantly differ between these patient groups in both this study and the George et al study (p = 0.81 and p = 0.91, respectively; <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005895.s008">S8 Fig</xref></bold>). This may suggest that SRSF1 is not the key driver of cancer metastasis in SCLC.</p><p>SRSF1 is one of the critical downstream transcriptional targets of Myc [<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Myc family genes (<italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>MYCN</italic>) were shown to have significant CN gain or amplification events in our Chinese SCLC patients (14%). SRSF1 gene over-expression in both Myc and N-Myc amplified SCLC cell lines and Myc amplified SCLC tumor patients, however, was not observed (p = 0.29 and p = 0.33, respectively), though the number of amplified cell lines or patient tumors with available gene expression data was sparse for each comparison (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005895.s009">S9 Fig</xref></bold>).</p><p><italic>SRSF1</italic> is a key cancer driver, as demonstrated by the profound tumor-suppressive effect of specific <italic>SRSF1</italic> knockdown in <italic>SRSF1</italic>-amplified or overexpressed SCLC models. Previous reports demonstrate that overexpression of <italic>SRSF1</italic> results in oncogenic transformation of immortalized rodent fibroblasts [<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], human mammary epithelial cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and mouse hepatocytes [<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In these models, SRSF1 overexpression promoted cell proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and formed tumors in orthotopic mouse models. It is likely that this transformation is a cumulative result of SRSF1&#x02019;s many different functions, including a combination of several alternatively spliced oncogenic variants in response to an increase in SRSF1 levels. A number of such variants have been identified, but these probably represent only a small fraction of potential effectors [<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Das et al, previously summarized various spliced products of SRSF1 and isoform mechanisms driving oncogenic phenotypes [<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], though these were not detected with reliability using RNASeq here&#x02013;a challenge with this technology that currently persists in splice variant detection, especially in FFEE specimens. Furthermore, we demonstrate here that SRSF1 mediates the activation of both PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways as evidenced by both gene expression pathway analyses and the suppression of these pathways through SRSF1 knockdown. It is interesting to note that several SRSF1-regulated targets involved in regulating cell proliferation are downstream of these two pathways, including RPS6KB1, MKNK2, and CCND1 genes [<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. <italic>RPS6KB1</italic> encodes the protein S6 kinase 1, a downstream effector in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and has been shown to be involved in mediating SRSF1-induced transformation [<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. <italic>MKNK2</italic> is an effector in the MAPK/ERK pathway [<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Splicing functionality has been shown to be critical for some, but not all oncogenic activities of SRSF1. An SRSF1 variant that is confined to the nucleus has been shown to be critical for its oncogenic role in mammary epithelial cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, this variant was not able to promote tumor formation in hepatocellular xenografts [<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In this particular model, SRSF1-mediated oncogenesis was attributed to activation of Raf-MEK-ERK pathway [<xref rid="pgen.1005895.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This demonstrates that SRSF1 can be oncogenic via both nuclear and cytosolic activities through either canonical (splicing-related) or non-canonical (AKT/ERK-related) pathways under various cellular contexts. It may be of future interest to explore and pinpoint which effector pathway of SRSF1 drives its oncogenic roles in SCLCs. In conclusion, our discovery firmly establishes SRSF1 as a compelling therapeutic target for SCLC, especially for the population with poor outcome, as predicted by <italic>SRSF1</italic> over expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>SCLC patient and sample summary</title><p>The study protocol and informed consent from all studies in this study were approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Chest Hospital and Nanjing Medical University.
