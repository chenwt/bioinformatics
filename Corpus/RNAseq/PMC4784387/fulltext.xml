This mycotoxin has genotoxic, teratogenic and immunotoxic effects in mammals, and its presence in pome fruits and derived products represents a serious health hazard. Biocontrol agents in the Pucciniomycotina, such as the yeasts <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. strain IAM 13481 and <italic>Rhodosporidium kratochvilovae</italic> strain LS11, are able to resist patulin and degrade it into the less toxic compounds desoxypatulinic acid and ascladiol.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this investigation we applied a transcriptomic approach based on RNAseq to annotate the genome of <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. IAM 13481 and then study the changes of gene expression in <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. exposed to patulin. Patulin treatment leads to ROS production and oxidative stress that result in the activation of stress response mechanisms controlled by transcription factors. Upregulated <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> genes were those involved in oxidation-reduction and transport processes, suggesting the activation of defense mechanisms to resist patulin toxicity and expel the mycotoxin out of the cells. Other upregulated genes encoded proteins involved in metabolic processes such as those of the glutathione and thioredoxin systems, which are essential to restore the cellular redox homeostasis. Conversely, patulin treatment decreased the expression of genes involved in the processes of protein synthesis and modification, such as transcription, RNA processing, translation, protein phosphorylation and biosynthesis of amino acids. Also, genes encoding proteins involved in transport of ions, cell division and cell cycle were downregulated. This indicates a reduction of metabolic activity, probably due to the high energy requirement by the cells or metabolic arrest while recovering from the insult caused by patulin toxicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Complex mechanisms are activated in a biocontrol yeast in response to patulin.

Their occurrence in commercialized food and feed is a consequence of fungal attacks on crops in the field and/or on stored products. Patulin (PAT) is a mycotoxin produced by species in the fungal genera <italic>Aspergillus</italic> and <italic>Penicillium. P. expansum</italic>, the causative agent of the blue mold disease of stored apples, is the main PAT producer and, as a consequence of its attack, PAT is found in different fruits especially pome fruits and derived products. PAT contamination poses a major risk for children, who consume great quantities of fruit juices.</p><p>The mechanisms of PAT toxicity and its effects on living cells have been explored for decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The main targets of patulin are cellular nucleophiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In eukaryotic cells, patulin induces oxidative stress by lowering the concentration of the antioxidant peptide glutathione, to which it binds due to its electrophilic reactivity, and through generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. ROS generation plays a role in the molecular events leading to apoptotic processes particularly by inducing peroxidation of membrane lipids and oxidative DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Genome-wide analysis of the model yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> on cells exposed to PAT revealed increased levels of transcripts of genes involved in proteasome activity, metabolism of sulfur amino acids, and stress responses, which included transporters involved in detoxification and multidrug resistance, oxidative stress scavengers (thioredoxin and glutathione) and DNA repair genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Another study in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> confirmed the ROS-induced PAT toxicity through glutathione (GSH) depletion, and the activation of antioxidants and redox systems controlled by the transcription factor Pap1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], which is the ortholog of Yap1, a key transcription factor that mediates oxidative stress responses in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Moreover, in <italic>S. pombe</italic> PAT also causes plasma membrane fluidization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and changes in chromatin structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>In mammals, the primary target organs of PAT toxicity are the gastrointestinal tract, kidney, liver and the immune system, with acute symptoms of intestinal hemorrhage, ulceration, nausea, edema, dyspnea, convulsion, and agitation. The carcinogenic risk of PAT is classified in group 3 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], since the evidence for its carcinogenicity is considered inadequate in humans and experimental animals. Long-term consequences of exposure to toxic PAT concentrations may include mutagenicity, genotoxicity, embryotoxicity, and exposure to high dosages may include immunosuppression, immunotoxicity and neurotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The Joint Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives established a maximum tolerable daily intake for PAT of 0.4&#x000a0;mg/kg body weight/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Based upon its toxicity profile, legislative regulations in Europe and USA set the highest tolerable levels of PAT in fruit-based products and juices at 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg, and for baby food at 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg (EC Regulation 1881/2006). Despite this restrictive legislation, recent surveys in Europe and USA revealed that PAT contamination is still a common issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>In addition to adverse effects on mammals, PAT inhibits microbial growth, having antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal activities, and damages plant cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As with other secondary metabolites produced by filamentous fungi, the role of PAT is likely to help in competition against other microbes that those fungi encounter in their environment. A gene cluster encoding proteins for PAT biosynthesis has been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and mutation of these genes allowed the study of the role of PAT in the pathogenicity of <italic>P. expansum,</italic> which is still controversial and likely dependent on host factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Postharvest control of <italic>P. expansum</italic> infections is crucial to prevent PAT accumulation in stored fruits. Currently, this is achieved through a combination of cold storage and treatment with chemical fungicides. However, because of ethical, technical and health issues, there is an increasing demand for alternative methods to reduce the use of chemicals; the use of biocontrol agents and/or controlled atmosphere are very promising strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Besides reduction of <italic>P. expansum</italic> attack on stored fruits, strategies to detoxify PAT also could provide safer juices for consumption. A number of microbes have been identified that are naturally resistant to PAT, and some have the ability of degrading it. The influence of biocontrol agents (BCAs) that are effective against <italic>P. expansum</italic> on PAT accumulation is an emerging and attractive field of study, and major findings have been recently reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Two ascomycete yeast species, <italic>Pichia ohmeri</italic> and <italic>Candida sake</italic>, and a bacterium, <italic>Pantoea agglomerans</italic>, were able to reduce PAT accumulation; however, the observed reductions were not attributed to direct PAT metabolization but to the protection of fruits from infection by PAT-producing <italic>P. expansum</italic>, or by PAT absorption by cell wall and/or into the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]<italic>.</italic> Conversely, the BCA <italic>Rhodosporidium kratochvilovae</italic> strain LS11, which is a basidiomycete yeast in subphylum Pucciniomycotina, was able to resist and detoxify PAT <italic>in vitro</italic> through two independent pathways that led to the formation of breakdown products that are much less toxic than the mycotoxin. The isomers <italic>(E)</italic> and <italic>(Z)</italic> of ascladiol, intermediate in PAT biosynthesis, were found as transient products, while desoxypatulinic acid (DPA) was identified as the final product of PAT degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Another Pucciniomycotina yeast, <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. strain IAM 13481, also converts PAT to DPA and ascladiols, but in this case <italic>(E)</italic> ascladiol was found as a transient metabolite, while DPA and <italic>(Z)</italic> ascladiol were the two final breakdown products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. More recently, <italic>Rhodosporidium paludigenum</italic> and other Pucciniomycotina species were found to be able to degrade PAT to DPA and/or ascladiols ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]; our unpublished data). Therefore, it seems likely that different mechanisms, depending on the species under examination, regulate the expression of the two degradation pathways present in Pucciniomycotina yeasts. The hypothesis of the two distinct pathways is corroborated by the chemical structures of DPA and ascladiols, as they derive from the breakage of bonds that are located in separate ends of the PAT molecule (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Interestingly, while the production of DPA was found only in Pucciniomycotina species, which suggests a peculiar feature of this lineage of basidiomycete fungi, ascladiols were detected after incubation of PAT with the ascomycete <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and with the bacteria <italic>Gluconobacter oxydans</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]<italic>,</italic> indicating that the ascladiol-forming degradation pathway is likely to be conserved across fungi and bacteria.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Chemical structures of patulin and of the three breakdown products <italic>(E)</italic>-ascladiol, <italic>(Z)</italic>-ascladiol and desoxypatulinic acid (DPA)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2016_2550_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>We recently explored the molecular mechanisms involved in PAT degradation by Pucciniomycotina yeasts through a random insertional mutagenesis approach: <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. IAM 13481 was used as the model organism because of the availability of its genome sequence. However, only a few genes involved in resistance to PAT toxicity were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], suggesting that PAT treatment activates multiple cellular responses that are unlikely to be elucidated in their entirety using a forward genetics strategy.</p><p>Therefore, in the present study we analyzed the effects of PAT treatment on <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. IAM 13481 cells through a genome-wide approach based on the RNA sequencing (RNAseq). Amongst the fungi there are only two studies that investigated the effect of PAT at the genome-wide level, both on <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, with one analyzing the highly expressed genes, and the second focusing on the differential transcriptional response of a <italic>sod1</italic>&#x02206; mutant in comparison with the wild type strain and on the scavenging effect of ascorbic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The present study represents the first application of the high-throughput sequencing technique RNAseq for a non-conventional yeast that is of interest for food safety. The aims were to provide a comprehensive analysis of the genes, the cellular processes and the cellular compartments that play a crucial role in response to PAT treatment, and to identify potential mechanisms and enzymes that are involved in PAT degradation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Generation of a reference transcriptome</title><p>The genome sequence of the monokaryon strain IAM 13481 of <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. is available on the JGI website at the US Department of Energy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Sporo1/Sporo1.home.html">http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Sporo1/Sporo1.home.html</ext-link>). Its size is 21.2&#x000a0;Mb and includes 76 scaffolds, four of which contained about half of the genome, and 5536 gene models predicted and with putative functions annotated using the JGI annotation pipeline. Although a key taxon used for comparative genomics with the rust fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], the genome is still a draft not available in GenBank, and for an accurate transcriptome analysis a gene annotation upgrade was necessary.</p><p>Several approaches were performed for the generation of a reference transcriptome, such as the use of both strand-specific and non-strand specific sequencing, combined or not with the existing gene annotation. According to BLAST similarity analyses of resulting assembled transcripts, the most accurate transcriptome was obtained by merging new genomic traits revealed by strand-specific sequencing to the existing <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. annotation.</p><p>Strand-specific libraries were prepared from RNA isolated from <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. 1) yeast cells grown in the presence and in the absence of 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml of PAT (two biological replicates for each of two samples), 2) yeast cells collected from YPD agar medium after 2 days of incubation, 3) ballistospore cells fired on a YPD agar mirror plate, a spore dispersal system that we previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The table in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> summarizes the samples used for RNA extraction, the type of libraries generated and their use for downstream analysis (i.e. genome annotation and/or differential gene expression analysis). The transcriptome datasets are available at the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA), under accession number SRP061533.</p><p>Gene annotation was performed using the Tuxedo tools. In particular, reads were cleaned and then mapped to the <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> genome sequence using Tophat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Approximately 120 million reads (~20 million per sample) were mapped to single locations in the <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. IAM 13481 genome, for a&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;95.0&#x000a0;% overall read mapping rate. Tophat outputs were used as inputs for Cufflinks to generate a primary transcriptome for each growth condition; in order to use the existing annotation as a guide for the assembling and for discovering novel transcripts, the RABT (Reference Annotation Based Transcript) assembly was performed. All the Cufflinks outputs were merged in a single final transcriptome through Cuffmerge. The new generated transcriptome consisted of 6595 unique genes and a total of 14462 gene models due to alternative splicing or variable 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; untranslated regions (UTRs), whose sequences are found in the Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Transcriptome analysis of <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. IAM 13481 incubated in the presence of the mycotoxin PAT</title><p>As a first step the effects of PAT on <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. IAM 13481 were evaluated by monitoring the yeast growth in the presence of different concentrations of the mycotoxin. As showed in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, an increase of PAT concentration progressively affected <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> growth, which was characterized by a lag-phase at the higher concentrations of mycotoxin tested (50 and 75&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml). As we previously reported, the lag-phase is longer when the concentration of PAT increases, and during this stage the mycotoxin is not actively degraded; when the yeast start growing, PAT is degraded and its decrease parallels the onset of the PAT degradation products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Also a lower initial concentration of cells slowed the growth of <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> in the presence of PAT and consequently its degradation. At these tested concentrations, PAT had no morphological effects on <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. cells as examined by microscopy.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Growth (OD<sub>595</sub>) of <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. after six days of incubation in LiBa medium in the presence of 0, 5, 15, 30, 50 and 75&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml of PAT</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2016_2550_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p>Initially 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml was initially chosen as the optimal PAT concentration since it has an intermediate toxicity on the cells that, however, are able to recover early from the PAT insult. For the first transcriptomic analysis, two independent <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. cultures were incubated in the presence and in the absence of 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml of PAT. Cells for poly(A) RNA extraction were collected at two different growth levels, within the lag-phase at optical density 595&#x000a0;nm (OD<sub>595</sub>) ~0.08, and OD<sub>595</sub>&#x02009;~&#x02009;0.25 during the phase of active growth (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>A). It was expected that the transcriptomic analysis performed with the yeast growth in the lag-phase would have revealed mainly the mechanisms behind PAT resistance, while that performed during the log-phase of growth would have elucidated the specific mechanisms of PAT degradation. TLC analysis was performed to monitor the degradation process, since it was pivotal to verify that the expression of the <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. genes involved in PAT resistance and degradation was actually occurring. The decrease of the PAT spot progressively paralleled the increase the spots of the breakdown products, and as expected the&#x000a0;amount of&#x000a0; PAT degraded was higher at OD<sub>595</sub>&#x02009;~&#x02009;0.25 compared to that at OD<sub>595</sub>&#x02009;~&#x02009;0.08. Finally, after 4 days of incubation PAT was completely degraded (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>B).</p><p>Non-strand specific sequencing was performed, which we found to be inadequate for an improvement of the existing annotation of <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> genome since transcripts were merged into large gene models likely&#x000a0;due to the overlapping UTRs of adjacent genes. This is indeed a characteristic of basidiomycete genomes, as revealed by the recent RNAseq-based genome update of the human pathogen <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]<italic>.</italic> Despite this limitation, preliminary bioinformatic analysis using the <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. draft genome revealed that most of the upregulated genes were in common for both samples collected at two different growth stage&#x000a0;and included more than 400 genes encoding proteins involved in oxidative and other stress responses, transport and signaling, with no evident insights about the specific mechanisms of PAT degradation (data not shown). Although informative, the large amount of data obtained and the lack of biological replicates did not allow us to focus on genes playing key functions in PAT resistance and/or degradation.</p><p>Therefore, several modifications were made to the original experimental design. First, PAT concentration was decreased from 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml to 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml and cells for RNA extraction were collected after 3&#x000a0;h of incubation, when <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. growth just started increasing and reached an OD<sub>595</sub> value of&#x02009;~&#x02009;0.08 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>A). At this growth rate, PAT was still undegraded and ascladiols and DPA were not detected (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>B), but the genetic arsenal behind PAT resistance and degradation was active as demonstrated by the reduction of the mycotoxin and the onset of its breakdown products achieved at OD<sub>595</sub> 0.8 in the same culture used for collecting the cells for analysis (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>C). The rationale behind lowering PAT concentration was to mitigate the toxic effects of the mycotoxin on the yeast cells and eliminate the lag-phase growth with the aim to detect both resistance and degradation genes involved in the first response to the mycotoxin, hence just at the beginning of the growth even before PAT degradation started. Second, strand-specific sequencing was performed in order to obtain data useful for an improvement of the genome quality, essential for a reliable transcriptomic analysis. Last, two biological replicates for a single time point rather than one replicate at different time points were used, firstly because the use of biological replicates allows for the statistical analysis of the data, and secondly because we did not see significant differences in the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) detected at different time points in our preliminary RNAseq analysis.</p><p>Bioinformatic analysis was performed using the Tuxedo tools. The identification of the <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> DEGs was performed using Cuffdiff, a statistical tool within the software Cufflinks. The unprocessed Cuffdiff output is available in the Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>. DEGs were considered those with a false discovery rate (FDR)&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05. Using these parameters, 347 genes were found differentially expressed by <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. IAM 13481 when incubated in the presence of 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml of PAT. Among these, 101 were upregulated and 246 were downregulated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). A heat map of the expression levels of the detected DEGs is shown in the Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Volcano plot showing upregulated and downregulated DEGs of <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp.

As mentioned above, other genes were grouped according to the model yeast databases as follows: organization of the cytoskeleton (8 DEGs), cell division (4 DEGs), chromatin functions (8 DEGs), cell wall organization and function (4 DEGs) and mitochondrial functions (11 DEGs) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">8</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>GO terms representation of downregulated DEGs of <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. grown in the presence of 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml of PAT</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2016_2550_Fig6_HTML" id="MO6"/></fig></p><p>Downregulated DEGs of the transport group encoded i) proteins that are involved in ions and sugar homeostasis, with calcium being the most represented (YJR124C, Pmr1, Vcx1), and ii) proteins involved in vesicle-mediated transport functions from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi, vacuole and other cellular compartments. Within the metabolic and biosynthesis groups, the most represented DEGs were those involved in amino acid biosynthesis and regulation.

Moreover, many other DEGs encode proteins involved in essential cellular processes such as organization of the cellular cytoskeleton, cell division, chromatin functions, DNA replication, meiosis, and mitosis: this suggests that cells exposed to PAT arrest their growth to have a lower metabolic activity probably because of the high energy requirements of the cells that need to recover from the insult due to the mycotoxin toxicity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Transcriptomic analyses of <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. incubated in the presence of high PAT concentration</title><p>The non-strand specific reads of poly(A) RNA extracted from <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. incubated in the presence of 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml of PAT at two different growth levels (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>) were re-analyzed using the newly generated transcriptome as a reference.

In the samples obtained at OD<sub>595</sub>&#x02009;~&#x02009;0.08 (indicated as PAT50#1), 155 upregulated genes were identified, and 31 of them were in common with DEGs found in samples obtained after treatment with the lower PAT concentration (indicated as PAT5); 208 downregulated DEGs with log2FC&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;-2 were found, and 19 were in common with PAT5 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>).

The transcriptional differences in cultures exposed to either 5 or 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml of PAT may be due to the different concentrations used and to the criteria used to select DEGs, since the FDR applied to analyze biological replicates can also select genes with log2FC lower than 2 and -2.</p><p>Amongst the three different transcriptomic datasets of this study (PAT5, PAT50#1 and PAT50#2), some of the most upregulated DEGs in all the samples were selected and their expression levels compared at different PAT concentrations and at two different growth stages (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).

Also, for the majority of the selected genes there was a minimum of a one-unit log2FC increment of expression at 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml, indicating that the abundance of transcripts for proteins such as Oye2, Adh1, Flr1, and others, relate to PAT toxicity and thus specifically required to defeat the cellular insult caused by the mycotoxin. Conversely, the expression of other genes (<italic>ADH6,</italic> YML131W<italic>, ENV9, URE2, TPO1, YCF1</italic> and <italic>PDR15</italic>) did not considerably differ at the two tested PAT concentrations, suggesting that the encoded proteins might be involved in general response to a toxic molecule (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>).

This, in conjunction with the low molecular weight of PAT, allows the mycotoxin to enter the cell, most likely through passive diffusion without the involvement of transporters or energy-dependent pumps.

Following our transcriptomic analysis we suggest that PAT degradation occurs through different ways and an essential step is the formation of enzymatic adducts of PAT with GSH, as documented by Fliege and Metzler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. We propose that the degradation occurs at least in part in the vacuole, likely mediated by the ABC transporter Ycf1 that binds PAT-GSH adducts and actively transports them to the vacuole for non-specific degradation; other vacuolar proteins, such as Env9, may also be involved.

Of note, the enzymatic adducts are likely formed by proteins with glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] such as Ure2, which is one of the highly expressed DEGs in our analysis. Whether or not the formation of the PAT breakdown products DPA and ascladiol occurs in the vacuole, other organelles, or in the cytosol needs to be further investigated.</p><p>DPA is the most important metabolite of PAT degradation because i) it is characterized by a lower cytotoxicity than PAT, most likely because of its very low reactivity with thiol groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], ii) it is the most abundant breakdown metabolite, and iii) it is produced by all the Pucciniomycotina found as able to degrade PAT. DPA is most likely formed through the hydrolysis of the &#x003b1;,&#x003b2;-unsaturated &#x003b3;-lactone ring of PAT (Rosa Dur&#x000e1;n-Patr&#x000f3;n, personal communication), a mechanism that is similar to the biodetoxification of zearalenone by the zearalenone hydrolase/lactonase Zdh101 produced by the BCA <italic>Clonostachys rosea</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Orthologs of Zdh101 were not found amongst the DEGs identified in this study as well as in <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> and other sequenced Pucciniomycotina genomes. Therefore, we searched for genes encoding proteins with predicted hydrolase activity on lactone rings and found in our DEGs a predicted dienelactone hydrolase (TCONS_00000158). We previously generated a targeted mutant for this gene as well as for another gene encoding a dienelactone hydrolase, the latter not detected as being differentially expressed in our analysis. Surprisingly, both mutants had the same kinetics of PAT degradation as the <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> wild type strain (unpublished data), indicating that these genes are not involved in PAT degradation. Perhaps suitable candidates for DPA generation could be the newly identified gene (TCONS_00005994) that encodes a protein containing a stress responsive A/B barrel domain of unknown function, another gene (TCONS_00013529) that encodes a protein designed as a catalytic LigB subunit of aromatic ring-opening dioxygenase (TCONS_00013529), or one of the upregulated short or medium chain dehydrogenases that are potentially able to degrade xenobiotic compounds.</p><p>As regards ascladiol, from a chemical viewpoint it results from the hemiacetal opening of PAT and reduction of the derived aldehyde. <italic>(E)-</italic>ascladiol is oxidized to PAT in one step enzymatic reaction in PAT biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]; thus, it is reasonable that the reverse enzymatic reaction leads to the formation of <italic>(E)-</italic>ascladiol from PAT. It has been recently suggested that the <italic>P. expansum</italic> gene <italic>PatE</italic> encoding a Glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) oxidoreductase is responsible for the last step in PAT biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], even though this hypothesis has not been experimentally established yet. Strikingly, BLASTp analysis revealed that <italic>P. expansum PatE</italic> corresponds to the <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> GMC oxidoreductase that was found to be upregulated in the present study (TCONS_00004874), and potentially this enzyme may be responsible for the conversion of PAT into ascladiol. Future studies using reverse genetics will allow the elucidation of the role of the upregulated <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. DEGs in PAT resistance and degradation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Damage to cellular components</title><p>Besides the role of ROS as signaling molecules, they are mainly responsible for PAT cytotoxicity. In fact, despite the rapid upregulation and high efficiency of antioxidant defenses, cells can still sustain severe organelle damage and inhibition of biological processes essential for cellular life. The cytotoxic effects of PAT have been studied for over 30&#x000a0;years, as reviewed in 2005 and 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and they recall the cellular damage observed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> exposed to ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Lipid peroxidation causes perturbing effects on the plasma and other organelle membranes with loss of intracellular components and altered homeostasis. Furthermore, oxidative DNA and RNA damage compromises nucleic acids integrity and functionality hence interfering with their synthesis and replication; the actin cytoskeleton is another target of PAT as well as of ROS, and the physiological consequences of its oxidation include accelerated aging and apoptotic cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This is the first study where a next generation sequence (NGS) technique has been applied to depict the complex molecular effects of the mycotoxin PAT on a non-conventional basidiomycete yeast that is able to degrade it and has biocontrol activity against the PAT-producing fungus <italic>P. expansum</italic>. Our study when compared with previous findings from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> about PAT cytotoxicity provides compelling evidence for common cellular targets and responses, yet it also discloses new aspects such as novel mechanisms of stress response activation, which may represent a specialized feature of the Pucciniomycotina fungi. Two attractive long term goals are 1) the development of a biosensor, based on upregulated <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genes in response to or even that bind the mycotoxin, for user-friendly and economical procedures for PAT detection and quantification in products ready for commercialization; and 2) the functional characterization of genes involved in conversion of PAT to DPA and/or ascladiol that will create the premises for production of enzymes responsible for PAT detoxification in heterologous cell factories in which the identified genes are transformed. These enzymes could be the base for detoxification processes of products and juices derived from pome fruits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Strain used and cultivation</title><p><italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. strain IAM 13481 was used in this study.

With 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml of PAT, two biological replicates were used; <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. cells were added to 200&#x000a0;ml of LiBa medium and incubated on an orbital shaker at 24&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C until the growth reached a OD<sub>595</sub> of&#x02009;~&#x02009;0.08 (~3&#x000a0;h).

The cultures were centrifuged to collect cells for RNA extraction, and an aliquot of each supernatant obtained was analyzed through HPLC as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] to monitor the degradation of PAT at the time of extraction. When 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml of PAT was used, two independent <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. cultures of 50&#x000a0;ml were incubated on an orbital shaker at 24&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and cells for RNA extraction were collected by centrifugation at OD<sub>595</sub> of&#x02009;~&#x02009;0.08 from one culture, and at OD<sub>595</sub> of&#x02009;~&#x02009;0.25 from the other; untreated conditions were LiBa medium without PAT inoculated with <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. IAM 13481 reaching the same growth levels. In this case the supernatants obtained were used to assess through TLC analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] the degradation of PAT at the times of RNA extraction. Moreover, both at PAT 5 and 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml, aliquots of the growth cultures from which cells were collected for RNA extraction were re-incubated and used to assess <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> growth and PAT degradation for several days, since it was pivotal to verify that the mechanisms behind PAT resistance and degradation were active.</p><p>Besides the incubation in the presence of PAT, <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp.

First, the existing <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. genome annotation was examined using the RNAseq data presented in this study. To this aim, a total of six strand-specific libraries generated as reported above were used. The <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. genome sequence (.fasta format) and annotation (.gtf format) were downloaded from the US Department of Energy&#x02019;s Joint Genome Institute website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Sporo1/Sporo1.home.html">http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Sporo1/Sporo1.home.html</ext-link>). Cleaned reads generated from all six conditions were individually mapped to the <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. genome sequence using Tophat. Generated .bam files were used to run Cufflinks with the RABT (Reference Annotation Based Transcript) assembly, an option that it is able to integrate novel transcripts in the existing genome annotation. Cuffmerge was then used to merge all the .gtf files generated by Cufflinks into the reference transcriptome used in downstream differential analysis. Novel <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. genes were those that did not find a corresponding match in the JGI <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. genome annotation. Gene names were assigned according to the Saccharomyces genome database (SGD) following BLASTx analysis; matches with <italic>E</italic>-value higher than 1E-3 were not considered because they indicated different orthologs having only low similarity. Cuffdiff, the statistical software for gene expression analysis, was run to compare the Tophat outputs deriving from samples of <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. incubated with and without 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml of PAT (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), and with the newly generated transcriptome as reference. <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. DEGs were considered those with a FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05. Graphical representations were performed using CummeRbund within the R package. Functional annotation of <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp.

Because samples were as single biological replicates, DEGs were selected based on the Log2FC expression values, with those&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;2 being upregulated and those&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;-2 downregulated. DEGs selected were compared with those obtained for <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> sp. incubated with 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml of PAT, as indicative of the reliability of our analysis since these datasets originated from three different and independent conditions. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the genetic effects of the PAT concentration and the incubation time, the Log2FC expression values of the main upregulated DEGs of these three datasets were compared.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Availability of supporting data</title><p>All the supporting data are included as Additional file.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec20"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12864_2016_2550_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Table reporting growth conditions used to collect <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> samples for RNA extraction, the type of cDNA libraries generated, and their use for downstream analysis.
