However, a considerable portion of the patients does not respond to trastuzumab and the molecular mechanisms underlying the intrinsic resistance to anti-HER2 therapy in GC is not fully understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We performed whole-transcriptome sequencing on 21 HER2-positive tumor specimens from Chinese GC patients. Whole genome sequencing was performed on the three samples with <italic>HER2</italic> fusion to discover the DNA integration structure. A multicolor FISH assay for <italic>HER2</italic> split screening was conducted to confirm <italic>HER2</italic> fusion and IHC (HercepTest&#x02122;) was used to detect the membranous expression of <italic>HER2</italic>. Fusion cDNA were transfected into NIH/3T3 cells and generate stable cell line by lentivirus.

T-DM1 was used to assess its binding to NIH/<italic>3T3</italic> cells ectopically expressing wild-type and fusion HER2. Finally, the anti-tumor efficacy of trastuzumab was tested in NIH/3&#x000a0;T3 xenografts expressing the <italic>HER2</italic> fusion variants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We identified three new <italic>HER2</italic> fusions with <italic>ZNF207</italic>, <italic>MDK</italic>, or <italic>NOS2</italic> in 21 <italic>HER2-</italic>amplified GC samples (14%; 3/21). Two of the fusions, <italic>ZNF207-HER2</italic>, and <italic>MDK-HER2</italic>, which are oncogenic, lead to aberrant activation of HER2 kinase. Treatment with trastuzumab inhibited tumor growth significantly in xenografts expressing MDK-HER2 fusion. In contrast, trastuzumab had no effect on the growth of xenografts expressing ZNF207-HER2 fusion, due to its inability to bind to trastuzumab.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results provide the molecular basis of a novel resistance mechanism to trastuzumab-based anti-HER2 therapy, supporting additional molecule stratification within HER2-positive GC patients for more effective therapy options.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12967-015-0476-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>HER2</kwd><kwd>Fusion-gene</kwd><kwd>Gastric cancer</kwd><kwd>Trastuzumab</kwd><kwd>Lapatinib</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Gastric cancer (GC), as the second leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, accounted for 989,600 new cases and 738,000 deaths globally in 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]; more than 50% of GC cases occur in Eastern Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The conventional treatments for GC include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], which have limited efficacy because most GC patients are in the advanced stages when diagnosed; the five-year survival rate for patients with stage III/IV GC is around 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Trastuzumab, a neutralization antibody of HER2, was recently approved for the treatment of a subset of advanced GC patients whose tumors are clinically defined as HER2-positive.</p><p><italic>HER2</italic> gene amplification was initially discovered as an oncogene in breast cancer (BC), which led to the development of HER2-targeted therapeutics for treating HER2-positive BC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These drugs include trastuzumab; lapatinib, a small-molecular inhibitor of HER2 kinase; pertuzumab, an antibody-blocking heterodimerization of HER2 with HER3; and trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), which is trastuzumab conjugated with the antimitotic agent emtansine (DM1). The clinical application of these targeted agents dramatically changed the landscape of BC therapy and exemplified a new era of personalized medicine associated with companion molecular diagnosis for patient selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In addition to BC, <italic>HER2</italic> amplification and overexpression was also found in about 20% of GC patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The anti-tumor activity of trastuzumab as a single agent or in combination with cytotoxic agents has been demonstrated in several HER2-positive human GC cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic> and in GC xenografts <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The preclinical efficacy translated into positive clinical trials in which a survival improvement was achieved in HER2-positive metastatic GC patients treated with trastuzumab plus cytotoxic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These results led to the approval of trastuzumab as the first molecular targeted therapy for treating GC.</p><p>Despite the clinical benefits of trastuzumab in the treatment of patients with HER2-positive GC or BC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], approximately 30-40% of HER2-positive tumors are insensitive to the treatment. Significant efforts to understand the resistance to anti-HER2 therapy in BC cases have recently been made, resulting in a diverse array of resistance mechanisms and clinical strategies to overcome the resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, there is little understanding of the resistance mechanism to anti-HER2 therapy in GC. Therefore, we used a next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach to elucidate molecular insights in HER2-positive GC. In this study, for the first time, we report three <italic>HER2</italic> gene fusions in HER2-positive GC in Chinese patients, and we characterize their oncogenic properties and sensitivity to anti-HER2 agents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Human primary tumor samples</title><p>Specimens were collected during surgery from Chinese GC patients with postoperative pathological confirmation.

For example, two <italic>HER2</italic> fusions were identified at the same time in human GC cell line MKN7 (HER2 positive): a fusion between <italic>CDK12</italic> exon 12 and <italic>HER2</italic> intron 4, and a second fusion between <italic>NEUROD2</italic> exon 1 and <italic>HER2</italic> exon 8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, there was no direct evidence in that report that demonstrated the oncogenic driver of these <italic>HER2</italic> fusions. In the current study, we performed a whole-transcriptome sequencing of 21 HER2-positive GC tumor samples taken from Chinese patients, and discovered three <italic>HER2</italic> fusion transcripts due to <italic>HER2</italic> gene fusions. Two of them, ZNF207-HER2 and MDK-HER2 were truncated in the N-terminal extracellular domains, but they remained intact in the kinase and transmembrane domains of HER2. The amplification and overexpression of the three <italic>HER2</italic> gene fusions were detected in the primary GC samples by multicolor FISH and RNAseq or IHC-based HercepTest&#x02122; analysis. The ectopic expression of <italic>ZNF207-HER2</italic> and <italic>MDK-HER2</italic> in the NIH/3T3 cells led to a constitutive activation of <italic>HER2</italic> and downstream signaling, and thus, cell transformation <italic>in vitro</italic> and tumorigenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>, demonstrating the oncogenic driver of the fusions. Furthermore, the xenografts ectopically expressing <italic>MDK-HER2</italic> but not <italic>ZNF207-HER2</italic> were sensitive to trastuzumab<italic>.</italic> Interestingly, the <italic>HER2</italic> fusions were found to be mutually exclusive with mutations of <italic>PI3KCA</italic>, <italic>BRAF</italic>, <italic>KRAS</italic>, and <italic>HER3</italic> and amplifications of <italic>FGFR2</italic> and <italic>c-MET</italic>. Collectively, our data confirmed for the first time the presence of oncogenic <italic>HER2</italic> arrangements in patients with GC. The <italic>ZNF207-HER2</italic> fusion represents a novel intrinsic resistance mechanism to trastuzumab-based anti-HER2 therapy, due to the loss of binding ability to trastuzumab.</p><p>Despite the overall survival benefit achieved with trastuzumab in GC patients carrying <italic>HER2</italic> amplification, a significant portion of the patients do not respond clinically to the treatment, and there is little understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying this intrinsic resistance. In contrast, the understanding of the mechanisms of both intrinsic and acquired resistance to <italic>HER2</italic> inhibitors in HER2-positive BC is far more advanced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. For example, some intrinsic resistance mechanisms affect the ability of HER2 inhibitors to directly engage HER2 in BC; a truncated form of HER2, p95, lacking the trastuzumab binding region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]; a splice variant that eliminates exon 16 (<italic>HER2</italic>-&#x00394;16) in the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor, preventing disruption of HER2 homodimers upon binding by trastuzumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]; In our study, we did not assess p95, but we did find <italic>HER2</italic>-&#x00394;16 in a GC tumor sample, which naturally harbored <italic>HER2</italic>-&#x00394;16. Surprisingly, its corresponding patient-derived gastric cancer xenograft (PDGCX), which retains <italic>HER2</italic>-&#x00394;16 (data not shown), responded well to trastuzumab treatment, with a significant tumor regression being observed (data not shown). Given the lack of clinical evidence of association between <italic>HER2</italic>-&#x00394;16 and resistance to trastuzumab in BC, as well as the lack of preclinical data on the anti-tumor efficacy of trastuzumab in xenografts carrying <italic>HER2</italic>-&#x00394;16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], our data suggest that <italic>HER2</italic>-&#x00394;16 was not a resistance mechanism to trastuzumab in GC when tested in the PDGCX model. Additional <italic>HER2</italic>-&#x00394;16 positive PDGCX models are warranted to confirm this observation further.</p><p>Surprisingly, in addition to the <italic>HER2</italic> fusions, we also found two recurrent in-frame <italic>BRAF</italic> fusion transcripts, <italic>BAIAP2L1-BRAF</italic> (data not shown), in another cohort of <italic>HER2</italic>-amplified GC patients. Although further work is needed to demonstrate its oncogenic activity and sensitivity to trastuzumab or BRAF inhibitor, the findings suggest that BAIAP2L1-BRAF could be a potential resistance mechanism to trastuzumab, as it maintains an intact BRAF kinase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>The current clinical protocol for selecting HER2-positive patients is based on FISH positivity or an IHC (HercepTest&#x02122;) score of 3+ (HercepTest&#x02122; score of 2+ needs further FISH confirmation). <italic>HER2</italic> gene amplification is determined by the ratio between the numbers of signals from the hybridization of the <italic>HER2</italic> gene probe (covers the whole <italic>HER2</italic> gene) and the number of signals from the hybridization of the reference chromosome 17 centromere probe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The antibody used in the HercepTest&#x02122; recognizes the HER2 epitope located at the HER2 intracellular site, which is also covered by all three <italic>HER2</italic> fusions (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Therefore, the current HER2 tests cannot distinguish between the amplifications of the HER2 fusions and that of the wild-type. The use of multicolor FISH and RT-PCR assays to detect the <italic>HER2</italic> fusions developed in this study demonstrated the feasibility of detecting <italic>HER2</italic> fusions as clinical biomarkers in either FFPE or frozen surgical GC specimens. This finding warrants further clinical validation of the novel resistant mechanism of the ZNF207-HER2 fusion to trastuzumab-based therapy.</p><p>In addition to the antibody, a number of small-molecule HER2 kinase inhibitors are available: lapatinib, an approved agent for HER2-positive BC patients, and afatinib and neratinib, two irreversible kinase inhibitors, currently in phase III clinical trials for HER2-positive BC. The modulation of AKT signaling by lapatinib in the cells expressing the HER2 fusions (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A) suggests that the small-molecule inhibitor against HER2 kinase is a potential option for cancer patients with the <italic>HER2</italic> fusions. This notion is further supported by our observations that NIH/3T3 cells expressing either ZNF207-HER2 or MDK-HER2 showed to be sensitivity to lapatinib, afatinib, and neratinib <italic>in vitro</italic> (data not shown)<italic>.</italic></p><p>Besides the functional and phonotypical heterogeneity, emerging evidences indicate that genetic heterogeneity among tumor cells contributes to the advantages for survival, proliferation, metastasis and resistance to anti-cancer therapies. Recently, Tajiri et al. examined 475 GC samples using multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and FISH analysis and revealed intratumoral heterogeneity of <italic>HER2</italic> amplification in 41% (21/51) of <italic>HER2</italic>-amplified tumors. The mutually exclusive co-amplification of <italic>HER2</italic> with <italic>EGFR</italic>, <italic>FGFR2</italic>, <italic>FGFR2</italic> and <italic>MET</italic> was also observed respectively in some of the tumors, suggesting the potential challenges for design of targeted-therapy approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The homogenous expression of ZNF270-HER2 supports the driver role of this fusion gene, which is consistent with our experimental results. However, the advantage of co-amplification of <italic>MDK-HER2</italic> and <italic>NOS2-HER2</italic> with wild <italic>HER2</italic> (intra-tumor heterogeneity) is yet to be uncovered. Further studies to explore the responsiveness of the HER2 fusions to combination of trastuzumab with pertuzumab or chemotherapies may lead to additional insights into the impact of the HER2 fusions to anti-HER2 therapies.</p><p>It is noteworthy that the HER2 positive GC samples used for this study were collected prior the introduction of trastuzumab to China, thus we lack evidence for clinical response of the tumors harboring HER2 fusions to trastuzuamb. Further studies on GC samples from patients treated with trastuzumab at different stages will help to confirm the effect of the HER2 fusions to trastuzmab therapy and their oncogenic property.</p><p>Although further large-scale clinical investigations are needed to understand the clinical prevalence in GC patients, our data on <italic>ZNF207-HER2</italic>, along with the discovery of two recurrent <italic>BAIAP2L1-BRAF</italic>, strongly indicate a large degree of molecular heterogeneity, even in the well-defined HER2-positive segment, representing potential <italic>de novo</italic> resistance to trastuzumab-based GC therapies. In addition, whether a similar mechanism would exist in BC also needs to be exploited.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, we uncovered three previously unidentified <italic>HER2</italic> fusion genes in GC patients whose tumors were clinically classified as HER2-positive. Our results suggest that these <italic>HER2</italic> fusions are genetically amplified driver oncogenes that respond differently to the HER2-neutralizing antibody trastuzumab. The resistance of ZNF207-HER2 to trastuzumab and the existence of the recurrent <italic>BRAF</italic> fusion variants warrant molecular subtype diagnoses of HER<italic>2-</italic>positive GC patients for more effective personalized trastuzumab therapies and for future treatment options.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec23"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12967_2015_476_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
