Teleosts are exposed throughout their life to a broad range of external factors which may be climatic, e.g. extreme cold or heat, nutritional as well as of social nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Cultured teleost species are exposed to an additional range of noxius stimuli and / or stressors such as overcrowding, confinement, chasing, netting, unsuitable water temperatures, poor water quality and overfeeding. The response to environmental parameters is considered a basic element of animal adaptation to various challenges and can affect all forms of animal performance. It further involves complex interactions, from the molecular to the systems level, and may render teleosts more susceptible to infections, inhibit growth or possibly result in reproductive failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>It has also been shown that the life history of an animal plays an important role in stress response (for a review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]). Yet, differences are observed according to the nature, intensity, duration and predictability of the applied stressors as well as between individuals and between different species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Besides the variety of parameters concerning external stimuli, a broad range of different responses to external stimuli have also been described, which may be of an adaptive or maladaptive nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The latter influences survival, reproductive capabilities, general fitness and immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It has also been shown, that in order to ensure decent animal welfare a certain allostatic load is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Nevertheless, up until now, only scarce information has been available dealing how established ordinary rearing methods during early life stages impacts the brain function, learning ability and coping styles of fish and more importantly, if they are of adaptive or maladaptive nature.</p><p>Studies in teleosts showing differential gene expression after stress exposure have been performed on core genes such as those involved in the classical regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]). These core genes, assumed to be involved in stress response, have been shown to be highly conserved across teleosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Further studies in teleosts applying high throughput expression analysis methods however, have identified several genes not previously known to be responsive to external stimuli. These studies broadly classified the majority of differentially expressed transcripts as genes playing an important role in metabolism, immunity and reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Early life patterns of fish species offer a unique opportunity to study the interactions between genes and environmental factors. In addition, for fish under captivity, larval stages represent one of the most critical periods to ensure high performance and superior quality in the subsequent developmental stages of the life cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The first attempts to investigate stress response in gilthead sea bream (<italic>Sparus aurata</italic>) juveniles using microarray technology for high throughput expression analysis, identified transcripts mainly involved in gluconeogenesis, glycolysis and in the respiratory chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Further expression analysis in liver of the gilthead sea bream after confinement stress, as well as after low temperature exposure, showed that genes involved in metabolic pathways as well as the endoplasmic reticulum are of significance regarding the transcriptional regulation of stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>However, the effect of early life events on fish performance has not yet been thoroughly examined. Here we investigate for the first time the transcriptome, the cortisol stress response and the performance of gilthead sea bream larvae exposed to unpredictable environmental, husbandry and social events of mild intensity at different time points of early ontogeny (first feeding, flexion and development of all fins &#x02013; hereafter referred to as <italic>Phase 1</italic>) as well as on the subsequent juvenile stage after the application of an additional acute stressor (referred to as <italic>Phase 2</italic>) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>All procedures such as handling and treatment of fish used during this study were approved by the HCMR institutional animal care and use committee following the three Rs (Replacement, Reduction, Refinement) guiding principles for more ethical use of animals in testing, first described by Russell and Burch in 1959 (EU Directive 2010/63). All experiments/methods in the present study were performed in accordance with the approved guidelines and regulations.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Larval rearing</title><p>Larval rearing was performed in 500-L cylindro-conical tanks. During the first phase feeding was based on daily supplementation of zooplankton (enriched rotifers and <italic>Artemia nauplii</italic>) and also phytoplankton for a period of 2&#x000a0;weeks. During the second phase feeding was based on <italic>Artemia nauplii</italic> and the weaning to artificial diets was completed. Tanks were coupled to a biological filter and were initially filled with filtered seawater from a deep well. Water, during embryogenesis, egg hatching and at the autotrophic larval stage, was re-circulated from the bottom of the tank through the biological filter at a rate of 10&#x000a0;%&#x000a0;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and was progressively increased to 70&#x000a0;%&#x000a0;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Following first feeding the water renewal in the tanks was set to 20&#x000a0;%&#x000a0;h-1 and was gradually increased to 170&#x000a0;% at the end of the experimental period. Aeration was provided by means of a wooden diffuser located in the tank center at a rate of 150&#x02013;200&#x000a0;ml&#x000a0;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Experimental design</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Early life events - larvae (Phase 1, P1)</title><p>Gilthead sea bream individuals were exposed at different stages of early ontogeny (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media"><bold>1</bold></xref>: Figure S1) to various events, representing possible stimuli experienced during intensive larvae rearing. All experiments were conducted in duplicate tanks per experimental group. The protocol was based on a previous unpredictable chronic low intensity stress (UCLIS) protocol, developed for the European sea bass (<italic>Dicentrarchus labrax</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and consisted of optical (increase in light intensity from 60 to 200 lux for 15&#x000a0;min; lights on for 0.5&#x000a0;h during night; lights off for 0.5&#x000a0;h during day; exposure to blue or red spectrum for 0.5&#x000a0;h), mechanical (high aeration for 90&#x000a0;sec) and social (presence of novel object for 0.5&#x000a0;h) mild stimuli. Two different types of stimuli were applied randomly on a daily basis for the total period of 14&#x000a0;days, thus fish were kept under a mild unpredictable chronic stress that minimized the potential for habituation. Full spectrum lights (Phillips, TLD 36&#x000a0;W) were used to approximate natural light and transparent filters to produce the blue (maximum absorption spectrum 450&#x02013;475&#x000a0;nm) and red (maximum absorption spectrum 620&#x02013;750&#x000a0;nm) spectra. The novel objects used were large sized Lego bricks of intense red and green color. Water samples (1&#x000a0;l) were taken at regular intervals (0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14&#x000a0;days) from the rearing tanks of the control and experimental groups. Water samples were used to determine water-born cortisol as a non-invasive method to evaluate stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>During larval rearing and pre-weaning a sample of 10 larvae was taken daily to determine morphological characteristics and record total length, while 2 times per week weight measurements were also performed with a sample of 10 individuals. At the end of larval rearing (60 dph) the biological performance of each group was evaluated by estimating the survival rate and the total growth rate.</p><p>For transcriptome analysis three biological replicates of each sampling point including control fish were collected resulting into a total of 18 samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Exposure to acute stress at juvenile stage (Phase 2, P2)</title><p>Post larvae were transferred into 1.5&#x000a0;m<sup>3</sup> cylindrical tanks for pre-growing. The water used was from a deep well (36 psu, 19&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) and the renewal rate at ~50&#x000a0;% per hour. The photoperiod was set at 12&#x000a0;L : 12D. Individuals were fed with artificial diets (INVE aquaculture S.A) appropriate to their age and size.</p><p>At the end of the experimental period of <italic>Phase 2</italic> (i.e. about two months after the end of the early-life events), 40 fish per group were sampled to measure their total length and body weight. In addition a representative sample per group was analyzed to estimate their qualitative characteristics in terms of potential deformities. To evaluate stress two types of control fish were used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]; one with minimum handling (fish captured with a net immediately, without decrease of the tank&#x02019;s water level, after the distribution of a small amount of food in the tank), and another with common handling practice (decrease of the water level, crowding and netting). Juveniles were then exposed to an acute stress protocol, consisted of crowding (10&#x000a0;min), chasing (5&#x000a0;min) and air exposure (1&#x000a0;min) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1) to evaluate the cortisol stress response between the groups with different early life stress history. Fish were transferred to 70&#x000a0;l buckets where blood was collected at 1&#x000a0;h post-stress. The time-point was chosen based on previous data in gilthead sea bream showing maximum plasma cortisol concentrations at 1&#x000a0;h post-stress exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In all groups 10 fish were sampled, euthanized with anaesthetic overdose and whole body samples were collected.</p><p>For transcriptome analysis three biological replicates of whole brain tissues were collected from individuals after common handling (control group) and after the acute stress application for each group (&#x0201c;P2-FF&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;P2-FLX&#x0201d;,&#x0201c;P2-FINS&#x0201d;) as well as for juveniles not having experienced early-life events (&#x0201c;Acute&#x0201d;) resulting in a total of 24 samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Whole body cortisol</title><p>Cortisol extraction was performed according to de Jesus et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and Pavlidis et al.

Briefly, whole-trunk samples were partially thawed on ice and homogenized in 5&#x000d7; (w/v), ice-cold, phosphate-buffered saline (pH&#x000a0;7.4) with a rotor homogenizer. Cortisol was extracted by adding 3&#x000a0;mL of diethyl ether to 2 &#x000d7; 250&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of homogenate. The liquid phase of the extract was allowed to freeze by placement of the tubes in &#x02013; 80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and the combined diethyl ether layer was transferred into a new tube. The tubes were placed in a 45&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C water bath for 1&#x000a0;h and at room temperature for an additional 3&#x000a0;h in order to allow the ether to evaporate completely.

Cortisol was measured using commercial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kits (Cayman Chemical, MI, USA).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Water-born cortisol release rate</title><p>Water samples (1&#x000a0;l) were peristaltically pumped at circa 10&#x000a0;ml&#x000a0;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> through a pre-filter (0.45&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m poresize: AcroCap&#x02122;, GelmanSciences, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and then through an activated solid phase extraction cartridge (Sep-pak&#x000ae; Plus C18, Waters, UK). Cartridges were then stored frozen until assayed. Free corticosteroids were subsequently eluted with 4&#x000a0;ml ethyl acetate.

The experimental protocol was based on an unpredictable chronic low intensity stress (UCLIS) protocol, previously developed for the European sea bass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In contrast to the results obtained for the European sea bass, the particular protocol did not affect survival, larvae performance and water cortisol release rates during the <italic>Phase 1</italic> of the experiment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>). In addition, remarkable lower basal cortisol release rates were observed in the present study compared to those of the European sea bass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These differences in the effects of the applied stressors among the two species were expected as a previous comparative study on European sea bass and gilthead sea bream showed that they possess different stress responsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A significant difference was observed regarding skeletal deformities within the flexion group, where a higher percentage of individuals were detected with improperly developed operculum and with deformed spinal cord (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Percentage of individuals within the flexion group with skeletal deformities</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>FF</th><th>FLX</th><th>FINS</th><th>C</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>operculum</td><td>0&#x000a0;%</td><td>6&#x000a0;%</td><td>0&#x000a0;%</td><td>0&#x000a0;%</td></tr><tr><td>skeletal</td><td>6&#x000a0;%</td><td>22&#x000a0;%</td><td>3&#x000a0;%</td><td>3&#x000a0;%</td></tr><tr><td>no swim bladder</td><td>0&#x000a0;%</td><td>0&#x000a0;%</td><td>3&#x000a0;%</td><td>3&#x000a0;%</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>Concerning <italic>Phase 2</italic>, statistically significant differences in total length as well as in body weight for those juveniles that experienced early-life events during the FIN stages were evident (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). However, no effect in whole-trunk cortisol concentrations of juvenile fish was detected, neither prior to nor after exposure to acute stressors (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Higher whole-trunk cortisol concentrations were only found in acute stressed fish compared to fish exposed to minimum and common handling (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, during <italic>Phase 1</italic> the experimental protocol had no effect on water-born cortisol concentrations and on the growth performance of gilthead sea bream larvae. This is in contrast with the case of European sea bass, where first feeding and flexion stages appeared to be more sensitive to the stimuli applied. It therefore appears that the gilthead sea bream is more tolerant than European sea bass to ordinary husbandry and managerial practices during early ontogeny. It has to be noted here, that although water renewal that gradually increased was an improvable parameter, measurements of water-born cortisol concentration in general are more appropriate to be performed in running water (of a given water renewal rate) than in static water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>During <italic>Phase 2,</italic> similar results were observed for both species, as fish, that had experienced an early-life event during the stage of the formation of all fins showed the worst performance. These results indicate that the early-life protocol applied, which is characterized by the unpredictability, variety and moderate intensity of the applied stimuli, provides a relative realistic model to evaluate the impact of daily aquaculture practices on fish performance. In addition, it can be used as a tool to investigate the impact of early-life events and of genome-environmental interactions on important life-history traits and stress-coping strategies at subsequent stages of development, in vertebrates with no perinatal maternal distress and complex parental care behavior.</p><p>With the onset of NGS technologies, transcriptomic information and global gene expression patterns of any organism of interest can be assessed, paving the way to investigate in entire transcriptome changes in relation to specific conditions, treatments or tissues. However, for robust gene expression pattern results, high throughput data are necessary as well as biological replicates. In the present study, three biological replicates from each condition were submitted to high throughput Illumina paired-end sequencing, and strict thresholds were set resulting in a robust data set. To assess differential expression, a reference transcriptome was first constructed comprising a total of 580,011 trinity transcripts (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) with an average length of 1,092&#x000a0;bp. Subsequently paired-end reads of experimental <italic>Phase 1</italic> as well as of <italic>Phase 2</italic> were mapped onto the constructed reference transcriptome (up to ~83&#x000a0;% and up to&#x02009;~&#x02009;74&#x000a0;% respectively, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). RNAseq enables also the detection of multiple transcript variants and thus does not reflect the number of genes of an organism. For further downstream data analysis three dataset with different threshold values were constructed. The fact that all three datasets show the same downstream expression patterns points to the robustness and the reliability of the results obtained<italic>.</italic></p><p>While cortisol measurements as well as total length and body weight did not show any effect when larvae were subjected to the early-life protocol (<italic>Phase 1</italic>), transcriptome analysis revealed differentially expressed transcripts with the developmental stage &#x0201c;all fins&#x0201d; (P1-FINS) separating itself from the other two (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). These results point to the fact that the most diverged phase in term of gene expression pattern during development seems to be at the phase of the development of all fins, which also has an impact later on in development and in particular in juveniles as shown in the expression patterns of <italic>Phase 2.</italic> Obtained expression patterns here showed, that juvenile fish experienced early-life events during the formation of fins (P2_FINS) differ from the other two early-life events (P2_FF and P2_FLX) as well as from the samples without any early-life event (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). This underlines once more the importance of the fin formation stage during the development of the gilthead sea bream.</p><p>In order to further investigate gene expression patterns in relation to stress response, expression values of all significantly expressed transcripts obtained from <italic>Phase 1</italic> and <italic>Phase 2</italic> were submitted to cluster analysis, using hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering, and PCA analysis. In general, the K-means clustering method is recommended when the population of genes to analyze is more than 200 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. To define the number of clusters, hierarchical cluster analysis was performed and agglomeration values were plotted on a scree diagram (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Following the elbow rule the cluster number was determined to be three. The analysis was repeated using K-means analysis with the number of cluster set to three. Cluster membership was corroborated by further discriminant analysis classifying correctly 96.1&#x000a0;% of original grouped cases (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Further PCA analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) showed that transcripts belonging to P1-FINS and P2-FLX were highly correlated to each other. The group belonging to the &#x0201c;acute stress&#x0201d; experiment correlates at PC1 together with P1-FINS and P2-FLX, but differs from them at PC2 and 3. Thus, this may indicate that on the one hand larvae exposed to early-life events during the formation of fins (P1-FINS) have a similar response to stress as juveniles exposed only to acute stress. On the other hand when larvae are exposed to early-life events during the flexion stage, juveniles do not responds much differently than those juveniles exposed only to acute stress (P2-FLX). The only group being close to &#x0201c;acute stress&#x0201d; in all three components is P2-FF, suggesting that the early-life protocol applied during first feeding of the fish has no effect at all on the later life history. P1-FLX and P1-FF are correlated to the second component reflecting similar reaction to early life events either at the first feeding stage or at the stage of flexion. Thus concerning <italic>Phase 1,</italic> again the stage &#x0201c;all fins&#x0201d; is the most diverged one. Concerning <italic>Phase 2,</italic> only when the early-life protocol is applied during the &#x0201c;all fins&#x0201d; stage it has an impact on juveniles. Such stress response revealed in the transcriptome data, presumably reflects impacts of handling upon fish wellbeing, as seen in the growth performance in gilthead sea bream juveniles (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Based on these results, it appears that the molecular response to early-life events (<italic>Phase 1</italic>) is similar when applied at stages FF and FLX, whereas if applied at stage FINS, a different expression pattern is seen. Similar expression patterns were detected for the stages FINS and FLX during <italic>Phase 1</italic> and <italic>Phase 2</italic> respectively. Juveniles exposed to acute stress displayed the most altered expression patterns when they have been exposed to early-life events during the formation of fins (P2-FINS). In contrast, comparable patterns in gene expression were detected in juveniles that had experienced early-life events at the very first larval stage (P2-FF). These results can have implications for the development of aquaculture practices and determine which are the least sensitive stages for conducting handling procedures. To further investigate stress response related genes, expression patterns of transcripts classified after GO ontology to the GO group &#x0201c;stress response&#x0201d; are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. In total, nine transcripts showed a <italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 during the experiment applying acute stress to juveniles without having experienced early-life events (acute). Notably, P1-FF, P1-FLX and P2-FINS again form a group with the latter one separating itself from the former two as in the PCA plot of significantly expressed transcripts. Concerning P1-FINS and P2-FLX they cluster again together in one group, whereas P2-FF clusters to the group comprising P1-FF, P1-FLX and P2-FINS. The expression pattern of acute stress does not cluster to any other group. Looking at the expression pattern illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, it is of interest to pinpoint the orthologous pair of genes annotated by NCBI blastn as proopiomelanocortin, <italic>pomc-a</italic> (HM584909) and <italic>pomc-b</italic> (HM584910). <italic>Pomc-a</italic> orthologs and their differential expression in a tissue panel was first described by Cardoso et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In contrast to the information available at NCBI, Cardoso et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] assigned the accession numbers HM584909 and HM584910 to <italic>pomc-aI</italic> and <italic>pomc-aII</italic>. The paralogous gene to <italic>pomc-a, pomc-b</italic> in the gilthead sea bream was identified for the first time in the present study (transcript id: TR91897|c1_g1_i2), without, however, significant differential expression in any of the stress experiments. The identification of gilthead sea bream <italic>pomc-b</italic> was evaluated by comparative mapping and phylogenetic analysis, which confirmed the identification of the gilthead sea bream <italic>pomc-b</italic> paralog (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). However only <italic>pomc-a</italic> paralogs showed significant differentially expression, which may explain why the <italic>pomc-b</italic> paralog was not identified until now (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Gene network analysis by GeneMANIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] shows physical interactions with melanocortin receptors, vitronectin, agouti related protein, agouti signaling protein and attractin-like 1b only for <italic>pomc-a</italic> and not for <italic>pomc-b</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>)<italic>.</italic> This also supports the hypothesis that only the paralogs <italic>pomc-aI</italic> and <italic>pomc-aII</italic> respond to stress (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) and <italic>pomc-b</italic> most probably underwent sub- or neofunctionalization and thus is involved in pathways other than stress response. Tissue specific expression analysis of the three pomc homologs in African cichlid fishes showed that only the whole brain and embryonic tissue expressed all paralogs of <italic>pomc,</italic> which explains why <italic>pomc-b</italic> was identified in the present study. In addition, it shows that some tissues express only the one of the paralogs (e.g. only <italic>pomc &#x02013;b</italic> was detected in skin<italic>)</italic>, which also pinpoints to a sub- or neofunctionalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Gene tree of the paralogous gene <italic>pomc</italic>. Molecular Phylogenetic analysis conducted in MEGA5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] using Maximum Likelihood method based on the Tamura-Nei model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The analysis involved 31 nucleotide sequences encoding for propiomelanocortin (<italic>pomc</italic>) retrieved from GenBank in a total of 14 species. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site and clearly separates <italic>pomc</italic> paralogs into two main groups, <italic>pomc a</italic> and <italic>pomc b. Pomc a</italic> comprises two subgroups <italic>pomc a-I</italic> and <italic>pomc a-II</italic>. For the gilthead sea bream <italic>pomc-b</italic> was identified in the present study (transcript id: TR91897|c1_g1_i2)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2016_2874_Fig7_HTML" id="MO7"/></fig><fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Gene network.

Gene expression patterns appeared to be more subtle than physiological measurements to detect response in the gilthead sea bream after early-life exposure to mild stimuli, as well as after acute stress. RNAseq analyses further showed the robustness of the experimental set up, and detected distinct expression patterns according to the time point of early-life events during development. It further revealed that juvenile fish are sensitive to the timing of exposure to the early-life protocol during larval development. Based on the data obtained in the present work it can be concluded that applying ordinary mild stimuli very early in development (at first feeding) does not affect performance nor the acute stress response at juvenile stage, whereas when the same events are applied at the phase of flexion or of formation of all fins, the stress response varies with the formation of all fins being the most critical stage during development.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec27"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12864_2016_2874_MOESM1_ESM.jpg" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Experimental set up.
