One promising approach has been to increase the number or activity of brown-like adipocytes in white adipose depots, as this has been shown to prevent diet-induced obesity and reduce the incidence and severity of type 2 diabetes. Thus, the conversion of fat-storing cells into metabolically active thermogenic cells has become an appealing therapeutic strategy to combat obesity. Here, we report a screening platform for the identification of small molecules capable of promoting a white-to-brown metabolic conversion in human adipocytes. We identified two inhibitors of Janus Kinase (JAK) activity with no precedent in adipose tissue biology that stably confer brown-like metabolic activity to white adipocytes. Importantly, these metabolically converted adipocytes exhibit elevated <italic>UCP1</italic> expression and increased mitochondrial activity. We further found that repression of interferon signalling and activation of hedgehog signalling in JAK-inactivated adipocytes contributes to the metabolic conversion observed in these cells. Our findings highlight a novel role for the JAK/STAT pathway in the control of adipocyte function and establish a platform to identify compounds for the treatment of obesity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Mammals possess two distinct types of adipose tissue: white and brown fat. White adipose tissue (WAT) stores excess energy and has a number of endocrine functions such as regulating satiety via leptin secretion. In contrast, brown adipose tissue (BAT) maintains body temperature via non-shivering thermogenesis. BAT releases energy in the form of heat by uncoupling the respiratory chain via uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). In addition to thermogenesis, BAT activation in rodents accelerated plasma clearance of triglycerides, ameliorated insulin resistance and protected against obesity<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Recently, PET/CT imaging revealed adipose tissue with thermogenic activity and UCP1 expression in human adults<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. These studies also found that BAT is inversely associated with adiposity, high body mass index and hyperglycemia. Based on these findings, there has been an increased interest in BAT as a therapeutic target to treat metabolic disorders.</p><p id="P3">Mouse studies have reported the emergence of UCP1-expressing cells in WAT upon cold exposure, &#x003b2;-adrenergic stimulation and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) activation<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, a phenomenon referred to as browning. These brown-like cells arise from the recruitment of specific precursor cells<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and/or the conversion of white into brown-like cells<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Two human trials have also demonstrated de novo generation of brown adipocytes upon cold acclimation combined with increased non-shivering thermogenesis and decreased body fat mass<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. These studies suggest identifying inducers of browning in humans may ameliorate obesity related diseases. To this end, we established a screening platform to discover small molecules capable of promoting white-to-brown metabolic conversion in human adipocytes and identified Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors as molecules with browning potential. In addition, we show that human pluripotent stem cell-derived adipocytes provide a scalable, robust and reliable cell model for adipocyte browning studies, compound screening and drug discovery.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="S1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S2"><title>A screening platform for adipocyte browning identifies inducers of <italic>UCP1</italic></title><p id="P4">We used a human pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived adipocyte model to study the pharmacological conversion of white to brown-like adipocytes. In this approach, adipocytes are obtained via the inducible expression of transcription factors in PSC-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) and the addition of an adipogenic cocktail to the media<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.

We reasoned that <italic>CEBPB</italic> and <italic>PRDM16</italic> could be replaced by small molecules to direct <italic>PPARG2</italic>-expressing MPCs towards a brown-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We monitored the responsiveness of PSC-WA to known modulators of <italic>UCP1</italic> expression<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and observed up-regulation of <italic>UCP1</italic> mRNA levels upon treatment with forskolin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), rosiglitazone and bone morphogenic protein 7 (BMP7), validating the use of PSC-WA for browning assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Utilizing this model we established a screening assay for assessing the conversion of white to brown-like adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). A focused library of 867 small molecules that has a large degree of activity annotation, facilitating deconvolution of mechanism of action was applied at day 7, when cells are differentiating and will adopt a white phenotype if no additional stimulus is applied. Adipocytes were exposed to compounds for 7 days and collected at day 14 for analysis. As a browning index, <italic>UCP1</italic> expression was monitored by <italic>UCP1</italic> mRNA capture plates followed by branched DNA amplification. Expression of fatty acid binding protein 4 (<italic>FABP4</italic>), an adipocyte specific gene, served as internal control to eliminate anti and pro-adipogenic compounds not specific to <italic>UCP1</italic>, such as the PPARG agonist rosiglitazone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, red dot). Out of 135 <italic>UCP1</italic> inducers (see online methods for statistical analysis), 52 compounds induced both <italic>UCP1</italic> and <italic>FABP4</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, blue dots). Among the 83 compounds that induced <italic>UCP1</italic> specifically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, green dots), compounds that induced <italic>UCP1</italic> at least 2 fold were selected as browning hits and compared to rosiglitazone-like compounds in an independent experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). <italic>UCP1</italic> induction by thyroid hormone receptor beta (THRB) agonists and phosphodiesterase enzyme 3 (PDE3) inhibitors is in accordance with previously reported up-regulation of <italic>UCP1</italic> promoter activity by thyroid hormone and cAMP<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Of particular interest, three annotated inhibitors of Spleen Tyrosine Kinase (SYK) and two inhibitors of Janus Kinase 3 (JAK3) showed the highest <italic>UCP1/FABP4</italic> ratio. JAK3 and SYK are best characterized for their role in immune cells development and physiology and as mediators of pro-inflammatory pathways<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Recently, the JAK-STAT pathway was found to modulate early adipogenesis upstream of PPARG but little evidence supported a role in adipose tissue remodeling and thermogenicity<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>A subset of <italic>UCP1</italic>-inducers modulate adipocyte lipid droplet morphology</title><p id="P6">White adipocytes have a single or a few large lipid droplets, whereas the brown adipocytes contain multiple small lipid droplets. We exploited this morphological difference to evaluate the browning effects of newly identified <italic>UCP1</italic>-inducer compounds. Following treatment of PSC-WA with selected compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), we used fluorescent dyes to mark nuclei and lipid droplets, and performed high content imaging to quantify the number and size of lipid droplets per cell. After 7 days of treatment with selected JAK3 and SYK inhibitors, we observed changes in lipid droplet morphology that are typical of brown-like adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Contrastingly, a THRB agonist was inert in this assay despite elevation of <italic>UCP1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>). We determined the lipid area of small (&#x0003c;1070&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>) and large (&#x0003e;1070&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>) droplets per well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, curve graphs) and used the ratio small/large droplet area as a &#x02018;brown-like lipid index&#x02019; for each compound, as exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref> for DMSO, JAK3 inhibitor, SYK inhibitor and THRB agonist. A total of 39 compounds that induced <italic>UCP1</italic> or displayed visible effects on lipid morphology during the browning screen were thereby quantified and ascribed a brown-like lipid index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, Y-axis). When the two browning indices were taken into account, i.e. <italic>UCP1</italic>/<italic>FABP4</italic> and lipid droplet morphology, JAK3 and SYK inhibitors were the most potent browning compounds from our screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). In addition, this analysis revealed that brown-like lipid morphology was poorly correlated with elevated <italic>UCP1</italic> expression, indicating that quantification oflipid droplet size is not a suitable phenotypic readout for adipocyte browning, at least in our system.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Validation of tofacitinib and R406 browning compounds in primary adipocytes</title><p id="P7">As model browning compounds, we selected the JAK3 inhibitor tofacitinib and the SYK inhibitor R406 for their potency in our browning assay and for their clinical relevance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). We examined the dose-response of tofacitinib and R406 in PSC-WA and found that the <italic>UCP1/FABP4</italic> ratio reaches a plateau at 2 &#x003bc;M for tofacitinib and 1 &#x003bc;M for R406 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Graphical representation of <italic>UCP1</italic> and <italic>FABP4</italic> normalized on housekeeping gene revealed a <italic>UCP1</italic>-specific effect of tofacitinib, while R406 induced both <italic>UCP1</italic> and <italic>FABP4</italic> expression when dosed above 1 &#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We confirmed that tofacitinib and R406-mediated increases in <italic>UCP1</italic> mRNA levels translated into accumulation of UCP1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>) and observed concomitant elevation in PRDM16 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Importantly, we validated the effects of tofacitinib and R406 on <italic>UCP1</italic> and <italic>FABP4</italic> expression in lentiviral-free, human primary adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) differentiated according to standard procedures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Tofacitinib and R406 also caused the emergence of brown-like lipid droplet morphologies in ADSC-derived adipocyte cultures and appeared superior to BMP7 in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Finally, we subjected mouse white adipose tissue explants to increasing doses of tofacitinib and R406 and observed up-regulation of <italic>UCP1</italic> expression in explants of sub-cutaneous, but not visceral, origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Tofacitinib and R406 block the JAK-STAT1/3 pathway during adipocyte browning</title><p id="P9">Tofacitinib is a potent inhibitor of signaling through JAK1 and JAK3 with 5-100 fold selectivity over JAK2 in cell-based assays<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. R406 is described as a potent and specific SYK inhibitor, but also targets JAKs, c-kit, Lck, and FLT3 when profiled at 2 &#x003bc;M<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. We sought to determine the pharmacological signature of tofacitinib and R406 in human adipocytes where target abundance and signaling activity might differ from immune cells. First we used RNA sequencing analysis of PSC-WA to evaluate the abundance of known targets of tofacitinib and R406. JAK1 was the most abundantly expressed member of the Janus kinase family, followed by Tyk2, JAK2 and JAK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). The abundance of SYK, c-kit, Lck and FLT3 was below statistical significance suggesting that R406 may exert its browning effect via JAK inhibition.</p><p id="P10">To profile possible downstream targets, PSC-WA were treated with tofacitinib and R406 at the determined &#x02018;browning dose&#x02019; (2 and 1 &#x003bc;M respectively) for 20 minutes and screened by reverse phase protein array (RPPA) covering 51 different phospho-isoforms. RPPA analysis revealed STAT3 as the main downstream target for both tofacitinib and R406 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). While the effect of tofacitinib was restricted to STAT3 in the RPPA panel, R406 had additional downstream targets including AKT, EGFR and ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). We further investigated the effect of tofacitinib and R406 on JAK/STAT, AKT and ERK1/2 pathways by immunoblot analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>, tofacitinib and R406 blocked tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 after 20 minutes, an effect that is exacerbated upon 7 days of treatment. In a dose response experiment, the gradual increase in UCP1 levels negatively correlated with STAT3 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Noticeably, STAT1 protein level decreased after treatment with tofacitinib and R406. Tofacitinib had no effect on AKT and MAPKs, whereas R406 significantly decreased the phosphorylation level of AKT, ERK1 and ERK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). AKT phosphorylation was restored at day 7, suggesting an adaptive response to maintain adipocyte homeostasis and insulin signaling. Phospho-STAT5 was undetectable in our assay and p38 and JNKs were unaltered at both times. Thus, JAK inhibitors likely change <italic>UCP1</italic> expression via a different route than the cAMP/p38 pathway downstream of &#x003b2;3-adrenergic stimulation<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) represses <italic>UCP1</italic> expression in brown adipocytes<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, an effect also observed in PSC-WA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4d</xref>). Since TNF-&#x003b1; can signal through JAK/STAT and ERK pathways, we tested CP-690550 and R406 ability to antagonize TNF-&#x003b1; repression of <italic>UCP1</italic> expression. CP-690550 and R406 partially and fully restored <italic>UCP1</italic> levels respectively, in agreement with the JAK/STAT-specific and JAK/STAT-ERK1/2 effects of each compound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4b</xref>). In addition, the combination of CP-690550 and R406 was not superior to R406 alone in increasing <italic>UCP1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4e</xref>), supporting evidence that CP-690550 and R406 functionally overlap.</p><p id="P12">Finally, we tested Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, and observed up-regulation of <italic>UCP1</italic> expression without significant regulation of <italic>FABP4</italic> with concomitant inhibition of STAT1/3 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Three other JAK1/2 inhibitors, AZD1480, CYT387 and Baricitinib, also showed up-regulation of <italic>UCP1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). A combination of tofacitinib and Ruxolitinib did not further increase <italic>UCP1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>, left panel), unlike a combination of tofacitinib with a THRB agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>, right panel). Altogether, the data highlight a central role for the JAK1/2-STAT1/3 pathway in <italic>UCP1</italic> expression in adipocytes.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Progressive and stable conversion of adipocytes by JAK inhibition</title><p id="P13">Molecules that increase <italic>UCP1</italic> expression by directly activating the <italic>UCP1</italic> promoter<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> may not be suitable for <italic>in vivo</italic> induction of browning or therapeutically useful to combat obesity. Alternative mechanisms of browning such as adipocyte metabolic remodeling are needed, and our screening platform was designed for this purpose. We examined the kinetics of tofacitinib and R406-mediated browning in comparison to THRB agonist, which also ranked in the top-10 best <italic>UCP1</italic> inducers but failed to modify lipid droplet morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

Contrastingly, <italic>UCP1</italic> mRNA levels increased more slowly and progressively in tofacitinib and R406-treated adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>), consistent with remodeling of cellular metabolism rather than direct modulation of <italic>UCP1</italic> promoter activity.</p><p id="P14">If a stable white to brown-like conversion is achieved via JAK inhibition, the brown-like phenotype should persist upon removal of CP-690550 and R406. To test this, we selected 9 inducers of <italic>UCP1</italic> mRNA levels from the original screen and treated PSC-WA with each compound for 7 days, washed with compound-free medium, and maintained in compound-free medium for an additional 14 day-period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Remarkably, all cells pre-treated with JAK inhibitors displayed high levels of <italic>UCP1</italic> mRNA and reduced lipid droplet size at day 28 compared to DMSO-treated cells while all other compounds lost their browning effect after washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b-c</xref>). Finally, we repeated the washout experiment with tofacitinib and R406 and added TNF-&#x003b1; at day 26, 48 hours prior to cells collection. Even in the absence of compounds, adipocytes pre-treated with tofacitinib and R406 maintained higher level of <italic>UCP1</italic> when challenged with TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate that JAK inhibition leads to the stable acquisition of brown-like metabolic properties in human adipocytes.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>JAK-inactivated adipocytes acquire a brown-like metabolic program</title><p id="P15">Brown adipocytes are characterized by high mitochondrial content as well as high metabolic activity<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Mitochondrial content was assessed by determining the ratio of subunit I of Complex IV (COX-I), which is mitochondrial DNA-encoded, on the 70kDa subunit of Complex II (SDH-A), which is nuclear DNA-encoded. Quantification of COX-1 and SDH-A immunoblots showed a significant up-regulation of mitochondrial content in R406 and tofacitinib-treated PSC-WA and ADSC adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). To determine the impact of these changes on metabolic activity, oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured. We found that basal, uncoupled and maximal respiration were increased when PSC-WA and ADSC adipocytes were pre-treated for 7 days with tofacitinib or R406 as compare to a DMSO control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Thermogenesis in brown adipocytes is fuelled by lipid catabolism, which can be measured by release of glycerol from fatty acid. We quantified the level of free glycerol from adipocyte culture medium and observed a ~2.5 fold increase of basal lipolysis in tofacitinib and R406-treated adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>), but no significant increase in forskolin (FSK) stimulated lipolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>).

To examine the contribution of SHH signalling downstream of JAK/STAT inhibition during metabolic browning of adipocytes, PSC-WA were subjected to increasing doses of cyclopamine, a SHH pathway inhibitor, in combination with DMSO, tofacitinib or R406 for 7 days. Addition of cyclopamine did not significantly alter gene expression in DMSO-treated PSC-WA but completely blocked tofacitinib-mediated induction of <italic>UCP1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8c</xref>).

Here, we established a small molecule screen to unravel pharmacologically accessible pathways capable of inducing a brown-like thermogenic program in human adipocytes. We identified tofacitinib and R406 as potent inducers of <italic>UCP1</italic> and via secondary screening established their role in remodeling lipid droplet morphology in human adipocytes. We found that both compounds target the JAK-STAT1/3 pathway in adipocytes and have a distinct progressive and long-lasting effect that confers brown-like metabolic properties to white adipocytes. Our results further highlight important antagonistic interplays between interferon and sonic hedgehog signaling in adipocyte function.</p><p id="P23">Our findings are in line with previously proposed functions of Hedgehog in determining white versus brown adipose cell fate<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. By using the Hedgehog activator Smoothened Agonist (SAG) in various mouse cell lines, Pospisilik <italic>et al.</italic> showed that activation of Hedgehog blocks white, but not brown, adipocyte differentiation and solely in the absence of cAMP and glucocorticoid signaling. In our study, activation of Hedgehog signaling by JAK inhibition occurred in <italic>PPARG2</italic> expressing cells in the presence of cAMP and glucocorticoid signaling and promoted the acquisition of a brown-like metabolic phenotype. It is thus conceivable that activation of Hedgehog signaling after adipogenesis is initiated and during the maturation of white adipocytes may promote the acquisition of brown-like properties. We further demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of Hedgehog decreased <italic>UCP1</italic> expression in genetically programmed BA and brown-like adipocytes. Interestingly, Pospisilik <italic>et al.</italic> reported the up-regulation of <italic>UCP1</italic> mRNA levels in WAT and BAT tissue upon genetic activation of Hedgehog in the aP2-SufuKO mouse, reminiscent of the data presented here upon treatment with tofacitinib and R406. More recently, an antagonistic crosstalk between Hedgehog and IFN&#x003b3; in white adipose tissue has been described, wherein inhibition of Hedgehog signaling by IFN&#x003b3; rescues white adipocyte differentiation<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Our findings further reinforce and refine the role of an IFN-JAK/STAT-SHH axis in human adipocyte biology.

In light of our findings, it will be interesting to investigate the role of TYK2/STAT3 and other JAK/STATs in committed, functional brown adipocytes. A fine tuning of the JAK/STAT pathway at various stages of differentiation and maturation might be key for optimum BAT expansion and metabolic function.</p><p id="P24">The utility of JAK inhibition as a therapeutic for obesity is complicated by the well-described role of this signalling pathway in the immune system. In fact, tofacitinib is currently approved in the United States to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, if one were to envision targeting adipose tissue by <italic>in vivo</italic> administration of an IFN/JAK/STAT inhibitor or similar compound it would almost certainly need to be delivered locally and prevented from spreading systemically or alternatively targeted selectively to white adipocytes. One could also conceive of a cell-based therapy wherein JAK inhibition of patient-derived adipocytes <italic>ex vivo</italic> is followed by transplantation to treat obesity, but this therapeutic modality would need to overcome numerous and significant obstacles before becoming a reality. A further limitation of the current study is the lack of evidence that JAK inhibition would promote metabolic browning <italic>in vivo</italic>, in particular in humans were evidence supporting this phenomenon is scant. Thus, additional research is required before inhibition of IFN/JAK/STAT signalling could be utilized therapeutically for the treatment of metabolic disorders.</p><p id="P25">Recent progress in the development of human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cell -based models of disease have delivered unprecedented tools for basic research and translational medicine.

Mitochondrial biogenesis was profiled by injecting perturbation drugs, 2 &#x003bc;M oligomycin, 0.5 &#x003bc;M CCCP (carbonyl cyanide-<italic>p</italic>-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone) and 5 &#x003bc;M antimycin A, in succession. OCR were determined by plotting the oxygen tension and acidification of the medium in the chamber as a function of time and normalized by protein concentration (picomoles per minute per milligram), respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Lipolysis assay</title><p id="P42">To measure lipolysis activity, DMSO, tofacitinib and R406-treated ADSC adipocytes were starved in DMEM containing 1% FBS for 1 h. Cells were then incubated in HBSS (Hank's balanced salt solution) with 2% fatty-acid-free BSA alone or with 10 &#x003bc;M forskolin. The culture medium was collected for glycerol measurement using the free glycerol reagent (Sigma#F6428). Protein concentrations used to normalize glycerol content were measured using the Bradford protein assay (BioRad). Glycerol release was expressed in micrograms of glycerol per milligram of total protein or the lowest value is set to 1.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>RNA sequencing of adipocyte browning</title><p id="P43">A total of six, 6-well plates were prepared as follow: In each plate, three wells were seeded with PPARG2-MPC, one well with PPARG2/CEBPB/PRDM16-MPC and one well with rtTA-MPC (5&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> cells/well). All cells were induced and differentiated as described above. At day 7, PSC-WA received either DMSO, tofacitinib (2 &#x003bc;M) or R406 (1 &#x003bc;M). PSC-BA and MPC received DMSO only. At day 8, three cell plates were collected by adding 350 ul/well of RLT lysis buffer (Qiagen), constituting the 24h-triplicates. In the remaining three plates, treatment with DMSO, tofacitinib and R406 was repeated at day 10 and 12. At day 14, cells were collected by adding 350 ul/well of RLT lysis buffer (Qiagen), constituting the 7days-triplicates. Total RNA from adipocyte lysate was extracted and purified using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Genomic DNA was removed from the extracted RNA using the RNase Free DNase Set (Qiagen) and purified with RNeasy Minelute Clean up Columns (Qiagen). For all samples high quality RNA was obtained (RIN between 8.1 and 9.8). RNA Sequencing libraries were prepared from 1&#x003bc;g of total RNA using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample preparation Kit v2 (Illumina) following the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing libraries were quantified using the Kapa Library Quantification kit (Kapa Biosystems) and quality controlled by capillary electrophoresis on a Bioanalyzer using High Sensitivity chips (Agilent Technologies). Libraries were sequenced in randomized pools of three or four libraries per lane on a HiSeq2000 sequencer (Illumina) for 2&#x000d7; 50 cycles using version 3 cluster generation kits and version 3 sequencing reagents (Illumina). One % of PhiX control library (Illumina) was spiked into each lane as a sequencing control.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Bioinformatics and statistical analysis of RNAseq data</title><p id="P44">RNA-seq reads were first aligned to human transcriptome, and unmapped reads were then aligned to human genome. Reads that map to annotated genes were modelled by negative binomial distribution, and differential expression was quantified by generalized linear models (GLMs) implemented in the <italic>edgeR</italic> package. For gene-level analysis, the filter for significantly differentially expressed genes was set as |logFC|&#x0003e;=1 (logFC=log fold-change) and FDR&#x0003c;0.05 (Likelihood-ratio test, adjusted with the Benjamini-Hochberg method for multiple testing). The filtering was not necessary for gene-set-level analysis. Gene set analysis was performed with both Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and the CAMERA method. Gene set enrichment score (<italic>ES</italic>) was defined as ES=sign(NES<sub>GSEA</sub>)log10(FDR<sub>GSEA</sub>), namely the sign of normalised enrichment score reported by GSEA (+1 if NES<sub>GSEA</sub>&#x0003e;0, and -1 otherwise), multiplied by log10-transformed false-discovery rate (the q-value). The enrichment score ranges between -4 and 4, corresponding to negatively or positively enriched gene sets that are statistically highly significant (FDR q&#x0003c;=1E-4). Gene sets in use included both pathway information from public repositories, including Reactome, StringDB and NCI-Nature pathway database, and manually curated sets of genes whose expression are regulated by upstream pathways.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>General statistical analyses</title><p id="P45"><italic>Biological replicates</italic> in figure legends refer to independent adipocyte differentiation and treatment, i.e. batch-infected PPARG2-MPCs were seeded in separate wells or dishes, differentiated for 7 days in the absence of compound and matured for another 7 days in the presence of compound. Biological replicates therefore capture the biological variation of stem cell differentiation into mature adipocytes and the cellular response to compound. Repeat experiments performed with different batches of PPARG2 lentiviral particles and MPC infections are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>. <italic>Technical replicates</italic> were replicate measurements of a given sample in readout assays (bDNA, RT-PCR, lipid droplet imaging, glycerol release).
