Although genomic and functional studies are beginning to reveal some of the genetic complexity and underlying pathobiology of ASD, the consistently reported male bias of ASD remains an enigma. We have recently proposed that retinoic acid-related orphan receptor alpha (<italic>RORA</italic>), which is reduced in the brain and lymphoblastoid cell lines of multiple cohorts of individuals with ASD and oppositely regulated by male and female hormones, might contribute to the sex bias in autism by differentially regulating target genes, including <italic>CYP19A1</italic> (aromatase), in a sex-dependent manner that can also lead to elevated testosterone levels, a proposed risk factor for autism.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this study, we examine sex differences in RORA and aromatase protein levels in cortical tissues of unaffected and affected males and females by re-analyzing pre-existing confocal immunofluorescence data from our laboratory. We further investigated the expression of <italic>RORA</italic> and its correlation with several of its validated transcriptional targets in the orbital frontal cortex and cerebellum as a function of development using RNAseq data from the BrainSpan Atlas of the Developing Human Brain. In a pilot study, we also analyzed the expression of <italic>Rora</italic> and the same transcriptional targets in the cortex and cerebellum of adult wild-type male and female C57BL/6 mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Our findings suggest that <italic>Rora/RORA</italic> and several of its transcriptional targets may exhibit sexually dimorphic expression in certain regions of the brain of both mice and humans. Interestingly, the correlation coefficients between <italic>Rora</italic> expression and that of its targets are much higher in the cortex of male mice relative to that of female mice. A strong positive correlation between the levels of RORA and aromatase proteins is also seen in the cortex of control human males and females as well as ASD males, but not ASD females.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Based on these studies, we suggest that disruption of <italic>Rora</italic>/<italic>RORA</italic> expression may have a greater impact on males, since sex differences in the correlation of <italic>RORA</italic> and target gene expression indicate that RORA-deficient males may experience greater dysregulation of genes relevant to ASD in certain brain regions during development.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/2040-2392-6-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Autism</kwd><kwd><italic>RORA</italic> expression</kwd><kwd>Transcriptional targets</kwd><kwd>Sex differences</kwd><kwd>Postmortem brain tissues</kwd><kwd>Mouse brain</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that are diagnosed on the basis of impaired social interactions and communication, especially social reciprocity, and the presence of aberrant, repetitive, and stereotyped behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Because of the strong heritability of ASD based on monozygotic twin and sibling studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], there have been extensive searches for genetic mutations and variations that may cause ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. To date, there are hundreds to thousands of genes that are considered autism candidate or susceptibility genes in the autism gene databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], with the number of genes continually growing. However, the combined genetic variations account for only approximately 20% of the cases, with no single gene or genetic variation associated with more than 1% of the cases. Thus, the etiology of the majority of ASD cases is still unknown.</p><p>Interestingly, ASD is consistently reported as having a higher incidence (approximately 4:1) in males than in females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Yet, the mechanism for the sex bias is unknown. Several hypotheses for the sex bias in ASD include: (1) genetic mechanisms which might involve (a) genes on the X or Y chromosomes; (b) skewed X-inactivation, (c) sex-specific imprinting defects on either the X chromosome or autosomes; (2) the extreme male brain hypothesis which posits that elevated fetal testosterone is a risk factor for ASD; and (3) gene-environment interactions that predispose an individual to ASD. All of these hypotheses have been comprehensively described in several recent reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. To date, none of these hypotheses, discussed briefly in the next paragraph, have been either proven or disproven. Given the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of ASD, it is possible that each of these mechanisms for sex bias may apply to specific cohorts of individuals with ASD. What is clear, however, is that a validated mechanism for sex bias will reveal a fundamental process inherent to the core biology of ASD.</p><p>With regard to genetic mechanisms for sex bias, there are a few candidate genes for ASD on the sex chromosomes, but the reported genetic variations in them cannot account for the majority of cases. On the other hand, the extreme male brain hypothesis proposed by Baron-Cohen and colleagues focuses on elevated testosterone levels as a risk factor for ASD. This hypothesis has been investigated primarily by correlating autistic behaviors and traits with fetal testosterone levels in amniotic fluid during gestation of the individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. More recently, this group has investigated differences in brain morphology linked to circulating testosterone levels in adults. Their studies demonstrated both morphological and volumetric changes in the brain that are both sex-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] as well as dependent on diagnosis of ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Direct investigation of the third hypothesis regarding gene by environment (GxE) interactions that may predispose an individual to ASD has been hampered by lack of knowledge regarding the genes that may be involved and the environmental factors that are relevant to ASD. We suggest that the reciprocal regulatory interaction between retinoic acid-related orphan receptor alpha (<italic>RORA</italic>) and sex hormones which includes RORA-mediated transcriptional regulation of <italic>CYP19A1</italic>, described below, may be a candidate for GxE interactions that modulate risk for ASD.</p><p>Our recent integrative genomic analyses of ASD involving gene expression and methylation profiling of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) from monozygotic twins and pairs of siblings discordant for autism diagnosis revealed the dysregulated expression of many genes in ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], some of which have been associated with aberrant methylation of the gene promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. One of the downregulated and hypermethylated genes was the nuclear receptor <italic>RORA</italic>. Further analysis of this gene (which exhibits steroid hormone receptor binding sites in its promoter region) revealed that its expression was upregulated by estradiol but downregulated by the androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Moreover, RORA was shown to transcriptionally regulate <italic>CYP19A1,</italic> a gene coding for aromatase, an enzyme that converts testosterone to estradiol. This intriguing relationship between RORA and sex hormones led us to propose a model in which RORA deficiency may lead to an elevation of testosterone and depletion of estradiol through suppression of <italic>CYP19A1</italic> expression. This model provides a plausible biochemical explanation for the elevated testosterone levels seen in studies by the Baron-Cohen group. It also suggests a more direct mechanism for the sex bias in ASD in which normal females, with higher estrogen levels, might exhibit higher expression of <italic>RORA</italic>, thus buffering against agents that induce RORA deficiency. This model further predicts that during development, <italic>RORA</italic> expression may be sexually dimorphic at least in some regions of the brain.</p><p>This pilot study was undertaken to examine the possibility of sex differences in the expression of <italic>RORA</italic> in several brain regions at different stages of development of the normal human brain using RNAseq data from the BrainSpan Atlas. In addition, sex differences in RORA and aromatase protein levels were investigated by reanalysis of our published confocal immunofluorescence data from the cortex of both male and female controls and age-matched male and female ASD donors. To reduce heterogeneity in the expression patterns due to the genetics as well as age of the brain donors, we also conducted expression analyses of the cortex and cerebellum of a strain of mice at 3&#x000a0;months of age. Together, these studies suggest sexual dimorphism in the expression of <italic>RORA/Rora</italic> in some brain regions during certain stages of development as well as a high correlation with the expression of its target genes, especially <italic>CYP19A1</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Re-analysis of pre-existing confocal immunofluorescence data from tissue arrays</title><p>Data from a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] employing confocal immunofluorescence to quantitate protein levels of RORA and aromatase on a tissue array containing specimens of the frontal cortex of ASD cases and age-matched controls were reanalyzed on the basis of gender.

Here, we reanalyze the confocal immunofluorescence data from age-matched male (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;9) and female (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;8) controls and show that there is a nominally higher level (1.22-fold) of RORA protein in females relative to males (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Similarly, the female-to-male (F/M) ratio for aromatase is 1.21. However, these modest differences are not statistically significant (two-tailed <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e;0.47 for RORA).

In addition, we investigated the correlation of <italic>RORA</italic> (or <italic>Rora</italic>) expression with several of its validated transcriptional targets in the same brain regions. For this study, we evaluated data for potential sex differences in <italic>RORA/Rora</italic> expression and/or its correlation with the expression of the transcriptional target genes from four sources: (1) our published confocal immunofluorescence analyses of tissue arrays containing cortical specimens from both male and female donors with ASD and age-matched controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]; (2) our prior gene expression analyses on frozen postmortem brain tissues from male controls and ASD donors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]; (3) the collection of RNAseq data from the BrainSpan Atlas of the Developing Human Brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]; and (4) <italic>de novo</italic> expression analyses of <italic>Rora</italic> and the orthologous target genes in mouse brain tissues.</p><p>Although there was suggestive evidence for sexually dimorphic expression of <italic>RORA</italic> (F/M ratio approximately 1.2 - 1.4) in the human frontal cortex, these sex differences were not statistically significant. The lack of significance for sex differences in <italic>RORA</italic> expression may not be surprising given the genetic heterogeneity of human donors and the limited number of tissues available for analyses. In this regard, the effect sizes for sex and ASD influences on <italic>RORA</italic> expression and protein levels in the frontal cortex may be more informative because they are independent of sample size. Notably, the effect size for RORA protein level in male ASD cases vs. controls is lower (0.22) than the effect size for the female case&#x02013;control comparison (0.36) (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This difference suggests a smaller effect of ASD on RORA levels in males than in females, which may reflect a lower basal level of RORA in unaffected males relative to that in unaffected females. Interestingly, the effect size is virtually zero (0.01) for sex differences in RORA protein in ASD cases (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), suggesting that both males and females affected by ASD have a comparably low level of RORA protein in the frontal cortex. In addition, the effect size for sex differences in <italic>RORA</italic> expression in the OFC of control males and females is at least 0.6 (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Thus, several determinations of effect size suggest that there may be a modest difference in the expression of <italic>RORA</italic> in the frontal cortex of control males and females which vanishes in males and females with ASD.</p><p>Perhaps of more relevance to the sex bias in ASD are sex differences in the correlation of <italic>RORA</italic> expression with that of some of its target genes in both the cortex and cerebellum. Studies with wild-type adult male and female C57BL/6 mice lend support to the existence of sex differences in <italic>RORA</italic> expression in the cortex and its correlation with target gene expression in these two brain regions. However, although the correlations between cortical expression of <italic>Rora</italic> and that of its transcriptional targets are higher in male mice in comparison to female mice, the analogous correlations using RNAseq data for human tissues are more complex and dependent on target gene and developmental period. It is also possible that the variability in correlations for human tissues is in part due to the genetic heterogeneity of the brain donors as well as the fact that the majority of age-matched samples used for the <italic>RORA</italic>-target expression correlations are not from the same donors. This donor disparity in the BrainSpan Atlas is in contrast to the samples involved in the confocal immunofluorescence and gene expression analyses performed by our laboratory, in which correlations of protein or gene expression levels (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, respectively) were determined for RORA and targets in the same samples, resulting in consistently higher and positive correlations. The following sections first highlight the principal findings of this study, and then discuss the implications of these findings with respect to the potential contribution of <italic>RORA</italic> to the sex bias and pathobiology of ASD.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Comparison of RORA and aromatase protein levels in the frontal cortex</title><p>Although there were no statistically significant sex differences in RORA and aromatase protein levels in the cortical specimens on the tissue array (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), the correlation analyses show that the protein levels for both RORA and aromatase in ASD cases (age-matched females and males) fall at the lower end of the range of protein levels for control females and males (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). However, the correlation between these protein levels is higher for ASD males than for ASD females, which may relate to sex differences in the response to RORA deficiency. Notably, there is a greater percent reduction in aromatase protein in ASD males in comparison to ASD females, suggesting that females may be better able to offset aromatase deficiency caused by RORA deficiency through compensatory mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Correlation of gene expression levels in the frontal cortex</title><p>Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> reveals a significantly high correlation between the expression of <italic>RORA</italic> and that of <italic>CYP19A1</italic> (the gene coding for aromatase) in frozen postmortem cortical tissues from both control and ASD males. This high correlation at the level of gene expression thus reflects the high correlation seen at the protein level for male cases and controls. The strong and positive correlation between CYP19A1 and RORA protein levels suggests that a deficiency in aromatase is likely to result in higher testosterone (and lower estradiol) levels in the presence of RORA deficiency. Physiological disturbances in either of these hormones during critical periods of development may result in impaired neurological development and function, as discussed later.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Analysis of RNAseq data for RORA and several of its transcriptional targets in the orbital frontal cortex (OFC) and cerebellum</title><p>RNAseq data from the BrainSpan Atlas was used as an experimental tool to explore sexually dimorphic expression of <italic>RORA</italic> and that of its target genes in different human brain regions across different developmental periods. Although there were no statistically significant sex differences in <italic>RORA</italic> expression in the OFC and cerebellum (Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), there was a suggestively higher expression (and a correspondingly larger effect size) in the OFC of adult females in comparison to age-matched males, with an F/M ratio comparable to that observed for RORA protein in the frontal cortex (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Of potentially greater interest are the sex differences in the correlation between <italic>RORA</italic> expression and that of its transcriptional targets, specifically <italic>A2BP1 (RBFOX1)</italic>, <italic>ITPR1</italic>, and <italic>NLGN1</italic>, summarized in Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. However, the sex-dependent correlations are complex, being dependent on both brain region and period of development. In the OFC before birth where the expression of <italic>RORA</italic> is very low (approximately 10% of that in the cerebellum), there is virtually no correlation between <italic>RORA</italic> expression and that of any of the three target genes in either females or males. This suggests that RORA may not play a major role in the prenatal development of this brain region, in contrast to the critical role of RORA in development of the cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], where the level of <italic>RORA</italic> expression is consistently high in both males and females across all developmental stages. The correlation patterns in the cerebellum are also different from the OFC, with females exhibiting significantly high correlations between <italic>RORA</italic> expression and that of the target genes through age 18, while the correlation pattern is more variable for males (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>), with each target gene showing a high correlation in at least one developmental period. Because some of this variability may be due to the mismatch of tissue donors (though age-matched) for the RNAseq studies which may confound correlation analyses, we performed gene expression analyses of <italic>Rora</italic> and the orthologous target genes in the cortex and cerebellum of a strain of adult male and female mice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Sexually dimorphic expression of Rora and its transcriptional targets in the mouse brain</title><p>The strongest evidence for sexually dimorphic expression of <italic>RORA</italic> in the brain is provided by the pilot studies using wild-type adult male and female C57BL/6 mice. Here, we show sex-dependent differences in the cortical expression of <italic>Rora</italic> and two of its transcriptional targets, <italic>Cyp19a1</italic> and <italic>Nlgn1</italic>, with expression of all three being significantly higher in females, which is also consistent with the large effect sizes for these genes. Power analyses, based on the expression data for these three genes, indicate sufficient power (&#x02265;0.98) to detect significant differences, even with only three mice per group. In part, these results using genetically homogeneous female and male mice support the sex differences in RORA protein that were suggested by our confocal immunofluorescence analyses of postmortem tissue specimens from the frontal cortex of males and females as well as that suggested by RNAseq data from the OFC of donors &#x02265;19&#x000a0;years of age. However, there were no significant differences in <italic>Rora</italic> and target gene expression in the mouse cerebellum, mirroring the results of our analyses of the RNAseq data from the human cerebellum.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Correlation of Rora and target gene expression in the mouse brain</title><p>Unlike the variable correlations of <italic>RORA</italic> and target gene expression in the brain of genetically heterogeneous human males and females, the correlations derived from the adult male and female mouse brain may be more informative and relevant to sex differences that potentially impact brain function. Interestingly, the correlation coefficients are high between <italic>Rora</italic> and all targets (including <italic>Cyp19a1</italic>) in the male cortex but variable and generally lower in the female cortex (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>Rora</italic>-target gene correlations in the cerebellum are comparably high for both males and females with respect to all targets except for <italic>A2bp1</italic> in females (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). Based on the more than 2,500 putative transcriptional targets of RORA that were identified by our previous chromatin immunoprecipitation-promoter chip hybridization (ChIP-on-chip) analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], the higher correlation between the expression levels of <italic>Rora</italic> and each of its transcriptional targets suggests that Rora deficiency may have a greater impact on neurological development and function in males than in females, especially in the cortex. This is particularly relevant since over 400 of the identified transcriptional targets of RORA are listed in SFARI Gene and AutismKB databases as autism candidate/susceptibility genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Moreover, RORA and estrogen receptor (ER) are both nuclear receptors that share the same DNA consensus binding sites and regulate the transcription of some of the same genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Thus, the higher concentration of estrogen, which has been demonstrated even in prepubescent females versus age-matched males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], may offset the loss of transcriptional control due to RORA deficiency by activating ER-mediated transcription, resulting in a lesser impact on neurological development in females. Also intriguing is the strong negative correlation coefficient between <italic>Rora</italic> and <italic>Cyp19a1</italic> expression levels in female mice. In contrast to the expected increase in <italic>Cyp19a1</italic> (aromatase) expression with increasing <italic>Rora</italic> expression which is seen in males, it is possible that aromatase expression <italic>in vivo</italic> is instead tightly regulated to maintain estrogen homeostasis (that is, to prevent overproduction of estrogen) in females under normal conditions. Such homeostatic regulation of estrogen in females is particularly important inasmuch as RORA and ER share overlapping transcriptional targets.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Complex regulation of <italic>RORA</italic>expression in the brain</title><p>Regardless of sex differences, the underlying mechanisms driving regional and developmental differences in <italic>RORA</italic> expression, such as those seen in the OFC, are unclear. Recently, we described differential recruitment of co-regulator proteins that are involved in the sex hormone-dependent regulation of <italic>RORA</italic> in the SH-SY5Y neuronal cell model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. We demonstrated that estrogen-mediated upregulation of <italic>RORA</italic> expression required both the estrogen receptor (ER-alpha) and the coactivator NCOA5, while androgen (DHT)-mediated downregulation of <italic>RORA</italic> required the androgen receptor (AR) and the corepressor function of SUMO1. Thus, the regional and temporal patterns of <italic>RORA</italic> expression in males and females during development may reflect both the tissue-dependent and developmental patterns of co-regulator and/or sex hormone receptor expression in the respective brain regions. Likewise, transcriptional regulation of target genes by RORA, a nuclear receptor whose function requires interaction with co-regulator proteins, is also dependent on the regional and temporal patterns of co-regulator expression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>A model connecting <italic>RORA</italic>to the sex bias in autism</title><p>Based on our previous studies showing the reciprocal regulatory relationship between RORA and the sex hormones, we proposed a mechanistic model in which RORA deficiency may biochemically explain the increase in testosterone in ASD, which has been reported by Baron-Cohen and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The strong correlation between RORA and aromatase protein and gene expression levels in the human brain from our earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and this study lends support to this model explaining, in part, the higher testosterone levels associated with some cases of ASD. However, the question regarding a direct role for RORA in the sex bias of ASD remains unresolved since there were no significant sex differences in <italic>RORA</italic> expression, despite a marginally higher level of <italic>RORA</italic> expression in the frontal cortex of normal adult females. Indeed, whether a 20% to 40% higher level of <italic>RORA</italic> expression in females can protect against genetically, physiologically, or environmentally-induced RORA deficiency during critical periods of development remains to be determined, possibly by using gene-knockdown animal models. It is noted that the levels of RORA protein in the cortex of male and female individuals with ASD are quite similar (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), perhaps reinforcing the idea of a &#x02018;higher threshold for ASD in females&#x02019; which may include greater tolerance to RORA deficiency down to a level at which some of the pathobiological processes associated with ASD are triggered. At present, it is unclear what the functional consequences might be for sex differences in <italic>RORA</italic> expression, particularly in the adult OFC. However, given the known neuroprotective function of RORA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], it is worth noting that the reported volume of the OFC is greater in female than in male adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. With respect to sex bias in ASD, perhaps of more importance than <italic>RORA</italic> expression <italic>per se</italic> is the correlation between <italic>RORA</italic> expression and that of its transcriptional targets, the functions of which are described in the next section.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>RORA, a molecular link between sex hormones, neurodevelopment, and autism pathobiology</title><p>The involvement of sex hormones in brain development has been well-documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], yet the precise molecular mechanisms through which the hormones affect neuronal processes, such as neurogenesis, neuron migration, synaptogenesis, synaptic plasticity, axon guidance, and dendrite formation, are not well understood. Equally unclear are the mechanisms through which the sex hormones (in particular estradiol) mediate the observed sexually dimorphic effects on dendritic spine formation and synaptogenesis in certain brain regions during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. A reasonable assumption is that these hormones act through their respective hormone receptors. However, although there is little evidence for genetic or functional alterations of the primary estrogen and androgen receptors (ER&#x003b1; and AR) in a significant number of ASD cases, homeostatic imbalance of their circulating hormones (for example, through altered aromatase expression) will inevitably alter receptor activation.</p><p>We suggest that RORA may be a molecular link between the sex hormones and neurodevelopment as well as a mediator of at least some of the pathobiological processes associated with autism. While RORA is a known regulator of circadian rhythm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] which in turn has been linked to synaptic regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], it is also a nuclear hormone receptor that is involved in the transcriptional regulation of many genes in different tissues, thus exhibiting tissue-dependent pleiotropic effects. In a neuronal cell model, we have demonstrated that RORA can bind to the promoter regions of over 2,500 genes, 438 of which are included in autism gene databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Gene ontology analyses of the putative gene targets of RORA revealed significant overrepresentation of genes involved in neuronal differentiation, neuron projection morphogenesis, axonogenesis, and axon guidance. We validated six transcriptional targets of RORA (<italic>A2BP1</italic>, <italic>CYP19A1</italic>, <italic>HSD17B10</italic>, <italic>ITPR1</italic>, <italic>NLGN1</italic>, and <italic>NTRK2</italic>) and, in this study, investigated the correlation between the expression of <italic>RORA</italic> and that of four of these targets in both the human and mouse brain. With regard to functional relevance, <italic>A2BP1</italic>, also known as <italic>RBFOX1</italic>, codes for a neuron-specific splicing factor associated with synaptic transmission, neurodevelopment, and developmental delay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>A2BP1/RBFOX1</italic> has been recently highlighted by a whole exome sequencing study as an evolutionarily constrained gene that regulates the splicing of a large number of other genes identified with high-confidence as ASD risk genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Interestingly, this study, which utilized a novel statistical model that integrated transmission and <italic>de novo</italic> association (TADA) analyses, also identified NLGN1 as one of the synaptic proteins encoded by the TADA genes, which included a number of other still unvalidated transcriptional targets of RORA (specifically, <italic>ANK2</italic>, <italic>APH1A</italic>, <italic>CACNA1D</italic>, <italic>HOMER</italic>, <italic>MYO9B</italic>, <italic>NR3C2</italic>, and <italic>TRIO</italic>). These strong genetic associations of putative RORA targets with ASD risk further suggest that RORA deficiency may have a large impact on neuronal functions disrupted in autism. Other neurologically relevant validated targets of RORA include ITPR1, a calcium signaling molecule involved in synaptogenesis, plasticity, dendritic contact, and long-term depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], and NTRK2, a neurotrophin kinase also involved in axon guidance, synaptogenesis, plasticity, mood disorder, and learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. On the other hand, <italic>CYP19A1</italic> and <italic>HSD17B10</italic> both code for metabolic enzymes involved in the conversion of testosterone to estradiol, suggesting that RORA deficiency may inhibit both biochemical pathways, thus exacerbating the expected increase in testosterone or depletion of estradiol. At present, it is not known what homeostatic mechanisms might restore the hormonal balance when both of these pathways are inhibited. Moreover, although our model predicts that testosterone levels would increase when RORA (and aromatase) are decreased, there is no information to date on the sex hormone levels in brain tissues that are RORA-deficient. It should be mentioned that, although the sex hormone status and possible hormonal imbalance in the heterozygous staggerer (Rora<sup>+/sg</sup>) mouse has been discussed at length by Doulazmi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], our study on the regulation of <italic>RORA</italic> by sex hormones as well as the regulation of <italic>CYP19A</italic>1 by RORA only recently demonstrated these associations in a neuronal cell model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. With respect to neurological functions, <italic>CYP19A1</italic> (aromatase) is associated with neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity, and social cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], while <italic>HSD17B10</italic> is associated with mitochondrial integrity, mental retardation, and language impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], therefore extending the impact of their dysregulation beyond endocrine metabolism. Thus, the neuronal activities and high level neurological functions associated with these validated transcriptional targets of RORA suggest a mechanism for induction of autism brain pathology driven by sex hormones under conditions of RORA deficiency. Finally, we suggest that RORA deficiency may be the direct result of genetic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] and epigenetic modifications of <italic>RORA</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and/or gene-environment interactions. With respect to GxE interactions, <italic>RORA</italic> expression may be dysregulated by intrinsic metabolic or physiological conditions (for example, sex hormone imbalance due to alterations in the steroid hormone biosynthetic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]) or by extrinsic environmental factors, such as endocrine disrupting compounds, which are known to interfere with normal hormonal signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p>While this exploratory study provides suggestive evidence for sexually dimorphic expression of <italic>RORA</italic> in certain brain regions during development, the major limitation is a lack of sufficient postmortem brain samples to reveal statistically significant expression differences between males and females. Power analyses, based on the human data reported in this study, indicate that at least 121 samples per group would be necessary to significantly detect a 20% difference in the level of <italic>RORA</italic> expression between males and females with a power of 0.8. The lack of sufficient samples is further compounded by the need to divide the available samples into subgroups to evaluate sex-dependent differences in gene expression across development.</p><p>Another confounding factor is the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of the brain donors as there is ample evidence that genetics influences gene expression which, in turn, controls phenotype. Indeed, aside from not having ASD or any other diagnosed neurodevelopmental disorder, the behavioral phenotypes of the control brain donors are unknown. This pilot study using BrainSpan data will help to direct attention to certain brain regions and developmental stages in which sex differences in the expression of <italic>RORA</italic> and/or regulation of its target genes are suggested. This study also suggests that any study of sex-dependent differences in gene expression in the brain must take into account both regional and developmental changes in gene expression.</p><p>Regarding the issue of genetic heterogeneity, mouse strains are much more homogeneous with respect to genotype, but individual expression differences are still apparent even within a strain. Some of these differences, especially in post-pubertal females, may be due to hormonal cycling, so future studies on sex differences in gene expression should utilize more hormonally-synchronized female mice. At present, it is not possible to predict how estrous synchronization of female mice would affect sex hormone levels in the brain and the impact on neuronal expression of <italic>Rora</italic>. It is further noted that the effects of sex steroids in the brain are also mediated by the local synthesis of neurosteroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], and may not be directly correlated to circulating hormonal levels. Interestingly, there is greater variance in <italic>RORA</italic> expression among the brain tissue samples from human females included in this study, especially in the later stages of development. In analogy to studies with human brain tissues, studies using animal models to study sex differences in gene expression should also include different brain regions and developmental periods.</p><p>Finally, despite the obvious advantages of studying sex-dependent differences in gene expression in an animal model where genotype and other physiological conditions can be better controlled to reduce heterogeneity, it should be kept in mind that regulation of gene expression in the human brain is likely to be much more complex than in mouse brain. This complexity is in part suggested by the differences in correlation coefficients for the expression of <italic>RORA/Rora</italic> and its respective target genes in male humans and male mice, where the correlation coefficients are generally higher in the mouse. Some of these differences may be due to species-dependent differential expression and recruitment of co-regulators or hormone receptors, and/or species differences in epigenetic regulation and alternative splicing.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Through analyses of pre-existing confocal immunofluorescence and gene expression data from our laboratory and publicly available RNAseq data, we present suggestive evidence that <italic>RORA</italic> may exhibit sex-dependent differences in gene expression in the human brain that are dependent on both brain region as well as stage of development. Significant sex differences in <italic>Rora</italic> and target gene expression are more readily observed in the cortex of a genetically homogeneous mouse model. With respect to gene expression in the mouse cortex, the stronger correlation between <italic>Rora</italic> and target gene expression in male mice in comparison to female mice suggests that Rora deficiency may have a greater impact on downstream events affecting neurological development and function in males in comparison to females. While sex differences in the correlation of <italic>RORA</italic> expression with that of its gene targets in the human brain are more complex, the consistently strong correlation between RORA and CYP19A1 protein and gene expression levels in our small number of postmortem human samples supports our proposed model for the involvement of RORA deficiency in the higher testosterone levels associated with increased risk for ASD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec26"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="13229_2014_162_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Additional file 1: <bold>Samples and data from confocal immunofluorescence analyses.</bold> Demographic and mean fluorescence data for tissue samples analyzed by confocal immunofluorescence.
