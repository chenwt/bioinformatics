However, half of AML cases do not contain the well-known aberrations detectable mostly by cytogenetic analysis, and these cases are classified as normal karyotype AML. Different outcomes of normal karyotype AML suggest that this subgroup of AML could be genetically heterogeneous. But lack of genetic markers makes it difficult to further study this subgroup of AML. Using paired-end RNAseq method, we performed a transcriptome analysis in 45 AML cases including 29 normal karyotype AML, 8 abnormal karyotype AML and 8 AML without karyotype informaiton. Our study identified 134 fusion transcripts, all of which were formed between the partner genes adjacent in the same chromosome and distributed at different frequencies in the AML cases. Seven fusions are exclusively present in normal karyotype AML, and the rest fusions are shared between the normal karyotype AML and abnormal karyotype AML. <italic>CIITA</italic>, a master regulator of MHC class II gene expression and truncated in B-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin disease, is found to fuse with <italic>DEXI</italic> in 48% of normal karyotype AML cases. The fusion transcripts formed between adjacent genes highlight the possibility that certain such fusions could be involved in oncological process in AML, and provide a new source to identify genetic markers for normal karyotype AML.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study is supported by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, RC1CA145889 (S.M.W., J.D.R., M.Q.Z.).The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a major type of leukemia, with estimated 13,780 new cases and 10,200 death in the United States in 2012 (American Cancer Society, 2012, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.org/Research/CancerFactsFigures/CancerFactsFigures/cancer-facts-figures-2012">http://www.cancer.org/Research/CancerFactsFigures/CancerFactsFigures/cancer-facts-figures-2012</ext-link>).

These AML cases are classified into a subgroup named normal karyotype AML as they lack specific markers for further classification. The variation of treatment response and prognosis of normal karyotype AML suggests that this subgroup of AML can be heterogeneous with different genetic aberrations. Indeed, mutations in several genes including <italic>CEBPA</italic>, <italic>FLT3</italic>, <italic>IDH1</italic>, <italic>MLL</italic>, and <italic>NPM1</italic>, and alternated expression of AF1q have been identified in the normal karyotype AML, and the potential value of these changes for clinical applications are under investigation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051203-Mrzek1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051203-Schlenk1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051203-Strunk1">[9]</xref>.

Therefore, identification of recurrent genetic mutations in nomal karyotype AML remains a challenging task.</p><p>Genetic aberrations could be examined at the levels of genomic DNA, transcription or translation. As the genomic DNA structure in normal karyotype AML is intact as revealed by cytogenetic and genome sequencing data, an alternative approach to search for potential aberrations in normal karyotype AML could be at the level of transcription. To investigate this possibility, we used the next generation sequencing-based paired-end RNAseq method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051203-Wang1">[13]</xref> to detect potential fusion transcripts in a group of normal karyotype AML cases.

Three well-known fusions in AML were identified in four abnormal karyotype AML cases, including <italic>RUNX1</italic>-<italic>RUNX1T1</italic> fusion in two cases [46,XXt(8;21)(q22;q22); 46,XYt(8;21)(q22;q22)], <italic>MLL</italic>-<italic>MLLT1</italic> fusion in one case [48,XX,+8,+8,i(8)(q10)/49,idem,+i(8)(q10)] and <italic>MLL</italic>-<italic>MLLT3</italic> fusion in one case [46,XY,t(9;11;11)(p22;q23;p11.2)]. The detection of these three known fusions shows the sensitivity of the paired-end RNAseq and the mapping programs used for the analysis. Under the threshold that a fusion must be detected by at least two pairs of fusion sequences and in at least two AML cases, a total of 134 fusions were identified in the 45 AML samples used in the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051203-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

Considering that there are two partner genes involved in each fusion, a question remains whether only one or both partner genes drove the fusion transcription. In the former case, only one strand should be used as the transcription template resulting in either sense or antisense transcripts; in the latter case, both strands should be used as transcription templates resulting in both sense and antisense transcripts. RNAseq sequences collected by the standard RNAseq method can identify the fusion junction but can not discriminate the original strand used for fusion transcription, and regular RT-PCR using only antisense primer for reverse transcription as used in our validation experiment above can only validate the transcripts from one DNA strand. To address this issue, we performed strand-specific RT-PCR using sense primer and antisense primer separately for reverse transcription. We used RNA samples from 8 myeloid leukemia-derived cell lines (KG-1, THP-1, Molm-13, Molm-14, MV4-11, HL-60, Kasumi-1, and Kasumi-6) to overcome the shortage of patient RNA samples for the analysis, and we selected 12 fusions for the test. The results confirmed that each fusion was expressed in at least one of the cell lines, and determined that 86% of fusion transcripts (68 out of 79 positive reactions in the total of 96 reactions) were transcribed from both sense and antisense strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051203-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). For example, sense and antisense transcripts for one of the two <italic>CIITA-DEXI</italic> fusions were expressed in 7 out of 8 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051203-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).

We used long-range PCR to amplify the mapped genomic region between the partner genes to know if there is a genomic structural change as reflected by the size difference of the amplified region comparing to the reference genome sequences. Of the 11 successfully amplified genomic DNA fragments, 6 have the sizes similar to and 5 have the sizes shorter than their corresponding regions in the reference genome sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051203-g005">Figure 5</xref>). For example, the size between <italic>IL17RB-ACTR8</italic> fusion is 4,044 bp in the reference genome sequences whereas the size of the amplified genomic fragment in AML is about 4 kb, suggesting that this fusion was generated by post-transcriptional process rather than genomic structural change; in the case of <italic>CLR-CLEC2D</italic> fusion, the size in the reference genome sequences is 31 kb but the size of the amplified genomic fragment has only 8 kb. This fusion transcript is likely caused by genomic DNA deletion between the two partner genes. The results indicate that both genomic structural change and post-transcriptional processing can contribute to the fomation of the detected fusion transcripts.</p><fig id="pone-0051203-g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0051203.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Long-range PCR results.</title><p>A.

We compared the fusions identified in normal karyotype AML with the fusions identified by these studies. Five fusions (<italic>XPA-NCBP1</italic>, <italic>HARS2-ZMAT2</italic>, <italic>HSP90B1-DKFZp547P055</italic>, <italic>IL17RB-ACTR8</italic>, <italic>ANKRD23</italic>-<italic>ANKRD39</italic>) are identified to share with the fusions identified in prostate cancer but no fusions are shared with breast cancer, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, and lung cancer. Further classification of the remaining 113 fusions shows that 7 fusions (<italic>FAM65A-CTCF, KIAA1267-ARL17, BC041636-GGCT, R3HDM2-INHBC, ABHD16A-LY6G5C, CRNKL1-NAA20, HSPA14-SUV39H2</italic>) are present only in normal karyotype AML, 18 are present only in abnormal karyotype AML or AML without karyotype information, and 88 fusioins are shared between normal, abnormal karyotype, and no karyotype AML groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051203.s003">Table S1</xref>). The fusions present only in each group have lower frequencies [2&#x02013;6 (7&#x02013;21%) for the 7 fusions only in the 29 normal karyotype AML, 1 to 3 (6&#x02013;19%) for the 18 fusions only in the 16 abnormal karyotype AML and AML without karyotype information], but the frequencies for the fusions shared in the three AML groups are from low to high [2&#x02013;30 (4&#x02013;67%) for the 88 fusions in all 45 AML samples]. The frequencies of the fusion distribution in these AML groups imply that the majority of the fusions identified in AML are not related with the karyotype status of the AML cases. Although the common fusions may not be much value as markers for abnormal karyotype AML as they already have well-defined genetic markers, these fusions can be potentially very useful markers for the normal karyotype AML.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title><italic>CIITA-DEXI</italic> fusions</title><p>Three <italic>CIITA-DEXI</italic> fusion isoforms were detected in 14 of the 29 normal karyotype AML cases [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051203-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051203.s002">Figure S2</xref>].

The three fusions contain the same <italic>CIITA</italic> part after the stop codon and fused to different locations of the same intron of <italic>DEXI</italic>. CIITA is a master regulator of <italic>MHCII</italic> gene expression, which is important for antigen-presenting cells to maintain their proper immune function. CIITA functions through interaction with multiple proteins including RFX complex (RFXANK, RFX5, and RFXAP) bound at <italic>MHCII</italic> promoters and other transcriptional factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051203-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

While normal karyotype AML lacks the well-known genetic aberrations, our study shows that fusion transcripts, predominantly derived between the genes adjacent in the same chromosome, are widely present in this subgroup of AML. It is also interesting to note that the majority of the fusion transcripts detected in the normal karyotype AML are also present in the abnormal karyotype AML cases. This fact indicates that the expression of the fusion transcripts are independent events regardless the karyotype status of the AML cells.</p><p>Unlike the fusions between the adjacent genes in normal human genome, in which the partner genes are unilaterally orientated along the same chromosome and expressed most likely by the &#x0201c;read-through&#x0201d; mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051203-Prakash1">[22]</xref>, the partner genes of the fusions identified in AML consist of very heterogeneous patterns of partner gene orientation. The presence of antisense transcripts for the majority of the genomic fusion loci further complicates the determination of the original strands used for the fusion transcription.</p><p>To identify the fusion transcripts present in AML, it is important to exclude the fusion transcripts present in the normal cells of the same individual and the normal cells mixed with the AML samples (the blast rate of the AML samples used in this study is between 95% to &#x0003c;10%, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051203-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Obtaining normal cells from the same leukemic individual, e.g., skin tissue, may not be a perfect choice as evidence shows that the normal skin tissue from leukemic patients can be highly contaminated with leukemic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051203-Ley1">[10]</xref>. To overcome this technical difficulty, we used the &#x0201c;conjoined genes&#x0201d; as the filter to exclude the AML fusions also present in normal human cells. Although this filter is not perfect solution, it is helpful to narrow down the fusion candidates associated with AML.</p><p>There are seven fusions detected only in the normal karyotype AML (<italic>FAM65A-CTCF, KIAA1267-ARL17, BC041636-GGCT, R3HDM2-INHBC, ABHD16A-LY6G5C, CRNKL1-NAA20, HSPA14-SUV39H2</italic>). The involved gene <italic>CTCF, INHBC and SUV39H2</italic> are particularly interesting. <italic>CTCF</italic> encodes a zinc-finger transcriptional regulator protein with 11 zinc fingers. It regulates transcription both positively and negatively. Mutations in <italic>CTCF</italic> have been observed in breast, prostate, and Wilms' cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051203-Phillips1">[25]</xref>. <italic>INHBC</italic> encodes the beta C chain of inhibin, a member of the TGF-beta superfamily involving hormone secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051203-Mathews1">[26]</xref>.

The <italic>HSPA14-SUV39H2</italic> fusion removed the last 3 exons of <italic>HSPA14</italic> and connected the remaining <italic>HSPA14</italic> part to the first exon of <italic>SUV39H2</italic>.</p><p>Five fusions (<italic>XPA-NCBP1</italic>, <italic>HARS2-ZMAT2, HSP90B1-DKFZp547P055, IL17RB-ACTR8</italic>, <italic>ANKRD23</italic>-<italic>ANKRD39)</italic> are shared between AML and prostate cancer. This raises an interesting question whether certain fusions could be common genetic aberrations contributing to different types of cancer. The <italic>HARS2-ZMAT2</italic> fusion was formed in-frame between the 3&#x02032; UTR of <italic>HARS2</italic> and the 3<sup>rd</sup> exon of <italic>ZMAT2</italic> in 3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; tail to head, sense orientation. <italic>HARS2</italic> (histidyl-tRNA synthetase 2) is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein involving in the synthesis of histidyl-transfer RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051203-OHanlon1">[28]</xref>. Mutations in <italic>HARS2</italic> cause Perrault syndrome with ovarian dysgenesis and hearing loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051203-Pierce1">[29]</xref>. <italic>ZMAT2</italic> is a matrin-type 2 zinc finger protein with unknown function. The <italic>HSP90B1-DKFZp547P055</italic> fusion was formed between the 17<sup>th</sup> of 18 exons of <italic>HSP90B1</italic> before its stop codon and the 2<sup>nd</sup> exon of a functionally unknown gene <italic>DKFZp547P055</italic>, fused in a 3&#x02032;-3&#x02032; tail to tail orientation between the two genes. HSP90B1 is a member of HSP90 proteins located in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is involved in folding Toll-like receptors involving in regulating innate and adaptive immunity, maintaining hematopoietic stem cell development, and potentially to be used as a vaccine for cancer treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051203-Liu1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051203-Luo1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051203-Audouard1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051203-Wood1">[33]</xref>. The <italic>HSP90B1-DKFZp547P055</italic> fusion disrupted the normal structure of <italic>HSP90B1</italic>, and possibly led to loss of function of HSP90B1. <italic>IL17RB-ACTR8</italic> fusion is formed in a 3&#x02032;-3&#x02032; tail to tail opposite orientation before the stop codon of <italic>IL17RB</italic> and the 3&#x02032; UTR of <italic>ACTR8</italic>. IL17RB is involved in the activation of the NF-kappaB pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051203-Hata1">[34]</xref>. This in-frame fusion maintains the normal codon of <italic>IL17RB</italic>, suggesting that the fusion could be translated into the two original proteins. Prostate cells are derived from endoderm and hematopoietic cells are derived from mesoderm. Therefore, the shared fusions between prostate cancer and AML are unlikely attributed to the same developmental origin. It will be interesting to further study the biological basis of the shared fusion transcripts between the two very different cancer types. <italic>MHCII</italic> is generally expressed in T cells, B cells and dendritic cells involving antigen presentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051203-LeibundGutLandmann2">[35]</xref>. While myeloid cells are not directly involved in antigen presentation, it has been observed that AML cells express many B-cell specific genes including <italic>CIITA</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051203-Steidl1">[36]</xref>. It will be interesting to know if the altered <italic>CIITA</italic> in normal karyotype AML could contribute to its escape of the host's immune-surveillance.</p><p>Sense and antisense transcripts are commonly present for the majority of human genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051203-Ge1">[37]</xref>. Our data show that sense and antisense transcripts are also present for most of the fusions detected. The orientations of the fusion partners at genomic DNA level are very different. It will be expected that only the 3&#x02032; to 3&#x02032;, tail to tail fused partners can drive the sense and antisene transcription. However, of the 12 fusions used for sense antisense detection, 6 are not in the 3&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; orientation but sense antisense transcripts were detected in each case. How were the sense and antisense transcripts expressed from these fusion loci remain to be understood.</p><p>While the biological/pathological function of many fusion transcripts identified in this study remains to be elucidated, a recent study shows that fusion transcripts formed by post-transcriptional process can have functional relevance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051203-Zhang1">[38]</xref>. Importantly, the high recurrence of the fusion transcripts formed between adjacent genes in AML provides a new targeting area to study disease mechanism and a rich resource to search for potential markers for clinical applications, particularly for the cancer types with intact genomic structure, as examplified by the normal karyotype AML.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>AML samples</title><p>The study used 29 primary samples of normal karyotype AML, eight AML primary samples with abnormal karyotype AML and eight AML primary samples without karyotype information [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051203-g001">Figure 1</xref>], of which 38 were from University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center and 7 were from Allcells Inc (AllCells, CA).

In FusionSeq mapping, reads from each end of a pair were mapped to the human reference genome sequences (hg18) independently. A set of filters, including PCR filter, homology filter, annotation filter, repeat filter, abnormal insert size filter and distance filter with default parameters in the program were used to remove low quality fusion candidates. Conditions were further set that a candidate fusion must be supported by at least two paired-end reads crossing the same boundary and the mapped sequences in both partner genes must contain at least 10 bp. In deFuse mapping, paired-end reads were mapped to both spliced and unspliced transcripts from Ensembl (version 62). Those mapped to the same transcript, mitochondrion and ribosome RNA were removed. The remaining paired-reads were trimmed and mapped again to the spliced and unspliced transcript sequences to remove those mapped to the same transcript. The remaining reads were clustered into contigs. Paired-end reads with only one end mapped were used to find breakpoint.
