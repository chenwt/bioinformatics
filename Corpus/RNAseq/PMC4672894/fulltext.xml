<italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness, is transmitted to its mammalian host by the tsetse. In the fly, the parasite&#x02019;s surface is covered with invariant procyclin, while in the mammal it resides extracellularly in its bloodstream form (BF) and is densely covered with highly immunogenic Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG). In the BF, the parasite varies this highly immunogenic surface VSG using a repertoire of ~2500 distinct <italic>VSG</italic> genes. Recent reports in mammalian systems point to a role for histone acetyl-lysine recognizing bromodomain proteins in the maintenance of stem cell fate, leading us to hypothesize that bromodomain proteins may maintain the BF cell fate in trypanosomes. Using small-molecule inhibitors and genetic mutants for individual bromodomain proteins, we performed RNA-seq experiments that revealed changes in the transcriptome similar to those seen in cells differentiating from the BF to the insect stage. This was recapitulated at the protein level by the appearance of insect-stage proteins on the cell surface. Furthermore, bromodomain inhibition disrupts two major BF-specific immune evasion mechanisms that trypanosomes harness to evade mammalian host antibody responses. First, monoallelic expression of the antigenically varied VSG is disrupted. Second, rapid internalization of antibodies bound to VSG on the surface of the trypanosome is blocked. Thus, our studies reveal a role for trypanosome bromodomain proteins in maintaining bloodstream stage identity and immune evasion. Importantly, bromodomain inhibition leads to a decrease in virulence in a mouse model of infection, establishing these proteins as potential therapeutic drug targets for trypanosomiasis. Our 1.25&#x000c5; resolution crystal structure of a trypanosome bromodomain in complex with I-BET151 reveals a novel binding mode of the inhibitor, which serves as a promising starting point for rational drug design.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>The use of specific inhibitors reveals a role for bromodomain proteins in epigenetically switching from the tsetse fly form of the sleeping sickness parasite <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> to the mammalian bloodstream form.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Many parasites undergo major changes in lifestyle as they cycle between their vectors and their hosts.

<italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> is a unicellular, protozoan parasite and the causative agent of Human African Trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). It also causes n'agana in cattle, a disease that imposes a severe economic burden in affected areas. The life cycle of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> requires adaptation to two distinct habitats: the fly (tsetse) and the bloodstream of its mammalian hosts. Within these habitats, the parasite assumes a succession of proliferative and quiescent developmental forms, which vary widely in metabolism, motility, and composition of the surface coat that covers the plasma membrane. In the fly, the trypanosome first resides in the midgut in its procyclic form (PF), where its surface is coated with a group of proteins collectively termed procyclins, and then in the salivary glands in its metacyclic form, where surface procyclin is replaced with a dense coat of Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG). The bite of the tsetse transmits the parasite to the mammalian host, where it resides extracellularly in its bloodstream form (BF) and continues to express VSG. The parasite relies on two strategies to evade the mammalian host antibody response. First, it varies (&#x0201c;switches&#x0201d;) its highly immunogenic surface antigen, using a repertoire of ~2,500 distinct <italic>VSG</italic> genes [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Only one <italic>VSG</italic> is expressed at a time (monoallelic expression), and host antibodies mounted against the initially expressed VSG must be continually replaced by antibodies against antigenically distinct VSGs, resulting in waves of parasitemia in the infected host [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Second, antibodies bound to surface VSG are rapidly internalized by the parasite [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], giving host effector cells less time to recognize and eliminate it. When trypanosomes enter the midgut of the tsetse following a bloodmeal, a temperature drop and an increase in acidity function cooperatively to induce differentiation from the BF to the PF. Together with remodeling of the parasite surface to replace VSG with procyclin, there are a number of cytoskeletal changes that occur, and the kinetoplast is repositioned. There is also a drastic change in metabolism as the trypanosomes leave the glucose-rich environment of the blood and transition to the fly midgut, where they are more reliant on mitochondrion Krebs cycle enzymes and respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation enzymes (reviewed in [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]).</p><p>Trypanosomes are unusual in that they are eukaryotes that transcribe their genome from polycistronic transcription units (PTUs) that often contain functionally unrelated genes. Thus, much regulation of gene expression occurs at the post-transcriptional level. With respect to differentiation, it is clear that the 3&#x02019;UTRs of procyclin and <italic>VSG</italic> genes contribute to their developmental regulation [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and that RNA binding zinc-finger proteins also play a role in specifying a differentiation program [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Many recent studies have shown that there are large changes in gene expression at the mRNA level during differentiation [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. While developmental changes in gene expression have been examined at the level of mRNA stability and association with the translation machinery, the mechanisms by which these changes are mediated at the DNA level are not well understood. The fact that trypanosomes have recognizable histones, histone modifications, and orthologues of many of the chromatin-interacting proteins found in other, more familiar model systems made us wonder whether differentiation from the BF to the PF may be epigenetically regulated. As epigenetic modifications are reversible, this would confer the plasticity necessary to maximize fitness according to environmental input [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], allowing cells to be poised to move forward in development, but not until the receipt of the appropriate environmental signals. In mammals, bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) family members that recognize histone lysine acetylation through their bromodomains are necessary to maintain murine embryonic stem cell pluripotency [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and differentiation can be rapidly induced by subjecting cells to treatment with highly selective bromodomain inhibitors [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Chromatin-interacting proteins in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> have thus far been studied primarily in the context of monoallelic <italic>VSG</italic> expression and switching [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], but less is known about their potential role in lifecycle differentiation.</p><p>Here, we report that acetyl-lysine (AcK) recognizing bromodomain proteins maintain the BF cell fate in trypanosomes. Using both small molecule inhibitors and genetic mutants of individual bromodomain proteins, we demonstrate that bromodomain inhibition results in gene expression changes that mimic those seen naturally in cells differentiating from the BF to the insect stage following a bloodmeal and transition to the fly midgut. Transcriptional changes are recapitulated at the protein level by the appearance of insect-stage procyclin on the cell surface. BF-specific processes, including monoallelic expression of <italic>VSG</italic> genes and rapid surface-bound antibody internalization are also compromised, establishing <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> bromodomain proteins as attractive therapeutic targets for trypanosomiasis. Indeed, bromodomain inhibition decreases virulence in an in vivo mouse model. Our crystal structure of a trypanosome bromodomain in complex with an inhibitor revealed marked differences in the AcK recognition site to its human counterparts, consistent with a novel binding mode of the inhibitor, which can now be exploited to develop trypanosome-specific, high-affinity drugs against trypanosomiasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Bromodomain Inhibition Increases Insect Stage-Specific Transcripts and Decreases Bloodstream-Specific Transcripts</title><p>Bromodomain proteins have recently been implicated in the maintenance of stem cell pluripotency [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> genome contains five genes with predicted bromodomains [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and we hypothesized that these proteins may play similar roles in maintaining the parasites in their BF and preventing differentiation to the PF. To address this question, we took advantage of a highly selective small-molecule bromodomain inhibitor called I-BET151, a well-characterized successor of I-BET762, which inhibits BET bromodomain proteins in mammalian cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We performed RNA-seq experiments on I-BET151-treated cells and compared them to cells treated with a vehicle control (DMSO; dimethyl sulfoxide). For the initial dataset, cells were subjected to either two days or three days of treatment with I-BET151 and compared to DMSO-treated cells. The RNA-seq libraries were prepared in triplicate from three independent cultures for each treatment using polyA+ selection. We used DESeq analysis [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] to identify the top up-regulated and down-regulated genes following I-BET151 treatment. A list of these genes along with their associated multiple testing corrected <italic>p</italic>-adjusted values are listed in Additional_File_1 and Additional_File_2 in <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Data</xref>. We used the log-fold changes and <italic>p</italic>-adjusted values from the DESeq analysis on I-BET151 cells treated for 3 d to generate the volcano plot shown in <xref rid="pbio.1002316.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>. Strikingly, I-BET151 treatment resulted in a strong up-regulation of a number of genes expressed only in the insect-residing PF form, including procyclins (<italic>EP1-3</italic> and <italic>GPEET</italic>), procyclin-associated genes (<italic>PAG1</italic>, <italic>2</italic>, <italic>4</italic>, <italic>5</italic>), procyclin stage surface antigen (<italic>PSSA</italic>), and protein associated with differentiation 2 (<italic>PAD2</italic>). We also observed a marked down-regulation of genes whose expression is normally higher in the mammalian BF, such as <italic>ISG64</italic>, <italic>PYK1</italic>, and <italic>GPI-PLC</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). To confirm whether the up-regulation in transcription of <italic>EP1</italic> was reflected at the protein level, we performed flow cytometry experiments to ask whether EP1 was expressed on the surface of the cells. Indeed, a large proportion of I-BET151-treated trypanosomes expressed EP1 after 3 d of treatment, while this was not the case for vehicle-treated controls (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). We conclude that bromodomain proteins are important for maintaining a BF-specific cell surface landscape.</p><fig id="pbio.1002316.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1002316.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Trypanosome bromodomain proteins maintain a BF-specific transcriptome.</title><p>(A) Volcano plot showing the most significant up- and down-regulated genes in the trypanosome genome from an RNA-seq experiment comparing cells treated for 3 d with I-BET151 to control DMSO-treated cells.

Each cluster contains a group of genes of both known and unknown function that were shown to change by roughly the same magnitude and with the same timing throughout differentiation. These genes are sometimes but not always functionally related. For example, about half the genes in cluster 30 are flagellar genes, but the remainder fall into different functional groups or have unknown function. Conversely, several flagellar genes are found in other clusters based on their pattern of expression. To analyze these same clusters of genes, we used a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) algorithm generated by the Broad Insitute at MIT [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/gsea">http://www.broad.mit.edu/gsea</ext-link>). This algorithm generates an Enrichment Score that estimates the degree to which a given set of genes is over-represented within the total set of the most highly up-regulated or down-regulated genes. It also provides an Estimation of Significance level and corrects for multiple hypothesis testing to generate a false discovery rate (FDR).

To get a sense of how many of the genes within each cluster were moving coordinately in the same direction (up or down with respect to untreated cells), we conducted an additional analysis that determined the percent of genes up-regulated or down-regulated by 1.1-fold within each cluster in I-BET151-treated cells. <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s038" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref> includes these percentages. We generated a list of clusters that had a GSEA generated FDR of &#x0003c;0.1 and for which &#x0003e; 70% of the genes were up-regulated or down-regulated following treatment with I-BET151. For the 31 clusters that met these criteria, we generated boxplots showing the expression level for all genes within that cluster in cells that had been treated for two days or three days with I-BET151, and compared them to control cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). The red line on the boxplot indicates the median level of gene expression for all the genes within a cluster, while the whiskers denote genes falling within the inner quartile range. Outliers are shown as blue dots. In some cases, a progressive change was observed in the median level of gene expression for the cluster throughout the time course (e.g., 10, 20, 22). In other clusters, there was a shift in the distribution of the data in untreated versus 2-d-treated cells, but not between 2-d and 3-d-treated cells (e.g., 11, 46, 56). We conclude that gene expression changes that take place during differentiation for roughly half (31) of the clusters in the previous study were mirrored in I-BET151-treated cells.</p><p>Queiroz et al. also organized groups of genes that change throughout differentiation by their annotated function. These groups and their abbreviations are listed in Additional_File_4 in <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Data</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s049" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12 Table</xref>. We performed the same analysis described above on these groups of genes and each functional group&#x02019;s GSEA scores are listed in <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s039" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>. We generated boxplots for the ten functional groups that met our criteria for differential expression following treatment with I-BET151 (&#x0003c;0.1 GSEA FDR and &#x0003e;70% of genes up- or down-regulated)(<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s039" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). For example, during the transition from the BF to the PF, trypanosomes down-regulate genes required for high rates of glucose and glycerol metabolism (denoted as glycBS in <xref rid="pbio.1002316.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>) as they leave the glucose-rich environment of the blood and transition to the midgut of the fly. Other genes in the glycosomal pathway that are not involved in the pentose phosphate pathway are also down-regulated (denoted as glyc in <xref rid="pbio.1002316.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). Cells undergoing differentiation also up-regulate many of the genes involved in the citric acid cycle (denoted as mit CAC in <xref rid="pbio.1002316.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). We find these changes reflected in I-BET151-treated cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s039" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). Notably, genes found in the procyclin-specific transcription unit (denoted as procyc in <xref rid="pbio.1002316.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>) were also up-regulated upon treatment with I-BET151 (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s039" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). Other previously identified functional groups that met our criteria for differential expression in I-BET151-treated cells include the invariant surface glycoproteins (ISGs), genes involved in cell cycle (cyc), genes associated with glycosyl phosphatidylinositol metabolism (GPI), cytoskeletal genes (cyskel), flagellar genes, and genes associated with intracellular protein and vesicular transport pathways (vestrans) (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). We conclude that with respect to transcription, bromodomain inhibited cells share some similarities to differentiating cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>A Temporal Analysis of I-BET151-Treated Cells</title><p>In order to compare the changes in gene expression that take place in I-BET151-treated cells with those that take place during differentiation, we performed a more extensive RNA-seq time course of I-BET151 treatment that included earlier time points than had been analyzed previously, at 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. As above, RNA-seq libraries were generated in triplicate using poly-A+ selection. First, we performed GSEA analysis using the Pearson metric for ranking genes in a time series (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/doc/GSEAUserGuideFrame.html?_Metrics_for_Ranking">http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/doc/GSEAUserGuideFrame.html?_Metrics_for_Ranking</ext-link>). We thus obtained a list of 17 functional groups and 35 clusters that were over-represented in the set of genes that are differentially expressed through the time course using a GSEA FDR cutoff of &#x0003c;0.1 (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.s040" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s041" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> Tables).</p><p>We used DESeq&#x02019;s negative binomial test to generate a list of differentially expressed genes at every time point using a multiple testing corrected <italic>p</italic>-adjusted cutoff of &#x0003c; 0.1.

We then plotted the percentage of genes within each cluster or group that were differentially expressed over the time course (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s021" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s022" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> Figs, <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s042" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s043" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref> Tables, Additional Files 5&#x02013;9 in <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Data</xref>).

For example, at 3 h after the initiation of I-BET151 treatment, 23% of genes in the glycosomal pathway (glyc, GSEA FDR = .018) are called by DESeq as being differentially expressed with a <italic>p</italic>-adjusted value of &#x0003c;0.1, whereas at 48 h, 94% of the genes in this group are differentially expressed in our dataset (gray line in <xref rid="pbio.1002316.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>, see also <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s042" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>). Other functional groups that showed early differential expression of their gene members include mitochondrial citric acid cycle enzyme genes (mit CAC), flagellar genes (flag), RNA binding protein genes (RBP), chaperone or protein-folding-related genes (chap), procyclic transcription unit genes (procyc) and genes associated with intracellular and vesicular transport pathways (vestrans) (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>).</p><p>The percentage of differentially expressed genes for each functional group rises sharply between 12 and 24 h for 15 of the groups analyzed (e.g., ISG and GPI, <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s021" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>) (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s021" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A&#x02013;S1C Fig</xref>) and generally continues to rise between 24 and 48 h (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s021" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B and S1C Fig</xref>). In addition to the ISG and GPI groups, genes involved in RNA degradation (RNAdeg), glucose and glycerol metabolism (glycBS), cytoskeleton(cyskel), ubiquitination (ubiq), DNA binding, replication, and nucleases (DNA) and protein kinase or kinase binding activity (signal K) were differentially expressed starting at 12 h after initiation of I-BET151 treatment (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.s021" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B and S1C Fig</xref>). Finally, two groups of genes were differentially expressed late in the time course, between 24 and 48 h. These included ribosomal proteins (ribprot) and genes associated with the nucleolus (nucleol) (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.s021" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1D Fig</xref>).</p><p>We performed the same analysis described above on the 35 clusters with GSEA FDRs of &#x0003c;0.1. We found that six clusters had differentially expressed genes early in the time course (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). 27 clusters contained genes that began to be differentially expressed at 12 h postinduction, and the percentage of differentially expressed genes within the majority of clusters continued to rise until 48 h (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.s022" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A&#x02013;S2D Fig</xref>). Genes within Clusters 57 and 22 were not differentially expressed until 24 h postinduction (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.s022" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2E Fig</xref>). Overall, this analysis indicates that a small subset of genes (between 21 and 29) are differentially expressed in the first 12 h of I-BET151 treatment, with a much larger number of genes (~700) showing differential expression between 12 and 24 h (see Additional Files 5&#x02013;9 in <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Data</xref>).</p><p>We wanted to compare the timing for gene expression changes that took place during our I-BET151 RNA-seq time course with those that took place in the Queiroz study. We compared only those clusters and functional groups with a GSEA FDR of &#x0003c;0.1 and &#x0003e;70% of genes up- or down-regulated at the 48 h time point. To get a global picture of the expression changes within each cluster or functional group, we plotted the median reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) for each cluster or group over time (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s023" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>, solid lines). We artificially set the median for each group at time 0 to be 1 and normalized the other medians accordingly, in order to more easily compare changes between groups. We then calculated the median expression level for each cluster or group using data generated in the Queiroz study and plotted these medians alongside our data (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s023" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref> dashed lines). Each solid and dashed line was given the same color for each functional group or cluster to ease comparison between the studies. However, we would like to emphasize that caution must be taken when comparing these two datasets, because they were not only generated using different cells and different induction techniques, but also the previous study used microarray technology rather than sequencing technology. Thus the level of expression is only grossly comparable between the two datasets. Nevertheless, we did observe that in general, for the 10 functional groups that met our criteria (GSEA FDR of &#x0003c;0.1 and &#x0003e;70% of genes up- or down-regulated at the 48 h time point), the median gene expression between 12 and 76 h for each of the groups (to the right of the black line on each plot) roughly correlated with the previous study (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s023" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). While the median gene expression at 48 and 76 h was quite similar for some functional groups (e.g., procyclic, glycolysis, GPI, ISG), other functional groups in our dataset changed to a lesser extent than those in the previous study (e.g., mit CAC and RNA degradation) (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Also of note is that the expression changes were more poorly correlated between 3 and 12 h (to the left of the black reference line in <xref rid="pbio.1002316.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).

Consistent with this observation, we found that genes within the vesicular and intracellular transport group were down-regulated in I-BET151-treated cells (Figs <xref rid="pbio.1002316.g001" ref-type="fig">1D</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002316.g002" ref-type="fig">2A</xref> and Additional Files 1,2, and 5&#x02013;9 in <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Data</xref>). Concurrently, expression of genes required for motility and for VSG-bound antibody internalization [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] are down-regulated during differentiation and were also reduced in I-BET151-treated cells (denoted &#x0201c;flag&#x0201d; in <xref rid="pbio.1002316.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref> and flagellar in <xref rid="pbio.1002316.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). We therefore tested whether I-BET151-treated cells were able to internalize surface-bound antibody. We first coated the cells with a primary antibody against the expressed surface VSG. After washing unbound antibody away, we subjected the cells to a 5-min incubation at 4&#x000b0;C or 37&#x000b0;C. At 4&#x000b0;C, wildtype cells are unable to move and the antibody remains on the surface, whereas at 37&#x000b0;C they are able to move freely and internalize surface-bound antibody [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Following incubation, we immediately fixed the cells with formaldehyde. We then added a secondary antibody and measured how much primary antibody remained on the surface by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. We observed a complete block in antibody internalization in I-BET151-treated cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>), consistent with decreased motility observed in these cells (compare <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s036" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s037" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> Movies).

Another link between ES expression and differentiation was observed by Amiguet-Vercher et al., who found an increase in transcription in regions near the ES promoter in silent ESs during the early stages of differentiation [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We also observed an increase in transcription of <italic>ESAG</italic>s at silent ESs upon treatment with I-BET151 (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.s024" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4E Fig</xref>). We plotted the median log<sub>2</sub>(RPKM) for all <italic>ESAG</italic>s in silent ESs during the I-BET151 time course and found an initial increase in expression of these <italic>ESAG</italic>s at 3 h postinduction, with a much more dramatic increase in expression occurring between 24 and 48 h (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.s025" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). To ascertain the timing for increased expression of silent VSGs, we plotted the median log<sub>2</sub>(RPKM) for all inactive VSGs during our time course and observed that VSG expression rises later in the time course, primarily between 24 and 48 h (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.s025" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). We conclude that bromodomain proteins are necessary for maintaining monoallelic expression of VSG genes, and confirm that transcription of <italic>ESAG</italic>s and <italic>VSG</italic>s appears intimately linked to differentiation processes.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Bromodomain Proteins Mediate "Memory" of the Active ES</title><p>In mammalian cells, differentiation from a totipotent to a differentiated state is accompanied by a number of changes at the chromatin level, including deposition of repressive histone marks and increasing chromatin compaction. Cellular reprogramming to the undifferentiated state is characterized by a nucleus largely devoid of heterochromatin [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and is inhibited by repressive histone modifications [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. While mammalian cells generally remain in their differentiated state, trypanosomes are required to cycle continuously between alternate differentiated states, and thus the epigenetic changes that accompany these transitions must necessarily retain some degree of plasticity. In agreement with this notion, the effects of I-BET151 treatment are reversible. Longer treatments (5 d) with I-BET151 lead to very low levels of anti-VSG antibody bound to the cell surface (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>), but memory of the active ES appears to be retained, as the VSG associated with this same ES is expressed on the surface after 3 d of washing out the drug (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Similarly, levels of surface EP1 are high after 5 d of I-BET151 treatment, but expression is lost upon washout of the drug. These results imply that the transcription changes associated with differentiation are reversible, and supports the intriguing possibility that these changes may be epigenetically mediated, though this remains to be conclusively proven.</p><fig id="pbio.1002316.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1002316.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Bromodomain inhibition is reversible and &#x0201c;memory&#x0201d; of the active ES is retained.</title><p>(A) Flow cytometry measuring the amount of anti-VSG antibody bound to the cell surface as well as surface levels of EP1 following treatment with I-BET151 for the indicated number of days.

These results imply that while both proteins maintain monoallelic expression of <italic>VSG</italic> genes, Bdf2 has a more specialized role in maintaining silencing at ESs. We tested whether Bdf2 could be localized to the ES using chromatin IP followed by Q-PCR. We performed this test in a cell line with a Blasticidin resistance gene at the active ES promoter and a GFP marker at one of the silent ES promoters. We found that Bdf2 localized to the promoter region of both the active and silent ES, and we also detected weaker binding at each of the <italic>VSG</italic>s associated with these ESs (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.s030" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10C Fig</xref>, left). Binding to these regions was decreased in the presence of I-BET151 (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.s030" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10C Fig</xref>, right). We also tested binding of Bdf3 to the ES using a cell line that did not distinguish the promoters of active and silent ESs. We found that Bdf3 also binds to the ES promoter (ESP1 in <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s030" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10D Fig</xref>) and to a pseudogene located further down the ES, but that it did not appear to bind directly to the <italic>VSG</italic> genes (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.s030" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10D Fig</xref>). Finally, transcription of <italic>ESAGs</italic> in inactive ESs is also higher in Bdf3<sup>kd</sup> and Bdf2<sup>KO</sup> cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.s031" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Fig</xref>).</p><p>We further tested whether Bdf3 binding was altered in the presence of I-BET151 by collecting samples for ChIP at 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h following initiation of treatment. We then used Q-PCR to test whether Bdf3 binding was altered at the ES promoter (ESP1 in <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s032" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12A Fig</xref>) or at several other sites identified as peaks of Bdf3 binding in our ChIP-seq experiment (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.s032" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12B&#x02013;S12D Fig</xref>). We found that I-BET151 treatment decreased binding to both the ES promoter and to the other sites we tested in a progressive manner, whereas it did not decrease binding to the <italic>URA3</italic> control region (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.s032" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12A Fig</xref>).</p><p>Our RNA-seq experiments on Bdf2<sup>KO</sup> and Bdf3<sup>kd</sup> cells were conducted at 48 h and 24 h post-induction, respectively. We wanted to confirm that the changes in transcription at these later time points were reflected early upon depletion of each Bdf. To do this, we isolated RNA from Bdf2<sup>KO</sup> cells at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h postinduction with Dox. For Bdf3<sup>kd</sup> cells, we isolated RNA at 6, 12, and 24 h postinduction. We confirmed that PAG2, EP1, and GPEET2 mRNA expression increased after 6 h of induction in Bdf3<sup>kd</sup> cells. This was also the case for a <italic>VSG</italic> gene in a silent site (VSG3) (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.s033" ref-type="supplementary-material">S13A Fig</xref>). We were also able to confirm that the transcription of silent ES VSGs and one metacyclic VSG was increased in Bdf2<sup>KO</sup> cells as early as 6 h postinduction (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.s033" ref-type="supplementary-material">S13B Fig</xref>).</p><p>Genetic depletion of Bdf3 did not result in the expression of EP1 on the surface of the cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>), but previous results from Batram et al. indicated that the presence of an ectopically expressed VSG &#x0201c;primed&#x0201d; cells for differentiation from the BF to the PF and increased their sensitivity to cis-aconitate, an acidic small-molecule differentiation trigger that mimics the increased acidity of the fly midgut [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. We wondered whether the increase in transcription of normally silenced <italic>VSG</italic>s might have a similar effect, so we subjected Bdf3<sup>kd</sup> and Bdf2<sup>KO</sup> cells to treatment with cis-aconitate or reduced temperature. Indeed, genetic depletion of bromodomain proteins primes BF trypanosomes for differentiation, and requires only one (cis-aconitate), rather than two, environmental stimuli to induce EP1 expression (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>). The effect was stronger in Bdf3<sup>kd</sup> cells, perhaps due to the significant up-regulation of EP1 mRNA. Unlike the Bdf2- and Bdf3-depleted trypanosomes, a large proportion of I-BET151-treated cells expressed EP1 at high levels in the absence of any environmental stimulus, and nearly all cells expressed EP1 following treatment with cis-aconitate or incubation at 27&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>). Control cells with intact bromodomain proteins showed very low induction of EP1 upon exposure to differentiation triggers (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>). These results confirm that bromodomain proteins are important for preventing remodeling of the parasite surface until all the appropriate environmental signals have been received.</p><p>We were able to partially recapitulate the block in antibody internalization observed in I-BET151-treated cells in both Bdf3<sup>kd</sup> and Bdf2<sup>KO</sup> cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>). The block in Bdf3<sup>kd</sup> cells is consistent with the decrease in transcription of flagellar genes necessary for motility (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.s029" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig</xref>). The partial block in antibody internalization observed in Bdf2<sup>KO</sup> cells was unexpected, but might be explained by a decrease in expression of the paraflagellar rod gene <italic>Pfr2</italic> (Tb927.8.5010) and in &#x003b1;-tubulin (Tb927.1.2400) in the Bdf2<sup>KO</sup> RNA-seq dataset. We hypothesize that these might be indirect consequences of Bdf2 inhibition related to <italic>VSG</italic> derepression [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Notably, the effects of I-BET151 treatment were more pronounced than those in cells with depletion of individual bromodomains, which most likely reflects simultaneous inhibition of at least two bromodomains (Bdf2 and Bdf3) by I-BET151. We cannot rule out the possibility that I-BET151 may also bind Bdf1, 4, and/or 5, and that these proteins may be able to partially compensate for the lack of Bdf3 in Bdf3<sup>kd</sup> cells. Overall, we show that most of the effects seen in I-BET151-treated cells are phenocopied in Bdf3<sup>kd</sup> cells, and that ES-specific effects are also observed in Bdf2<sup>KO</sup> cells. Our results imply that bromodomain proteins are required for maintenance of BF stage identity.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Bromodomain Proteins Are Promising Drug Targets for Treatment of Trypanosomiasis</title><p>Inhibition of bromodomain proteins compromises BF-specific immune evasion mechanisms and provides several advantages for the host immune system, including slower parasite growth and cell cycle defects (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A and 6B</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s028" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>), expression of an invariant epitope on the surface of the cell (EP1) (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>), and defects in antibody internalization (Figs <xref rid="pbio.1002316.g003" ref-type="fig">3A</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002316.g005" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>), making these proteins attractive drug targets. However, while repurposing known bromodomain inhibitors to combat trypanosomiasis is a promising strategy, in vivo treatment with I-BET151 itself is suboptimal because of its low affinity for trypanosome bromodomain proteins and its high affinity for mammalian BET proteins that affect the immune system [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We therefore asked whether the course of parasitemia is altered in mice infected with trypanosomes treated in vitro with I-BET151 prior to infection. Mice infected with parasites treated for two days with I-BET151 survived significantly longer than control mice. In addition, 80% of the mice infected with parasites treated for three days with I-BET151 did not develop detectable parasitemia (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). We wanted to make sure that the survival advantage in WT mice was not due to lack of viability of I-BET151-treated cells, and we also wanted to confirm that I-BET151-treated cells were able to establish infections in vivo. We reasoned that if the drug-treated trypanosomes were not viable or capable of establishing an infection, then <italic>RAG-/-</italic> mice, which lack B and T cells, would have a similar advantage to WT mice in surviving infection with I-BET151-treated trypanosomes.

We plated the treated cells in 3 separate 96-well dishes at a concentration of 50 cells/well and then counted the number of wells where trypanosomes were growing after 4 d. We chose this concentration because we infected mice with 50 trypanosomes. 100% of wells in all 3 plates had trypanosomes growing after 4 d for both DMSO and I-BET151-treated samples (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.s034" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14A Fig</xref>).

The overall structure adopts the canonical bromodomain fold comprising four &#x003b1;-helices linked by variable loop regions that form the ligand binding site [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>). Unexpectedly, but consistent with the reduced affinity, the ligand is flipped by roughly 180&#x000b0; with respect to the human BRD4-BD1-I-BET151 complex and cannot adopt its classical binding mode (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In human BRD4-BD1, the dimethylisoxazole group mimics AcK, recognizing the conserved Asn (Asn140) and the conserved water network. In Bdf2, the dimethylisoxazole ring is solvent-exposed, while recognition of the conserved Asn takes place through a bidentate hydrogen bond to the imidazolone moiety. The new orientation is probably due to a clash of the pendent pyridine ring with the large trypanosome gatekeeper residue Trp92, which dominates ligand recognition through parallel &#x003c0;&#x02013;&#x003c0; stacking and which is not found in any of the 61 human bromodomains at this position [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The flipped binding mode is further enforced by the narrow AcK binding slot that cannot accommodate the energetically favorable twist of the dimethylisoxazole with respect to the quinoline ring (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>). Notably, the pyridine moiety forces the imidazolone to sit high up in the AcK binding pocket, resulting in an imperfect fit with a gap at the bottom of the pocket that is filled by an additional, unconserved water molecule (Wat1, <xref rid="pbio.1002316.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>). By contrast, the smaller gatekeeper residue Ile146 in human BRD4-BD1 allows the twisted dimethylisoxazole to engage in the classical AcK recognition (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E</xref>).</p><fig id="pbio.1002316.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1002316.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Structural analysis of I-BET151 binding to Bdf2.</title><p>(A) Structure of the Bdf2 bromodomain in complex with I-BET151 (PDB code 4PKL).

<italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> differentiation from the BF to the PF requires extensive reprogramming that results in drastic changes in morphology, metabolism, and protein expression. These changes are reflected at the level of gene expression, with recent studies indicating that 25%&#x02013;40% of all genes are differentially expressed as the cells transition from one form to another [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. A number of mechanisms have been shown to be involved in the developmental regulation of gene expression, including alternative splicing [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and mRNA stability mediated by regulatory sequences within 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019; UTRs [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. These regulatory sequences are, in turn, bound by RNA binding proteins. For example, ZFP3 associates with EP1 and GPEET mRNA and can interact with translation factors [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Our studies indicate that there may be an additional layer of developmental regulation of gene expression that is mediated at the DNA level. We show that inhibition of bromodomain proteins cause some transcriptional changes that are similar to those observed during the physiological transition from the BF to the PF. These transcription changes have functional consequences, such as the appearance of EP1 on the cell surface and the gradual disappearance of surface VSG.</p><p>An alternate explanation for the data is that treatment with I-BET151 and/or knockdown of Bdf genes results in a global transcriptional dysregulation, such that all formerly silenced genes show increased transcription and active genes show decreased transcription. To try and determine whether this was the case for our I-BET151 time course, we split genes into those that had previously been shown to change during differentiation as defined by the Queiroz study, and those that have not. If global dysregulation were occurring, we would expect that in the group of genes not associated with differentiation, there should be an increase in median RPKM for genes that are poorly expressed at time 0, and a decrease in median RPKM for genes that are highly expressed at that time point. Genes in the &#x0201c;procyclic&#x0201d; group, as defined by Queiroz et al. are poorly expressed in BF cells. We examined the range of starting RPKMs for this group of genes and extracted genes of similar starting RPKM from the set of genes that have not previously been shown to be involved in differentiation. We then plotted the median level of gene expression over time for this group of poorly expressed genes. We did not observe a significant increase in the median RPKM for this set of genes over the course of I-BET151 treatment (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.s035" ref-type="supplementary-material">S15 Fig</xref>), indicating that global disregulation is not occurring. We obtained similar results for the set of genes with high starting RPKM, whose range was chosen based on the range of expression for the genes found in the &#x0201c;glycolysis 1&#x0201d; group of genes defined by Queiroz et al. (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.s035" ref-type="supplementary-material">S15 Fig</xref>). We did not observe a general decrease in median RPKM for the set of highly expressed genes that were not previously shown to be involved in differentiation over the course of I-BET151 treatment. While we have not formally disproved global disregulation, we believe these findings argue for a more specific effect of I-BET151 treatment on the set of genes known to be involved in differentiation.</p><p>In <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>, there is a paucity of sequence-specific DNA regulatory sequences that can serve as transcription factor binding sites. Only one transcription factor has been well characterized [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and it appears to primarily mediate Pol I transcription. To our knowledge, enhancer-like sequences have not been identified. It is thus unlikely that transcription factors are the means by which developmental transcriptional programs are put in place. This leaves epigenetic marks and the proteins that read them as a potential mechanism for regulating developmental changes in gene expression at the DNA level. Our work implies that bromodomain protein localization could change during differentiation from the BF to the PF in the normal course of the trypanosome lifecycle, and that this may be part of the mechanism by which a new, PF-specific transcriptional program is initiated. While we have demonstrated that bromodomain proteins bind chromatin, and that binding is altered following their inhibition, technical considerations currently preclude a direct demonstration that epigenetic changes (e.g., changes in histone marks) that fundamentally change the structure of the chromatin surrounding bromodomain-bound sites are occurring. Future studies may be able to address whether changes in the patterns of histone tail modification or DNA methylation result from altered localization of chromatin readers during differentiation.</p><p>We were able to demonstrate that bromodomain protein-mediated changes in transcriptional program are reversible (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>), and we theorize that this plasticity may be a significant advantage to an organism that must reprogram itself quickly to adapt to the changing environments encountered between the insect and the mammalian host. Our results are in good agreement with a very recent study in mice, where small-molecule bromodomain protein inhibition in embryonic stem cells resulted in loss of the undifferentiated state and in spontaneous onset of differentiation [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The surprising parallels between bromodomain-mediated maintenance of cell fate in mouse embryonic stem cells and BF trypanosomes have interesting implications for how these processes may have evolved across diverse biological systems.</p><p>We found that inhibition of bromodomain proteins caused growth arrest, both in our genetic knockdowns of Bdf2 and Bdf3 and upon treatment with I-BET151 (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s028" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>), albeit with different timing in each case. This is interesting in light of the fact that long slender BF trypanosomes cease to divide as they progress to the stumpy forms that are eventually ingested by the tsetse. Transcriptional profiling has revealed that many of the gene expression changes that take place during the transition from the BF to the PF are already in motion during the stumpy stage [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and thus some of the transcription changes that we observe in I-BET151-treated cells might be shared with cells transitioning from the long slender to the stumpy form. That is to say that it is possible that the cell cycle arrest observed upon bromodomain protein inhibition is a result of the transcriptional program that is set forth following inhibition. The Lister427 strain used in this study is not pleomorphic and thus cannot be induced to form stumpies. However, it may be that bromodomain inhibition causes the cells to acquire some characteristics of stumpy forms. That said, we were unable to detect PAD1 on the surface of I-BET151-treated cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and thus do not think the drug is inducing formation of a true stumpy form. Conversely, it is possible that the growth arrest is causing transcriptional changes consistent with progression to the next lifecycle stage. However, the fact that we see an up-regulation of EP1 mRNA at 3 h following I-BET151 treatment, and that we do not observe a pronounced growth arrest in the first 24 h of treatment does not support this notion. In future studies, it will be interesting to see what effect I-BET151 has on pleomorphic strains, and whether it is able to instigate transition to the stumpy form.</p><p>We initially chose to focus on the BF cell fate because its loss could have important therapeutic implications. For example, disrupting immune evasion mechanisms specific to BF cells (e.g., antigenic variation or antibody internalization) could lend the host immune system a much-needed boost in combating infection. However, the question as to whether bromodomain proteins are important for maintaining cell fate in other lifecycle stages, such as in PF cells, is an important one to be addressed in future studies.</p><p>Evidence has accumulated over the years that chromatin structure and chromatin-interacting proteins are critical for maintaining monoallelic expression of <italic>VSG</italic> genes [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Consistent with these results, inhibiting bromodomain proteins that read AcK marks on the histone tails affects monoallelic expression. One previous study demonstrated that deletion of a histone methyltransferase caused cell cycle arrest and cell death after induction of differentiation from the BF to the PF [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Because many PF-specific genes were up-regulated following induction of differentiation, the authors suggested that the phenotype could be a byproduct of a cell cycle checkpoint defect, rather than a problem with initiation of differentiation. To our knowledge, our study is the first report of a chromatin factor being required to prevent premature differentiation prior to environmental cues. This is particularly interesting in light of the fact that previous reports have linked gene expression within the ESs to differentiation processes [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and we hypothesize that bromodomain proteins may be one of the factors that mechanistically tie these two processes together. One scenario for how this might occur is that an unidentified signaling event could trigger removal of bromodomain proteins from the ESs, resulting in up-regulation of mRNA from many different ESs, which in turn could cause active ES attenuation and initiate a PF transcription program, as envisioned by Batram et al. Conversely, a global removal of bromodomain proteins from transcription initiation sites could be the event by which a PF-specific transcription program is initiated, with active ES attenuation and transient derepression being part of this more global differentiation program. Our observation that inhibiting the more ES-specific factor Bdf2 caused less of a change in the global transcriptome, but that Bdf2-depleted cells were still &#x0201c;primed&#x0201d; to undergo differentiation to a larger degree than wildtype cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>) supports the first scenario.</p><p>Our insights into this differentiation process have fundamental implications for the design of new strategies to treat trypanosomiasis, as inhibiting bromodomain proteins decreases virulence in a mouse model (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). This finding is important because trypanosomiasis is fatal if untreated and there is a paucity of drugs available for this disease [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Novel drug targets are necessary; as late-stage treatments are highly toxic, few new drugs are in development, and drug resistance is increasing [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The notion that bromodomain inhibitors can &#x0201c;trick&#x0201d; a BF trypanosome into prematurely initiating differentiation to the insect stage while still in the bloodstream imparts this class of molecules with substantial therapeutic potential. In addition to the adverse effects of I-BET151 on the parasite&#x02019;s fitness itself (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A and 6B</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002316.s028" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>), the host immune system would have specific advantages over <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>: (1) expression of invariant insect stage proteins on the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> surface provides a &#x0201c;handle&#x0201d; for a single antibody type to recognize the parasite (in contrast to the constantly antigenically varying VSG coat that is native to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> in the bloodstream) and (2) blockade of rapid antibody internalization, another hallmark of the <italic>T</italic>.<italic>brucei</italic> BF, would allow more time for host effector cells to recognize and eliminate the parasites.</p><p>While I-BET151&#x02019;s low affinity for trypanosome bromodomain proteins currently limits its use in therapeutic intervention, our crystal structure of Bdf2 in complex with I-BET151 provides critical information to guide the design of a highly specific trypanosome bromodomain inhibitor. The fact that the architecture of the AcK recognition site of the Bdf2 bromodomain markedly differs from its mammalian counterparts (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>) implies that a trypanosome-specific bromodomain inhibitor can in principle be developed. This is particularly relevant, because various bromodomain inhibitors such as I-BET151 affect the mammalian immune response [<xref rid="pbio.1002316.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which could pose problems during an infection. Our structure provides specific clues, for example deletion of the pendent pyridine ring or expansion of the tricyclic aromatic ring system to fill the gap at the bottom of the binding site, for augmenting the drug-Bdf2 interactions to yield a trypanosome-specific, high-affinity ligand, while concurrently decreasing affinity for mammalian bromodomain proteins (<xref rid="pbio.1002316.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>). This would avoid compromising the immune response in the host, while inhibiting trypanosome growth, offering a promising new avenue toward therapeutic intervention for trypanosomiasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec012"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Culture Methods and Strains</title><p>
