To investigate how pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only proteins impact on acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we generated mixed lineage leukemia (<italic>MLL)-AF9</italic> and <italic>MLL-ENL</italic> AMLs from BH3-only gene knockout mice. Disease development was not accelerated by loss of Bim, Puma, Noxa, Bmf, or combinations thereof; hence these BH3-only proteins are apparently ineffectual as tumor suppressors in this model. We tested the sensitivity of <italic>MLL-AF9</italic> AMLs of each genotype <italic>in vitro</italic> to standard chemotherapeutic drugs and to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, with or without the BH3 mimetic ABT-737. Loss of Puma and/or Noxa increased resistance to cytarabine, daunorubicin and etoposide, while loss of Bim protected against cytarabine and loss of Bmf had no impact. ABT-737 increased sensitivity to the genotoxic drugs but was not dependent on any BH3-only protein tested. The AML lines were very sensitive to bortezomib and loss of Noxa conveyed significant resistance. <italic>In vivo,</italic> several <italic>MLL-AF9</italic> AMLs responded well to daunorubicin and this response was highly dependent on Puma and Noxa but not Bim. Combination therapy with ABT-737 provided little added benefit at the daunorubicin dose trialed. Bortezomib also extended survival of AML-bearing mice, albeit less than daunorubicin. In summary, our genetic studies reveal the importance of Puma and Noxa for the action of genotoxics currently used to treat MLL-driven AML and suggest that, while addition of ABT-737-like BH3 mimetics might enhance their efficacy, new Noxa-like BH3 mimetics targeting Mcl-1 might have greater potential.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a devastating disease primarily affecting children and older people. Although genetically diverse,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> most AMLs are oligoclonal at presentation, with perhaps only two to four driver mutations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> Chromosomal translocations are common (~50&#x00025; of cases) and those involving the mixed lineage leukemia (<italic>MLL</italic>) gene, the mammalian homolog of <italic>Drosophila</italic> trithorax gene located on chromosome 11 band q23, occur in ~10&#x00025; of acute leukemias, including AML, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and leukemias of mixed or indeterminate lineage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup>
<italic>MLL</italic> translocations are associated with poor prognosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup>
<italic>MLL</italic> encodes a large multi-domain protein that activates transcription through its C-terminal histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyl transferase domain. <italic>MLL</italic> translocations create a fusion gene containing the 5&#x02032; portion of <italic>MLL</italic> and the 3&#x02032; portion of the partner gene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> The DNA-binding MLL portion of the resulting fusion protein binds MLL target genes, including Hox genes, and the partner moiety enforces constitutive expression through interaction with a higher order transcriptional elongation complex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> Nearly 80 different MLL fusion partners have been identified in AML,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> two of the most common being <italic>AF9</italic> and <italic>ENL</italic>. Transgenic mice expressing <italic>Mll</italic>-<italic>AF9</italic> and <italic>Mll-ENL</italic> under the control of the endogenous <italic>mll</italic> promoter are highly prone to AML, although the long latency indicates a requirement for additional genetic event(s) before the emergence of fully malignant cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup></p><p>Major improvements in AML therapy have remained elusive. Current &#x02018;standard of care' involves an initial phase of intense chemotherapy (remission induction therapy) followed by additional chemotherapy cycles and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Most commonly, induction therapy involves administration of cytarabine with an anthracycline, usually daunorubicin or idarubicin, with etoposide sometimes also included. Because all these drugs act on DNA synthesis, they preferentially affect rapidly dividing cells. Cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside) is phosphorylated intracellularly and incorporated into DNA during S-phase, resulting in chain termination of the elongating nascent DNA chain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> Anthracyclines and etoposide inhibit topoisomerase II, thereby increasing the frequency of double strand DNA breaks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Multiple additional activities have been ascribed to anthracyclines,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> including inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis as a result of intercalation between base pairs and generation of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup></p><p>By provoking DNA damage, ROS and other intracellular stresses, cytotoxic drugs kill cells (at least in part) by inducing the intrinsic (also known as the mitochondrial or stress-induced) apoptosis pathway, which is regulated by pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (for reviews see refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Bcl-2 and its closest relatives (Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, Mcl-1, A1/BFL1, Bcl-w and, in humans, possibly also Bcl-B) promote cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis, whereas structurally similar relatives Bax and Bak (and possibly also Bok) instead promote apoptosis, as do the so-called &#x02018;BH3-only proteins' (Bim, Puma, Noxa, Bad, Bid, Bmf, Bik and Hrk), which have only one of the four Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains. In healthy cells, the pro-survival proteins hold Bax and Bak in check. Stress signals &#x02013; such as DNA damage or oncogene expression &#x02013; up-regulate expression of Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only proteins, which bind tightly to the hydrophobic surface groove of pro-survival Bcl-2-like proteins, thereby neutralizing their capacity to inhibit activated Bax and Bak. The most potent BH3-only proteins, Bim, Puma and tBid, can bind all pro-survival proteins whereas others show more selective binding:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> Noxa, for example, is specific for Mcl-1 and A1/BFL1, whereas Bad is specific for Bcl-2, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and Bcl-w. Certain BH3-only proteins can also bind transiently to the surface groove of Bax and Bak, inducing them to undergo conformational change and form homodimers on the outer mitochondrial membrane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> The homodimers then aggregate to form homo-oligomeric pores,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> through which cytochrome <italic>c</italic> egresses into the cytoplasm to initiate the cascade of caspase activation responsible for dismantling the cell.</p><p>A new class of small molecule that mimics BH3-only proteins is generating much clinical interest. BH3 mimetics bind to pro-survival Bcl-2-like proteins in a manner similar to BH3-only proteins, releasing previously sequestered BH3-only proteins to activate Bax and Bak.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> Cancer cells have greater susceptibility to BH3 mimetic drugs than normal cells, in part because they often have higher levels of pro-survival proteins and hence higher &#x02018;stores' of BH3-only proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> ABT-737, the first bonafide BH3 mimetic to be developed, binds Bcl-2, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and Bcl-w but not Mcl-1 or A1,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> as does its orally bio-available derivative ABT-263 (Navitoclax),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> whereas the more recent ABT-199 (Venetoclax) is specific for Bcl-2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>) and A-1155463 is specific for Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> These BH3 mimetics have shown promising efficacy in a variety of preclinical models (eg refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>) and ABT-263 and ABT-199 are now in advanced clinical trials for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and certain other malignancies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> High levels of Mcl-1 (or A1/BFL1) are likely to cause resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> and BH3 mimetics specific for Mcl-1 are under development.</p><p>Using retroviruses expressing MLL-fusion genes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> we are generating murine AMLs with a variety of apoptotic lesions.

Mice received 5&#x02009;mg/kg body weight daunorubicin intravenously on days 1, 4 and 9 and either ABT-737 (75&#x02009;mg/kg body weight) or vehicle intraperitoneally on days 1&#x02013;5 and 8&#x02013;12.</p><p>For the WT/<italic>MLL-AF9</italic> AMLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>), controls receiving saline and vehicle (black) all died within 20 days and those treated with ABT-737 alone (blue) fared no better. In contrast, daunorubicin (red) significantly extended lifespan; of the 15 mice transplanted with five different WT/<italic>MLL-AF9</italic> AMLs, almost 50&#x00025; survived for more than 30 days, and two were still alive at the end of the experiment (100 days; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>).</p><p>Treatment with ABT-737 as well as daunorubicin did not significantly increase survival over daunorubicin alone (compare aqua and red lines), although more mice achieved long-term survival (5/15 versus 2/15). No overt correlation was evident between the degree of responsiveness of individual AMLs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>) and their pattern of expression of pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins or BH3-only proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). RNASeq analysis is being undertaken to attempt to account for the differences in responsiveness.</p><p>Of note, while <italic>MLL-AF9</italic> AMLs lacking Bim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>) responded similarly to WT/<italic>MLL-AF9</italic> AMLs, those lacking either Puma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>) or Noxa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>), were very resistant to daunorubicin, even when it was combined with ABT-737. Thus, Puma and Noxa are critical for the cytotoxic action of daunorubicin.</p><p>In view of the high sensitivity of the AML lines to bortezomib <italic>in vitro</italic>, we were keen to test its efficacy <italic>in vivo</italic>. Unfortunately, tests performed on healthy C57BL/6 mice indicated relatively poor tolerance of the drug, evidenced by severe weight loss. AML-bearing mice were given the maximum tolerated dose (0.75&#x02009;mg/kg) and any mice euthanized early due to weight loss (usually before 7 days) were censored. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> summarizes the outcome for mice developing AML following transplantation with three different WT/<italic>MLL-AF9</italic> AMLs. Treatment with bortezomib provided a significant extension of life although, at this dose, efficacy was not as great as with daunorubicin, and combination therapy with ABT-737 provided no additional benefit.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we tested the impact of loss of individual BH3-only proteins on the development and treatment of AMLs driven by MLL-fusion genes. The AMLs were generated by transplanting WT or BH3-only gene KO fetal liver cells infected with <italic>MLL-AF9</italic> or <italic>MLL-ENL</italic> virus into sub-lethally irradiated recipient mice. Of note, loss of Bim, Puma, Noxa, Bmf, or combinations thereof, made no significant difference to the kinetics of morbidity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>), all recipients developing florid AML within 30&#x02013;65 days. These results differ markedly from those obtained for lymphomagenesis in E<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>-<italic>myc</italic> mice, where disease was accelerated by loss of Bim, Puma or Bmf, although not Noxa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref></sup> Thus, in contrast to Myc-driven lymphomagenesis, none of the BH3-only proteins tested appear to serve as a critical tumor suppressor for the development of MLL-driven AML. This is suggestive of redundant roles. However, the faster morbidity of the retroviral AML model (median 6 weeks) compared with the E<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>-<italic>myc</italic> lymphoma model (median 15 weeks) may have masked a tumor suppressor role.</p><p>To ascertain the sensitivity of the MLL fusion protein-driven AMLs to conventional and targeted cytotoxics, we first tested primary cell lines established by culturing bone marrow cells from sick reconstituted mice in medium supplemented with IL-3. Each of the standard chemotherapeutic drugs was relatively effective at killing WT/<italic>MLL-AF9</italic> AMLs, etoposide and daunorubicin more so than cytarabine at the concentrations tested. As might be predicted for DNA damaging agents such as these, loss of either Puma or Noxa, both p53 targets, increased resistance. Loss of Bim increased resistance to cytarabine but not to etoposide or daunorubicin, whereas loss of Bmf had no significant impact. ABT-737 was not very effective as a single agent but significantly improved the response to the standard agents suggesting that it may improve clinical response or allow lower concentrations of traditional cytotoxics to be used.</p><p>Bortezomib was highly effective at killing WT/MLL-AF9 AMLs <italic>in vitro</italic>. Significantly, whereas <italic>puma</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, <italic>bim</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>bmf</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> AMLs were as sensitive as WT/<italic>MLL-AF9</italic> AMLs, Noxa-deficient AMLs displayed increased resistance. Noxa RNA levels increased markedly within 3&#x02009;h in primary WT/<italic>MLL-AF9</italic> lines exposed to bortezomib and high levels of Noxa protein were observed within 6&#x02009;h in two bortezomib-treated lines (one WT and the other <italic>bmf</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) but not in two other WT lines that were nevertheless highly sensitive to bortezomib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). Differential kinetics of Noxa induction or breakdown may explain the varied results.</p><p>Several mechanisms have been implicated in the cytotoxicity induced by proteasome inhibitors, including stabilization of p53 and I<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B, and induction of ER stress and the unfolded protein response (reviewed in refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>), all of which trigger apoptosis through the Bcl-2 family-regulated pathway. The apparent lack of Puma-dependence implies that Noxa induction by bortezomib in <italic>MLL-AF9</italic> AML cells occurs through a p53-independent mechanism. Noxa transcription can be upregulated by <italic>c-myc</italic> in tumor cells in response to bortezomib.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup></p><p>Noxa strongly binds to and inhibits anti-apoptotic Mcl-1,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> thereby facilitating activation of Bak and Bax. Since Noxa promotes Mcl-1 degradation via the BH3-only E3 ubiquitin ligase Mule,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup> Mcl-1 levels might be expected to rise in bortezomib-treated cells but this was not apparent for the AML lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Presumably bortezomib-mediated Noxa up-regulation titrates the level of Mcl-1 sufficiently to kill the cells.</p><p>We transplanted five independent WT/ <italic>MLL-AF9</italic> AMLs into immunocompetent mice to test their sensitivity <italic>in vivo</italic> to daunorubicin and bortezomib, both alone or in combination with ABT-737. Daunorubicin treatment significantly prolonged the life of most AML-bearing mice, some of which (7/30) survived until the end of experiment (100 days post treatment; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Although the addition of ABT-737 did not further improve survival significantly, given the <italic>in vitro</italic> results discussed above it would be worthwhile testing whether combination therapy enabled a lower dose of daunorubicin to be effective <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Importantly, our data clearly show, for the first time, that effective killing of <italic>MLL-AF9</italic> AML cells by daunorubicin <italic>in vivo</italic> is dependent on expression of Puma and Noxa, as the AMLs lacking these BH3-only genes were more refractory to treatment (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5c and d</xref> with a). Bim appears to play no role (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), in contrast to the situation observed for E<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>-<italic>myc</italic> lymphomas where Bim, Puma and Noxa were all involved in killing by DNA damage-inducing drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup> Although not as efficacious as daunorubicin, bortezomib also extended the life of AML-transplanted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and the <italic>in vitro</italic> data suggests this response is highly Noxa-dependent.</p><p>In summary, our mouse genetic studies have revealed the importance of the BH3-only proteins Puma and Noxa for the efficacy of cytotoxic drugs currently used to treat <italic>MLL-AF9</italic> AML.
