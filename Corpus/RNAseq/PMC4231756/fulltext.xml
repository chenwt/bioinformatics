Comparative transcriptomic analysis of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> isolated from rabbit intestines and from several laboratory conditions enabled identification of mRNAs and sRNAs induced during infection and of regulatory factors that likely control them. More than 12% of annotated <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> genes are differentially expressed in the intestine, including the genes of T3SS2, which are likely induced by bile-mediated activation of the transcription factor VtrB.

The <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> transcriptional response to <italic>in vivo</italic> growth is far more widespread than and largely distinct from that of <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, likely due to the distinct ways in which these diarrheal pathogens interact with and modulate the environment in the small intestine.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>29 October 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p><italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> is a gram-negative enteric pathogen and the leading worldwide cause of seafood-associated gastroenteritis. Intestinal colonization by <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> results in marked disruption of the intestinal epithelium, inflammation and diarrhea, both in infected humans (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and in infant rabbits, which were recently developed as a model host for study of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus-</italic>linked pathogenesis (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Analyses using infant rabbits, as well as using ligated intestinal loops in adult rabbits, have enabled identification of several factors that are critical for virulence. In particular, one of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus&#x02019;</italic> two type 3 secretion systems (T3SS) has been found to be essential for intestinal colonization, and a subset of its secreted effectors play prominent roles in pathogenesis (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). However, <italic>in vivo</italic> analyses to date have primarily investigated the clinical significance of candidate virulence loci identified through comparisons of pathogenic and non-pathogenic isolates and based on knowledge of virulence genes in other organisms. Studies have not addressed the overall physiology of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> within the host; consequently, transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) analyses of gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic> can illuminate a wealth of previously unexplored pathways and processes. RNA-Seq analyses provide a genome-wide overview of factors that may contribute to <italic>in vivo</italic> adaptation and growth; additionally, comparison of <italic>in vivo</italic> gene expression profiles to regulons dissected <italic>in vitro</italic> can provide insight into the environment that <italic>V. parahemolyticus</italic> encounters and generates within a mammalian host.</p><p>Comparative genomic analyses revealed that pathogenic isolates of <italic>V. parahemolyticus</italic> encode two T3SS, while environmental isolates commonly encode only a single system (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The ubiquitous secretion system, T3SS1, contributes to <italic>V. parahemolyticus&#x02019;</italic> cytotoxicity toward cultured cells (reviewed in (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>)), but does not appear to play a significant role in intestinal colonization or induction of intestinal pathology (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). It may instead influence interactions between <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and other hosts, such as shellfish. In contrast, T3SS2, which along with one or more hemolysins is encoded in a genomic island associated with pathogenic isolates (VP-PAI) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), is essential for intestinal colonization and consequently all downstream features of disease in infant rabbits (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). It is also required for disruption of the intestinal epithelium and villus structure and for the bacteria's enterotoxicity in ligated loops, in which colonization factors can be dispensible (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In particular, the T3SS2 effectors VopZ and VopV have been found to be critical virulence factors in these model systems (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Expression of T3SS2 structural genes and effectors is controlled <italic>in vitro</italic> by two transcription factors, VtrA and VtrB, and can be induced by bile, which is presumed to induce its expression <italic>in vivo</italic> as well (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Expression of T3SS1 is governed by the transcription activator ExsA and the associated factors ExsCDE, as well as by calcium and iron (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>); however, no analyses regarding T3SS1 expression <italic>in vivo</italic> have been reported.</p><p><italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> also has the capacity to produce two flagellar systems, which function in different environments associated with distinct morphological states. In liquid cultures, the organism is relatively small (2&#x02013;3 &#x003bc;m), and produces a single polar flagellum. In contrast, growth on a surface or in a viscous environment, which impedes rotation of the polar flagellum, can induce formation of longer (up to 30 &#x003bc;m) swarmer cells with multiple lateral flagella as well as the polar flagellum (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Induction of lateral flagella, as well as of many genes associated with the swarmer state/surface sensing, is controlled by the sigma 54-dependent transcription regulator LafK (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). It has been hypothesized that induction of the swarmer state might occur during infection (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>); however, previous analyses have not assessed the prevalence of such transitions, and the importance <italic>in vivo</italic> of lateral flagella or other LafK-regulated factors have not been reported.</p><p>A newly recognized feature of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> is production of Type VI secretion systems (T6SS), which have been found to mediate interbacterial competition for several other bacterial species (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). As with its T3SS, pathogenic <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> encodes two T6SS, one of which is predominantly found in clinical, rather than environmental, isolates (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Precise roles and mechanisms of action have not been identified for either system; however, it has been reported that <italic>V. parahaemolyticus&#x02019;</italic> T6SS1 and T6SS2 are active under distinct conditions, and thus that they may promote bacterial survival within different environments. In particular, the pathogen-associated T6SS1 is activated by surface sensing and high salinity and negatively regulated by quorum sensing (i.e. by high cell density), whereas the uniformly present T6SS2 is inhibited by surface sensing and activated by quorum sensing and low salinity (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Thus, the relative expression of these systems during infection can provide some insight into the environmental conditions encountered by <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> within the host.</p><p>The infant rabbit model of infection used for investigation of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> pathogenicity has also been used to characterize infections caused by a related enteric pathogen, <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, which causes the severely dehydrating diarrheal disease, cholera (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Like <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> primarily colonizes the small intestine; thus, the two pathogens are expected to encounter similar environmental stimuli during the infection process. However, in contrast to <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> does not closely associate with or damage enterocytes or elicit a marked inflammatory response; instead, cholera toxin, a secreted AB<sub>5</sub> type toxin underlies its pathogenicity (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). We previously developed the tools to carry out a comparative transcriptome analysis on <italic>V. cholerae</italic> isolated from <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures and from the fluid that accumulates within the ceca of infected infant rabbits (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). This study allowed identification of numerous genes whose expression is altered by the infection process, including a high number of known virulence genes that exhibited increased expression <italic>in vivo</italic>. Genome-wide analyses of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic> have not previously been performed; however, microarrays have been used to investigate changes in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> gene expression induced by bile and by the absence of VtrB, and have been used to define several additional regulons (e.g. genes regulated by ExsA, LafK and the quorum-sensing regulator, OpaR) (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>Here, we compare the transcriptomes of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> cultured under standard laboratory conditions, in the presence of bile or VtrB overexpression, and isolated from the ceca of infected infant rabbits. Our analyses reveal that expression of the genes encoding T3SS2 and its effectors is markedly upregulated <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that these genes constitute the majority of those upregulated in common (relative to growth in Luria Bertani Broth (LB)&#x000a0;alone) by all three experimental conditions tested. However, despite the significant overlap between these regulons, our analyses indicate that there is also a large set of genes (<italic>n</italic> =&#x000a0;277) whose expression is only altered <italic>in vivo</italic>, suggesting that <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic> is subject to significant regulatory influences in addition to bile/VtrB induction. Notably, even though <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and <italic>V. cholerae</italic> both colonize the small intestine, relatively few genes shared by these two pathogens were found to be differentially regulated <italic>in vivo</italic> in both organisms. Thus, our observations suggest that the distinct modes with which these two small bowel pathogens interact with the host profoundly affect the environment perceived by the bacteria, and thereby shape their disparate transcriptional responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Strains and culture conditions</title><p>All experiments were performed with the sequenced <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> pandemic isolate RMID2210633 (serotype O3:K6) or derivatives of this strain.

Greater than 7 million fragments were obtained for all RNA samples but one (CF1) (Supplementary Figure S1A). Due to targeted depletion of rRNAs, the vast majority (greater than 97%) of these reads corresponded to the sense strands of annotated ORFs and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) or to unannotated intergenic regions (Supplementary Figure S1B), yielding a sequencing depth previously shown sufficient to reliably quantify and compare transcript abundance across a wide dynamic range (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The correlation (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) of normalized expression per gene between biological replicates ranged from 0.72 to 0.94 and 0.66 to 0.88 for LB and CF samples, respectively (Supplementary Figure S2).</p><sec id="SEC3-1-1"><title>Comparative analyses of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> gene expression in culture and during infection</title><p>To identify genes that are differentially expressed in LB cultures and <italic>in vivo</italic>, we compared the RNA-Seq data for these conditions using DESeq, a differential expression analysis package for RNAseq data that presumes read abundance can be modeled by a negative binomial distribution (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). When data from all three rabbits and all four LB cultures were compared, 416 (9%) and 181 (4%) of the 4868 annotated <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> ORFs and ncRNAs were found to be significantly up- and down-regulated (&#x0003e;3-fold, <italic>P</italic><sub>adj</sub> &#x0003c; 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>), respectively, in cecal fluid compared to LB (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Of note, the majority of differentially expressed genes (57%) came from chromosome II, despite the fact that this replicon encodes only 36% of annotated <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> genes. Forty-four of the genes induced <italic>in vivo</italic> (11%) lie within the region of chrII that encodes T3SS2 (VPA1321-VPA1370) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), consistent with its known role in pathogenesis and with previous reports that it is expressed at low levels under non-inducing conditions <italic>in vitro</italic>.

Among upregulated genes, overrepresented GOs include protein secretion, transport activity, maltose and phosphate transport and pathogenesis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; Supplementary Table S3). It should be noted though that assignments to the &#x02018;pathogenesis&#x02019; category are based primarily on homology, rather than experimental evidence in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus;</italic> in fact, T3SS1 genes are classified within pathogenesis, whereas T3SS2 genes are not associated with any GO group. Many <italic>V. cholerae</italic> virulence genes (e.g. the components of the critical colonization factor TCP) are also not associated with the GO pathogenesis category. However, classification of genes associated with more conserved functions is likely more reliable, and thus supports the idea that <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and <italic>V. cholerae</italic> rely on distinct metabolic processes to grow in the small intestine.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>MA plots of relative transcript abundance in cecal fluid versus LB.

In agreement with their essential role in colonization, a vast majority of T3SS2 genes were induced in all three rabbits. In contrast, genes of T3SS1 were significantly induced in only two samples (CF1 and CF2), and the correlation (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) between CF3 and the other samples for T3SS1 was only &#x0223c;0.5, whereas it was 0.97 for CF1 and CF2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This finding supports our previous report that T3SS1 is dispensable for pathogenesis (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), since infection occurred despite low expression of T3SS1, and suggests that activation of T3SS1 activity may be a response to (as yet undefined) host/microbiome factor(s) that are not invariably present. We also observed significant variability in induction of several other gene clusters, including those encoding iron transport systems and nitrate/nitrite reductases (Supplementary Figure S4), further suggesting that the metabolic environment encountered by <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> during infection is not consistent even among genetically identical animals grown under controlled laboratory conditions.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Scatter plots of log2 FPKMO values per ORF in biological replicates.

It should be noted that transcripts from exogenously expressed VtrB were more abundant than <italic>in vivo</italic>- or bile-induced transcripts, raising the possibility that some changes observed in response to pVtrB are not physiologically meaningful.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Comparative analyses of the <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> transcriptional response to intraintestinal growth, bile and VtrB overexpression.

In particular, we explored the potential roles of the T3SS1 regulator ExsA, the surface sensing/swarming regulators LafK and ScrABC and the quorum sensing regulator, OpaR (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).

Furthermore, although levels of ExsA transcripts are elevated in CF from all three rabbits, they are markedly less increased in CF3, in which T3SS1 up-regulation was not apparent. This is consistent with ExsA levels needing to reach a threshold to mediate downstream events; however, it is also possible that ExsA activity is dependent upon an additional (undefined) factor absent in bacteria in CF3. Levels of ExsA are thought to be responsive to increased calcium and to reduced iron levels (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), raising the possibility that intraintestinal variability in these ions accounts for at least some of the transcriptional heterogeneity we observed among the cecal fluid samples.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>MA plots for <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> gene expression in CF versus in LB, highlighting genes regulated by known transcription factors.

Additionally, the altered expression of a number of genes regulated by OpaR (which is repressed by AphA) also might indicate that OpaR was less active <italic>in vivo</italic>. Approximately 40% of the OpaR regulon showed altered expression <italic>in vivo</italic> that is consistent with reduced activity of this regulator, including changes in expression of T6SS1 and T6SS2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, also Supplementary Table S5). Many of the affected loci (e.g. T6SS2) also showed altered expression in response to exogenous production of VtrB, and it is possible that the OpaR and VtrB pathways are interrelated; however, the precise nature of their relationship remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-5"><title>Intraintestinal growth does not induce a swarmer gene expression profile</title><p>In contrast to the ExsA and OpaR regulons, we saw relatively little overlap between <italic>in vivo</italic>-regulated genes and genes controlled by surface sensing, LafK or ScrABC, all of which govern <italic>V. parahaemolyticus&#x02019;</italic> production of lateral flagella and transition to a swarmer state (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).

Additional analyses indicate that induction is not imperative for even a subset of cells, or for intestinal sites other than the cecum; we observed that deletion of numerous lateral flagella genes involved in the transition from the swimmer to the swarmer state (VPA0264-VPA0275) does not impair colonization of the small intestine by <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> (Supplementary Figure S3).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-6"><title>Intraintestinal growth alters the abundance of regulatory RNAs</title><p>Our transcriptome analyses also revealed several known or putative <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> regulatory RNAs whose abundance is significantly altered during infection compared to growth in culture (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). One of these is Spot 42, a <italic>trans</italic>-acting sRNA implicated as a regulator of catabolite repression, central metabolism and motility in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Aliivibrio salmonicida</italic> (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), whose expression was elevated more than 35-fold <italic>in vivo</italic>. Notably, we also detected reduced transcript abundance for homologs of genes down-regulated by Spot 42 in <italic>E. coli</italic> (e.g. citrate synthase (VP0842 and VP1647), malate dehydrogenase (VP0325) and pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase (VP2942)), suggesting that <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> Spot 42 likely regulates similar processes as the <italic>E. coli</italic> sRNA. Additionally, this result suggests that preferred carbon sources, such as glucose, are readily available to intestinal <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, which is perhaps surprising given our observation that maltose transport genes are also up-regulated. One of the five <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> qrr sRNAs was also significantly up-regulated in CF from all three rabbits. Qrrs are key regulators of quorum sensing that are expressed at low cell density and up-regulate expression of AphA (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>); thus, this observation is consistent with our analyses of AphA, OpaR, and downstream genes, which suggested cells <italic>in vivo</italic> do not perceive the presence of a bacterial &#x02018;quorum&#x02019;. Also consistent with our earlier analyses, we observed that transcript abundance for RyhB, an sRNA that is expressed when cellular iron concentrations are low (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), varied considerably among animals; this data provides further evidence that iron is not uniformly available within the intestines of infected animals. Finally, we found that the abundance of a region encoding two tandem GEMM domains on chromosome I was significantly up-regulated <italic>in viv</italic>o, and two other tandem GEMM domains on chromosome II met slightly less stringent criteria for <italic>in vivo</italic> change (&#x0003e;3-fold, <italic>P</italic><sub>adj</sub> &#x0003c; 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>). These domains typically mediate cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) controlled regulation of downstream sequences, and we observed that expression of downstream genes, including TfoX (VP1028), a putative regulator of bacterial competence, was also increased <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, these data suggest the possibility that levels of c-di-GMP differ between <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> grown cells; however, as GEMM domain binding can have either positive or negative effects (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), the direction of change cannot be inferred from our data.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-7"><title>Spot 42 modulates T3SS2 production but is not required for <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> virulence</title><p>Given the marked up-regulation of Spot 42 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we wondered whether this sRNA might be important for <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> adaptation to and colonization of the intestinal environment. Therefore, we examined the effect of deleting <italic>spf</italic> (which encodes Spot 42) on virulence-related phenotypes <italic>in vitro</italic> and on <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> pathogenicity. Unexpectedly, we observed that the absence of Spot 42 reduced levels of VtrB in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, and also reduced (but did not eliminate) production and secretion of T3SS2 translocon and effector proteins (VopD2 and VPA1350, respectively) that are regulated by VtrB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">B</xref> and data not shown). Consistent with these findings, the <italic>spf</italic> mutant displayed reduced adhesion to cultured epithelial cells and had a reduced capacity to translocate effector proteins into these cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">D</xref>). The mutant's deficiencies could be complemented by exogenous expression of Spot 42 or VtrB, providing further evidence that Spot 42 influences production of VtrB. However, despite the reduced activity of T3SS2 <italic>in vitro</italic> in the <italic>spf</italic> mutant, the mutant retained full virulence in the rabbit model of infection, indicating that the residual levels of T3SS2 expression and activity in the mutant are sufficient to mediate intestinal colonization and induction of diarrhea (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E&#x02013;G</xref>). Thus, Spot 42's effects on T3SS2 and metabolic functions do not appear to be critical for pathogenesis.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>The influence of <italic>spf</italic> deletion upon T3SS2-related phenotypes.

Notably, DESeq analysis employing the same cutoffs used here yielded only 91 (2%) of all annotated <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genes, a much smaller response than we observed in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, where &#x0003e;12% of genes were differentially regulated. This difference does not appear to be due to technical differences in read depth or number of replicates tested in these two studies, as similar results were seen with randomly sampled subsets of each of these data sets containing an equal number of total non-rRNA reads. We speculate that the more severe host response to <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> (e.g. inflammation, epithelial disruption) may in turn elicit a greater transcriptional response from this pathogen, which relies on T3SS2 to efface the intestinal microvilli and establish a more intimate connection with host epithelium than <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). It is possible that the longer period of colonization by <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> (38 h versus 22 h for <italic>V. cholerae</italic>) also provides greater opportunity for host responses that influence pathogen gene expression; however, signs of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> infection are minimal at 22 h p.i. (the peak of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> infection), and thus the disparate timepoints probably provide a more meaningful comparison of the pathogens&#x02019; transcriptional responses to the infection process.</p><p>To further compare the transcriptional responses of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and <italic>V. cholerae</italic> to the host environment, we examined the expression patterns of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> genes whose homologs were differentially expressed in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> during infection. There was little correlation between the relative expression of these homologous genes in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and <italic>V. cholerae</italic>
<italic>in vivo</italic> compared to LB cultures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), and, as noted above, enriched GO terms were discordant for the two organisms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Other than &#x02018;pathogenesis&#x02019; (which depends upon disparate mechanisms in the two species), the only shared response appears to be induction of maltose transport; transcripts related to maltose transport are extremely abundant <italic>in vivo</italic> for both pathogens. <italic>V. cholerae</italic>
<italic>in vivo</italic>-induced genes are also enriched for factors involved in sugar transport (GOs 0005351 and 0009401), and while several genes involved in sugar transport were also induced <italic>in vivo</italic> in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, neither of these GOs was significantly enriched among <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> genes induced <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Our analyses provide further evidence that one of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus&#x02019;</italic> T3SS (T3SS1) is dispensable for pathogenesis, and confirm the prior supposition that expression of T3SS2 is induced <italic>in vivo</italic>, probably due to the presence of bile and induction of VtrB. Differentiation of bacteria into the swarmer state and expression of surface-induced genes is not apparent <italic>in vivo</italic>; additionally, despite accumulation of 10<sup>9</sup> bacteria per gram tissue or milliliter fluid <italic>in vivo</italic>, <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> colonizing the rabbit small intestine and cecum do not perceive the presence of an abundant bacterial community, and genes activated by quorum sensing are not expressed. Although iron limitation can sometimes restrict bacterial growth <italic>in vivo</italic>, our results indicate that <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> does not routinely encounter an environment in which iron is scarce. Similarly, iron is also not thought to be limiting during <italic>V. cholerae</italic> infections of infant rabbits (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). However, we observed relatively little concordance overall between the sets of genes from <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and <italic>V. cholerae</italic> that are differentially regulated <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, a far greater fraction of the <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> genome is differentially expressed <italic>in vivo</italic> compared with <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (12% versus 2%). This marked difference likely reflects <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>' and <italic>V. cholerae</italic>'s fundamentally distinct modes of interacting with the host. Unlike <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, which does not intimately interact with and disrupt the host epithelium, <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> depends on its TTSS to attach to and efface the brush border of the intestinal epithelium (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Furthermore, and perhaps related to its disruption of host tissue, <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, unlike <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, stimulates considerable inflammation. Thus, <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>' more extensive transcriptional changes likely reflect its adaptation to the changes (tissue disruption and inflammation) that it has elicited in the host. Finally, we anticipate that future RNA-seq-based analyses will also allow examination of the host transcriptome during infection, enabling even greater understanding of the interplay between the host and these intestinal pathogens.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SEC4"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gku891/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p>
