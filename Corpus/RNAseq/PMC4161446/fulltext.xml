Key substrates for exosomal degradation include aberrant functional RNAs and cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs). It has recently been reported that the nuclear exosome is inactivated during meiosis in budding yeast through degradation of the subunit Rrp6, leading to the stabilisation of a subset of meiotic unannotated transcripts (MUTs) of unknown function. We have analysed the activity of the nuclear exosome during meiosis by deletion of <italic>TRF4</italic>, which encodes a key component of the exosome targeting complex TRAMP. We find that TRAMP mutants produce high levels of CUTs during meiosis that are undetectable in wild-type cells, showing that the nuclear exosome remains functional for CUT degradation, and we further report that the meiotic exosome complex contains Rrp6. Indeed Rrp6 over-expression is insufficient to suppress MUT transcripts, showing that the reduced amount of Rrp6 in meiotic cells does not directly cause MUT accumulation. Lack of TRAMP activity stabilises &#x0223c;1600 CUTs in meiotic cells, which occupy 40% of the binding capacity of the nuclear cap binding complex (CBC). CBC mutants display defects in the formation of meiotic double strand breaks (DSBs), and we see similar defects in TRAMP mutants, suggesting that a key function of the nuclear exosome is to prevent saturation of the CBC complex by CUTs. Together, our results show that the nuclear exosome remains active in meiosis and has an important role in facilitating meiotic recombination.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust [grant number 088335], SF is funded through an MRC DTP scheme.

Rrp6 degradation occurs across the first few hours of meiosis, coinciding with DNA replication and the induction of meiotic double strand breaks.

These are stringent criteria compared to previous analyses <xref rid="pone.0107648-Neil1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107648-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. We also applied a noise cut-off to remove dubious calls from regions with very low read counts. By this definition, we annotated 1596 CUTs under active degradation in meiotic cells - a surprisingly high number but similar to that reported by Neil <italic>et al</italic>. for mitotic cells <xref rid="pone.0107648-Neil1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107648-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, 60% of the mitotic CUTs reported by Neil <italic>et al</italic>. and 64% of the mitotic CUTs reported by Xu <italic>et al</italic>. overlapped with meiotic CUTs <xref rid="pone.0107648-Neil1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107648-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. For comparison, only 56% of the mitotic CUTs discovered by Xu <italic>et al</italic>. were also discovered by Neil <italic>et al</italic>. suggesting that differences between meiotic and mitotic datasets stem primarily from technical variation and do not represent a major change in CUT metabolism. Importantly, Xu <italic>et al</italic>. identified CUTs based on stabilisation in <italic>rrp6</italic>&#x00394; cells, so the fact that over half these CUTs are also unstable in meiotic cells strongly suggests that Rrp6 is functional during meiosis. These comparisons were performed using only reads which map uniquely to the genome as the microarrays used by Xu <italic>et al</italic>. and Neil <italic>et al</italic>. excluded non-unique regions, and were also mapped to the S288C rather than the SK1 genome, however, re-performing the analysis with non-unique reads included and mapping against the SK1 genome identified only 18 additional CUTs. A list of the meiotic CUTs identified in this analysis is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107648.s005">Table S1</xref>. Together, these data demonstrate that TRAMP-mediated CUT degradation remains active during meiosis.</p><p>Cbc2 binds to the cap of all nascent RNA polymerase II transcripts, and we therefore expected that CUTs and mRNAs would be similarly represented in the Cbc2-immunoprecipitated material. However, the analysis of the actual read density across the region of chromosome V shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107648-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, which contains 10 ORFs, was dominated by a small number of mainly intergenic peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107648-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). In fact, all the peaks visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107648-g002">Figure 2C</xref> are CUTs, three of which are also present in mitotic cells and three are only expressed in meiosis.

To this end, we constructed an estradiol-inducible Rrp6 over-expression strain by introducing a heterozygous <italic>GFP-RRP6</italic> construct under a <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter into a strain expressing an ER-Gal4 fusion.

Silver staining of the purified complexes revealed a similar banding pattern in meiotic and mitotic samples, although yields of the exosome were reproducibly lower from meiotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107648-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). We performed the immunoprecipitation experiment using two different protocols and analysed the samples from both experiments by mass spectrometry. As expected, the complete core exosome was detected in all mitotic and meiotic samples but not in untagged controls, as were the exosome cofactors Rrp6 and Ski7 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0107648-t001">Table 1</xref>). The one exception was Rrp43, which was not detected for reasons that remain unclear. Peptide scores obtained in these experiments are semi-quantitative and, to a first approximation, the peptide score of proteins at 1&#x02236;1 stoichiometry rises linearly with mass. Plots of peptide score versus mass show that this relationship holds true for core exosome subunits in all samples, whereas poorly associated non-exosomal proteins have very low peptide scores for their mass, indicating a very low abundance in the samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107648-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Ski7 and Rrp6 are associated with the cytoplasmic and nuclear exosome complexes respectively and have lower peptide scores than core subunits, as expected since both are sub-stoichiometric to the core exosome, but are still clearly separate from weakly associated non-exosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107648-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, compare Rrp6 and Ski7 to core components Rrp44, Rrp4 and non-exosomal proteins). These plots provide no evidence that Rrp6 association with the core exosome changes dramatically between meiosis and mitosis, as the peptide score for Rrp6 is almost identical in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107648-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, highlighted Rrp6 signals). Mitotic exosome preparations contained various non-exosomal proteins, primarily involved in ribosome synthesis as expected given the importance of the exosome in this process<monospace>. </monospace>Only one meiosis-specific exosome associated protein was detected in both experiments: the RNA binding protein Rim4 which has recently been implicated in control of meiotic translation <xref rid="pone.0107648-Berchowitz1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>; however we were unable to verify this interaction by co-immunoprecipitation despite repeated attempts using different tagged constructs. Therefore, although the meiotic exosome is less abundant than the mitotic exosome, it remains associated with Rrp6 and we did not detect any other differences that could explain MUT accumulation.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0107648-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0107648.t001</object-id><label>Table

of TRAMP function somewhat unclear. Since meiotic replication proceeded normally in <italic>trf4</italic>&#x00394; cells, we analysed the next step: meiotic recombination. This process is initiated by the endonuclease Spo11, which cuts chromosomes at well-mapped hotspots. Transiently cleaved chromosome fragments are sufficiently abundant to be detected as truncated fragments migrating below the main chromosome band on PFGE gels probed for short chromosomes. PFGE analysis for cleaved fragments of chromosome III in wild-type cells revealed a transient peak after four hours of meiosis that was much weaker in <italic>trf4</italic>&#x00394; mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107648-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, compare lanes 4 and 10). However, a transient peak in <italic>trf4</italic>&#x00394; cells would be missed if it did not coincide with a sampling time, and we therefore repeated this assay in an <italic>sae2</italic>&#x00394; background in which double strand breaks cannot be repaired <xref rid="pone.0107648-Prinz1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107648-McKee1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>.

Although Trf4 is an RNA processing protein, we could detect no defect in the expression of key recombination factors by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107648-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), suggesting that this was not caused by a specific gene expression defect.

We find that Rrp6 levels are much reduced in meiotic cells, but this appears to coincide with a general down-regulation of exosome levels in pre-meiotic cells grown to high density. Purified exosome from meiotic yeast contains Rrp6 and the meiotic exosome appears fully functional for CUT degradation. Furthermore, the re-expression of Rrp6 is insufficient to destabilise MUT transcripts, showing that the stabilisation of MUTs in meiosis cannot be attributed to a lack of Rrp6.
