The paper wasp genus <italic>Polistes</italic> is a model for social insect evolution and behavioral ecology. We developed RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene silencing to explore proposed connections between expression of hexameric storage proteins and worker vs. gyne (potential future foundress) castes in naturally-founded colonies of <italic>P. metricus</italic>. We extended four fragments of putative hexamerin-encoding <italic>P. metricus</italic> transcripts acquired from a previous study and fully sequenced a gene that encodes Hexamerin 2, one of two proposed hexameric storage proteins of <italic>P. metricus</italic>. MALDI-TOF/TOF, LC-MSMS, deglycosylation, and detection of phosphorylation assays showed that the two putative hexamerins diverge in peptide sequence and biochemistry. We targeted the <italic>hexamerin 2</italic> gene in 5<sup>th</sup> (last)-instar larvae by feeding RNAi-inducing double-stranded <italic>hexamerin 2</italic> RNA directly to larvae in naturally-founded colonies in the field. Larval development and adult traits were not significantly altered in <italic>hexamerin 2</italic> knockdowns, but there were suggestive trends toward increased developmental time and less developed ovaries, which are gyne characteristics. By demonstrating how data acquisition from 454/Roche pyrosequencing can be combined with biochemical and proteomics assays and how RNAi can be deployed successfully in field experiments on <italic>Polistes</italic>, our results pave the way for functional genomic research that can contribute significantly to learning the interactions of environment, development, and the roles they play in paper wasp evolution and behavioral ecology.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Experimental studies conducted in natural environments are important for understanding ecological patterns and processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Resetarits1">[1]</xref>.

The paper wasp <italic>Polistes metricus</italic> Say, distributed in the Midwestern and Southeastern U.

Early work includes physiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Bohm1">[11]</xref>, inclusive fitness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Metcalf1">[12]</xref>, behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Gamboa1">[13]</xref>, and sex ratio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Metcalf2">[14]</xref>. To extend and expand these and other research areas at both the species and genus levels, <italic>P. metricus</italic> was the first <italic>Polistes</italic> species subjected to analysis of its expressed sequence tags (ESTs &#x02013; its expressed mRNA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Toth1">[15]</xref>, which then were annotated by reference to the genome of a related species, the honey bee <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Consortium1">[16]</xref>. Using this EST resource, Toth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Toth1">[15]</xref> documented differences in gene expression among the four categories of adult females that occur in an annual colony cycle of <italic>P. metricus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026641-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).

The annual cycle begins (arrow) when a female emerges from quiescence with undeveloped ovaries. Feeding at flowers enables ovary development, which precedes nest founding. Oviposition occurs immediately upon initiation of each nest cell by the now-maternal foundress (crown icon) that performs all maternal behaviors in addition to oviposition, including foraging, feeding larvae, and nest construction. <underline>Worker Phase</underline>. The first female offspring to emerge in early summer are workers (hard hat icon) that forage, feed larvae, and construct the expanding nest. The foundress transitions into a true social queen that limits her activities to oviposition and feeding larvae using foods brought to the nest by workers. <underline>Reproductive Phase</underline>. Female offspring emerging in mid-summer are non-working future foundresses called gynes (tiara icon). Males, not shown, emerge synchronously with gynes. <underline>Decline Phase</underline>. In late summer the queen and workers die. Gynes and males depart the nest, which now is empty and unattended. <underline>Quiescence Phase</underline>. Gynes and males mate and feed at fall flowers. With the decline in flower availability and onset of cooler weather, males die, and gynes enter a torpor-like quiescence in sheltered concealment. Workers live only from their emergence until the end of the reproductive phase. A gyne from the reproductive phase of one year has the potential to become a foundress and then queen the following year, thus the tiara to crown transition can represent single individuals that pass from gyne to foundress to queen. Larval treatments and sampling reported in this experiment were conducted in the Reproductive Phase of the colony cycle.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0026641.g001"/></fig><p>The manipulative experimental approach of RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene targeting occurs post-transcriptionally and involves specific degradation of target mRNA.

Adults feed nectar directly to larvae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Hunt1">[8]</xref>, and this can be mimicked by feeding nectar-like liquids to larvae, providing a vehicle for dsRNA. Specific larvae can be tracked through time by means of &#x02018;nest maps&#x02019;, enabling individual marking of newly-emerged adults. These adults can then be tracked on their nests in field situations or collected for subsequent analyses.</p><p>Here, we develop RNAi for <italic>P. metricus</italic> for experimental applications in natural environments. This approach enables testing of causal relationships between candidate genes (genotype) and their association with behavior and/or caste ecology (phenotype). We exemplify this potential by exploring a central developmental question with significance in behavioral ecology: the role of specific storage proteins in developmental bias toward workers and gynes (future queens of the next generation). Storage proteins are ecologically important gene products that play a role in diapause not only in <italic>Polistes</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Hunt4">[31]</xref> but in a broad range of insects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Chapman1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Hahn1">[33]</xref>. <italic>Polistes metricus</italic> has two putative hexameric storage proteins, Hexamerin 1 and Hexamerin 2.

Fragments of putatively Hexamerin-encoding transcripts are available as ESTs, but it has been unclear how these relate to the two largely uncharacterized <italic>Polistes</italic> proteins.</p><p>We report successful cloning of the Hexamerin 2 encoding gene of <italic>P. metricus</italic> from its available ESTs, and proteomic analyses of the <italic>P. metricus</italic> Hexamerin 1 and Hexamerin 2 proteins.

Subsequently, dsRNA was synthesized for <italic>hexamerin</italic> 2 and a control gene (<italic>gfp &#x02013; green fluorescent protein</italic>), and these were used in a larval feeding experiment with naturally-founded <italic>P. metricus</italic> colonies in the field. We show that larval Hexamerin 2 can be successfully suppressed by RNAi and that the adult caste phenotype of Hexamerin 2 knockdowns is not significantly altered.

Treatment was also not a significant factor in this corrected model that blocked for the effect of location on phenotypic traits (F<sub>1,16</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.040, P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.874, N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10). No interaction was detected between study site and treatment (F<sub>1,16</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.042, P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.840). Next, we took into account that the total nine nests were split between the treatment categories.

We concluded that putative effects of treatment were not confounded by environmental influences or heterogeneity. To conserve degrees of freedom, therefore, factors location and nest were not used for blocking in subsequent analyses.</p><p>We initially used a full, parametric model to analyze the phenotypic dataset. Total developmental time, ovary development, forewing length, and adult feeding were included as dependent variables in a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Total developmental time was summed over the measurements of days to cocoon and days cocooned to avoid a colinearity problem caused by the two variables being significantly negatively associated in the dataset (Pearson correlation, R&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.538, P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.001, N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;22). Egg number was not included due to insufficient data and variability (1 egg was laid by a <italic>gfp</italic> control wasp). The ANOVA suggested that <italic>hexamerin 2</italic> RNAi did not alter the <italic>P. metricus</italic> phenotype. This result was independent of whether ovary development was coded as a binary variable (i.e., ovary being active or not: F<sub>4,17</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2.259, P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.105, N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;11) or as 4 developmental classes (F<sub>4,17</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.961, P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.146, N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;11). The analysis conformed to assumptions of ANOVA, as determined by Bartlett's test and Levene's test on variances and normality plots of residuals.</p><p>Next, we looked at each variable using a non-parametric approach. We found that days cocooned, ovary development (4 classes), forewing length, and adult feeding were similar between <italic>hexamerin 2</italic> knockdowns and <italic>gfp</italic> controls (Mann-Whitney U-test, P&#x0003e;0.05, N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;11, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026641-g006">Fig. 6B, D&#x02013;F</xref>).

Our most significant contribution to RNAi studies is that we then successfully deployed the RNAi tool in a field setting &#x02013; that is, in a natural setting outside the laboratory. We did so in the context of an ecological test of caste differentiation in the eusocial wasp <italic>Polistes</italic>, which is a model system for evolutionary studies of insect sociality and behavioral ecology. The foundational aspects of our work included sequencing the <italic>hexamerin 2</italic> gene, matching the cloned gene to the Hexamerin 2 protein product, and identification of the correspondence between the cloned gene and Hexamerin 2 by mass-spectrometry. Our principal biological finding &#x02013; that Hexamerin 2 plays no role in worker/gyne differentiation &#x02013; coincides with findings from previous studies using other investigative methodologies.</p><p>Our research underscores that <italic>Polistes</italic> is a robust model system, having a rare convergence of assets. Paper wasps, with their 2 dimensional, bare nests allow access for observation and manipulation in their natural environment. As a result, they are a model that can be used to address questions regarding the structure and evolution of insect sociality. Most other social insects have been studied in artificial habitats. Ants and termites nest underground or within solid structures, thus making in-nest observations difficult or impossible in the field. Honey bees, although easily observed and the target of the first insect genome project, are domesticated animals and have been selected for docility and honey production. Our work combines the assets of the <italic>Polistes</italic> model system with tools of genomics deployed in a field setting, augmenting the studies of Toth et al. and Hunt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Hunt2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Hunt4">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Toth2">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Toth3">[39]</xref> and further advancing the <italic>Polistes</italic> model system.</p><p>Our small final sample sizes (11 <italic>hexamerin 2</italic> and 11 <italic>gfp</italic>) could reflect several variables that can be addressed in future RNAi experiments. In order to provide maximum assurance that we treated only gyne-destined larvae, we conducted our experiment in late July and August, corresponding to the mid to late phase of gyne production. Because nest mortality is a normal demographic occurrence, a higher sample size could be obtained by beginning an experiment earlier in the phase of gyne production. To increase the number of nest boxes at the start of a season could also increase the final sample size. The frequency of nest foundings in our nest boxes by <italic>P. metricus</italic> (47/300) was unexpectedly lower than that of previous studies conducted in Missouri, USA.</p><p>The four putative Hexamerin 1 peptide hits (8&#x00025; sequence coverage) toward the Hexamerin 2 sequence in the MALDI experiment could be explained by some level of contamination or by sequence identity in these regions. Because the gene that encodes Hexamerin 1 is not identified, precise sequence similarity estimation between two hexamerins is currently infeasible. Previous studies of other hymenopteran species with sequenced genomes have reported relatively high sequence similarity of multiple hexamerins: up to 42&#x00025; in <italic>A. mellifera</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Martins1">[40]</xref> and 79&#x00025; in the wasp <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Cristino1">[41]</xref>.</p><p>We found that the two putative hexamerins of <italic>P. metricus</italic> are glycosylated. In Hexamerin 2, the putative N-glycosylation sites are located at asparagines 201 and 344. Glycosylation has been shown to have important stabilizing and structural roles in a related storage protein, arylphorin, in <italic>Antheraea pernyi</italic> silk moth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Ryu1">[42]</xref>. Based on SDS-PAGE size-estimation, Hexamerin 1 (&#x0223c;77.7 kDa) lies within the typical hexamerin size scale of 75&#x02013;90 kDa, whereas Hexamerin 2 is smaller than an average hexamerin with its molecular weight of &#x0223c;68.5 kDa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Martins1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Cristino1">[41]</xref>. In addition to differences in size, only Hexamerin 2 appears to be phosphorylated. Phosphorylation can be critical for events ranging from signaling to subcellular protein localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Graves1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Cohen1">[44]</xref>. Hexamerin-receptor interaction is regulated by receptor phosphorylation in rice moth <italic>Corcyra cephalonica</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Arif1">[45]</xref>, but effect of phosphorylation of hexamerin itself are currently unclear. The differences that we found between Hexamerins 1 and 2 in both size and phosphorylation suggest different roles for the two proteins.</p><p>In a previous study using gel band quantification, Hexamerin 1 was significantly differentially expressed between worker-destined and gyne-destined larvae, but that experiment indicated no specific caste-related role for Hexamerin 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Hunt4">[31]</xref>. In the present study we used dsRNA for the <italic>hexamerin 2</italic> gene to specifically down-regulate production of Hexamerin 2 protein. The absence of a significant caste-related response to RNAi down-regulation of Hexamerin 2 confirms the inference of the previous study. However, our detailed statistical analysis suggests possible trends toward extended larval development time and reduced ovary development in knockdowns, which are characteristics of gynes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Hunt4">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Toth3">[39]</xref>. The detailed statistical analysis is warranted, even though the statistical results <italic>per se</italic> are negative, because both positive and negative statistical outcomes are meaningful for interpretation of the study.</p><p>Whereas dsRNA injection studies achieve significant knockdown of the target gene at low dosage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Zhou2">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Tomoyasu1">[47]</xref>, feeding studies generally require a higher dosage to achieve efficient knockdown. Effective knockdown in <italic>Polistes</italic> was achieved using a dosage of dsRNA consistent with feeding studies in honey bees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Wolschin1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Mutti1">[48]</xref> and termites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Zhou1">[22]</xref>. Control (<italic>gfp</italic>) and <italic>hexamerin 2</italic> larvae were fed equally with dsRNA without adverse phenotypic effects, thereby suggesting that the system will be compatible with future RNAi experiments. A next step, therefore, would be to continue investigation of roles played by hexamerins in <italic>P. metricus</italic> worker/queen differentiation using <italic>hexamerin 1</italic> RNAi in a full replication of the study we report here, once transcripts for the <italic>P. metricus hexamerin 1</italic> gene have been identified. Such an investigation could test the possibilities of compensatory or opportunistic upregulation of Hexamerin 1 by Hexamerin 2. Compensation would be physiological &#x02013; to have Hexamerin 1 substitute for Hexamerin 2 in functions that are not yet known. &#x02018;Opportunistic&#x02019; would be that Hexamerin 1 increases because more building blocks are available if less Hexamerin 2 is reduced. In addition, methods such as microarray <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Toth2">[38]</xref> and RNAseq can be employed to identify candidate genes for other ecologically and evolutionarily important traits such as behavioral dominance, seasonal and nutritional affects on the colony cycle, photoperiodicity, and diapause. The genetic foundations of these traits can then be pursued using RNAi in experiments such as we report here. Ever-lower costs of whole genome sequencing using high throughput sequencing techniques, combined with improvements in annotation and comparative analysis methods, now allow genomic tools to be developed for many species. Efforts are currently underway to sequence genomes of two <italic>Polistes</italic> species: <italic>P. dominulus</italic> and <italic>P. canadensis</italic> (A. L. Toth, personal communication). Thus, soon there will be a substantial increase in genome sequence information for <italic>Polistes</italic>. The RNAi tool that we present here, therefore, is an extremely timely step forward that can enhance the use of paper wasps as model systems for the greater synthesis among gene expression, behavioral ecology, and evolutionary biology of social insects. In addition, although there are unique features of <italic>Polistes</italic> biology that make it particularly suitable for RNAi experiments in the field, our work suggests the possibility that RNAi is a tool that can be adapted for experiments on other species in natural environments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Hexamerin sequencing</title><p>Four partial EST sequences for hexamerin (contigs 45616, 45913, 42334 and 40833: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://stan.cropsci.uiuc.edu/454/blast/waspblast.html">http://stan.cropsci.uiuc.edu/454/blast/waspblast.html</ext-link>) were available from the <italic>Polistes</italic> wasp EST data set to design primers.

During the course of the field work we monitored colony development daily by removing the nest box top (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026641-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>) and recording the content of each nest cell (empty, egg, larval instar, or cocoon) on a &#x02018;nest map&#x02019; drawn on hexagon-imprinted paper. We collected colony data in the early mornings, generally before 9 am EDT, which enabled counting the number of adults present before daily foraging had begun.</p><fig id="pone-0026641-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0026641.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Field methods and dsRNA delivery.</title><p><bold>A:</bold> &#x0201c;Wasp boxes&#x0201d; have lift-off lids and wire mesh across the open bottom.

Our RNAi treatments were applied to late 5<sup>th</sup> instar larvae to coincide with peak Hexamerin expression, thus our results are not a consequence of having treated larvae in a time window that might not yield a response signal.</p><p>Only a single dsRNA type was used per nest. For treatments, tubes of dsRNA were placed on ice and transported to the field, where we mixed the dsRNA with 30&#x00025; sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026641-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>) immediately before feeding it to larvae using a standard laboratory pipette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026641-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>). At each feeding we gave each larva 15 &#x000b5;l of the dsRNA/sucrose mix, which they readily accepted. Each larva was treated morning and evening on 2 consecutive days. Each feeding contained 20 &#x000b5;g of dsRNA, therefore a total of 80 &#x000b5;g of dsRNA was administered to each larva. A total of 72 larvae from 10 nests were fed <italic>hexamerin 2</italic> dsRNA, and a total of 56 from 8 nests were fed <italic>gfp</italic> dsRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026641.s005">Table S2</xref>). We identified larvae by location on the nest map. When a fed larva completed growth and spun its cocoon, we marked that cocoon with dots of Testors&#x000ae; enamel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026641-g007">Fig. 7B</xref> inset). We continued nest mapping daily until all fed larvae in a nest had spun cocoons.</p><p>When all fed larvae in a nest had spun cocoons, we transferred that colony to a rearing cage as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Karsai1">[57]</xref>. Adults taken with the nest were anesthetized with CO<sub>2</sub> and examined for wing wear. From 1 to 5 females with wing wear, which characterizes foundresses and workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Toth3">[39]</xref>, were marked with a dot of enamel on the metanotum and caged with the nest. We released any males and females with unworn wings, which were putative gynes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Toth3">[39]</xref>. We removed and discarded all unmarked cocoons and the untreated developing wasps in them as well as any subsequently cocooning individuals. Eggs and pre-cocooning larvae were undisturbed. We held caged colonies in a sheltered outdoor location at the NCSU Honey Bee Research Facility, where each colony was provided with <italic>ad libitum</italic> water and sucrose (rock candy) and a fresh mid-3<sup>rd</sup> instar <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> caterpillar daily. When all treated wasps had emerged from a nest, the remaining colony was returned to its nest box in the field and thereafter not disturbed. The field studies did not involve any endangered or protected species. No specific permits were required for the described field studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Treatment bioassay</title><p>We inspected caged colonies daily at mid-morning and identified newly-emerged wasps by nest map location prior to transporting them to the laboratory and placing each in an isolation cage. Isolation cages had wooden tops and bottoms &#x0223c;8.5 cm on each side. Three sides of the cage were wire mesh (&#x0223c;3 mm openings) &#x0223c;23 cm in height. The fourth side was closed with corrugated cardboard into which a small doorway was cut for daily maintenance. A small, empty, pre-emergence nest (7 to 14 cells) constructed in the preceding year by a <italic>P. metricus</italic> foundress near St. Louis, MO, was affixed to the underside of the top of each cage before the newly-emerged wasp was introduced. Most wasps spent time on those nests.</p><p>Caged wasps were placed in growth chamber C25 in the NCSU Phytotron. The chamber contained incandescent lights on a 16L/8D cycle; fluorescent lights came on 2 h following and went off 2 h before the incandescent lights. Light intensity was 21 micromoles/sec/m<sup>2</sup> in the incandescent-only morning and evening periods and 225 micromoles/sec/m<sup>2</sup> during the both-lights midday. Chamber temperature was 20&#x000b0;C at night and 30&#x000b0;C during full light, with a gradual ramp-up in the morning and ramp-down in the evening. We provided each isolation cage with a small plastic Petri dish containing sucrose (rock candy), a water source (a 1.5 ml microfuge tube plugged with cotton), and, daily, a single small <italic>M. sexta</italic> caterpillar: late 2<sup>nd</sup>-instar or early 3<sup>rd</sup>-instar. Caterpillar head capsules were crushed immediately before provisioning, which ensured that they did not crawl away. Cage maintenance, conducted daily at midday, consisted of replenishing the water (deionized), removing the remains of any uneaten caterpillars, and providing a fresh caterpillar. Time outside the chamber was no more than 2&#x02013;3 min. Each day we repositioned cages within the chamber.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Treatment response variables</title><p>In a previous laboratory experiment with newly-emerged isolated <italic>P. metricus</italic> females, putative workers showed ovarian development whereas putative gynes did not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Bohm1">[11]</xref>. Wasps entering ovary development could be expected to show higher rates of feeding from protein sources than wasps not entering ovary development. Because ovary development occurs in putative workers but not putative gynes, and because ovary development could reflect post-emergence feeding, we quantified both feeding rate and ovary development in order to test whether <italic>hexamerin 2</italic> treatment might induce ovaries more worker-like than those of controls. Beginning the day after being introduced to the chamber, we scored each wasp daily for 12 days as to whether the caterpillar had been eaten. On the 13<sup>th</sup> day we removed each wasp from the chamber, chilled it &#x0223c;10 min in a refrigerator, and removed it from its cage.</p><p>We dissected ovaries (together with the digestive tract) by grasping the terminal segment of the metasoma with fine-point forceps and pulling. Removed tissue was placed in 100&#x00025; EtOH in a labeled microfuge tube and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C. Approximately 2 weeks after the last specimen had been prepared, we transferred the tissue samples to 70&#x00025; EtOH and returned them to &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C. Approximately 2 months later we dissected the tissue specimens in 70&#x00025; EtOH under a dissecting microscope to separate the ovaries from other tissues. We then placed the ovaries in 70&#x00025; EtOH in number-coded 0.2 ml microfuge tubes and held them at laboratory ambient temperature. Approximately 1 month later we digitally photographed each ovary using an Evolution MP Color camera on an Olympus SZX12 microscope with a 1.0&#x000d7; objective lens and the adjustable magnification set at 25&#x000d7;. All images were captured in a single session with no adjustments to the apparatus.</p><p>Four ovary images were selected as representing 4 development classes: 0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;ovaries filamentous with no discernable oocytes; 1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;oocytes discernable but small in size and somewhat translucent; 2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;one or more oocytes opaque (with yolk deposition); 3&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;one or more large ova present (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026641.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). We removed the selected images from the image set, and the remaining images were independently scored 0 to 3 by five non-biologists who compared each image to printed copies of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026641.s003">Figure S3</xref>. For every ovary, we used the mean of these 5 objective scores for analyses. Scorers were blind to the identities of the specimens.</p><p>We clipped the right forewing of each wasp at its base using iris scissors and taped it to a labeled microscope slide with clear tape. We then captured digital images of the wings with the same camera/microscope equipment as for ovaries but with a 0.5&#x000d7; objective lens and with the adjustable magnification set at 10&#x000d7;. All images were captured in a single session with no adjustments to the equipment. We quantified images using ImageJ software. A linear measurement (in pixels) was taken from the proximal closure of the C cell to the distal posterior corner of the 2Rs cell (nomenclature as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026641-Naumann1">[58]</xref>). Wing wear by some wasps when in isolation precluded total wing length measurement. Measurements were blind with regard to which dsRNA a wasp had received. We converted pixel values to mm by quantifying a scale photographed at the same magnification.</p></sec><sec id="s4k"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The nests that received <italic>gfp</italic> and <italic>hexamerin 2</italic> dsRNA treatment to verify <italic>hexamerin 2</italic> knockdown were equally represented at two study sites. For RNAi validation, we collected <italic>gfp</italic> control larvae from six nests and putative <italic>hexamerin 2</italic> knockdown larvae from four nests. Only a single dsRNA was administered in a single nest. Gene expression data were log transformed. We then used a main effects ANOVA in a model with mRNA level as the dependent variable and with qPCR plate (technical blocking factor) and treatment as the dependent variables. The dataset conformed to assumptions of ANOVA, as determined by Bartlett's tests and normality plots of residuals.</p><p>For analyses of individual development and adult bioassays, the <italic>gfp</italic> controls represented five nests at three locations, and the <italic>hexamerin 2</italic> dsRNA treatment group represented four nests and three locations. The majority of the data (20 out of 22 wasps) came from two overlapping sites. To test whether treatment effects could be confounded by environmental influences or heterogeneity between location and nests, we first tested the effect of these two study sites on phenotypic characteristics, using a general linear model with location as random factor, treatment as a fixed effect, and ovary development, total developmental time, forewing length, and number of caterpillars eaten as dependent variables.</p><p>All analyses were performed with Statistica 6.0.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0026641.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>Amino acid alignment of the putative </bold><bold><italic>P. metricus</italic></bold><bold> hexamerin protein with other known insect hexamerin sequences.</bold> <italic>Polistes</italic> sequence was aligned with sequences of from other hymenopteran insects species, <italic>Apis meliferra</italic> (ABR45904), <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic> (XP_001607029) and <italic>Camponotus festinatus</italic> (CAB62053), and dipteran insects, <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (XP_001663961), <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> (XP_001843494) and <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> (XP_321434) using ClustalW version 1.82.
