Here, we show that Hfq is critical for the uropathogenic <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> to effectively colonize the bladder and kidneys in a murine urinary tract infection (UTI) model and to establish burned wound infection of the rats. In this regard, we found the <italic>hfq</italic> mutant induced higher IL-8 and MIF levels of uroepithelial cells and displayed reduced intra-macrophage survival. The loss of <italic>hfq</italic> affected bacterial abilities to handle H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and osmotic pressures and to grow at 50&#x000b0;C. Relative to wild-type, the <italic>hfq</italic> mutant had reduced motility, fewer flagella and less hemolysin expression and was less prone to form biofilm and to adhere to and invade uroepithelial cells. The MR/P fimbrial operon was almost switched to the off phase in the <italic>hfq</italic> mutant. In addition, we found the <italic>hfq</italic> mutant exhibited an altered outer membrane profile and had higher RpoE expression, which indicates the <italic>hfq</italic> mutant may encounter increased envelope stress. With the notion of envelope disturbance in the <italic>hfq</italic> mutant, we found increased membrane permeability and antibiotic susceptibilities in the <italic>hfq</italic> mutant. Finally, we showed that Hfq positively regulated the RpoS level and tolerance to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the stationary phase seemed largely mediated through the Hfq-dependent RpoS expression. Together, our data indicate that Hfq plays a critical role in <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> to establish UTIs by modulating stress responses, surface structures and virulence factors. This study suggests Hfq may serve as a scaffold molecule for development of novel anti-<italic>P. mirabilis</italic> drugs and <italic>P. mirabilis hfq</italic> mutant is a vaccine candidate for preventing UTIs.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from National Science Council (NSC101-2320-B-002-028) and National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.

Numerous cellular processes, such as stress responses, iron homeostasis and outer membrane protein (OMP) biogenesis are subject to the control of sRNAs and Hfq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Chao1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Guillier1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Richards1">[5]</xref>. For the most part, sRNA-mRNA interactions result in mRNA degradation and/or inhibition of translation. It is now known that Hfq is a small (102 amino acids in <italic>E. coli</italic>), conserved RNA chaperone protein present in many bacterial species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Chao1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-DeLay1">[3]</xref>. The importance of Hfq became clear when an <italic>E. coli hfq</italic> null mutant was created. This mutant had pleiotropic phenotypes, such as a decreased growth rate, increased sensitivity to cellular stresses, and increased cell length <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Tsui1">[6]</xref>.</p><p>For most bacteria, <italic>hfq</italic> mutation resulted in diverse phenotypic changes. In striking contrast, deletion of <italic>hfq</italic> in <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strains did not result in any detectable phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Bohn1">[7]</xref>. The role of Hfq in the pathogenesis of several bacterial species has been examined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Chao1">[1]</xref>. <italic>hfq</italic> mutation in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium results in severe attenuation for virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Sittka1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Simonsen1">[9]</xref>.

Since catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CA-UTI) is a major health concern due to the complications and recurrence, researches directed at understanding the pathogenesis are warranted. The successful colonization of the urinary tract requires that <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> overcome a barrage of innate host defenses, including the shear flow of urine, the antibacterial molecules, the influx of neutrophils, and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Jacobsen1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Nielubowicz1">[15]</xref>. Common strategies of UTI pathogenesis employed by <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> include fimbria- mediated adhesion and invasion of the uroepithelium, flagella-mediated motility, stress responses, biofilm formation and avoidance of host immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Nielubowicz1">[15]</xref>. How <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> adapts to ever-changing host milieu is still a mystery. Hfq and sRNA have received considerable attention for their functions in fine-tuning gene expression to facilitate bacterial adaptation. Considering stress tolerance is central to the ability of many bacterial pathogens to successfully colonize hostile host environments and Hfq and sRNAs are key regulators of stress response pathways in other bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Chao1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Guillier1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Richards1">[5]</xref>, we were interested in understanding how Hfq might contribute to the virulence of uropathogenic <italic>P. mirabilis</italic>.</p><p>Thus far, nothing is known about the role of Hfq in <italic>P. mirabilis</italic>. We employed a mouse model of UTI to show that Hfq is critical for <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> to effectively colonize within the urinary tract. We demonstrated that Hfq affected a number of virulence-related <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> phenotypes, including motility, biofilm formation, and resistance to stresses such as ROS and high osmolarity. In addition, we investigate the correlation of Hfq with RpoS and RpoE. This is the first report about the role of <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> Hfq.

RpoE-regulated sRNAs are involved in OMP expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Thompson1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Papenfort1">[47]</xref> and there is ample evidence of fine tuning of bacterial OMP expression by Hfq-dependent sRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-FigueroaBossi1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Papenfort1">[47]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Vogel1">[49]</xref>. For example, RpoE-regulated sRNAs, MicA and RybB, of <italic>Salmonella</italic> respond to membrane stress by accelerating OMP mRNA decay in an Hfq-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Papenfort1">[47]</xref>. Besides, a conserved sRNA, MicM, promotes silencing of the OMP YbfM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Vogel1">[49]</xref>. Two lines of evidence suggest that RpoE-regulated sRNAs are involved in Hfq-mediated OMP homeostasis of <italic>P. mirabilis</italic>. First, <italic>P. mirabilis hfq</italic> mutation leads to changes of OMPs and upregulation of RpoE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085626-g006">Figure 6A, 6B</xref>). Second, we found <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> RpoE positively regulated expression of RybB by the reporter assay and <italic>hfq</italic> mutation decreased RybB level (our unpublished data). It is worth noting that YbfM and MicM counterparts exist in the <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> HI4320 genome. Further analyses are underway not only to characterize the OMP targets of Hfq (PMI1017, OmpA) but also to investigate the role of RybB and MicM in <italic>P. mirabilis</italic>.</p><p>Relative to <italic>rseA</italic> mutant and wild-type, which exhibited a similar ability to colonize the mouse urinary tract, the <italic>rpoE</italic> mutant had significantly lower colonization of the urinary tract (our unpublished data). We found <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> hfq mutant had higher RpoE expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085626-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) but exhibited impaired colonization of the urinary tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085626-g002">Figure 2</xref>). These data indicate that both RpoE and Hfq are required for colonization. Indeed, increased RpoE in <italic>V. cholerae hfq</italic> mutant also doesn't account for this strain's colonization deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Ding1">[11]</xref>. This is not surprising for RpoE-regulated sRNAs and Hfq are functional partners. It is possible that the RpoE-regulated sRNAs, in conjunction with Hfq, are critical regulators of OMP biogenesis, motility, and adherence to and invasion of uroepithelial cells, which all are important factors for <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> to colonize the urinary tract and cause UTI. Therefore, reduced colonization was observed in either <italic>rpoE</italic> or <italic>hfq</italic> mutant. Of course, loss of <italic>rpoE</italic> may be defective for entirely different reasons, leading to lower colonization.</p><p>The drug sensitivities of <italic>P. mirabilis hfq</italic> mutant in this study may be due to increased cell permeability or misregulation of outer membrane channels for drugs, which was supported by the increased SDS susceptibility and the OMP changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085626-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), respectively. Recently, a sRNA has been shown to participate in regulating drug efflux proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Nishino1">[50]</xref> and Hfq has been shown to affect drug susceptibilities by regulating expression of AcrAB efflux system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Yamada1">[51]</xref>. Alternatively, the increased drug susceptibilities of <italic>P. mirabilis hfq</italic> mutant leave open the possibility that Hfq may also influence multidrug resistance by regulating efflux systems. <italic>acrAB</italic> genes exist in the <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> HI4320 genome. Investigation of the correlation of AcrAB efflux pump with Hfq/sRNAs is underway to elucidate the role of Hfq in <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> drug susceptibilities.</p><p>Two Hfq-dependent sRNAs, DsrA and RprA, have been demonstrated to activate the expression of <italic>rpoS</italic> through a mechanism whereby basepairing of the sRNAs disrupts an inhibitory secondary structure formed by the <italic>rpoS</italic> mRNA leader sequence and the absence of Hfq caused the reduced translation efficiency of <italic>rpoS</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Gottesman1">[37]</xref>. The decreased transcript level of <italic>rpoS</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085626-g007">Figure 7A</xref>) in <italic>P. mirabilis hfq</italic> mutant suggests the existence of Hfq-dependent transcriptional activators of <italic>rpoS</italic> or the possibility that a loss of <italic>hfq</italic> affects the stability of <italic>rpoS</italic> transcript. In this regard, <italic>hfq</italic> mutation in <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> also caused a dramatic decrease in <italic>rpoS</italic> mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Chiang1">[48]</xref>. Knowing production of catalase was affected by both Hfq and RpoS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Sonnleitner1">[13]</xref>, we found either <italic>rpoS</italic> or <italic>hfq</italic> mutation resulted in a severe defect in tolerance to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085626-g007">Figure 7B</xref>) accordingly. With respect to the poor restoration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> tolerance by introduction of the RpoS-expressing plasmid into the <italic>hfq</italic> mutant, it appears that Hfq/sRNAs are required for the translational activation of RpoS and the presence of RpoS-expressing plasmid alone fails to rescue <italic>hfq</italic> mutant from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> killing. It's worth noting that the RprA counterpart is present in the <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> HI4320 genome.</p><p>To elucidate Hfq-regulatory circuits that are involved in the pathogenesis of <italic>P. mirabilis</italic>, co-immunoprecipitation assays should be carried out with Flag-tagged Hfq and combined with RNAseq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085626-Sittka2">[52]</xref> to identify all of the sRNAs that directly interact with Hfq, as well as mRNA binding partners.</p><p>In summary, this study implies Hfq as a pivotal coordinator for a diversity of regulatory circuits including surface and/or cellular components. We have demonstrated that the loss of Hfq significantly attenuates <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> colonization in mouse model of infection and leads to pleiotropic defects in stress tolerance, motility, invasion, biofilm formation, and resistance to antimicrobial agents. In this regard, it is tempting to suggest that Hfq may serve as a scaffold molecule for the design of novel antibacterial drugs and the <italic>hfq</italic> mutant is a vaccine candidate for preventing <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> UTI.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dr. Yeong-Shiau Pu (National Taiwan University Hospital) for providing the NTUB1 cell line, and Dr.
