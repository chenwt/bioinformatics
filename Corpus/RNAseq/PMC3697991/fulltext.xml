However, there still exists considerable discrepancy on gene expression measurements and DEG results between the two platforms. The objective of this study was to compare parallel paired-end RNA-Seq and microarray data generated on 5-azadeoxy-cytidine (5-Aza) treated HT-29 colon cancer cells with an additional simulation study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We first performed general correlation analysis comparing gene expression profiles on both platforms. An Errors-In-Variables (EIV) regression model was subsequently applied to assess proportional and fixed biases between the two technologies. Then several existing algorithms, designed for DEG identification in RNA-Seq and microarray data, were applied to compare the cross-platform overlaps with respect to DEG lists, which were further validated using qRT-PCR assays on selected genes. Functional analyses were subsequently conducted using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients between the RNA-Seq and microarray data each exceeded 0.80, with 66%~68% overlap of genes on both platforms. The EIV regression model indicated the existence of both fixed and proportional biases between the two platforms. The DESeq and baySeq algorithms (RNA-Seq) and the SAM and eBayes algorithms (microarray) achieved the highest cross-platform overlap rate in DEG results from both experimental and simulated datasets. DESeq method exhibited a better control on the false discovery rate than baySeq on the simulated dataset although it performed slightly inferior to baySeq in the sensitivity test. RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR, but not microarray data, confirmed the expected reversal of <italic>SPARC </italic>gene suppression after treating HT-29 cells with 5-Aza. Thirty-three IPA canonical pathways were identified by both microarray and RNA-Seq data, 152 pathways by RNA-Seq data only, and none by microarray data only.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results suggest that RNA-Seq has advantages over microarray in identification of DEGs with the most consistent results generated from DESeq and SAM methods. The EIV regression model reveals both fixed and proportional biases between RNA-Seq and microarray. This may explain in part the lower cross-platform overlap in DEG lists compared to those in detectable genes.</p></sec></abstract><conference><conf-date>21-23 May 2012</conf-date><conf-name>8th International Symposium on Bioinformatics Research and Applications (ISBRA'12)</conf-name><conf-loc>Dallas, TX, USA</conf-loc></conference></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In recent years, RNA-Seq emerged as an appealing alternative to classical microarrays in measuring global genomic expressions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The RNA-Seq technology has been applied to many human pathological studies such as prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], neurodegenerative disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], retina defection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Gene detection in RNA-Seq, unlike microarray, is not dependent on probe design; rather it relies on short nucleotide reads mapping which can attain exceedingly high resolution. Furthermore, the RNA-Seq gene counts cover a larger dynamic range than microarray probe hybridization based design. On the other hand, microarray technology is still widely used because of lower costs and wider availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Previous studies comparing parallel RNA-Seq with microarray data have reported good correlation between the two platforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. While classical correlation approaches can evaluate the strength of the association between the two platforms, they have been insufficient in gauging proportional and fixed biases between the two platforms. Given the uncertainties in measuring gene expressions for both platforms, we have therefore applied the Errors-In-Variables (EIV) regression model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The EIV model is a more suitable regression method for this type of platform comparison because (1) it reflects measurement errors from both platforms, (2) its goodness-of-fit measure reflects the Pearson correlation, yet with the added advantages of (3) providing a measure for fixed bias and, a measure for proportional bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>A major rationale for conducting global transcriptomic studies is to identify genes that are differentially expressed between two or more biological conditions. In previous comparisons of the differentially expressed gene (DEG) lists generated using parallel RNA-Seq and microarray data, the biological groups that were studied were often very different (e.g. liver vs. kidney, or malignant breast cell line vs. normal breast cell line) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In the current study, parallel sets of RNA-Seq and Affymetrix microarray data were generated on a single HT-29 colon cancer cell line that was treated with and without 5-aza-deoxy-cytidine (5-Aza), a DNA methylation enzyme inhibitor. The concentrations of 5-Aza used in the present study (0 &#x003bc;M, 5 &#x003bc;M and 10 &#x003bc;M), approximated or exceeded the concentration previously reported to reverse hypermethylation of the <italic>SPARC </italic>(EMBL: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="ENSG00000113140">ENSG00000113140</ext-link>) gene promoter and reverse suppression of <italic>SPARC </italic>mRNA expression in HT-29 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In this study, paired ends 100bp RNA-Seq data was generated as opposed to single end RNA-Seq data described in similar reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Moreover, most of the previous studies comparing the two platforms were usually based on one or two DEG detection methods, which were relatively outdated or not inclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Our study surveyed an array of currently used algorithms to identify DEGs in parallel for both microarray and RNA-Seq data. We sought to determine which pair of microarray and RNA-Seq algorithms would yield the largest overlap in the DEG lists under the same statistical significance level. A simulation study was further conducted using published parallel RNA-Seq and microarray datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], to assess the consistency of different DEG methods across platforms and their ability in identifying true positives. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays (qRT-PCR) was used to assay expression of the <italic>SPARC </italic>gene and other DEGs selected by using 1) both datasets, 2) RNASeq data only and 3) microarray data only. Finally we determined which Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) canonical pathways were identified by 1) both datasets, 2) RNASeq data only and 3) microarray data only.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>5-Aza treatment of HT-29 cells</title><p>The HT-29 (ATCC) colon cancer cell line was maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% kanamycin, streptomycin-penicillin, and incubated at 37&#x000b0; C and 5% CO2. Three replicative 150 mm cultures were treated with: 1) dimethyl sulfoxide (vehicle alone, 0 &#x003bc;M 5-Aza); 2) 5 &#x003bc;M 5-Aza and 3) 10 &#x003bc;M 5-Aza; for five days. These 5-Aza concentrations are similar and greater than the 5-Aza concentration previously reported to increase apoptosis, alter genome methylation as well as mRNA gene expression in HT-29 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The HT-29 cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline on the plate prior to scraping and centrifuging the cells. Total RNA was extracted separately from each of these nine cultures using TRI Reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The RNA quality was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Tech., Palo Alto, CA) to have a RNA Integrity Number score <italic>&#x02265; </italic>7. Each of the nine RNA samples was used to generate parallel RNA-Seq, microarray and qRT-PCR data.</p></sec><sec><title>Illumina RNA-Seq data</title><p>Aliquots (1 &#x003bc;g) of nine RNA samples (triplicate samples for each of three experimental conditions), were subjected to paired-ends 100 bp Illumina sequencing. The RNA-Seq libraries were prepared and sequenced at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). In brief, mRNA was purified and fragmented, followed by cDNA synthesis with random hexamers. This product then underwent end repair, adapter ligation, and size selection using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA) to isolate DNA templates of 320nt fragments and to remove excess adapters. The cDNA was PCR amplified. Each library was sequenced using Illumina 2000 sequencer (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) on 2 lanes of the flow cell. Between 41 and 88 million reads were generated for each of the RNA samples. The sequences were filtered using FASTX-Toolkit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] to remove sequences with low Phred scores (~ first 3 nucleotides). The short reads fastq files were processed using Tophat (v2.0.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and mapped to the reference Ensembl human genome 19 using default settings for paired reads. Cufflink program (version 1.3.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] or HTSeq-count (v 0.5.3p7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] were subsequently employed to convert aligned short reads (BAM format) into Fragments Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped fragments (FPKM) or raw gene counts. In the following step, a filter procedure was applied to remove gene entries with max alignment number of &#x0003c; 10 in all three replicates of the experimental groups (control or 0 &#x003bc;M, 5 &#x003bc;M and 10 &#x003bc;M 5-Aza).

Note each RNA sample was hybridized to a separate microarray chip. Microarray data were preprocessed using Bioconductor's <italic>affy </italic>package followed by a custom filter procedure to retain the probe entries that were present in all three biological triplicates of one experimental group (control or 0 &#x003bc;M, 5 &#x003bc;M and 10 &#x003bc;M 5-Aza). RMA normalization was applied to scale the replicates to a comparable range. If multiple probes on the array corresponded to a single gene, the probe with the highest intensities was used to represent the gene intensity. The microarray data have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE41364.</p></sec><sec><title>Platform comparison based on gene expression levels and correlations</title><p>General between-platform association analysis was applied to compare RNA-Seq with microarray data profiles. This includes a detectable gene determination for each group after the filter procedure, in which detectable genes were identified and compared respectively between the two platforms. In addition, the general gene expression profiles from RNA-Seq or microarray were examined in a scatter plot with Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients calculated for all the genes (including those removed by the filtering procedure). Detectable genes which are RNA-Seq exclusive were compared to the overlapped ones using expression intensity histograms. This analysis was performed to verify the sensitivity of RNA-Seq technology in detecting genes expressed at low levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Errors-In-Variables (EIV) regression model</title><p>Both normalized microarray data and RNA-Seq FPKM values were transformed into log2 scale and subsequently converted to unit-free ratios by dividing a pre-selected housekeeping gene, <italic>ZNF311</italic>(EMBL: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="ENSG00000197935">ENSG00000197935</ext-link>).

The true expression levels of simulated genes were sampled from this empirical distribution in such a way that: a histogram of true data was generated using 500 bins at first step; a simulated gene was then assinged to a bin based on the frequency with a small turbulance added to its value. Uniform distribution (ranging the length of the bin) was assumed to the turbulance term to differentiate genes in the same group. As a result, the transformed expression level of a gene at a certain x% quantile of a given sample is equal to the same x% quantile of g(y) in terms of distribution + a small turbulance. The turbulance added same effect of variation to every gene because of the variance stablizing transformation.</p><p>The RNA-Seq data were fitted in a negative binomial model as described by Kvam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].

In practice, the distribution of &#x003bb; was slightly rescaled to the range of the real data. Subsequently, we sampled both microarray g(y) and RNA-Seq &#x003bb; of 10,000 genes from each corresponding distribution with a strict rule on quantile consistency (any gene of the &#x003b1; percentile of one distribution shall have the same quantile in the other dataset). In reality, sample percentile converge to distribution percentile when sample size is large, therefore a Spearman correlation of 1 was approximated in our simulated data sets across platforms.</p><p>Pre-defined significant DEGs were randomly sampled so that the log fold changes of these preset DEGs were generated from a mixed normal distribution where the probabilities of being up and down regulated were both equal. Moreover, in our analysis, the absolute expectation of log fold changes and standard errors for up and down regulated genes were set to be the same.</p><p>In practice, we generated 10 sets of simulated data in practice with 5 replicates included in both treatment and control group and 1000 random selected genes were preset to be differently expressed in different levels using a method of 95% minimum fold change such that the 1000 preset <italic>bona fida </italic>DEGs were generated with their fold changes following a log-normal distribution with 95% of the 1000 genes having their fold changes above the given level.

For NOISeq method, a q = 0.8 (recommended by NOISeq author) criterion was used due to the absence of FDR control in this method. We further evaluated the sensitivity and false positive rate of each DEG algorithm by varying the differential significance levels of the preset 1000 genes using 95% minimum fold change method. Specifically, a range of values from 0.5 to 4 by an increment of 0.5 were used to generate the simulated DEGs.</p></sec><sec><title>qRT-PCR analysis of control HT-29 RNA samples vs. 5 &#x003bc;M 5-Aza treated HT-29 RNA samples</title><p>Reverse transcription was performed on 5 &#x003bc;g aliquots of each of the six RNA samples using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Thirteen genes were selected by the majority vote of platform specific DEG detection methods and are categorized into 3 groups, which are: 1) commonly identified on RNA-Seq and microarray datasets; 2) RNA-Seq data only and 3) microarray data only.

On average, the Illumina RNA-Seq detected ~29.0% more genes than its microarray counterpart and a significant portion (~22.1%) of the RNA-Seq specific genes did not have corresponding probe sets on the array. The overlap rates of the genes detected by both RNA-Seq and microarray datasets for the 0 &#x003bc;M, 5 &#x003bc;M and 10 &#x003bc;M 5-Aza HT-29 cultures, respectively, ranged between 66.8-68.6% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). We further profiled the expression pattern of all genes from both platforms and observed a general linear relationship between the two data sources. Both Pearson and the Spearman correlation coefficients were evaluated for each group and the results (Pearson correlation r = 0.81 ~ 0.83, Spearman correlation r<sub>s </sub>= 0.87 ~ 0.89, P value &#x0003c;&#x0003c; 1&#x000d7;10<sup>-10</sup>) indicated a strong correlation between the two platforms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).

We further examined the widely-reported sensitivity advantage of RNA-Seq over microarray platform. Group-wise density histograms were generated to examine the distribution of the commonly detectable genes and those having corresponding probes on the array yet are exclusively identified by RNA-Seq (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The histogram clearly showed disparate peaks between the two categories of genes with the overlapped ones forming a higher peak at the upper level of the expression scale and the microarray bereft genes mainly distributed at the lower end of the axis.

The threshold was set at fold-change &#x0003e; 2 or less than 0.5 and a false discovery rate &#x02264; 0.05 for all of the eight algorithms except NOISeq. Since setting a fold change was not an option for NOISeq, we set a threshold of q = 0.8 and then subsequently filtered the selected genes with a threshold of fold-change &#x0003e; 2 or less than 0.5. Treatment of HT-29 cells with 5 &#x003bc;M 5-Aza (compared to the control HT-29 cells) resulted in up-regulation (&#x02191;) and down-regulation (&#x02193;) of genes.

All of the algorithms demonstrated an overall upregulation of gene expression after treatment of 5 &#x003bc;M 5-Aza.

The 5-Aza concentrations were chosen to approximate and exceed the concentration previously reported to increase apoptosis and alter genome methylation as well as mRNA gene expression in HT-29 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Specifically reversal of hypermethylation of the <italic>SPARC </italic>promoter and reversal of suppression of <italic>SPARC </italic>gene expression were reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The RNA-Seq technology is rapidly advancing, hence paired-end rather than single end RNA-Seq data were generated for this study.</p><p>We first examined the detection sensitivity for both platforms. RNA-Seq detected more genes than microarray, particularly among genes expressed at low levels. This observation is consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The higher sensitivity of RNA-Seq can be attributed to its detection mechanism based on single-read/nucleotide resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The microarray gene quantification results largely depend on the accuracy of probe fluorescence scanning; background signal and other confounding factors (e.g. stains on array surface) may conceal the real genetic signal for a probe having a low abundance. In this perspective, the difference in detection mechanism confers a natural advantage to RNA-Seq comparing to microarray. The genomic ranges covered by both platforms also differ significantly. In addition, RNA-Seq detects all sequences that are expressed and basically surveys all the known genes provided by hg19 reference genome (N = 23,368), whereas microarray only examines genes based on the predesigned probe sets included on the array (N = 18,209). The correlation analysis confirmed strong general concordance on the gene expression measurements across platforms. Both Pearson and the Spearman correlation coefficients between the two technologies were found well above 0.8 with P values &#x0003c;&#x0003c; 0.001 indicating the data were in comparable quality to previously reported parallel microarray and RNA-Seq datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Furthermore, the EIV regression model was applied since the classical correlation based analysis is insufficient in gauging the quantitative concordance of the two platforms and the existence of random errors in both measurements rendered the traditional ordinary least regression method unsuitable in the current case. As per our study, the EIV regression revealed the existence of both fixed and proportional biases between the microarray and RNA-Seq platforms. We found that the fixed bias plays a minor part while the proportional bias is the major source of discrepancy between the two platforms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Basically, an estimated fixed bias at -0.24 on the log2 scale reflected a trivial baseline difference, whereas an estimated ~1.45 proportional bias meant that a unit change on microarray gene intensity on the log2 scale corresponded to about 1.45 units change for RNA-Seq on the log2 scale. This regression model is consistent with the observation that RNA-Seq was more sensitive and exhibited a larger dynamic range than its microarray counterparts in measuring the expression level of the same transcript.</p><p>Since the major goal of conducting global transcriptomic studies is to identify genes that are differentially expressed between two or more biological groups, this study applied several DEG algorithms designed for either microarray or RNA-Seq data. Two of the most widely used microarray DEG algorithms in recent years, SAM and eBayes, are included in this study. The classical T-test, which is known to perform relatively poorly in microarray analysis was also evaluated as a "control" method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. While microarray data produces a continuous intensity, which commonly follows a log-normal distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], the RNA-Seq gene expression level is discrete or digital in nature. The microarray DEG algorithms are based on continuous distribution of random variables (after log transformation of the probe hybridization intensities). On the other hand, RNA-Seq DEG algorithms are rapidly evolving. The earlier studies mostly relied on algorithms assuming a Poisson distribution on the gene counts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] while the more recent methods utilized a negative binomial model which was considered better than Poisson assumption in explaining biological variability of the RNA-Seq data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. This study considers several of the currently used, popular RNA-Seq DEG algorithms: Cuffdiff, baySeq and DESeq which are roughly based on the negative binomial modeling of RNA-Seq data and the nonparametric SAMSeq and NOISeq methods, which are relatively model-free. Each of the methods has its own virtue and relevance: the Cuffdiff method is built to incorporate biological variability information (e.g. isoforms and fragment assignment uncertainty) from the initial short reads input. In baySeq algorithm, the estimate of significance is based on an empirical Bayes approach, which ranks the DEGs by posterior probabilities of the treatment group. DESeq assumes a locally linear relationship between variance and mean expression level. The SAMSeq algorithm, on the other hand, differs from the aforementioned algorithms by identifying DEGs using a Wilcoxon rank based nonparametric approach, which is relatively free from model biases. Lastly, the NOISeq algorithm evaluates the log-ratio of normalized counts (M value) versus their absolute difference (D value) and determined their differential significance by comparing to the noise distribution, and is designed to overcome the sequencing depth dependency commonly seen in other DEG methods.</p><p>Our simulation experiment using preset, true-positive genes at a minimal fold change of 2, demonstrated maximal cross-platform overlaps in the DEG lists generated by two of the RNA-Seq algorithms, baySeq and DESeq, and by two microarray methods, eBayes and SAM (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). These observations are consistent with our results obtained using the HT-29 experimental data. Note however, that we were not able to evaluate the Cuffdiff algorithm using the simulated dataset. When the sensitivity of all the DEG methods were also examined in our study, the results showed that baySeq performed best among all RNA-Seq algorithms evaluated, in identifying true positive genes at each 95% minimal fold-change level. This observation is consistent with a previous study in which baySeq was found superior in ranking genes by significance to be declared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. DESeq tails immediately after baySeq in sensitivity curves and performed comparably well at lower fold change levels (e.g. log2 fold change ~ 1.5). The microarray DEG algorithms, SAM and eBayes, were generally found less sensitive than RNA-Seq programs.</p><p>With respect to FDR evaluation, however, baySeq resulted in more false positive calls than most of the other RNA-Seq algorithms except for NOISeq, especially when the 95% minimum fold changes of true positive genes are higher (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, <bold>right section</bold>). DESeq constantly results in the lowest FDR among all the RNA-Seq algorithms evaluated in the simulation experiments, indicating its superior reliability. The NOISeq showed a very poor performance on FDR evaluation curve particularly with lower 95% minimal fold change thresholds (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, <bold>left section</bold>), reflecting the fact that NOISeq's DEG discerning power by comparing noise distribution against a true signal was seriously compromised when the 'true difference' is less remarkable. In practice, it is of theoretical importance to weigh more on preventing false positives than false negatives; we thus favor DESeq over Bayseq in RNA-Seq analysis as the former method controls FDR better than the latter in higher differential significance level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, <bold>right section</bold>).</p><p>Of the two microarray DEG algorithms, SAM slightly outperforms Ebayes in both sensitivity and FDR evaluation. The traditional T-test with BH correction, not surprisingly, showed a very poor performance in identifying true positives, probably due to its inappropriate independence assumption. When we view our results from the perspective of platform comparison, it is generally expected that DESeq and SAM can lead to consistent and reasonable DEG results -- an observation which is exactly reflected in our HT-29 experiment (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>Finally, to begin to address the biological significance of these studies, we undertook to validate that treatment of HT-29 colon cancer cells with 5 &#x003bc;M 5-Aza would relieve suppression of <italic>SPARC </italic>gene expression. While this anticipated outcome was confirmed using both the RNA-Seq data and qRT-PCR data, it was not observed in the microarray data. In addition a higher percentage of other DEGs identified using both platforms or RNA-Seq only was confirmed by qRT-PCR than the DEGs identified using microarray alone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A strong correlation of genomic expression profiles was observed between the microarray and RNA-Seq platforms with the latter technology detecting more genes across the genome. Remarkable differences between the two platforms in terms of (1) the existence of both fixed and proportional biases detected by the errors-in-variable (EIV) regression model, and (2) discrepancies in DEG identification have been discovered in our study. We further confirmed that the DEG discrepancies are mostly related to the different algorithms used for both platforms. Among all the DEG algorithms surveyed in this study, the largest cross-platform overlaps were observed between the DEG lists generated by two RNA-Seq algorithms, baySeq and DESeq, and the DEG lists generated by two microarray algorithms, SAM and eBayes, from the HT-29 experimental dataset. The simulation studies, which did not include evaluation of Cuffdiff, indicate that the the DESeq algorithm outperformed the other RNA-Seq algorithms, based upon the combined considerations of sensitivity and false discovery rate. DESeq also demonstrated the highest overlap rate with the DEG list generated by SAM from the microarray data. Overall, the nonparametric based DEG methods such as SAMSeq or NOISeq exhibited suboptimal performance compared to their parametric counterparts, partly due to the limited number of replicates. QRT-PCR validated a higher percentage of the DEGs identified by both platforms and RNA-Seq only, than the DEGs identified by microarray only. Finally, while there were common IPA canonical pathways identified by both microarray and RNA-Seq data, a large number of additional canonical pathways were identified by RNA-Seq data alone. No additional canonical pathways were identified by microarray data alone.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations used</title><p>5-Aza: 5-azadeoxy-cytidine; EIV: Errors-In-Variables; DEG: differentially expressed genes; FDR: false discovery rate; FC: fold change; qRT-PCR: quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>W.R.M. has participated in Illumina sponsored meetings over the past four years and received travel reimbursement and an honorarium for presenting at these events.
