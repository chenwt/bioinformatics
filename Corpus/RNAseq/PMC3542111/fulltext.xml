High population density is empirically considered to induce prophylactic immunity to reduce the infection risk, which was challenged by a model of low connectivity between infectious and susceptible individuals in crowded animals. The migratory locust, which exhibits polyphenism through gregarious and solitary phases in response to population density and displays different resistance to fungal biopesticide (<italic>Metarhizium anisopliae</italic>), was used to observe the prophylactic immunity of crowded animals. We applied an RNA-sequencing assay to investigate differential expression in fat body samples of gregarious and solitary locusts before and after infection. Solitary locusts devoted at least twice the number of genes for combating <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> infection than gregarious locusts. The transcription of immune molecules such as pattern recognition proteins, protease inhibitors, and anti-oxidation proteins, was increased in prophylactic immunity of gregarious locusts. The differentially expressed transcripts reducing gregarious locust susceptibility to <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> were confirmed at the transcriptional and translational level. Further investigation revealed that locust GNBP3 was susceptible to proteolysis while GNBP1, induced by <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> infection, resisted proteolysis. Silencing of <italic>gnbp3</italic> by RNAi significantly shortened the life span of gregarious locusts but not solitary locusts. By contrast, <italic>gnbp1</italic> silencing did not affect the life span of both gregarious and solitary locusts after <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> infection. Thus, the GNBP3-dependent immune responses were involved in the phenotypic resistance of gregarious locusts to fungal infection, but were redundant in solitary locusts. Our results indicated that gregarious locusts prophylactically activated upstream modulators of immune cascades rather than downstream effectors, preferring to quarantine rather than eliminate pathogens to conserve energy meanwhile increasing the &#x0201c;distance&#x0201d; of infectious and target individuals. Our study has obvious implications for bio-pesticides management of crowded pests, and for understanding disease epidemics and adaptiveness of pathogens.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The wide application of fungal biopesticides for insect management has led to concerns over the development of biopesticide resistance. The migratory locust, a globally notorious agricultural pest, has density-dependent phase changes between solitary and gregarious states. The gregarious locusts displayed longer life spans than solitary locusts after biopesticide <italic>Metarhizium anisopliae</italic> infection. We analyzed prophylactic immunity of the locusts in phase change adaptation by transcriptome analysis. Gregarious locusts optimized immunity by investing more in molecules of upstream immune cascades including pattern recognition proteins, anti-oxidation proteins, protease inhibitors and serine protease. High levels of pattern recognition proteins guided deposition of immune products onto pathogens reducing growth, proliferation and transmission. This prophylactic immunity of gregarious locusts emphasized on quarenteening <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> pathogens in early infection, which decreased individuals' infection risk in a population and avoids disease epidemics. Pest outbreaks mostly occur in high population densities, thereby, diminishing entomopathogen biopesticide efficiency. Our results provide an insight to an organism's &#x0201c;enhanced&#x0201d; immunity induced by population densities and inspires new paradigms to understand biopesticide tolerance and disease epidemics in the future.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (No: 2012CB114102), the grant of Natural Science Foundation of China (No: 30830022), the Knowledge Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (KSCX2-EW-N-5), and the National High-tech R&#x00026;D Program of China (No: 2006AA10Z236).

Changes in population density usually induce polyphenic transition and variations in the immune response of animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003102-Rolff1">[1]</xref>. The locust, globally notorious agricultural pests that have been controlled with fungal biopesticides for decades, exhibits phenotypic changes during solitary or gregarious phases in response to low or high population densities, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003102-Pener1">[2]</xref>. Differences in morphology, behavior and physiology have been observed between the two locust phases. Gregarious locusts (<italic>Schistocerca gregaria</italic>) have longer life spans than solitary locusts in response to treatment with a lethal fungal biopesticide (<italic>Metarhizium anisopliae var. acridum</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003102-Wilson1">[3]</xref>. The altered susceptibility of gregarious locusts through changes in population density potentially enhance the risk of fungal biopesticide resistance and provide an ideal model system for investigating the environmental factors that modulate the phenotypic immunity of locusts.</p><p>High population densities increase the risk of infection by individuals through contact and injury from cannibalism, which require relatively higher investments into host immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003102-Srygley1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003102-Barnes1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003102-Bazazi1">[6]</xref>. However, several gregarious insects display low total hemocyte counts and decreased phenoloxidase (PO) activity, previously postulated to have arisen from the increasing the &#x0201c;distance&#x0201d; between the susceptible individuals and infected individuals, due to the gap filled by more healthy individuals after crowding, resulting in a relatively lower risk of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003102-Wilson2">[7]</xref>. This assumption from Watve's model depends on the increasing Euclidean or behavioral distance between the susceptible individuals and infected individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003102-Watve1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003102-Wilson3">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003102-Miller1">[10]</xref>. That is, any physiological or behavioral characteristics of host (such as rapid wound healing after injury or cannibalism, allogrooming after pathogen attachment to body surfaces and other hygienic activities) beneficial to inhibiting output of pathogens particles from infectious individuals and increasing the &#x0201c;distance&#x0201d; between hosts ensures the health of crowded individuals. Previous observations of altered immunity in high-density populations were largely incomprehensive because the prophylactic investment in immunity could be emphasized either on behavioral defenses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003102-Elliot1">[11]</xref> or physiological defense, displaying the defense strategies from pathogens elimination to the control of pathogens proliferation, spread and damages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003102-Lazzaro1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003102-Raberg1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003102-Medzhitov1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003102-Ayres1">[15]</xref>. Therefore, it is essential to find indicators for the evaluation of density dependent prophylaxis either in physiological or behavioral defenses.</p><p>Unlike behavioral defenses, physiological defenses are largely depend on distinctive, efficient, and dedicated immune responses. When fungi germinate on insect integument and penetrate into their hemocoel, fungal molecular patterns (mostly &#x003b2;-1,3-glucans) and virulent factors (PR1) from the growing hyphae are detected by insect immune surveillance molecules such as glucan recognition proteins (GNBP/GRP) and persephone (PSH). In response to the fungal invasion, the insect immune system initiates series of defenses such as humoral melanization, fungal &#x003b2;-1,3-glucan degradation, assembly of attack complex and production of intracellular antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003102-Ferrandon1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003102-Matskevich1">[17]</xref>. The relatively simple immune system of invertebrates allows for the comprehensive observation of resource allocation in immune cascades and for further understanding of the host defense strategy in response to changes in population density.</p><p>Previous studies have attempted to understand desert locust phenotypic immunity by comparing the differences in behavioral fever, hemocyte counts, bacterial lysis and melanization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003102-Wilson1">[3]</xref>.

Moreover, the prophylactic immunity of gregarious locusts reduces the susceptibility to fungal biopesticide. Our comprehensive transcriptome analysis revealed that gregarious migratory locusts selectively increased molecules of immune cascades including PRPs, inhibitors (serpins) and counteragents (peroxiredoxin) of ROS rather than activate the entire immune pathways to produce specific effectors (e.g. AMPs), improving our understanding of the molecular dynamics in insect prophylactic immunity. The benefit of emphasizing on the upstream of immune cascades could be to deposit sufficient products of immune responses (eg. melanin) onto the surface of pathogens whilst conserving resources for the production of specific effectors for migration. This defense strategy of coating pathogens to decrease their ability to obtain nutrition from the insect hemolymph leads to an inhibition of pathogens proliferation and production of infective particles. Hence, we suggested that a high level of PRP (GNBP3) allowed gregarious locusts to adapt a tolerance strategy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003102-Medzhitov1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003102-Ayres1">[15]</xref> of quarantining the fungal pathogens rather than through their direct elimination.
