In this study, we show that upregulation of HOTAIR induced platinum resistance in ovarian cancer, and increased HOTAIR levels were observed in recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian tumors vs. primary ovarian tumors. To investigate the role of HOTAIR during DNA damage induced by platinum, we monitored double-strand breaks and show that HOTAIR expression results in sustained activation of DNA damage response after platinum treatment. We demonstrate that ectopic expression of HOTAIR induces NF-&#x003ba;B activation during DNA damage response and MMP-9 and IL-6 expression, both key NF-&#x003ba;B target genes. We show that HOTAIR regulates activation of NF-&#x003ba;B by decreasing I&#x003ba;-B&#x003b1; (NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor) and establish that by inducing prolonged NF-&#x003ba;B activation and expression of NF-&#x003ba;B target genes during DNA damage, HOTAIR plays a critical role in cellular senescence and platinum sensitivity. Our findings suggest that a NF-&#x003ba;B-HOTAIR axis drives a positive-feedback loop cascade during DNA damage response and contributes to cellular senescence and chemotherapy resistance in ovarian and other cancers.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The mammalian DNA damage response (DDR) to genotoxic stress is critically important for maintaining genome stability, cell survival and preventing cellular transformation. DDR networks include the classic tumor suppressor gene p53 and its downstream target p21 [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. More recently, a DDR mechanism has been reported involving nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B), a master regulator of over 400 genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, cell cycle control and cell senescence [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. NF-&#x003ba;B signaling-mediated activation of DDR has been shown to restore genomic integrity, augment cancer cell survival, and play a role in development of resistance to platinum-based cancer therapies [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, distinct DNA damage-induced NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathways contributing to chemoresistance in cancer have not been well studied.</p><p id="P3">Platinum, the first line of therapy for ovarian and other cancers, induces inter-and-intra strand crosslinks, generates single stranded breaks and activates nucleotide excision repair [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Cellular responses to DNA damage, including response to platinum, can be regulated at the post-transcriptional level by long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] . The JADE1 adjacent regulatory RNA (lncRNA-JADE) was reported to play a crucial role in DNA damage-induced, histone H4 acetylation associated with transcriptional activation [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and lncRNA-p21 was shown to physically interact with hnRNPK (heterogenous nuclear ribonuclear proteins) during DDR and mediate p53-dependent transcriptional repression [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Platinum-induced DNA damage resulted in lncRNA PANDA (p21-associated ncRNA DNA damage activated) activation, interaction with transcription factor NF-YA, and PANDA-NF-YA modulation of p53-dependent apoptosis [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p id="P4">HOX antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR), a lncRNA frequently overexpressed in human cancers [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], was originally identified in 2007 by Rinn et al as a lncRNA located in the HOXC cluster on chromosome 12 that regulates the HOXD gene cluster on chromosome 2 [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. HOTAIR transcriptionally silences genes located on a distant chromosome region through an epigenetic mechanism involving interaction with polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] . This interaction appears to be required for PRC2 occupancy of specific loci, such as the HOXD locus, trimethylation of histone H3 lysine K27 (H3K27me3) by enhancer of zeste 2 (EZH2) and subsequent gene repression [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Additional inter-chromosomal targets of HOTAIR include- cancer-associated genes such as protocadherin (PCDH), ephrin receptor (EPHA1) and the NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitory protein I&#x003ba;-B&#x003b1; [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although epigenetic processes have been reported to play critical roles in DDR [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], including aberrant histone methylation by EZH2 [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], a direct role for HOTAIR in DDR has not been investigated. However, functional overlap between PRC2 and NF-&#x003ba;B activation by genotoxic agents, inflammation, and cancer has been reported [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], suggesting a potential interaction between NF-&#x003ba;B activation and HOTAIR in response to DNA damage. Furthermore, in solid tumors, including ovarian cancer (OC), enhanced NF-&#x003ba;B activation has been observed in aggressive chemoresistant cell lines [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p id="P5">The objective of this study was to investigate the functional role for HOTAIR in DDR and chemotherapy resistance. We demonstrate a strong correlation of HOTAIR overexpression with platinum resistance in OC cell lines and patient tumors. In response to DNA damage, we found that NF-&#x003ba;B directly upregulates HOTAIR expression in OC cell lines. Downregulation of I&#x003ba;-B&#x003b1; during DDR induced a NF-&#x003ba;B-HOTAIR signaling positive-feedback loop cascade, and we demonstrate that DDR further induces HOTAIR-mediated expression of p65-NF-&#x003ba;B and NF-&#x003ba;B target genes MMP9 and IL-6 to promote OC cellular senescence and resistance to DNA-damaging agents. Collectively, these results are the first to demonstrate a role for HOTAIR in DNA damage-induced NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway, identifying HOTAIR as a new therapeutic target in drug resistant OC and likely other cancers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>HOTAIR is overexpressed in drug-resistant ovarian cancer</title><p id="P6">We examined expression of HOTAIR in a panel of OC cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) representing a spectrum of platinum (CDDP) sensitivity (Resistant; Sensitive).

In this study, we demonstrate a key role for HOTAIR in DNA damage: HOTAIR modulates expression of genes activated during DDR, including Chk1 and the levels of &#x003b3;-H2AX, to inhibit cell cycle progression. Our findings include that HOTAIR activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway following CDDP-induced DNA damage contributes to cellular senescence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DDR activation of NF-&#x003ba;B induces HOTAIR and a positive feedback loop, resulting in sustained NF-&#x003ba;B activation and persistent DNA damage signaling. As platinum-based regimens continue to be the mainstay of treatment for many solid cancers including OC [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], HOTAIR may represent a target for therapeutic intervention of drug resistance.</p><p id="P20">Previous mapping studies revealed HOTAIR binding to chromosomal regions near the I&#x003ba;-B&#x003b1; gene, supporting the potential regulation of NF-&#x003ba;B activity by HOTAIR.

In ovarian and other cancers, NF-&#x003ba;B activation is associated with chemoresistance [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and activation during DNA damage induced by genotoxic agents has been demonstrated but not well defined [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

Consistent with these results, overexpression of HOTAIR increased nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B, which correlated with reduced total I&#x003ba;-B&#x003b1; levels after CDDP treatment, and HOTAIR overexpression resulted in sustained DDR and NF-&#x003ba;B activation.</p><p id="P21">Our results also link HOTAIR-mediated IL-6 secretion with platinum resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). The IL-6 cytokine induces apoptosis inhibitors BCL-2, BCL-XL and XIAP and contributes to CDDP-resistance [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Importantly, IL-6 secretion has also been linked with exposure to genotoxic stress caused by cisplatin and carboplatin [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. IL-6 is generally considered a pro-survival cytokine, but sustained IL-6 secretion after DNA damage is linked with cellular senescence [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The notion of cell senescence (a tumor suppressor mechanism) contributing to chemotherapy resistance (involves cell proliferation) is an emerging concept. Recent reports suggest that a senescent cell can become a &#x0201c;pro-inflammatory cell&#x0201d; and promote tumor progression by acquiring a senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) offer support for this concept [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Our findings that HOTAIR can activate NF-kB and its target genes is supported by a recent report implicating HOTAIR in driving the expression of genes directly involved in SASP in urothelial carcinoma, further potentiating an important role for HOTAIR during senescence [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Furthermore, it is now strongly believed that the secretion of IL-6 by senescent cells can alter the tumor microenvironment in a paracrine fashion, activating multiple pathways, including the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and transforming surrounding stromal cells to a more chemoresistant phenotype [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Fig. S7B</xref>).

The slow tumor growth we observed in CDDP-treated HOTAIR expressing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1F</xref>) could be attributed to senescent cells altering the microenvironment to a tumor promoting environment, although further studies are needed.</p><p id="P22">Unresolved DSBs generated by prolonged CDDP-induced DNA damage can result in constitutive activation of DDR signaling and activation of stress response pathways, including senescence [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Senescence following irreparable DNA damage has been reported [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and we investigated whether exposure to low or high dose CDDP would be analogous to early response (transient period) or development of resistance (prolonged period). We demonstrate that prolonged expression of HOTAIR results in &#x003b3;-H2AX foci formation and subsequent activation of Chk1, which plays a pivotal role during DDR by inducing S15 phosphorylation of tumor suppressor p53 (trans activation domain). The finding that HOTAIR-induced p53 phosphorylation during high CDDP (prolonged exposure) is further supported by the observed induction of p21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>), a p53 target gene and CDK inhibitor, a process that is ATR-dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Fig.S7B</xref>). As induction of p21 has been closely linked to senescence [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], our findings are the first to indicate a role for HOTAIR in both senescence and chemoresistance. In support of our data, HOTAIR has recently been shown to induce the senescence pathway by its induction of p21 and p15 as well as genes involved in the NF-kB pathway [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. We posit that HOTAIR can contribute to the activation of several pathways that ultimately lead to chemoresistance. In high DNA damaging conditions a subset of cells can undergo HOTAIR dependent senescence, and at lower or non-senescent conditions HOTAIR can cause resistance in a cell-autonomous manner.</p><p id="P23">In addition to demonstrating that the above scenario is a NF-&#x003ba;B pathway dependent process, our results indicate that sustained NF-&#x003ba;B activation in HOTAIR expressing cells is due to suppression of I&#x003ba;-B&#x003b1; expression by HOTAIR, in agreement with a previous report linking NF-&#x003ba;B activation to cellular senescence [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

In addition, it is possible that DNA damage can induce a physical interaction between NF-&#x003ba;B and PRC2, which can alter regulation of genes involved during senescence, such as an EZH2-NF-&#x003ba;B interaction [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p id="P24">Collectively, our data suggest a model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Fig. S7B</xref>) of NF-&#x003ba;B-driven transcription of HOTAIR, which subsequently activates persistent NF-&#x003ba;B expression, IL-6 secretion, and activation of CHK1-p53-p21 pathway, and establishment of a senescence, chemoresistant cancer phenotype.

After reversing the crosslinks, DNA was purified, and standard curve of ChIP input DNA was prepared. Enrichment was calculated by using qPCR to compare the level of the target region in each sample to the mean of negative control genomic regions. Primers designed for the specified genomic regions (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, Iowa) amplified a single product from input DNA based on a single melting peak (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table S4</xref>).

Briefly, biological duplicates of A2780p and A2780_CR5 cells (10<sup>7</sup> culture dish) were lysed and RNA was extracted according to manufacturers protocol (Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit). Total RNA was size fractionated by size using ethanol concentration manipulations. The large RNA fraction (&#x0003e;200 nt) was fragmented prior to library construction. Ribosomal RNA was reduced by duplex specific nuclease (DSN) following limited hybridizations of both fractions and then amplified to add barcodes for multiplexing on the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. Demultiplexing was performed by CASAVA v1.8.2 and trimming was accomplished with Trimmomatic v0.22 with additional trimming by fastx_clipper v0.0.13.2. Read mapping was performed by tophat2 v2.0.6 to the human genome hg19 (UCSC) with Gencode annotation v13 allowing no more than two mismatches.
