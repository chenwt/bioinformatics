To achieve this flexibility, a set of &#x0201c;housekeeping&#x0201d; genes, which define the shape and basic physiology of the organism, is expressed constitutively, while other genes are only expressed when needed. Regulation of gene expression is therefore a major mechanism to enable organisms to respond for example to environmental changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Such regulatory events can be fairly straightforward, as in prokaryote responses to nutrient availability, where the nutrient enters the cells and acts on a transcriptional regulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, in general, the processes leading from signal detection to gene expression are more complex and this is particularly the case in multicellular organisms.</p><p>During development of multicellular organisms, a range of cellular functions such as cell differentiation, cell division and cell movement have to be coordinated by intercellular communication to generate a functional final form. The regulatory circuitry to achieve this feat, and the genes encoding its components, cannot have all appeared at the same time. Rather, pre-existing genes have been co-opted for novel roles. Progressive re-iteration of gene co-option, combined with evolution of novel coding sequences by mutation and occasional horizontal gene transfer, may gradually have generated the complex regulatory mechanisms that control the development of modern multicellular organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Changes in the cis-regulatory regions of genes, allowing genes to be expressed at novel stages or locations in the developing form, appeared to have played a crucial role in generating morphological diversity in animals and plants, but alteration of gene function after gene duplication or by acquisition of novel functional domains will also have contributed to the emergence of developmental complexity.</p><p>To understand how multicellular organisms evolved, it is essential to recognize the core conserved features of their developmental program and the gene modifications that caused phenotypic innovation. For complex organisms, such as animals, this is a daunting task, which is complicated by the fact that the unicellular ancestor is long extinct or has meanwhile evolved along a different trajectory. However, it is feasible for less complex forms, such as the Dictyostelid social amoebas, which have a conditional form of multicellularity. Dictyostelia initially feed as unicellular amoebas on bacteria and enter multicellular development by aggregation, when starved. The aggregates transform into migrating slug-shaped structures and finally into fruiting bodies that consist of a spore mass and up to four different cell types to carry the spore mass aloft. In the model organism <italic>D.discoideum</italic> (DD), several signal molecules and direct cell-cell interactions that coordinate morphogenesis and trigger cell-type specialization, and many components of the pathways that process these stimuli have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Even the correct positioning of nucleosomes seems to be influenced by the ability of DD to form multicellular structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A molecular phylogeny based on rRNA and nuclear encoded protein sequences subdivides all known Dictyostelia into two main branches each containing two major and some minor groupings, with DD residing in group 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The split between the two main branches from the last common ancestor was dated at around 600 million years ago, indicating that this form of multicellularity emerged almost as long ago as that of the animal kingdom with around 700 million years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Phenotypic analysis revealed that groups 1&#x02013;3 contain species that predominantly form small clustered or branched fruiting structures with maximally two cell types. Many species in these groups have retained encystation, the unicellular life cycle of their amoebozoan ancestors as an additional survival strategy. Group 4 species form larger solitary and unbranched fruiting bodies with up to five cell types and have lost encystation entirely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>

</p><p>Microarray and RNAseq based transcriptomics in DD revealed that at least 25&#x000a0;% of the DD genes are affected by the transition from growth to multicellular development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. While members of the basic cellular machinery, such as genes encoding ribosomal proteins, are down-regulated, more than 2000 genes are up-regulated. These genes are likely to be involved in either regulating cell differentiation or in defining the differentiated state. However, some of these genes may be subject to co- or mis-regulation, e.g. hitchhiking effects from neighboring genes or suppression of global negative regulators. <italic>D. purpureum</italic>, another group 4 species, showed a similar profile, indicating broad conservation of the developmental gene expression in group 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>In this work we used comparative transcriptomics of species across the entire Dictyostelid phylogeny to define the core set of orthologous developmentally regulated genes. This approach provides the basis for the discovery of currently missing components or even entire pathways that control development and for subsequent studies investigating how evolutionary changes in the core set led to phenotypic innovation. For five core set genes we tested the phenotypic consequences of gene disruption.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Species and sample preparation</title><p>

The mRNAs were converted to a sequencing ready library with the mRNA kit from Illumina, and paired end sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq instrument. The TopHat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] pipeline with the HTseq script [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] was used to count the number of reads mapped to specific genes in each genome. Individual mapping results were normalized to the total number of reads obtained for each sample and rpkm (reads per kilobase gene sequence per million) values were calculated for each gene.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Criteria for definition of developmental expression</title><p>Earlier results suggested that growth-specific genes are down-regulated upon entering the developmental cycle, while the expression of many development-specific genes is turned on or up-regulated. Thus, for our analysis we considered only developmentally upregulated genes. We first assessed, which genes in each species have expression data (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1a</xref>). To define upregulated expression we used three different methods (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1b</xref>; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Each method has its drawbacks and advantages and a combination thus provides more robust results. The union of the resulting candidate genes would capture all potential genes of interest (the core set of developmentally upregulated genes) while the intersection of all methods would provide the most robust set of potential developmentally important genes. Method A relies on normalized counts only. A threshold of at least 20 reads per gene was set to exclude weakly expressed genes. A threshold for upregulated expression of the normalized counts (reads per kilobase per million sequencing reads; rpkm) of at least three times between the vegetative growth state and any other time point was set. These relaxed criteria can capture genes of which the expression pattern differs slightly between species but the false positive rate with such a threshold approach can be high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. With method B we defined orthologs between all species and used the expression of these orthologous genes as replicates in a DEseq analysis. Here we used the NC4 data of DD only to be compatible with the data of the other species. With this method the false positive rate might be lowest, but we might fail to capture all relevant genes. The third method (C) relied on the definition of upregulated genes in DD by using our NC4 and AX4 data available from earlier results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Axenic and xenic growth conditions and the slightly different genome background of the two strains might lead to a higher false negative detection rate. The resulting developmentally upregulated genes were then categorized as species-specific if no ortholog to other species could be detected. Only developmentally upregulated genes with at least one ortholog in one of the other species were further analysed. For methods B and C we used DEseq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] to define significantly developmentally upregulated genes with a false positive detection rate of 10&#x000a0;%.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Overview of differentially expressed genes and orthologs in social amoebae</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="5">A: orthologs and expression counts</td></tr><tr><td/><td>DD</td><td>DL</td><td>DF</td><td>PP</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Number of genes</td><td>12319</td><td>10232</td><td>11879</td><td>11440</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Expressed in data set</td><td>11549</td><td>10216</td><td>11854</td><td>11315</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Ortholog families (ORTHOMCL)</td><td>7290</td><td>7172</td><td>7316</td><td>7114</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5">B: definition of expression sets with different methods</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Orthologs between all species</td><td/><td>5895</td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>In developmental set</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;A</td><td>&#x02265;&#x02009;3x developmentally upregulated</td><td>DD<break/>DL<break/>DF<break/>PP</td><td>2352<break/>2895<break/>2605<break/>2955</td><td>776</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;B</td><td>Differentially expressed orthologs<sup>a</sup>

Since genomes generally go through expansion, shrinkage and loss of gene families, orthologous genes, particularly within large gene families, cannot always be assigned. To avoid incorrect assignments, we did not attempt to group single genes, but instead defined gene families. Using the ORTHOMCL algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], we defined 8903 gene families consisting of at least two members, irrespective of their species affiliation. This number also includes genes that only have paralogs in the same species (i.e. species-specific gene duplications) without similar genes in another species. The largest family consisted of 208 genes (52 DD; 80 DL; 60 PP; 16 DF). 5016 families had exactly 1 member per species and all orthologous groups present in all species sum up to 5763. Including families that only existed in a single taxon, we defined over 7000 orthologous groups for each species (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Gene expression during multicellular development</title><p>Between species there are considerable differences in the time required to aggregate and form fruiting bodies. To be able to compare the transcriptional profiles of species from different taxon groups, we isolated RNAs when species had reached a specific developmental stage rather than a specific time point after starvation. The chosen stages were growth stage, early aggregation, mounds, early and late fruiting body formation. The species DL, PP and DF do not develop very synchronously, which means that stage-selected RNAs are to some extent intermixed with RNAs from earlier or later stages. RNA was sequenced using Illumina technology. The majority of genes in the genomes of all 4 species are also represented in their transcriptome (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><p>For method A the mapped reads were normalized to yield rpkm values (reads per kilobase per million) to allow comparison of expression levels at different stages within one species. The incomplete synchrony of development of DL, PP and DF compared to DD caused quenching of expression differences between developmental stages. We therefore decided to define genes as developmentally upregulated if the normalized expression (rpkm values) at any developmental stage was at least 3-fold higher than at the <italic>t</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0&#x000a0;h growth stage. By this definition from 2352 to 2955 genes are developmentally upregulated in the different species (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), but nearly half of the upregulated genes in each species have no identifiable counterpart in the other genomes. In larger gene families no clear orthology relationships exists. In this case we reasoned that similar expression profiles might confer similar functions and grouped family members with similar expression patterns together. We also included genes, which have identifiable orthologs to DD in three species only and are developmentally expressed in all three. This resulted in a set of 776 orthologous genes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1, method A).</p><p>For method B we first defined orthology relationships between all genes of the four species (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1b</xref>).

The subsequent DEseq analysis yielded 150 developmentally upregulated genes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1, method B).</p><p>For method C we employed the read counts obtained from our sequences and the freely available AX4 data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] from the same time points. A principal component analysis using cummeRbund [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] shows that the largest difference in gene expression occurs between vegetative growth (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;0&#x000a0;h) and all other time points (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S1). This is in agreement with previous RNA profiling of DD development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Of the 493 developmentally upregulated genes only 243 have a detectable ortholog in at least one of the other species (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1b</xref>). These are listed in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1.</p><p>The three methods yielded different numbers of potential conserved developmentally expressed genes. A comparison of the gene list revealed that 71 genes were detected with all methods (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>A Venn diagram showing the resulting numbers of genes from the three methods. <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold>, and <bold>c</bold> are described in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

</p><p>As expected method A yielded the highest number of genes and the overlap to the other gene sets is low indicating a high false positive discovery rate. Method B yields the lowest number of genes but nearly all of these detected genes were also observed with other methods indicating a low false positive discovery rate.</p><p>The expression peak time point of each gene in the defined set was analyzed in respect to its conservation (% identity) between DD and DF (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). A statistical analysis (Wilcoxon-Mann&#x02013;Whitney-Test) showed that the conservation of genes with a peak expression at time point 16&#x000a0;h or 20&#x000a0;h (t_3 and t_4 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3) is higher than at 4&#x000a0;h (t_1 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3). This finding is in agreement with earlier results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>GO term enrichment analysis</title><p>To assign functions to the core set genes, their protein functional domains were first analysed using interproscan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and the domains were next mapped to Gene Ontology (GO) categories. We tested for potential enrichment of GO terms using the GO term finder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The complete set of defined developmentally expressed genes (859) was enriched, among others, in terms like signal transduction, regulation, cell communication (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S2). We then analysed the genes in the different intersections (defined by two or three methods) separately. Only in intersection A|B and A|B|C we found Go term enrichments. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows a network analysis of the enriched terms of this intersection from methods A|B (140 genes; grey area in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Comparison to characterized mutants</title><p>To date more than 1000 DD mutants targeting more than 600 genes have been described and most are available via the Dicty Stock Center (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dictybase.org/StockCenter/StockCenter.html">http://dictybase.org/StockCenter/StockCenter.html</ext-link>). 652 mutant strains, including null mutants, overexpressors, and multiple gene manipulations, showed a developmental defect. We found that 480 of the underlying affected genes have an ortholog in all the other three species. Thus, genes with phenotypic consequences upon manipulation are enriched in the orthologous set, since 73&#x000a0;% (480 of 652) of the genes defined by their impact on the development are also detectable in all other species but only 48&#x000a0;% of all DD genes (5895 of 12319).</p><p>Only 186 genes within the developmental mutant collection of DD appeared to be developmentally upregulated in DD (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S2). Of these 186 genes, 33 do not have a detectable ortholog in at least one of the other three species and 20 have no ortholog in all three species. Interestingly, among the latter 20 developmentally expressed DD genes with no detectable counterpart in all the other genomes are four coding for proteins related to spore formation and two involved in adhesion indicating species-specific evolution in these categories. The most prominent group of genes with orthologs in only a subset of species is again involved in adhesion (5 of 33). Fortyfour of the 186 DD genes are present as orthologs in all other species but appear not to be developmentally regulated in all species. The remaining 89 genes have orthologs and are also developmentally upregulated (according to method A).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>KO mutant analysis of selected genes</title><p>To assess the combined predictive value of deep conservation within Amoebozoa and conservation of gene regulation within Dictyostelia for an essential biological role of genes, we selected a set of orthologous genes that was developmentally upregulated in at least three out of four Dictyostelia and had likely orthologs in the solitary amoebozoa <italic>Acanthamoeba castellanii</italic> and PP. DD spore formation is evolutionary derived from encystation, sharing a core signalling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. From the above set, we selected five genes for knock-out by homologous recombination (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S4). These genes, DDB_G0275521, DDB_G0287037 DDB_G0288963, DDB_G0269826 and DDB_G0272550 were both spore-enriched in PP and upregulated during encystation. DDB_G0272550 could not be knocked out despite three attempts. For none of the four obtained knock-outs, we noted any difference in developmental progression compared to wild-type. Fruiting bodies, stalks and spores looked normal and there were no significant differences in sporulation efficiency and spore viability (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S5, S6A, B). Chimeric development in a 1:1 starter mix with wild-type cells over five cycles of growth and fruiting body formation also did not result in marked under- or over-representation of the knock-out clones in the spores (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S6 C). From this small set, it therefore appears that predicting essential roles for genes from deep conservation and conserved developmental regulation remains challenging. However, the selected genes come from the set defined by method A only, and thus may have functions which are not essential for the developmental progression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><p>Developmental processes depend on sophisticated regulatory networks and specialized functions, which must be integrated with the normal cellular machinery. We set out to define a minimal set of genes recruited for developmental purposes, which were already present in the last common ancestor (LCA) of all social amoebae. We assumed that such genes would be up-regulated upon entering the cycle, while other genes that are essential for development but also required for growth, would not be affected. The developmentally up-regulated set may provide insights into the evolutionary mechanisms by which the developmental cycle was established. A comparison between two group 4 species, DD and <italic>D. purpureum</italic> showed high conservation of developmental gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It was however, unclear whether this conservation is restricted to group 4 or whether it also extends to the other major groups of social amoebae. Comparative genome analysis of <italic>D. purpureum</italic> and DD also showed that despite their considerable large evolutionary distance, gene synteny is still present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Synteny was not observed between genomes outside this group, indicating low overall conservation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], making the processes that are conserved all the more relevant.</p><p>Co-occurrence networks can be used to trace specific functions during evolution. Such networks tend to have a strong correlation between co-occurrence and co-expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Our study might be viewed as a first attempt to define co-occurrence networks for the developmental cycle.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Methods to robustly define core developmental genes</title><p>Previous studies showed that at least 25&#x000a0;% of all DD genes alter their expression upon entering the developmental cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This was also the case for all four species examined by us. Using three methods with different strengths and weaknesses we defined a set of genes likely involved in social amoebae developmental processes since the LCA of all Dictyostelia emerged. With the methods B and C we wanted to define minimal gene sets by using strict statistical measures for differential expression. Replicate transcriptional profiles were previously generated for DD AX4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], which provided a biological replicate for our DD NC4 data. Method B stringently captures highly conserved genes and developmental programs by using species data as &#x0201c;evolutionary&#x0201d; replicates. Method A was designed to capture even genes with roles in development where transcriptional profiles differ slightly between species. We cannot, however find genes, where the orthology relationship between species has been masked during the long evolutionary separation of the species.</p><p>For some genes we may have not detected their developmental expression pattern in one or another species due to the increased complexity of growth and development on plates. Thus, method A includes orthologous genes, which are developmentally upregulated in three taxa only. Indeed, in this subset we found a gene, RegA, which was previously shown to be developmentally upregulated in the axenic AX4 strain of DD and found to be important for the phosphorelay system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. It showed no expression increase in the NC4 wild type strain of DD in our data set, but has developmentally upregulated counterparts in all other genomes. This finding emphasizes that the inclusion of such genes is justified.</p><p>Genes in the intersection A|B are strongly enriched in gene ontology terms related to developmental processes. However, of these 140 genes a large number is not yet functionally characterized (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1) Furthermore, several of these genes have no detectable domain structure which would provide some hints for their function. Thus, our analysis opens up an alley to characterize developmental genes further. No GO term enrichment could be detected in genes defined with method A and C but not B (98 genes).</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Mutants in the developmental cycle</title><p>Not all genes that cause developmental changes after manipulation are developmentally up-regulated. Currently, 652 mutated genes with descriptions of developmental defects are listed in dictybase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dictybase.org">http://dictybase.org</ext-link>).</p><p>We found, that 186 of these genes are developmentally upregulated in DD, but only half of these genes are also developmentally regulated in the other three investigated species or even present. Likewise, half of all developmentally regulated genes in each organism have no detectable developmentally regulated counterpart in the other species (data for DF, DL, PP not shown). These mutants mainly stem from screens for mutant phenotypes, and thus randomly pick up genes from our core set and species-specific developmental genes. Among the genes with described mutant phenotypes not detectable in more than 2 of the investigated species are genes overrepresented with functions in adhesion and spore formation. Adhesion gene variability enables kin recognition and exclusion of other species from fruiting body formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Spore differentiation on the other hand involves a number of coat proteins, where possibly the structure but not the sequence has constraints in evolvability. Both functions are presumably subject to species-specific modulation.</p><p>The occurrence of mutant phenotypes for genes of the non-core set indicates that despite lack of conservation, such genes still have indispensable roles in the developmental cycle. Some of these genes likely represent species-specific additions to the cycle, but others might have evolved beyond recognizable similarity.</p><p>Our attempts to investigate the core set further by constructing mutant strains of some conserved genes yielded no discernable phenotype for four genes and one gene that might be essential also in the vegetative state. Apparently, lack of consequences from the loss of a gene might lead to the conclusion that this gene is dispensable. However, high conservation of sequence and expression pattern over long evolutionary distances can only be maintained if it remains under purifying selection. Laboratory conditions are far more constant than natural environments and thus might require less sophisticated and robust gene sets for the developmental cycle. On the other hand, not all possible phenotypes are testable in the laboratory and thus might have escaped our notion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The 89 described mutant phenotypes of genes of the core set could therefore represent the observable phenotypes and essentiality must be defined in respect to environmental and not laboratory conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Generation of specialized cells and tissues during a developmental cycle enabled higher order complexity of organisms. Due to the large number of genes involved in such processes and their adaptation and re-functionalization during evolution it is difficult to define developmental gene sets in e.g. plants and animals. The social amoebae can serve as a relative simple model for development. A further advantage is that for over 600 mya the developmental cycle remained stable with only a few changes. This enables the study of conserved, and therefore possibly important, functions, of this developmental program. We were able to define a small number of potentially developmentally relevant genes, of which a large number so far escaped functional studies. Our study thus will help the research community interested in development to get further insights in the evolution and maintenance of such programs.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec22"><title>Additional files</title><p>
