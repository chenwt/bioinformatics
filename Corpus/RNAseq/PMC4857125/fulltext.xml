In addition to the canonical OSNs, which express odorant receptors (ORs), the epithelium contains specialized subpopulations of sensory neurons that can detect specific information from environmental cues and relay it to relevant neuronal circuitries. Here we describe a subpopulation of mature OSNs in the main olfactory epithelium (MOE) which expresses CD36, a multifunctional receptor involved in a series of biological processes, including sensory perception of lipid ligands. The <italic>Cd36</italic> expressing neurons coexpress markers of mature OSNs and are dispersed throughout the MOE. Unlike several ORs analyzed in our study, we found frequent coexpression of the OR <italic>Olfr287</italic> in these neurons, suggesting that only a specific set of ORs may be coexpressed with CD36 in OSNs. We also show that CD36 is expressed in the cilia of OSNs, indicating a possible role in odorant detection. CD36-deficient mice display no signs of gross changes in the organization of the olfactory epithelium, but show impaired preference for a lipid mixture odor. Our results show that CD36-expressing neurons represent a distinct population of OSNs, which may have specific functions in olfaction.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in the olfactory epithelium (OE) express different types of olfactory receptors, which participate in the detection of distinct chemosensory stimuli. This information is subsequently transmitted to the olfactory bulb (OB) in the central nervous system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Mature OSNs express the olfactory marker protein (OMP)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> and are functionally and molecularly classified according to the type of olfactory receptor they express, their pattern of axonal projection to olfactory glomeruli in the OB, or presence of specific signal transduction machinery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Most OSNs in the main olfactory epithelium (MOE) express canonical odorant receptors (ORs), which belong to a large family of over a thousand G-protein coupled receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> and function in a combinatorial manner to discriminate an enormous number of odorants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Other OSNs in the MOE express instead trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) or receptor guanylyl cyclase (GC-D). These receptors are involved in the detection of volatile amines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> and peptide hormones<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> present in urine, respectively. It has also been shown that GC-D expressing neurons detect CO<sub>2</sub>, which is an important olfactory stimulus for many organisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p><p>Distinct subpopulations of OSNs in the olfactory epithelium may also differ in the signaling proteins they express. While the canonical OSNs express the olfactory G protein alpha subunit (G&#x003b1;olf/<italic>Gnal</italic>), adenylyl cyclase III (ACIII/<italic>Adcy3</italic>) and the cyclic nucleotide-gated (<italic>Cnga2</italic>) channel, other subpopulations express members of the transient receptor potential (Trp) channel family or other subtypes of transduction proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p><p>CD36, also known as fatty acid transporter (FAT), is a single-chain glycoprotein expressed at the cell surface of several mammalian cells types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Most of the receptor is extracellular; it possesses two transmembrane segments and two short cytoplasmatic portions. Even though its intracellular signaling capacity is apparently limited, CD36 is involved in multiple cellular functions, including lipid binding, lipid uptake and inflammatory signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. In addition, CD36 functions in the immune system as a scavenger receptor that cooperates with <italic>Toll</italic>-like receptors (TLRs) to recognize lipids derived from bacterial pathogens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p><p>Moreover, CD36 is known to play several roles in sensory perception. The sensory neuron membrane protein (SNMP), a <italic>D. melanonogaster</italic> CD36 homologue, mediates proper responses to the lipid pheromone cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) in a population of sensory olfactory neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. In addition, it was shown that CD36 mediates fatty acid detection in taste cells and preference for lipid ingestion in rodents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, suggesting a conserved role for this receptor in lipid sensory recognition.</p><p>In previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> we showed that the CD36 gene is expressed in discrete regions of the brain that receive input from both the main and accessory olfactory bulbs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Here we show that CD36 is expressed in the cilia of a subpopulation of OSNs in the MOE. These neurons coexpress typical markers for mature olfactory sensory neurons, including proteins involved in the canonical OR signal transduction cascade. We found that some of these CD36 expressing neurons also coexpress <italic>Olfr287</italic>. No coexpression was however observed when other types of ORs were analyzed, indicating that the CD36 expressing neurons may express only a particular subgroup of all possible existing ORs. In addition, we also show that innate preference for lipid odor is impaired in CD36-deficient mice. Altogether, our results suggest that CD36 may play important roles in olfaction.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cd36 gene expression is abundant in the olfactory epithelium</title><p>In order to evaluate the relative abundance of <italic>Cd36</italic> transcripts, we conducted real-time RT-PCR using various mouse tissues and two different reference genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S1</xref>). High levels of <italic>Cd36</italic> expression were observed in tissues known to strongly express the gene, such as the heart and adipose tissue (17- fold the expression levels in OE; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), in agreement with the transcript levels originally described for rat tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. <italic>Cd36</italic> expression in the OE is much higher than in other neural tissues, such as eye or whole brain. Interestingly, <italic>Cd36</italic> expression in the dorsal tongue, implicated in fat intake preference<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, has not been previously compared to the expression in other tissues. Here we report that <italic>Cd36</italic> expression in the OE is comparable to that in the dorsal tongue, both representing epithelial tissues that perform environmental chemical sensing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p><p><italic>In situ</italic> hybridization experiments revealed that <italic>Cd36</italic> expression is widely distributed throughout the MOE of adult mice, but absent in the vomeronasal organ (VNO; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>) or in the OB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The respiratory epithelium also stains positive for the <italic>Cd36</italic> message, forming a continuous labeled contour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). It is remarkable, however, that even though the olfactory epithelium shows intense staining in numerous cells in the neuronal cell layer, only a subset of the cells are stained. These results indicate that <italic>Cd36</italic> expression in the MOE is restricted to a subpopulation of neurons.</p><p>We next examined the expression of <italic>Cd36</italic> during the postnatal development of the olfactory epithelium. Even though the staining pattern for <italic>Cd36</italic> expression was observed in all developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), the number of labeled cells progressively increased until P14, and then stabilized, in all the three levels of the olfactory epithelium measured (rostral, medial and caudal) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S2</xref>). No <italic>Cd36</italic> expression was detected in the septal organ (SO) and Grueneberg ganglion (GG) at any tested age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cd36-positive OSNs coexpress OMP, G&#x003b1;olf, and specific ORs</title><p><italic>Cd36</italic> mRNA hybridization signals in the olfactory epithelium are observed in two different cell layers, in the supporting cell layer (lighter staining) and in the mature OSNs layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). It is noteworthy that cells in the OSNs layer show stronger staining than the ones in the supporting cell layer. Combined <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and immunofluorescence staining shows that CD36 expressing cells coexpress both OMP (mature OSNs) and type III &#x003b2;-tubulin (TUBB3; mature and immature OSNs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). In addition, two-color fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization experiments revealed that <italic>Cd36</italic> is consistently coexpressed with <italic>Omp</italic> and G&#x003b1;olf (<italic>Gnal</italic>), the G protein through which ORs signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, duct and supporting cells labeled with the <italic>Cyp2a4</italic> riboprobe do not or only weakly express <italic>Cd36</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Together, these results show that mature OSNs in the MOE are the main source of the transcript.</p><p>Since OR-expressing and TAAR-expressing neurons represent different populations of mature OSNs in the olfactory epithelium, we investigated whether <italic>Cd36</italic>-positive OSNs coexpress some of the members belonging to these two receptor families. We performed two-color fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization using <italic>Cd36</italic> riboprobes together with a riboprobe corresponding to an OR gene which is the most highly expressed OR gene in the mouse olfactory epithelium (<italic>Olfr1507</italic>, also known as mOR28)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> or a <italic>Taar7b</italic> probe, which should recognize all of the highly related members of the <italic>Taar7</italic> subfamily (TAARs 7a, 7b, 7d, 7e, and 7f)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Neither <italic>Olfr1507</italic>- nor <italic>Taar7b</italic>-positive OSNs showed coexpression of <italic>Cd36</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). We also used P2-IRES-tauGFP mice, to identify the OSNs expressing the OR P2 (<italic>Olfr17)</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and did not observe coexpression of <italic>Cd36</italic> with GFP in these neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). We therefore analyzed a larger number of OR genes. Probes corresponding to additional 11 OR genes were pooled and used in the two-color fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization together with the probe for <italic>Cd36</italic> (pool 1: <italic>Olfr124</italic> and <italic>Olfr1509</italic>; pool 2: <italic>Olfr646</italic>, <italic>Olfr1264</italic> and <italic>Olfr1372-ps1</italic>; pool 3: <italic>Olfr78</italic>, <italic>Olfr569</italic>, <italic>Olfr638</italic>, <italic>Olfr691</italic>, <italic>Olfr692</italic>, and <italic>Olfr1512</italic>). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">figure S3</xref>, no coexpression of <italic>Cd36</italic> with these OR genes was also observed.</p><p>In a recent study, Saraiva and colleagues used single-cell RNA sequencing (RNAseq) experiments to analyze the transcriptomes of individual OSNs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. One of the analyzed neurons (OSN #191) expressed high levels of <italic>Cd36</italic>. Also highly expressed in this same neuron are the typical markers for mature OSNs (<italic>Omp</italic>, <italic>Gng13</italic>, <italic>Gnal</italic>, <italic>Cnga2</italic>, <italic>Gnb1</italic>) and the OR <italic>Olfr287</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). No relevant expression of TAARs, TrpC2, Trpm5 or GC-D was observed in this neuron. Expression of a second OR gene was also detected in this neuron, although at considerably lower levels than <italic>Olfr287</italic>.</p><p>Based on these studies, we next decided to check whether <italic>Cd36</italic><sup>+</sup>-OSNs coexpress <italic>Olfr287</italic>. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization experiments showed that <italic>Olfr287</italic><sup>+</sup>-OSNs are located in the same expression zone as <italic>Olfr1507</italic><sup>+</sup>-OSNs, but are less numerous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Two-color FISH revealed substantial coexpression of this receptor and the <italic>Cd36</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>,d and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). It should be noted that the <italic>Olfr287</italic> probe we used was designed to cover the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region of the transcript because two other OR genes, <italic>Olfr286</italic> and <italic>Olfr288</italic>, show highly similar coding sequences, and could therefore cross hybridize with the <italic>Olfr287</italic> probe. Using this specific probe we found that ~62% of the <italic>Olfr287</italic><sup>+</sup>-OSNs coexpress <italic>Cd36</italic>, and ~16% of the <italic>Cd36</italic><sup>+</sup>-OSNs coexpress <italic>Olfr287</italic> in the same OE zone, indicating that not all <italic>Olfr287</italic><sup>+</sup>-neurons are positive for <italic>Cd36</italic> and vice-versa. Nevertheless, <italic>Olfr287</italic> coexpression with <italic>Cd36</italic> transcript is a frequent event that was not observed for the other OR genes tested in our experiments.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>CD36 protein localizes to the ciliary layer of the olfactory epithelium</title><p>We subsequently investigated whether CD36 is localized to the cilia of OSNs, the site of odorant detection and signal transduction. Double immunostaining and confocal analysis indicate that CD36 colocalizes with acetylated &#x003b1;-tubulin, a marker for cilia, indicating that the CD36 protein is predominantly expressed in the cilia of the OSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S4</xref>). We also analyzed the general morphology of the OE from the <italic>Cd36</italic><sup><italic>obl/obl</italic></sup> mutant mice. These mice carry a nonsense mutation that codes for a premature stop codon within the coding region of the <italic>Cd36</italic> gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, and consequently do not express <italic>Cd36</italic> in the olfactory epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figs 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S5</xref>). The OE from <italic>Cd36</italic><sup><italic>obl/obl</italic></sup> mice appears normal, and the density and zonal expression profiles of <italic>Olfr1507</italic> and <italic>Taar7b</italic> are unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). In addition, the general distribution of supporting cells, ducts and Bowman&#x02019;s gland (which express <italic>Cyp2a4</italic>) and OMP-positive neurons are unaffected in the <italic>Cd36</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>,b), and no gross changes in the structure of the olfactory bulb of one-year-old CD36-deficient mice are observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>CD36-deficient mice display altered olfactory behavior upon lipid exposure</title><p>We next analyzed whether olfactory guided behaviors are perturbed in CD36-deficient mice. Given that CD36 is not expressed in the VNO, it is expected that responses to pheromones or kairomones detected by this organ would not be altered in <italic>Cd36</italic><sup><italic>obl/obl</italic></sup> mice. In fact, we found that defensive behaviors generated upon exposure of mice to predator odors, a response shown to be largely dependent on the VNO<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, was equivalent in <italic>Cd36</italic><sup><italic>obl/obl</italic></sup> and wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>). In order to assess general olfactory capacity, we conducted the buried food olfactory assay. No significant differences were observed in the performances of wild type and <italic>Cd36</italic><sup><italic>obl/obl</italic></sup> mice in this test, indicating that the loss of CD36 does not affect general odorant detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref>). In addition, no significant changes were observed between the two genotypes when mice were exposed to amyl acetate in an odorant preference test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S7</xref>).</p><p>Since CD36-deficiency does not lead to aberrant OE morphology or general olfactory behavior impairment, we reasoned that only responses to specific odorants that bind to the receptor should be disturbed in the mutants. Among CD36 known ligands, lipids are candidate molecules, which could induce olfactory responses as environmental cues. In fact, we found that <italic>Cd36</italic><sup><italic>obl/obl</italic></sup> mice animals exhibited significantly decreased investigation time towards a lipid mixture containing saturated and unsaturated long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs), when compared to wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8c</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Previous studies have shown that CD36 and its homologue play a role in chemosensory responses to lipid ligands in insects and mammals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. In mice, CD36 is involved in gustatory detection of lipids, and in preferential attraction to lipid-enriched foods and beverages, responses which are abolished in CD36-null mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.</p><p>Here we show that CD36 is highly expressed in a subset of mature OSNs present in the MOE. These neurons are located in the mature OSN layer and scattered in all zones of the olfactory epithelium. The number of CD36 expressing neurons increases during development, and persists in adult mice. These findings raise important questions regarding the possible functional roles played by CD36 in olfaction.</p><p>It has become clear now that the MOE is composed of distinct subpopulations of olfactory neurons. Some of these are well known, like the canonical olfactory sensory neurons, others have been only recently characterized; and there may be other subpopulations, yet to be identified. As mentioned above, the many subpopulations are mainly distinguished by the type of receptor they express: ORs, TAARs, GC-D, and there are also a few olfactory neurons that express V1Rs or V2Rs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Here we identify a new subpopulation of olfactory sensory neurons which express CD36, a receptor that binds lipid ligands and has been previously proposed as a candidate fat taste transducer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.</p><p>Some olfactory neurons express members of the Trp channel family, however, it is not clear yet whether they work as receptors or simply as transducing effectors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. A newly identified population of <italic>Trpc2</italic>-expressing OSNs was recently reported, indicating that previous findings attributed to the VNO <italic>Trpc2</italic>-positive neurons could also be mediated by MOE cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Similarly, our results suggest that, in the olfactory system, the CD36 molecule may have similar functions attributed to these proteins in taste cells.</p><p>CD36-positive neurons coexpress <italic>Omp</italic> and <italic>Gnal</italic>, initially suggesting that they represent a subpopulation of canonical OSNs. We therefore analyzed whether these cells also express ORs. We did not detect coexpression of <italic>Cd36</italic> with 13 different tested ORs; however, we observed a frequent coexpression of <italic>Cd36</italic> with <italic>Olfr287</italic>. Since ~16% of the <italic>Cd36</italic><sup>+</sup> OSNs in OE zone 4 coexpress <italic>Olfr287</italic> we could predict, assuming equivalent proportions, that the remaining <italic>Cd36</italic><sup>+</sup>-OSNs within this same expression zone would express at least additional five OR genes. Also, if <italic>Cd36</italic><sup>+</sup> OSNs in the other expression zones show similar coexpression frequencies as <italic>Cd36</italic><sup>+</sup>/<italic>Olfr287</italic><sup>+</sup>-OSNs, we would expect that additional eighteen ORs are coexpressed in these cells, totalizing ~24 different OR genes that can be coexpressed with CD36 in the whole OE. The observation that ~40% of <italic>Olfr287</italic> cells do not express <italic>Cd36</italic> suggests heterogeneity of these neurons. In fact, this is not an unpreceded finding, since Omura and Mombaerts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> showed recently that approximately a third, and not all, of <italic>Olfr68</italic>/<italic>Olfr69</italic><sup>+</sup> MOE cells express <italic>Trpc2</italic>. Altogether, it seems that some OSNs in the MOE are heterogeneous in terms of expression of accessory molecules, even if they have the same <italic>Olfr</italic> gene identity. Future experiments will be required to determine the complete set of ORs expressed in this subpopulation of OSNs.</p><p>Since CD36-OSNs do not represent a major subpopulation of OSNs, one would expect little impact in general olfactory parameters. The general morphology and organization of the CD36-deficient MOE is comparable to wild-type mice, which is also valid for general olfactory behavioral parameters. As mentioned above, CD36 in adipose and taste cells binds LCFAs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. In order to characterize specific olfactory behavior changes possibly related to CD36 loss of function, we tested whether CD36 deficiency impairs preference for a chemically defined lipid concentrate rich in LCFAs. We found that even though <italic>Cd36</italic><sup><italic>obl/obl</italic></sup> mice show normal general olfactory behaviors towards regular odorants, they do not show preference for a lipid mixture when compared to wild-type mice. Preference tests for lipid mixtures have been previously performed in other studies, but the specific contributions of the gustatory or olfactory systems to the behavioral responses could not be distinguished in these reported experiments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Our study aimed to test specifically olfaction-driven instinctive behavioral responses. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that low concentrations of volatile fatty acids detected by CD36-taste cells contributed to the observed behavior. It is also possible that a generalized CD36-deficiency provokes specific impairment of lipid-elicited responses evaluated by preference tests, excluding an olfactory role for CD36. Additional experiments, including those involving OSN-specific <italic>Cd36</italic> deficient mice, are necessary in order to support the hypothesis that CD36<sup>+</sup>-OSNs are true lipid sensors functionally coupled to a brain circuitry involved in lipid preference behavior. Nevertheless, our results raise the interesting possibility that CD36 expressing olfactory neurons are involved in the recognition of lipid odorants, mediating the attraction to this type of chemosensory cue, especially because long-chain fatty acids should be present at very low concentrations in the air-phase. In this case, lipid-associated signal transduction mechanisms in the MOE could influence important social and feeding behaviors. For instance, the fatty alcohol (Z)-5-tetradecen-1-ol from exocrine glands was recently identified as a compound that enhance male urine attractiveness to female mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Recently, a study performed with human subjects suggested that fat content of food can be detected via odors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, implying that lipid odorants may be more physiologically relevant than previously assumed. One may expect that fatty odors would be important to identify highly caloric food that should be strategically consumed, but this hypothetical behavior may function in the opposite direction in a different metabolic context.</p><p>Previous studies have implicated CD36 in neuronal functions. For instance, it was shown that a subpopulation of glucose-responsive hypothalamic neurons senses fatty acids through CD36<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. In addition, different studies implicated CD36 in lipid intake, satiety and obesity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Although there is insufficient evidence to conclude that olfactory CD36 mediates fatty acid detection, the identification of a novel population of olfactory neurons expressing CD36 provides a new perspective to neuronal signaling with relevant impact to olfactory functions. It is known that each subpopulation of OSNs makes distinct connections in the OB, indicating that they provide information from different chemosensory inputs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. It will be interesting to determine how the axonal projection from CD36 expressing neurons to the main OB is organized. The fact that, unlike other OSN subpopulations, the CD36<sup>+</sup>-neurons are widely distributed all over the olfactory epithelium, and not segregated in different expression zones, suggests that the projection pattern of these neurons to the OB is different. It is possible that these neurons relay information in non-conventional forms that still need to be clarified.</p><p>Importantly, the possibility that CD36 may not work as a receptor involved in odorant signal transduction cannot be excluded. For example, CD36 could function as a metabolic sensor that informs the neurons about nutritional status or even transport fatty acids through the cell membrane. In addition, as an innate immune signaling co-receptor, CD36 can also sense lesions or nasal flora imbalance. These possibilities will have to be carefully addressed in order to determine the roles played by CD36 in olfactory physiology. During the preparation of the revised version of this manuscript two independent groups<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> also reported expression of CD36 in OSNs and supporting cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Animal experimentation</title><p><italic>Cd36</italic><sup><italic>obl</italic></sup> /Mmucd mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> were acquired from MMRRC (UC Davis) in heterozygosis and were intercrossed to yield homozygotes mutants and wild-type mice; genotyping was performed by PCR followed by DNA sequencing.
