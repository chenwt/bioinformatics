Here we show that miR-675, a microRNA (miRNA) embedded within <italic>H19</italic>&#x02019;s first exon, is expressed exclusively in the placenta from the gestational time point when placental growth normally ceases, and placentas that lack <italic>H19</italic> continue to grow. Overexpression of miR-675 in a range of embryonic and extraembryonic cell lines results in their reduced proliferation; targets of the miRNA are upregulated in the <italic>H19</italic> null placenta, including the growth promoting Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (<italic>Igf1r</italic>). Moreover, the excision of miR-675 from <italic>H19</italic> is dynamically regulated by the stress response RNA binding protein HuR. These results suggest that <italic>H19</italic>&#x02019;s main physiological role is in limiting growth of the placenta prior to birth, by regulated processing of miR-675. The controlled release of miR-675 from <italic>H19</italic> may also allow rapid inhibition of cell proliferation in response to cellular stress or oncogenic signals.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source country="United Kingdom">Medical Research Council : </funding-source><award-id>G0801156(87767) || MRC_</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">The <italic>H19</italic> locus expresses high levels of a 2.5 kb RNA Polymerase II dependent transcript, which is spliced, capped, polyadenylated, and exported into the cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.

The <italic>H19</italic> transcript contains only short open reading frames, which are poorly conserved between mice and human and thus appears to be a noncoding RNA, one of the first lincRNAs to be discovered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. The <italic>H19</italic> gene is located downstream of the growth promoting insulin like growth factor 2 (<italic>Igf2</italic>) gene on chromosome 7 in mouse and 11p15.5 in humans.

How the RNA exerts these functions and what its physiological role is remains unknown.</p><p id="P3">One way by which lincRNAs may acquire functionality is by acting as the precursor to small RNAs capable of regulatory function, such as microRNAs (miRNAs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Indeed, exon 1 of <italic>H19</italic> harbours a miRNA containing hairpin which has been found to serve as the template for two distinct miRNAs, miR-675-5p and miR-675-3p<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, and it has been suggested that it may be these miRNAs that confer functionality on <italic>H19</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Moreover, the miR-675 stem loop was shown to be one of the most highly conserved features of the <italic>H19</italic> RNA during mammalian evolution, indicating that selective pressure may be higher on the miRNAs than on <italic>H19</italic> as a whole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="S1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S2"><title>miR-675 is expressed in placenta but processing is strongly inhibited</title><p id="P4">To investigate the possibility that <italic>H19</italic> derives its functionality from miR-675, we determined the expression profile of the miRNA. As <italic>H19</italic> is the primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) template for miR-675 we decided to examine its expression in tissues where <italic>H19</italic> is highly transcribed. Unexpectedly, both species of miR-675 were barely detectable in fetal liver (endoderm derived tissue) and fetal heart (mesoderm derived tissue) at all stages of embryonic development tested, despite the vast levels of <italic>H19</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b, c</xref>), suggesting that processing of the miRNA from <italic>H19</italic> is inhibited. Indeed, large scale miRNA profiling studies have also found only low levels of miR-675 in the embryo despite abundant <italic>H19</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Low levels of miR-675 were also identified in human cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, implying that the inhibition of miR-675 processing is evolutionarily conserved. In contrast to fetal tissues however, we observed miR-675 to be expressed in the placenta exclusively from the maternal allele and with increasing abundance from E11.5 until term, despite there being no change in the abundance of <italic>H19</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. S1a</xref>). This suggests that not only is miR-675 processing inhibited but that this inhibition is a dynamic process that can be relaxed to allow expression of the miRNA. No miR-675 expression was detected in fetal brain, where <italic>H19</italic> is absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p><p id="P5">By comparison to a miRNA universal standard, which contains known concentrations of most miRNAs, the number of molecules of miR-675 per cell were found to be very low in embryonic tissue (approximately 40 copies in fetal heart and 70 in fetal liver), indicating that miR-675 is most likely non-functional in these tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 b - e</xref>). When miR-675 reaches its peak of expression in the E19.5 placenta however, there are approximately 300 copies of miR-675-5p and 1000 copies of miR-675-3p per placental cell. The previously characterized miRNA let-7 is known to be functional in HeLa cells at a similar concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Despite this potentially functional abundance, miR-675 levels are only 1 % of <italic>H19</italic> levels, demonstrating both the very high abundance of <italic>H19</italic> and also an unusually tight inhibition of miRNA processing.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>miR-675 processing is inhibited by the RNA binding protein HuR</title><p id="P6">As inhibition appears to be a dynamic process in the placenta, we hypothesized that RNA binding proteins might contribute to miR-675 regulation and hence performed RNA affinity assays followed by mass spectrometry to identify proteins that bind <italic>H19</italic> in the region of the miR-675 stem loop (see Methods). We used partially differentiated trophoblast stem (TS) cell lysate as a cell culture approximation of early gestation placenta as these cells do not express miR-675 despite robust <italic>H19</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. S1b, c</xref>). Using this approach we identified 49 proteins that were bound selectively to <italic>H19</italic> in the region of the miR-675 stem loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Notably, these included a number of proteins that are implicated in RNA metabolism and small RNA regulation, such as Upf1, Zcchc11, Luc7l and HuR. Amongst these, the RNA binding protein HuR stood out as a candidate for regulating miR-675 processing, for a number of reasons: first, there is a putative HuR binding site in <italic>H19</italic> 55 bp upstream from the miR-675 stem loop (AUUUUA), second, expression of <italic>HuR</italic> in the placenta declines during development as that of miR-675 increases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), and third, HuR is known to afford mRNAs protection from endonucleases (the miRNA processing enzymes Drosha and Dicer are both RNAse III class endonucleases)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Finally, knockout of <italic>HuR</italic> results in specific defects of the placenta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. We also found <italic>HuR</italic> expression to be higher in the liver, where miR-675 is silent, than it is in the late gestation placenta (data not shown).</p><p id="P7">We performed RNA immunoprecipitation with an antibody to HuR and found that it bound to full length <italic>H19</italic> in placenta at E11.5, when miR-675 is suppressed and HuR levels are high, but not at E19.5 when miR-675 is expressed and HuR levels are lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). We sought to identify a cell culture model in which to perform functional studies. miR-675 is suppressed in primary MEF cells despite robust expression of <italic>H19</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. S1d</xref>), suggesting that inhibition of processing occurs in these cells; RNA immunoprecipitation experiments indeed confirmed HuR binding to <italic>H19</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). To assess the role of HuR in the suppression of miR-675 processing we performed siRNA mediated knockdown in MEF cells and found that levels of both miR-675-5p and miR-675-3p were increased approximately 2- and 1.5-fold respectively in the absence of HuR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. S2a, b</xref>). A similar effect was observed in MEF cells genetically deficient for <italic>HuR</italic> (<italic>HuR</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) where both miR-675-5p and miR-675-3p were increased by approximately 2- and 2.2-fold respectively relative to wild type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Finally, we ablated <italic>HuR</italic> in a myoblast cell line (C2C12) by siRNA knockdown and again found that miR-675-5p and miR-675-3p levels were increased in the absence of HuR, by 2.8- and 3.5 fold respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. S2c, d</xref>). In all cell culture models of HuR deficiency, levels of miR-16 were unchanged relative to controls suggesting that the regulatory effect of HuR ablation is specific to miR-675 as opposed to the broader miRNA processing pathway. Thus HuR negatively regulates processing of both species of miR-675. <italic>Luc7l</italic> knockdown also resulted in increased miR-675 levels suggesting that HuR is not the only negative regulator of processing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. S2b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>HuR does not block miR-675 processing at the Dicer step and likely blocks Drosha</title><p id="P8">We next sought to identify where in the miR-675 processing pathway HuR acts to inhibit processing. miRNAs are processed sequentially from longer hairpin containing RNAs, first in the nucleus from the pri-miRNA by Drosha to create the pre-miRNA and second in the cytoplasm by Dicer to create the mature miRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The abundance of <italic>H19</italic> (the pri-miRNA) suggests that processing of miR-675 is inhibited at the Drosha stage. To investigate this further we performed Northern blot experiments on fetal liver and placental RNA and found only low levels of pre-miR-675, the product of Drosha cleavage of <italic>H19</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a, b</xref>). Moreover when we transfected synthetic pre-miR-675 into MEF cells we observed an increase in mature miR-675 and this increase was not altered by the presence or absence of HuR, showing that processing by Dicer was not affected by HuR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Finally, our RNA immunoprecipitation experiments showed that HuR binds to the full length <italic>H19</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c, d</xref>). Taken together these data suggest that HuR binds the full length <italic>H19</italic> RNA and inhibits processing of miR-675 at the Drosha step. Nevertheless, HuR ablation does not result in complete processing of <italic>H19</italic>, suggesting that other mechanisms exist to protect <italic>H19</italic> from Drosha cleavage, possibly including the other <italic>H19</italic> RNA binding proteins we identified. Drosha localizes exclusively to the nucleus while the <italic>H19</italic> RNA is known to localize predominantly to the cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> and thus it is likely that HuR (and perhaps other RNA binding proteins) protects <italic>H19</italic> from processing by Drosha while it is localized to the nucleus, but that another level of protection is afforded by nuclear export of <italic>H19</italic>. A family of Igf2 mRNA binding proteins have been implicated in the cytoplasmic localization of <italic>H19</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and these proteins are thus additional candidates for conferring inhibition of miR-675 processing. To determine whether HuR affects the nuclear export of <italic>H19</italic>, we performed nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA fractionations from wildtype and <italic>HuR</italic><sup>-/-</sup> MEF cells and found no change in the abundance of nuclear <italic>H19</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d, e</xref>). Moreover, fractionation of placental RNA revealed that the increasing miR-675 expression observed in that organ is not due to increased nuclear <italic>H19</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f - i</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>miR-675 slows cell proliferation</title><p id="P9">The fact that miR-675 has been conserved during evolution, despite suppression of its processing, suggests a function for the miRNA as well as a need for precise regulation of its dosage. To examine its function we transiently transfected miR-675-5p and miR-675-3p mimics into MEF, C2C12, TS and ES cell lines and found that the proliferation rate of all cell lines was reduced by at least 50% in the presence of miR-675 compared to a scrambled control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a - d</xref>). TUNEL staining showed this effect was not due to increased apoptosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. S3a</xref>), rather we noticed that the negative regulator of cell cycle <italic>Rb1</italic> was upregulated by miR-675, indicating a possible reduction of cell cycle rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. S3b</xref>). Interestingly, it was not a single species of miR-675 that was responsible for the reduced proliferation, but rather miR-675-5p slowed the rate of proliferation of ES, TS and to a lesser extent MEF cells, while miR-675-3p slowed that of MEF and C2C12 cells. To confirm these results we utilized the A2lox.cre ES cell line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> to create cells capable of doxycycline induced expression of either miR-675-5p (A2lox-5p), miR-675-3p (A2lox-3p) or a scrambled control (A2lox-scrambled). To avoid inhibition of processing we placed these miRNAs in the miR-30 hairpin context and observed selective upregulation of either species of miR-675 upon the addition of doxycycline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). Cell proliferation assays confirmed the results of the transient miR-675 mimic experiments in ES cells in that proliferation of the A2lox-5p cell line was slowed by the addition of doxycycline, while no effect was observed on the A2lox-3p or A2lox-scrambled cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e - g</xref>).</p><p id="P10"><italic>H19</italic> was first shown to have tumor suppressor properties by overexpression in the G401 metastatic rhabdoid tumor cell line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. We investigated whether miR-675, rather than <italic>H19</italic> itself, may have been responsible for this previously reported effect by overexpressing the smaller RNA in these cells. Indeed we observed reduced proliferation of G401 cells when treated with miR-675-5p as opposed to a scrambled control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>). Finally, we took advantage of the fact that both <italic>H19</italic> and miR-675 become expressed in differentiating C2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>) to perform antagomiR mediated loss of function experiments and found that proliferation of these cells increased when miR-675-3p was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4i</xref>). Taken together these results show that miR-675 is a functional component of the <italic>H19</italic> RNA, capable of suppressing cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S6"><title>Deletion of both <italic>H19</italic> and miR-675 results in placental overgrowth</title><p id="P11">Given the growth limiting effect of miR-675 it was interesting to note that expression of the miRNA in the placenta is concomitant with the natural cessation of the growth of that organ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Moreover mice that carry a 13 kb deletion that includes <italic>H19</italic>, miR-675 and 10 kb of regulatory sequences upstream of <italic>H19</italic> show an overgrowth phenotype that is more severe in the placenta (145 % WT) than the embryo (123 % WT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.

We cloned the <italic>Igf1r</italic> 3&#x02032;UTR downstream of a luciferase reporter construct and co-transfected it into cells alongside either a miR-675-3p mimic or a scrambled control. We found that luciferase levels were reduced by more than 60 % in the presence of miR-675-3p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>). This effect was not observed when the miR-675-3p binding sites were mutated, thus <italic>Igf1r</italic> is a potential target of miR-675-3p. Moreover <italic>Igf1r</italic> was found to be upregulated in <italic>H19</italic><sup>&#x00394;3</sup> placentas only at the time when miR-675 is expressed (E18.5) and not when it is silent (E11.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f</xref>)<bold>,</bold> suggesting it is a target of the microRNA <italic>in vivo.</italic></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S9"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P14">Our results suggest that a physiological role of <italic>H19</italic> is to slow down growth of the placenta in the second half of gestation, in preparation for parturition. This appears to be achieved at least in part by downregulation of the RNA binding protein HuR during gestation which normally blocks processing of miR-675 at the Drosha stage. Increased levels of miR-675 in the placenta are concomitant with downregulation of <italic>Igf1r</italic>, amongst other targets which may also contribute to reduced growth. Igf1r has been shown to be an important regulator of growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, with its main ligand being Igf2. Remarkably, the <italic>H19</italic> locus therefore regulates the abundance of Igf2 (through imprinting) and that of its receptor, Igf1r, through miR-675.</p><p id="P15">While data presented here applies to growth regulation in the placenta under physiological conditions, it is notable that in embryonic tissues miR-675 remains tightly repressed despite the high levels of <italic>H19</italic>. We speculate that the enormous reservoir of the growth suppressing miR-675 could be rapidly mobilized in response to cellular stress or abnormal proliferation. Indeed, HuR is known to relocate from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in stress conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> and upon pharmacologically induced neoplastic transformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. This would expose <italic>H19</italic> to processing by Drosha, thus liberating miR-675. <italic>HuR</italic> was recently shown to suppress processing of human miR-7 from the highly expressed <italic>HNRNPK</italic> transcript<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. That miR-7 is also a known tumor suppressor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> that functions partly through <italic>Igf1r</italic> targeting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, may suggest a wider miRNA repertoire for a <italic>HuR</italic> mediated response to aberrant cell proliferation. The <italic>H19</italic> RNA being a regulatable reservoir of the proliferation suppressing miR-675 may thus explain the lincRNAs tumour suppressive role, especially in childhood tumours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. The mechanisms of processing and function of miR-675 are likely to be relevant to the molecular pathology of fetal growth and cancer syndromes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S10"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Cell Culture</title><p id="P16">ES cells were the J1 line and were maintained on gelatinized dishes in ES media (Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium containing sodium pyruvate and l-glutamine (DMEM), supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1% penicillin / streptomycin, 1x non-essential amino acids, 0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (1000 units / ml) (Millipore)).</p><p id="P17">TS cells were the TS-rs26 line derived in the Rossant Laboratory, cultured in standard conditions (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1% antibiotic / antimycotic solution, 1x sodium pyruvate and 0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 ng/ml b-fetal growth factor (bFGF) (Sigma) and 1 &#x003bc;g / ml heparin (Sigma) with 70% of the media preconditioned with embryonic feeder cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>).
