Here, we describe a general pipeline in which candidate functional SNPs are first evaluated by fine-mapping, epigenomic profiling, and epigenome editing and then interrogated for causal function by using genome editing to create isogenic cell lines. To validate this approach, we analyzed the 6q22.1 prostate cancer risk locus and identified rs339331 as the top scoring SNP. Epigenome editing confirmed that rs339331 possessed regulatory potential. Using transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-mediated genome-editing, we created a panel of isogenic 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell lines representing all three genotypes (TT, TC, CC) at rs339331. Introduction of the &#x0201c;T&#x0201d; risk allele increased transcription of the <italic>RFX6</italic> gene, increased HOXB13 binding at the rs339331 region, and increased deposition of the enhancer-associated H3K4me2 histone mark at the rs339331 region. The cell lines also differed in cellular morphology and adhesion, and pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes suggested an influence of androgens. In summary, we have developed and validated a widely accessible approach to establish functional causality for non-coding sequence variants identified by GWAS.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P2">In contrast to Mendelian disorders, the vast majority of trait-associated common polymorphisms are located in the non-protein coding genome<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, with many GWAS variants falling within gene regulatory elements. Trait-associated polymorphisms are enriched for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Moreover, the primary ENCODE paper recently reported a substantial enrichment of GWAS variants in ENCODE defined regions<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, and another large-scale study revealed that approximately 75% of all noncoding GWAS single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or their proxies, are within a defined DNase I hypersensitive site<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. However, linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the lack of a genetic code for the non-protein coding genome make functional interpretation of trait-associated polymorphisms particularly vexing. Even in large-scale fine mapping studies, LD prohibits the unambiguous identification of causal variants.</p><p id="P3">Genome and epigenome editing technologies provide ideal and powerful tools to assess the functional significance of polymorphisms in the endogenous human genome. Epigenome editing reagents, which induce targeted recruitment of enzymes or domains that modify gene expression, can be used to validate the regulatory potential of particular genomic sequences. Genome editing nucleases including zinc fingers, TALENs and CRISPR/Cas constructs can be used to create isogenic series of disease-relevant cell lines representing the different genotypes of a candidate functionally causal risk SNP, enabling genotype-phenotype investigations in an identical and appropriate genetic background.</p><p id="P4">Despite the potential power of these technologies to address SNP causality, to our knowledge, no previously published study has used epigenome and/or genome editing methods to establish the functional significance of a non-coding variant identified through cancer GWA studies. A recent study used transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) to evaluate a variant correlated with fetal hemoglobin levels by deleting a 10-kb region harboring this SNP in intron-2 of the mouse <italic>Bcl11a</italic> gene. Although removal of this large sequence by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair significantly decreased BCL11A transcript and protein levels<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, the deletion of such a large segment of DNA does not directly demonstrate the causal effect of the original polymorphism. Another study used nuclease-induced homology-directed repair (HDR) to characterize a regulatory mutation in a family for the rare autosomal recessive disorder, premature chromatid separation (PCS) syndrome<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. However, these studies were not performed in a cellular context that is relevant for the actual disease; in addition, creation of the cell lines required a labor-intensive, two-step antibiotic selection method that is not amenable to higher-throughput use<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Currently, no validated experimental pipeline has been described to establish the mechanisms underlying risk SNPs despite repeated descriptions of the importance of such an approach in the published literature<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Here we describe the development and validation of a fully integrated, end-to-end pipeline that we call CAUSEL, <underline>C</underline>haracterization of <underline>A</underline>lleles <underline>US</underline>ing <underline>E</underline>diting of <underline>L</underline>oci, which enables experimental establishment of the functional causality of trait-associated variants. CAUSEL is comprised of five main steps: fine mapping, epigenomic profiling, epigenome editing, genome editing, and phenotyping. To demonstrate the feasibility of this concept, we evaluated the intronic prostate cancer risk locus located on chromosome 6q22.1 <sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Our work establishes the causal function of a specific variant at this locus, and provides validation for the CAUSEL pipeline.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S3"><title>Overview of CAUSEL</title><p id="P6">To establish a general method for assessing the functional significance of non-coding SNP variants, we assembled a pipeline consisting of five main steps (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>): (1) fine mapping to identify the range of candidate causal variants, (2) epigenomic profiling to narrow the field of candidate SNPs, (3) epignome editing to establish the regulatory potential of genomic regions bearing the variants, (4) homology-directed repair (HDR) induced by genome-editing nucleases combined with a barcoding screening strategy to create isogenic cell lines bearing the full range of potential genotypes, and (5) phenotypic analysis of the isogenic cell lines.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Application to 6q22.1</title><p id="P7">To validate this method, we focused on a prostate cancer risk locus located on chromosome 6q22.1. This locus had been previously shown to have a strong correlation with prostate cancer and to act as an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for <italic>RFX6</italic> expression<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. The presence of an eQTL and its target gene make a locus particularly attractive for genome editing because they provide a testable hypothesis for genome editing &#x02013; modification of a causal (but not correlated) variant will alter transcript levels.</p><p id="P8">To identify the strongest candidate causal variants, fine mapping data was evaluated from over 35,000 individuals and 27 SNPs were identified <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 1a&#x02013;d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>). All of these variants are strongly associated with prostate cancer risk and are genetically indistinguishable, with association <italic>P</italic> values within 1 order of magnitude (range: 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup> to 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;17</sup>).</p><p id="P9">To further narrow the list of 27 candidate causal SNPs identified by fine mapping, we overlayed the genomic locations of these variants with epigenetic features in the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line obtained from publicly available databases and in primary prostate tumors. This analysis identified one SNP, rs339331, over the other 26 variants as having the highest likelihood of being functionally relevant (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). Of note, the &#x0201c;T&#x0201d; risk allele of rs339331 has been previously shown to create a binding site for the prostate lineage-specific HOXB13 transcription factor in prostate cancer cell lines<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. We confirmed that HOXB13 binding occurs in primary human prostate tumors using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR). We observed strong enrichment of HOXB13 binding in two independent prostate tumor samples thereby demonstrating that this region is a <italic>bona fide</italic> HOXB13 binding site in human tissue (Methods; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To functionally test the hypothesis that rs339331 is located within an <italic>RFX6</italic> regulatory sequence, we used targeted epigenome editing reagents. TALE-LSD1 fusion proteins consist of a programmable transcription activator-like effector (TALE) array, which can be engineered to bind nearly any DNA sequence of interest<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, fused to LSD1, a histone lysine-specific demethylase. Previous work has shown that TALE-LSD1 fusions can remove H3K4 methylation marks associated with enhancers and decrease their gene regulatory activities<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. We designed two TALE-LSD1 fusions that overlapped the HOXB13 binding site that encompasses rs339331 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). These two fusions significantly suppressed <italic>RFX6</italic> transcript levels by three-fold in the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). In a reciprocal experiment, we fused the same DNA-binding TALE repeat arrays from the TALE-LSD1 proteins to a VP64 transcriptional activation domain to create artificial TALE-activators<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Site-specific recruitment of VP64 to rs339331 resulted in a greater than two-fold increase in <italic>RFX6</italic> expression (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>). We obtained similar results when we performed these same experiments in 22Rv1, an independent prostate cancer cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the rs339331 site lies within a genomic region that can transcriptionally regulate expression of the target RFX6 gene.</p><p id="P11">Next, we used TALE nuclease (TALEN)-mediated HDR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>) to create a series of isogenic 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell lines each harboring one of the three rs339331 genotypes (the parental diploid 22Rv1 line harbors a heterozygous genotype of CT). Because we found nuclease-induced HDR of the rs339331 locus to be a low frequency event in 22Rv1 cells, we developed a barcoding strategy that enabled us to both efficiently isolate single cell clones and sequence the target locus of thousands of clones at nucleotide resolution without the need for antibiotic resistance marker selection.</p><p id="P12">The method uses traditional barcoding for clones within a plate coupled with an amplicon shifting strategy resulting in each plate being tagged with a unique amplicon (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5</xref>). With this method, we analyzed 1,920 clones derived from two independent transfection experiments (960 clones from each) in one high-throughput sequencing lane (Methods). We obtained evaluable data for 1,832 clones, of which 407 retained the heterozygous status of the parental line. Thus, the percentage of single cells bearing at least one mutated rs339331 allele was 78% (1,425/1,832) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref> and Methods). Among these mutations, we identified 459 distinct alleles that were generated by this TALEN pair (Methods; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>) with variable-length deletions most likely induced by mutagenic non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)-mediated repair<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. The percentage of single cell clones with homozygous alleles at rs339331 (created by induction of one of the two desired HDR-mediated alterations in one allele) was 0.2% for the TT clones and 0.4% for the CC clones: 2/916 clones bearing TT (mediated by HDR with the donor template used to create the &#x0201c;T&#x0201d; allele) and 4/916 clones bearing CC (mediated by HDR with the donor template used to create the &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; allele) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To assess the phenotypic impacts of rs339331 alteration, we first examined expression of the RFX6 target gene in the isogenic 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell lines (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). Baseline <italic>RFX6</italic> expression variability measured in 20 unmodified 22RV1 cell clones (CT heterozygous at rs339331) showed consistent levels of expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). By contrast, <italic>RFX6</italic> transcript levels were significantly altered in the isogenic modified cell lines: in two independent clones bearing homozygous TT risk alleles, <italic>RFX6</italic> expression was significantly increased relative to the parental, heterozygous (CT) parental line, while two independent clones bearing homozygous CC protective alleles showed decreased <italic>RFX6</italic> expression (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). We measured the allelic ratio of <italic>RFX6</italic> mRNA levels in the TT and CC homozygous cell clones to further examine the impact of rs339331 genotypes on <italic>RFX6</italic> gene expression. Using another SNP, rs12202378, located in intron 12 of <italic>RFX6</italic> (r<sup>2</sup> with rs339331 = 0.97) as a marker to distinguish between allelic transcripts, we observed that the allelic mRNA ratio was balanced at rs12202378 for cell lines homozygous (TT or CC) at rs339331 but was imbalanced for the parental, heterozygous cell line (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c,d</xref>). Not unexpectedly, in 22Rv1 cell clones bearing variable-length NHEJ-induced deletions, which presumably disrupt HOXB13 binding, we also observed downregulated expression of <italic>RFX6</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). To further substantiate the role of this region in a second independent cell line, we also performed genome editing of the hypotetraploid LNCaP prostate cancer cell line, which carries only the &#x0201c;T&#x0201d; allele at rs339331. Nine independent cell clones each carrying a variable-length NHEJ-mediated deletion all showed decreased <italic>RFX6</italic> transcript levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that introduction of a &#x0201c;T&#x0201d; risk allele at rs339331 causes increased <italic>RFX6</italic> expression while introduction of a &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; protective allele results in decreased <italic>RFX6</italic> expression.</p><p id="P14">We next used ChIP-qPCR to interrogate the state of regulatory epigenetic marks across the CC, CT, and TT genotypes in our isogenic 22Rv1 cell lines. Consistent with the gene expression data, we found that both the HOXB13 transcription factor occupancy and the H3K4me2 post-translational histone modification characteristic of enhancers were higher in the TT clones compared to the TC and CC clones at the rs339331 locus (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e,f</xref>). ChIP-qPCR in the parental, heterozygous cell line confirmed this observation for HOXB13 (as previously shown)<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and H3K4me2 by demonstrating greater binding to the T variant than the C allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8a,b</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We next assessed if there are phenotypic differences relevant to cancer among the three isogenic 22Rv1 cell lines. Homozygous TT and parental TC cells displayed a mesenchymal-type morphology, whereas CC clones were rounder with a regular cobblestone morphology, and formed tight colonies more typical of normal, untransformed epithelial cells (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). Because changes in cell shape can indicate a difference in the expression of proteins involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, we performed assays to test the ability of cells to adhere to collagen and plastic. TT clones adhered significantly more readily to both substrates than the CC clones (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). In contrast to a previous report, where modulation of <italic>RFX6</italic> expression by shRNAs and siRNAs affected cell proliferation, invasion and migration<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, we did not detect any significant differences in these phenotypes with respect to genotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>).</p><p id="P16">To assess the impact of rs339331 alteration on global gene expression, we profiled the transcriptomes of the isogenic cell lines (both CC clonal lines (N=2), both TT clonal lines (N=2), and the parental 22Rv1 lines (N=2) using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) followed by validation of selected differentially expressed genes by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10a</xref>). Principal component analysis of the data showed that independent biological replicates clustered together according to genotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10b</xref>). One hundred and fifty three genes were differentially expressed in the CC cell lines compared to the parental TC cells, and 43 genes were differentially expressed in the TT cell lines compared to the parental TC cells (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). This is consistent with the greater phenotypic similarities we observed between the parental cell lines and homozygous TT clones. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis using the differential gene set identified between the CC and TT cell lines highlighted androgenic compounds and the androgen receptor as predicted upstream regulators of gene expression changes (<italic>P</italic> value for AR=8.2&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>, CC v TT, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>).

However, our study is the first to describe the successful integration of all of these steps into a single validated pipeline for the systematic and comprehensive evaluation of the impact of genotype on phenotype.</p><p id="P18">We selected the previously identified 6q22 prostate cancer risk locus to demonstrate proof-of-concept of this pipeline<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Previous work from others showed that this locus was an established eQTL for <italic>RFX6</italic> expression and that suppression of <italic>RFX6</italic> levels resulted in alterations in proliferation, migration, and invasion<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Although this earlier study had shown that the T risk allele induced stronger binding of HOXB13 in prostate cancer cell lines, it did not provide proof of direct causality on <italic>RFX6</italic> expression <sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. By contrast, we used the CAUSEL pipeline to move beyond correlation and to show HOXB13 binding <italic>in vivo</italic> in primary human prostate tumors and to prove functional causality of rs339331 on <italic>RFX6</italic> target gene expression, on induction of cellular phenotypic alterations, and on global transcriptional changes that link androgen receptor signaling with <italic>RFX6</italic> expression. Our observation of somewhat different cellular phenotypic effects than the earlier report may be attributable to our use of genetic modification of an endogenous SNP allele on <italic>RFX6</italic> expression as opposed to the shRNA and siRNA-based suppression approach used in the previous study<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. This difference in phenotypic outcomes reinforces the importance of performing true genetic analysis rather than using other techniques such as shRNA that do not necessarily correctly recapitulate the phenotypic impacts of sequence variation.</p><p id="P19">Although our initial validation of the CAUSEL pipeline used TALENs, any of the various genome-editing nucleases, including CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases, ZFNs or meganucleases, can be used to create isogenic cell lines. We used TALENs because this was the platform of choice at the time we initiated this work, but we are currently using CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases in our on-going studies. The choice of which genome editing platform to use will depend on many factors, including the specific experimental question, the cell type, the locus being modified, desired ease of use, and the intrinsic design constraints of the genome editing reagents. Similarly, although we used engineered TALEs to direct LSD1 or transcriptional activation domains to specific loci, the epigenome editing component of CAUSEL might also be practiced using engineered zinc finger arrays or catalytically inactive Cas9.</p><p id="P20">An important consideration for experiments that use genome-editing nucleases to create isogenic cell lines is the potential for confounding off-target mutations<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. This possibility exists regardless of the specific genome-editing nuclease platform used. Although we and others have shown that TALENs can induce off-target mutations<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, we believe it is unlikely that our results are confounded by such effects because the same TALEN pair was used to create the homozygous &#x0201c;T&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; lines, which in turn showed different but consistent effects on <italic>RFX6</italic> expression in more than one cell clone. Users of the CAUSEL pipeline need to be aware of the possibility for off-target mutations and to design their experiments appropriately. Although genome-wide methods for determining off-target effects of nucleases are beginning to be described in the literature<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, these approaches are likely not necessary if appropriate control experiments are performed as we have done in this report.</p><p id="P21">The barcoding-based single cell screening approach that we developed for clonal genotyping should provide an important and broadly useful tool for genome editing projects. This method is flexible with respect to scale and can be used with any genome editing platform. For our experiments, the frequency of obtaining cells bearing HDR of one allele and not having an NHEJ-induced indel mutation in either allele was very low and necessitated a screen that enabled high-throughput genotyping. We envision that for many other similar experiments performed with the CAUSEL pipeline, the rate of obtaining desired HDR-modified cell clones will be low because: NHEJ-mediated repair can efficiently introduce unwanted indel mutations; and because the strategy of introducing additional mutations that prevent re-cleavage of the locus following successful HDR modification cannot be easily adapted to non-coding loci. However, even for genome editing experiments with higher rates of desired modifications, we believe that our screening approach will provide an economical and comprehensive method for genotyping cell clones; for example, enabling the pooling of multiple editing experiments into a single sequencing run.</p><p id="P22">In summary, this strategy provides an important blueprint for addressing the causal significance of the numerous trait-associated non-protein coding variants that have been and will continue to be identified. As the field advances, larger screens across multiple cell types and loci and <italic>in vivo</italic> modeling to characterize the role of inherited variation in disease development will continue to unravel the underlying biology of human traits. Thus, we envision that the CAUSEL approach will be of wide utility to the GWAS research community.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Fine Mapping</title><p id="P23">We combined data from studies with existing high-density SNP genotyping in prostate cancer GWAS in the following populations: European ancestry [8,600 cases and 6,946 controls from the Cancer of the Prostate in Sweden (CAPS)<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3)<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> African ancestry [5,327 cases and 5,136 controls from the African Ancestry Prostate Cancer GWAS Consortium (AAPC)<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and the Ghana Prostate Study]<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>; Japanese ancestry [2,563 cases and 4,391 controls from GWAS in Japanese in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC)]<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> and Latino ancestry [a GWAS of 1,034 cases and 1,046 controls from the MEC]<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>.

Clones containing fewer than a total of 40 reads were discarded (N=40) leaving 1,880 (1,920&#x02013;40) clones for sequence variant characterization.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Sequence variant characterization and genotyping</title><p id="P47">On average, each clone had 5,797 reads (10.9 million/1,880 clones). The unix command, <italic>uniq</italic>, allowed the identification of unique sequences that were present for each clone. These unique sequences were then tallied using another series of commands. From the total reads, we selected the two most abundant sequences in each sample. If the two most abundant sequences comprised at least 80% of the total number of reads, the clone was considered pure, i.e., not polyclonal. Next, the 21 basepair core region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5a</xref>) was used to assign each of the two sequences into three possible groups (C, T, or Mut). If the sequence matched the 21 base pair string, &#x02018;TCCCCAGTTT<underline>C</underline>ATGAGGTTTA&#x02019; (the underlined base is the C/T SNP at rs339331), it was called as a &#x02018;C&#x02019; allele; if the sequence matched the &#x02018;TCCCCAGTTT<underline>T</underline>ATGAGGTTTA&#x02019; string, it was called as a &#x02018;T&#x02019; allele. If the sequence did not match either, it was categorized as &#x02018;Mut&#x02019;. At the end of this step, each clone is assigned to one of the following six possibilities &#x02013; &#x02018;T/T&#x02019;, &#x02018;C/C&#x02019;, &#x02018;T/C&#x02019;, &#x02018;T/Mut&#x02019;, &#x02018;C/Mut&#x02019;, &#x02018;Mut/Mut&#x02019;. At this step, we still do not know the nucleotide sequence of the &#x02018;Mut&#x02019; alleles and &#x02018;Mut&#x02019; can result from a substitution, insertion, or deletion.</p><p id="P48">To characterize the actual alleles at the nucleotide level, we used the BLAST algorithm to align each of the top two sequences for each clone against a 141 bp region of the RFX6 region, which was considered as the reference sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). After this initial alignment, we focused specifically on the 21 basepair core region that is in common to all amplicons (the yellow highlighted sequence in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>) and alleles were called only if they occurred in this region. Based on this pipeline, we identified a total of 459 individual allele variants (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) resulting from NHEJ- and HDR- nuclease-induced modifications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).</p><p id="P49">All scripts for processing and analyzing the sequencing data are available by contacting the corresponding authors.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Variant visualization</title><p id="P50">The weblogo tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/logo.cgi">http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/logo.cgi</ext-link>) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>) was used to visualize the distribution and frequency of deletions in our dataset. The heatmap in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref> was created based on all of the identified alleles (N=459) with certain deletion length; and the number of other alteration (base substitution or insertion resulted by NHEJ) and their combinations. The heatmap shows the distribution and correlation of the number of altered and deleted positions (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). The pie chart shows the distribution of certain genotype categories, including; C/T (parental/unmodified); C_or_T / Mut (one chromosome altered); Mut/Mut (both chromosomes altered); C/C or T/T (recombinant). Mut means that the sequence differs from the parental including (deletions, insertions and substitutions) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Adhesion assays</title><p id="P51">Cells were normalized to 0.3&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml and applied to 96 well plates uncoated or coated with collagen IV (Sigma Aldrich).

This process consists of colony transfer into tissue culture plates and making replica plates; one for DNA extraction and genotyping and one for continued growth of colonies. The rest of the figure focuses on the sequencing pipeline. In this example, there are five separate plates for genotyping. (<bold>b</bold>) Each plate (represented by the blue bars) is barcoded by a unique amplicon and each amplicon contains the area of interest (denoted by the red hash mark). Each amplicon is shifted by 2&#x02013;3 basepairs relative to the previous one. PCR based target amplicon generation using cell lysate from the plates is performed. (<bold>c</bold>) Within an individual plate, conventional dual barcoding is performed. Thus, each well (e.g., well A1) from separate plates will have the same conventional dual barcodes, but will be distinguished by the amplicon, which is unique for each plate.

Each clone is identified by its plate number (amplicon barcode) and well position (conventional barcode). A full computational pipeline has been developed and is available upon request. See Methods for full details.
