Following Notch1-dependent T-cell lineage specification during which the first T-cell lineage genes are expressed and myeloid and dendritic cell potential is lost, T-cell specific transcription factors subsequently induce T-cell commitment by repressing residual natural killer (NK)-cell potential. How these processes are regulated in human is poorly understood, especially since efficient T-cell lineage commitment requires a reduction in Notch signalling activity following T-cell specification. Here, we show that GATA3, in contrast to TCF1, controls human T-cell lineage commitment through direct regulation of three distinct processes: repression of NK-cell fate, upregulation of T-cell lineage genes to promote further differentiation and restraint of Notch activity. Repression of the Notch1 target gene <italic>DTX1</italic> hereby is essential to prevent NK-cell differentiation. Thus, GATA3-mediated positive and negative feedback mechanisms control human T-cell lineage commitment.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="i1" xlink:href="ncomms11171-i1.jpg"/>Strong Notch signalling promotes initial T cell lineage specification of lymphoid progenitors but is also permissive for thymic natural killer (NK) cell development.

Nevertheless, other developmental options, such as NK-cell potential, are still retained within these cells.

However, these studies also revealed that Notch signalling is permissive for NK cell development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, indicating that Notch activation is not sufficient to induce T-cell commitment, in agreement with other studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Moreover, following the strong NOTCH1-dependent T-lineage specification step, induction of human T-lineage commitment and further differentiation into &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-lineage double positive (DP) thymocytes occurs more efficiently when Notch signalling activity is reduced<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. In agreement, Notch target genes that require the highest level of Notch activation (such as <italic>NRARP</italic> and <italic>DTX1</italic>) are repressed during the commitment process, while others (such as <italic>HES1</italic> and <italic>MYC</italic>) remain expressed until the cells have passed through the &#x003b2;-selection checkpoint<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. While changes in Notch signal strength could explain such differential regulation, other transcriptional regulators may also control the expression of Notch target genes, as previously illustrated for E-protein dependent <italic>HES1</italic> expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Indeed, when the expression patterns of known Notch target genes are studied individually, it is clear that other regulatory inputs are required to explain the diversity in expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, a phenomenon that is also observed during mouse T cell development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p><p>Given that Notch signalling is not sufficient to control human T-lineage commitment, we investigated which other transcription factors mediate this process. We focused on TCF1 and GATA3, two essential regulatory proteins during T cell development, and show that GATA3, but not TCF1, controls the human T-lineage commitment process. We demonstrate that TCF1 requires Notch activation to induce T-lineage specification, whereas GATA3 is required to induce T-lineage commitment through direct regulatory roles that lead to repression of NK-cell fate and progression along the T developmental pathway. In addition, GATA3 provides a negative feedback onto the Notch signalling pathway in which repression of <italic>DTX1</italic> is required to prevent diversion into the NK-cell pathway. Overall, our work reveals that GATA3 is required to shut off NK-cell development and to restrict Notch signalling activity to promote T-cell commitment in human T-cell progenitors.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Notch signalling is insufficient to induce T-cell commitment</title><p>Notch signalling is essential to induce T-lineage specification in both mouse and human but its role in human T-cell commitment is less clear.

These findings indicate that TCF1 requires Notch activation to induce human T-lineage specification, in contrast to in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, and that TCF1, like Notch, is not sufficient to discriminate between NK- and T-cell lineages.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>High-level GATA3 inhibits notch-induced T-cell specification</title><p>We subsequently investigated whether GATA3 was capable of inducing human T-lineage commitment at the expense of natural killer (NK) cell development.

Thus, whereas TCF1 synergizes with Notch activation to induce T-lineage specification and supports both T and NK cell development, simultaneous GATA3 and Notch activation in HPCs results in inhibition of T-lineage specification due to GATA3-mediated interference of Notch activation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>GATA3-mediated restraint of notch concurs with T commitment</title><p>While our <italic>ex vivo</italic> isolated progenitor subsets revealed simultaneous induction of <italic>TCF7</italic>, <italic>GATA3</italic> and Notch target gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>) within the most immature human CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD1a<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes, the heterogeneity of this population may obscure the detection of discrete developmental stages of early T cell development that could reveal kinetic differences in the expression of these genes.

This revealed that the induction of <italic>TCF7</italic> and <italic>GATA3</italic> is delayed compared with the direct Notch targets <italic>DTX1</italic> and <italic>HES1</italic>, when sequential stages of T cell development are evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), consistent with earlier findings in both mouse and human<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Thus, instead of acting simultaneously, TCF1 and GATA3 may act sequentially following initial Notch signalling to induce T cell commitment at the expense of NK cell differentiation.</p><p>Since earlier work from our lab revealed that a reduction in Notch signalling activity enhances human T-lineage commitment and differentiation into DP thymocytes, we focused on GATA3 because its negative effect on Notch activation, as characterized above, could provide a molecular mechanism that mediates this process. Indeed, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that the most significant Notch-dependent genes in human CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> thymocytes, including <italic>IGFR1</italic> and <italic>RUNX3</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>), are downregulated during the CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD1a<sup>&#x02212;</sup> to CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD1a<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transition that marks human T-lineage commitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>), confirming an initial but partial reduction in Notch signalling activity at this developmental stage as also previously illustrated for the Notch targets <italic>DTX1</italic> and <italic>NRARP</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Furthermore, GATA3 transduction results in repression of these Notch-dependent genes in human CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> thymocytes (48&#x02009;h after transduction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>), suggesting a negative feedback of GATA3 onto the Notch pathway during the induction of T-lineage commitment.</p><p>To functionally test this hypothesis, we introduced GATA3 into CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD1a<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T-lineage specified thymocytes, cells that already received strong Notch signalling <italic>in vivo</italic>. In this setting, <italic>GATA3</italic> transduction also resulted in 10-fold higher <italic>GATA3</italic> levels compared with in <italic>in vivo</italic> thymocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), thus yielding similar levels as in CB transduction experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). Consistent with previous experiments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, reduction of Notch signalling activity by adding a low, 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;M concentration of the &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor (GSI) 7 (<italic>N</italic>-[<italic>N</italic>-(3,5-difluorophenyl)-l-alanyl]-s-phenyl-glycine t-butyl ester) (DAPT) in control-transduced cells resulted in an accelerated development towards the DP stage, in comparison to when Notch signalling was present (0&#x02009;&#x003bc;M GSI, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Interestingly, elevated <italic>GATA3</italic> levels in the presence of Notch signalling also resulted in such an enhanced differentiation towards the DP stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>) and yielded higher numbers of DP thymocytes at that time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). In contrast, <italic>TCF7</italic> expression did not accelerate T cell development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f,g</xref>). Thus, following Notch induced T-lineage specification, GATA3 can restrain Notch signalling activity to promote further T-lineage differentiation, illustrating context-specific effects of GATA3 on human T cell development.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>GATA3 is essential to prevent NK cell development</title><p>Human T-lineage commitment is not only characterized by a functional requirement to reduce Notch activation, but also demands loss of NK-cell potential.

GATA3 reduction significantly increased both the frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>) and absolute number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>) of NK cells, while the number of CD7<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell precursors significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>), thereby causing a fivefold reduction in the T/NK cell ratio compared with the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>).

These differential effects of <italic>GATA3</italic> shRNA knockdown on T and NK cell development were also apparent following overexpression of repressor of GATA3 (ROG (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>)), although the increase in NK cell numbers failed to reach significance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a&#x02013;c</xref>).

Here, we use functional gain- and loss-of-function experiments in primary human thymocytes, combined with genome-wide molecular data, to show that following Notch-induced human T-cell specification, GATA3, locks down T-lineage commitment by acting at three different levels. First, GATA3 prevents NK cell development by repressing NK-lineage associated genes. Second, GATA3 controls, both positive and negative, expression of Notch target genes and selectively represses those that are downregulated during human T-lineage commitment as exemplified by the Notch target gene <italic>DTX1</italic>. Third, GATA3 promotes T-lineage differentiation through upregulation of essential genes for T-cell development. Thus, GATA3 induces human T-lineage commitment through both positive and negative regulatory mechanisms following Notch and TCF1 mediated T-cell specification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>).</p><p>The positive regulatory role for GATA3 on the expression of other important transcription factors that mediate early T cell development, including <italic>TCF7</italic> and <italic>BCL11B</italic>, is consistent with observations in mice and illustrates that key components of the network are shared between species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. However, in mice it has been difficult to functionally reveal these positive roles of GATA3 using gain-of-function approaches as uncommitted thymocytes do not tolerate high levels of GATA3 in the presence of Notch signalling or are diverted to mast cells in its absence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Here, we show that GATA3 can promote developmental progression of uncommitted human T cell precursors in the presence or absence of Notch signalling, consistent with earlier findings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Thus, although human cells might be more tolerant to high levels of GATA3 compared with murine thymocytes, we propose that its interaction with other transcriptional programmes explains this difference in developmental outcome.</p><p>Indeed, previous studies from our lab have clearly illustrated differences in Notch activation status during early T cell development in human compared with in mice. While Notch activation in human peaks at T-cell specification and declines thereafter, Notch signalling continues to rise during murine T cell development until the &#x003b2;-selection checkpoint has been reached. Consistently, uncommitted early T cell precursors in human differentiate more efficiently into &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-lineage DP thymocytes when Notch activity is reduced<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, while murine ETPs remain strongly Notch-dependent until the DN3b &#x003b2;-selection stage to allow DP development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. As such, the negative feedback that GATA3 induces onto at least parts of the downstream Notch network will permit human cells to differentiate more efficiently, while murine thymocytes die as a result of the lack of Notch signalling activity during the early stages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. However, a similar GATA3-mediated mechanism may occur at &#x003b2;-selection during murine T cell development as positive effects of GATA3 become apparent at the later developmental stages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. In agreement, GATA3 repressive effects on <italic>DTX1</italic> have also been observed in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, indicating that similar mechanisms may be in play but at different stages of development. Therefore, we propose that GATA3 switches from a negative to a positive regulator of T cell development, as soon as the cells cross a Notch-dependent threshold. This would also explain why human uncommitted thymocytes are not diverted into mast cells, a property that is maintained in murine thymocytes until the peak of Notch activation is reached in DN3a thymocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.</p><p>Importantly, GATA3 does not repress all Notch target genes as illustrated by upregulation of <italic>HES1</italic> and <italic>MYC</italic>. This is important as Notch remains essential for the further development of T-lineage specified progenitor cells, although not at such high levels compared with earlier stages. This differential response of Notch target genes may be related to the individual role of each of the targets with respect to their effects on T cell development. Indeed, while it is clear that HES1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>) and MYC (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>) have positive roles during T-lineage development, DTX1 has been more considered as a negative regulator of Notch activity in mammals as illustrated through preferential B-lineage differentiation when overexpressed in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Although the role of each of the GATA3 repressed Notch targets remains to be elucidated, GATA3 may be required to selectively downregulate some Notch targets that may be detrimental for further T cell development, thereby allowing the synergistic activity of Notch and GATA3 to drive further T cell differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. The need for additional regulatory inputs to modulate different components of the Notch pathway has also been discussed during murine T cell development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, further supporting such distinct regulatory roles. It is tempting to speculate that such a GATA3 repressive mechanism onto the Notch pathway may be defective in early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ETP-ALL) cases that are associated with GATA3 mutations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> as these may lead to aberrant Notch activation and inhibition of further T-lineage differentiation.</p><p>Although the inhibition of NK cell development by GATA3 may seem in conflict with observations in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, there are several aspects that differ in our experimental approach that may account for such differences. First, GATA3 levels differ between T and NK cells and, accordingly, the development of both lineages depends on such differential expression as evident from our gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Given that our shRNA reduced GATA3 expression &#x0223c;2-fold, our results are difficult to compare with full gene deletion approaches as used in murine experiments. Second, the absence of thymic NK cells in GATA3 deficient mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> may reflect a defect in the generation of GATA3-dependent intrathymic T/NK cell precursors. Although human CD56<sup>bright</sup> cells have been associated with GATA3-dependent intrathymic NK cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, evidence now emerges that this NK cell subset represents a different stage of development compared with CD56<sup>dim</sup> cells, rather than a separate NK-lineage with different origins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. We previously could not associate intrathymic NK cells with such a particular phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and thus the difference in GATA3 levels between both human subsets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> may not reflect a different origin. Given that we incompletely knocked-down GATA3 in human uncommitted T cell precursors, potential negative effects of GATA3 on the development of these cells were circumvented. Third, species-specific differences cannot be excluded, as demonstrated previously for instance with respect to the IL7 requirement during B cell development. Intriguingly, GATA3-mediated repression of human NK cell development may involve activation of <italic>IL7R</italic> expression as evident from GATA3 binding at that region, a feature that does not occur in mice. Consistently, T cell precursors from <italic>IL2RG</italic>-deficient patients fail to commit into the T-lineage pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>, indicating that the stage of IL7R activation corresponds with the requirement for GATA3 to induce T-cell commitment. Although we did not find many differences in GATA3 occupancy between human and mouse, we may have missed other species-specific regulatory events that are controlled by GATA3 since we performed ChIP on total human thymocytes. Indeed, data in mouse show clear stage-specific changes in GATA3 occupancy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> that may be masked in our human results because of this approach. Further studies will be required to investigate this in more detail.</p><p>The capacity of GATA3 to repress alternative lymphoid differentiation, as well as stem cell genes such as <italic>LMO2</italic>, <italic>MEF2C</italic>, <italic>TAL1</italic>, <italic>PU1</italic> and <italic>BCL11A</italic> is consistent with observations in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In this way, GATA3 function in human also substantially overlaps with that of BCL11B, although this gene remains to be studied in human. Our study shows that, in human, TCF1 function seems more dependent on Notch1 activity compared with in mice since no initiation of T cell development can be observed by TCF1 in the absence of Notch activation. This may relate to the high level of Notch activation that is required during this specification stage. Nevertheless, the core transcriptional components of the T-lineage network seems identical in human and mouse, although species-specific differences in kinetics and function are clear.</p><p>Given that Notch signalling is critical in various developmental systems, our findings help to understand the mechanisms through which Notch signalling induces and supports lineage choices in these different contexts. Following the initial Notch activation phase that involves the induction of both positive and negative downstream mediators, Notch signalling further depends on the activity of lineage-specific genes that downregulate the negative downstream mediators and, as such, this allows Notch to exercise its positive regulatory roles during the initiation of various developmental programmes. The combined activation of both positive and negative downstream mediators thereby provides a mechanistic framework through which Notch can maintain progenitor cells in a multipotent state. While Notch is critical to induce particular developmental programmes, such a dual system may form the molecular basis for understanding lateral inhibition and can permit alternative lineages to differentiate in case environmental conditions do not support further progression of the &#x02018;default' programme.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Isolation of haematopoietic progenitor cells and thymocytes</title><p>Child thymus was obtained from children undergoing cardiac surgery with informed consent of the parents or guardian.
