Response to progestin therapy positively correlates with hormone receptor expression, in particular progesterone receptor (PR). However, many advanced tumors lose PR expression. We recently reported that the efficacy of progestin therapy can be significantly enhanced by combining progestin with epigenetic modulators, which we term &#x0201c;molecularly enhanced progestin therapy.&#x0201d; What remained unclear was the mechanism of action and if estrogen receptor &#x003b1; (ER&#x003b1;), the principle inducer of PR, is necessary to restore functional expression of PR via molecularly enhanced progestin therapy. Therefore, we modeled advanced endometrial tumors that have lost both ER&#x003b1; and PR expression by generating ER&#x003b1;-null endometrial cancer cell lines. CRISPR-Cas9 technology was used to delete ER&#x003b1; at the genomic level. Our data demonstrate that treatment with a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) was sufficient to restore functional PR expression, even in cells devoid of ER&#x003b1;. Our studies also revealed that HDACi treatment results in marked downregulation of the oncogene Myc. We established that PR is a negative transcriptional regulator of Myc in endometrial cancer in the presence or absence of ER&#x003b1;, which is in contrast to studies in breast cancer cells. First, estrogen stimulation augmented PR expression and decreased Myc in endometrial cancer cell lines. Second, progesterone increased PR activity yet blunted Myc mRNA and protein expression. Finally, overexpression of PR by adenoviral transduction in ER&#x003b1;-null endometrial cancer cells significantly decreased expression of Myc and Myc-regulated genes. Analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database of endometrial tumors identified an inverse correlation between PR and Myc mRNA levels, with a corresponding inverse correlation between PR and Myc downstream transcriptional targets SRD5A1, CDK2 and CCNB1. Together, these data reveal a previously unanticipated inverse relationship between the tumor suppressor PR and the oncogene Myc in endometrial cancer.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the American Cancer Society Institutional Research Grant (SY), and the NIH R01CA99908 and R01CA184101 (KKL), the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Research Development Fund (KKL).

Over 52,000 cases are diagnosed each year, and American women have a lifetime risk of 1:11 [<xref rid="pone.0148912.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The uterine endometrium is exquisitely sensitive to steroid hormones. Estrogen acting through the estrogen receptor (ER: ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2;), drives proliferation, while progesterone acts through the progesterone receptor (PR: PRA and PRB) to counteract these effects by inducing differentiation, promoting apoptosis, and inhibiting invasion [<xref rid="pone.0148912.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Based on the role of progesterone as a tumor suppressor in the endometrium, progestin-based hormonal therapy has been used to treat endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer for more than 60 years [<xref rid="pone.0148912.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, hormonal therapy has typically been successful only in tumors where hormone receptors are expressed. Our group and other groups have reported that the expression of PR positively correlates with a favorable prognosis and response to progestin treatment [<xref rid="pone.0148912.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0148912.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], whereas loss of PR expression underlies treatment failure. This limits the impact of hormonal therapy in advanced disease where receptors are lost.</p><p>In our recently published study, we provide compelling evidence that it is possible to convert a PR-negative cancer into a PR-positive cancer using epigenetic modulators [<xref rid="pone.0148912.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This approach enhances sensitivity to progestin therapy in tumors with low levels of PR and induces progestin sensitivity in tumors that were never responsive. We propose that the efficacy of progestin therapy can be significantly enhanced by combining it with epigenetic modulators, which we term &#x0201c;molecularly enhanced progestin therapy.&#x0201d;</p><p>To investigate if this molecularly enhanced progestin therapy can be applied to advanced endometrial cancer patients with ER&#x003b1; and PR negative tumors; we generated ER&#x003b1; null endometrial cancer cell lines by applying novel CRISPR-Cas9 technology to delete ER&#x003b1; at the genomic level (ESR1). Our data demonstrate that treatment with an HDACi is sufficient to restore functional PR expression, even in cells devoid of ER&#x003b1;.</p><p>Our studies also revealed a previously unanticipated inverse correlation between PR and the oncogene Myc in endometrial cancer, suggesting that HDACi treatment provides an additional advantage of Myc downregulation. We report an in-depth analysis of this correlation and hypothesize that loss of myc underlies the differentiating effects of progestin therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Antibodies and Reagents</title><p>Estradiol (#E2257) and progesterone (#P6149) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich and resuspended in ethanol.

Response to progestin-based therapy positively correlates with hormone receptor expression, in particular progesterone receptor (PR), yet many advanced tumors are devoid of PR expression as well as ER&#x003b1;, the primary transcriptional inducer of PR. We recently found that PR expression can be restored by HDACi. Herein we extend these findings by reporting that PR expression can be restored in endometrial cancer cells, even those without ER&#x003b1;. These data are critical because they suggest that, even in patients with loss of both ER&#x003b1; and PR, it may be possible to restore sensitivity to progestin through combination treatment with an epigenetic modulator. Surprisingly, we also found that the oncogene Myc, which is known to be induced by ER&#x003b1; and PR in breast cancer cells, was markedly repressed by HDACi treatment, including in cells that lack ER&#x003b1;. Moreover, exogenous expression of PR by adenovirus promoted Myc downregulation, providing further evidence that PR negatively regulates Myc expression. Consistent with the observations in cancer cells, we found that PR and Myc are inversely correlated in endometrial tumors in TCGA dataset. We hypothesize that loss of Myc underlies the differentiating effects of progestin therapy in endometrial cancer.</p><p>Myc is a well-characterized oncogene that plays a major role in the pathogenesis of many cancers [<xref rid="pone.0148912.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0148912.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Like other cancer types, Myc is highly expressed in endometrial tumors [<xref rid="pone.0148912.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Studies in transgenic mouse models reveal that Myc inactivation results in rapid tumor regression and is frequently associated with hallmarks of cellular differentiation and apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0148912.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0148912.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Despite clear evidence for the highly oncogenic role of Myc in many tumor types, including endometrial cancer, a specific small molecule inhibitor of Myc has remained elusive [<xref rid="pone.0148912.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Current drug development strategies include targeting pathways upstream or downstream of Myc, such as the bromodomain and extra-terminal motif (BET) inhibitor. Indeed, inhibition of BET in multiple myeloma results in remarkable downregulation of Myc expression and associated cell death [<xref rid="pone.0148912.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Herein we identify another potential mechanism to blunt the oncogenic effects of Myc: PR-mediated suppression of Myc transcription. Therefore, molecularly enhanced progestin therapy not only enhances sensitivity to progestin by restoring functional PR expression [<xref rid="pone.0148912.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0148912.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], but also provides an additional advantage of downregulating Myc.</p><p>Others have shown that Myc expression is regulated through epigenetic mechanisms. For example, HDACi-mediated repression of Myc expression has also been reported in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines [<xref rid="pone.0148912.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The potential mechanism is up-regulation of <italic>MXI1</italic> and <italic>SSB2</italic>, which inhibit the transcriptional activity of Myc [<xref rid="pone.0148912.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, our data suggest that the mechanism of Myc repression is through PR. First, treatment with progesterone in combination with HDACi produced a further decrease in Myc as compared to HDACi alone. Second, overexpression of PRA/B by adenovirus in ECC1-<italic>ESR1</italic> CRISPR KO cells substantially decreased Myc expression in the absence of an HDACi, indicative of a PR-mediated effect rather than a general epigenetic effect.</p><p>Several reports in breast cancer demonstrate that ER&#x003b1; and PR promote transcription of Myc through binding the estrogen response element (ERE) and progesterone response element (PRE) in the Myc promoter region [<xref rid="pone.0148912.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0148912.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0148912.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0148912.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The earliest report of a PRE in the Myc promoter region in T47D breast cancer cells was published in 1997 [<xref rid="pone.0148912.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The observation that ER&#x003b1; and PR induce Myc expression is consistent with the phenomenon that progestins used in contraception drugs promote breast cancer growth <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0148912.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0148912.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Here we report the converse effect in endometrial cancer, where expression of Myc inversely correlated with ER&#x003b1; and PR, both in endometrial cancer cell lines and in tumors from TCGA database. Control experiments in MCF7 breast cancer cells confirmed the positive correlation of Myc with ER&#x003b1; and PR in this cell type. Thus, the negative regulation of Myc by PR in endometrial cancer may provide one explanation for the opposing effects of progesterone on proliferation in breast vs. endometrial cancer.</p><p>In summary, we found that HDACi treatment of endometrial cancer cells provides the dual advantages of upregulating the tumor suppressor PR and downregulating the oncogene Myc. Unfortunately, single agent HDACi has limited clinical efficacy in solid tumors, and emerging studies are exploring the use of HDACi to &#x0201c;prime&#x0201d; tumors to other treatments [<xref rid="pone.0148912.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148912.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Based on our extensive studies of mechanisms of PR silencing in endometrial cancer, we suggest that HDACi can be used to prime endometrial tumors for responsiveness to progestin-based therapy, which we refer to as molecularly enhanced progestin therapy, via epigenetic modulation. Future studies are necessary to understand if combining an HDACi with progestin will restore PR, downregulate Myc, and lead to disease management. A first step may be to explore this combinatorial strategy in the neoadjuvant setting, which would provide the opportunity to examine PR and Myc levels in pre-treatment biopsies and in post-treatment surgical specimens obtained at the time of tumor cytoreduction. Another therapeutic opportunity is in the setting of advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer, where the majority of endometrial tumors have lost expression of PR. By integrating the epigenetic therapies into hormonal regimens, it may be possible to improve outcomes for endometrial cancer, a disease that is on the rise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0148912.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>E2 stimulation induce PR and Myc expression in MCF7 breast cancer cells.</title><p>MCF7 cells were grown in charcoal stripped serum and treated with 10nM Estroadiol (E2) as indicated time point.
