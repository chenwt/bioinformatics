We used a microarray-based system that warrants high throughput and easy handling. Seven immunogenic candidates were selected after screening. Comparative analyses by ELISA and microarrays manifested their immunodominant character. The large repetitive protein (SEN4030) that plays a role as a putative adhesin in initial cell surface interaction and is highly specific to <italic>Salmonella</italic> is considered to be the most suitable protein for a diagnostic approach. The results further demonstrate that the strategy applied herein is convenient for specifically identifying immunogenic proteins of pathogenic microorganisms. Consequently, it enables a sound assessment of promising candidates for diagnostic applications and vaccine development. Moreover, the elucidation of immunogenic proteins may assist in unveiling unknown virulence-associated factors, thus furthering the understanding of the underlying pathogenicity of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in general, and of <italic>S.</italic> Enteritidis, one of the most frequently detected serovars of this pathogen, in particular.</p><p><fig position="anchor" id="Figa"><label>Figure</label><caption><p>The microarray-based approach was aimed at identifying novel immunodominant proteins of <italic>S.</italic> Enteritidis.

However, many different serovars have been described for <italic>S. enterica</italic> including the major contributors to salmonella infections in humans, S. Enteritidis, S. Typhi, S. Typhimurium, S. Paratyphi, and S. Choleraesuis. While S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi cause typhoid fever, S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium lead to gastrointestinal infections termed salmonellosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the European Union alone, approximately 100.000 human cases of salmonellosis are reported annually, with <italic>S.</italic> Enteritidis and <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium the most frequently detected serotypes (EFSA, 2013). These non-typhoidal salmonella (NTS) cause a localized infection manifesting as nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea and fever. The infection dose is approximately 10<sup>5</sup> bacteria and the disease is mainly self-limiting with mild symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, in immunocompromised people and young children the severity of the disease may be more pronounced including typhoid-like infections potentially leading to systemic infections and sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. While several in vivo animal infection models have been used to study the pathogenicity of S. Typhimurium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], <italic>S.</italic> Enteritidis has been insufficiently studied. Additionally, evidence suggests that S. Enteritidis requires genes missing in S. Typhimurium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The detection of enteric pathogens relies primarily on standard cultivation techniques. The bacteria are cultured from food or fecal samples and detection comprises pre-enrichment, enrichment, identification of the pathogen and confirmation as mandatory steps, which usually take several days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Although standard cultivation tests are dependable and well-established, the demand for more rapid diagnostic tools is high. Especially during the containment of epidemics, isolation of patients in hospitals, and monitoring of contaminations in food-processing plants time is critical. Therefore, immunoassay-based tests, e.g. ELISA or lateral flow tests deserve consideration. Whereas ELISA is a laboratory-intensive method that takes roughly 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;h, lateral flow test strips are designed with easy handling and read-out in mind. In fact, immunochromogenic strips (ICS) based on lateral flow have been successfully introduced in the developing countries to detect <italic>Treponema pallidum</italic>, the cause for the sexually transmitted infection syphilis, among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Commonly used ELISA systems are based on a sandwich assay format using Anti-O-H antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], which detect both the O-antigen (polysaccharide) and the H-antigen (flagella) of salmonella. However, in order to improve sensitivity and specificity for future tests, a deeper understanding of specific salmonella antigens is required.</p><p>In this study, we applied a method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] based upon a cDNA expression library with subsequent immunoscreening of recombinantly expressed fusion proteins on microarrays. The expressed fusion constructs comprise an N-terminal HaloTag&#x000ae; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and the C-terminal salmonella proteins. The former is a Dehalogenase derivative that provides a covalent, irreversible and highly specific binding to its corresponding ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The high binding affinity enables a direct application of the cell lysate rendering time consuming purification steps obsolete [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Consequently, seven novel antigens of S. Enterititdis were identified.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Experimental</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Bacterial strains and growth media</title><p><italic>S</italic>.

The optical density was measured using the OMEGA Fluostar (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bmglabtech.com/">www.bmglabtech.com/</ext-link>) at a wavelength of 450&#x000a0;nm.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>cDNA library construction and screening</title><p>Screening of 1536 different samples led to 192 clones being sequenced due to their fluorescence intensity. Within this group nine genes encoding proteins with immunogenic potential were revealed. In spite of that, numerous sequenced clones displayed only gene fragments ranging from 45 to 444&#x000a0;bp resulting in poor and ambiguous identification after BLAST analysis. This might have been caused by the excessive degradation of RNA prior to cDNA synthesis as attributed by a RNA integrity number (RIN) of 2.6. Although comparative studies have shown the RNA isolation method used to be reliable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], it may have been a source for degradation. Still, this has been a proven method in revealing immunogenic proteins from pathogens and extracting RNA with high quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although, cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification may have assisted in creating short fragments, the approach presented herein was specifically selected due to its ability to generate full-length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and high quality cDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Nevertheless, normalization of cDNA prior to cloning was successful. Duplex-specific nuclease digests solely double-stranded DNA and has been used for normalization of cDNA prior to RNAseq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This is a mandatory step to reduce the highly abundant rRNA, which encompasses more than 95&#x000a0;% of a total RNA extraction. As no distinct band of 3,000&#x000a0;bp, representing cDNA derived from 23S rRNA, is visible after gel electrophoresis, the cDNA was effectively normalized. Rather, a homogeneous smear, representing cDNA molecules of different sizes, was detected. Contrary to eukaryotic mRNA harboring a poly(A) tail, prokaryotic mRNA lacks this feature and thus cannot be directly reverse transcribed using oligo(dT) primers. However, as the applied cDNA synthesis demanded the presence of a poly(A) tail, the total RNA had to be polyadenylated prior to first-strand synthesis. After normalization, cloning commenced by introducing the inserts into linearized vector using ligation-independent-cloning (LIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The LIC is a powerful tool in contrast to original cloning methods based upon ligase and restriction endonucleases, which often suffer from low efficiencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] caused mainly by short overhangs leading to nonspecific interactions and advocating religation of the vector. In contrast, LIC guarantees directional cloning at any desired site with high efficiency. Furthermore, the proteins of interest were expressed as fusion constructs harboring an N-terminal HaloTag&#x000ae;. This enabled covalent, irreversible binding to the microarray surface in a highly specific manner. Thus, purification was obsolete and cross-reactivity reduced to a minimum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Commonly, microarray-based immunoscreenings offer high throughput of samples as Zhu, et al., 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] have shown. However, most methods incorporate time-consuming and costly purification steps prior to spotting purified target protein to nitrocellulose microarrays. The combination of high-throughput microarray-based immunoscreenings and the easy handling of the HaloTag&#x000ae; system warrants a fast identification of immunogenic proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Consequently, the immunoscreenings of 1536 proteins are completed within a few hours.</p><p>Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> summarizes the nine protein candidates identified via microarray screening. The proteins encompass a highly conserved DNA primase that shows homology in all bacteria. Moreover, two hypothetical proteins (SEN1186 and SEN2464) were detected with no known function rendering these candidates highly attractive for further investigations. SEN2464 is additionally described as a methionine tRNA cytidine acetyltransferase providing precise recognition of the AUG codon for elongation-specific methionine tRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. For SEN4030, a large repetitive protein with 5559 amino acid residues, no function is known; however, it shows high similarity to SiiE of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium. SiiE is a giant non-fimbrial adhesin that facilitates initial interaction to the intestinal epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. SEN4030 and the putative isomerase (SEN1504) are conserved in <italic>Salmonella</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Membrane-association is another intriguing feature as it enhances the protein&#x02019;s accessibility in a diagnostic assay. This is true for the ais protein (SEN2278), the multidrug resistance protein A (SEN2659) and the membrane-bound lytic murein transglycosylase A precursor (SEN2832). The ais protein is a lipopolysaccharide core heptose(II)-phosphate phosphatase catalyzing the dephosphorylation of heptose(II) of the outer membrane lipopolysaccharide core. On top of that, it has just recently been identified as a virulence factor contributing to enteric infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Last but not least, SEN1186 is a DNA mismatch endonuclease located in the cytoplasm.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>List of all identified immunogenic proteins from cDNA expression library screening.

However, after initial identification, clones expressing full-length proteins were obtained for all genes except SEN4030. SEN4030 comprises approximately 17,000&#x000a0;bp, so cloning of the full-length gene was not achieved. Consequently, two sequence segments, one in the central region of the gene (6,600&#x02013;8,100&#x000a0;bp = SEN4030a) and another at the C-terminal end (13,500&#x02013;15,500&#x000a0;bp = SEN4030b) of the gene were chosen. The 444&#x000a0;bp segment identified during initial immunoscreening is located within SEN4030b. Both parts contain bacterial immunoglobulin-like domains that are mainly found in bacterial surface proteins involved in pathogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The proteins primase and membrane-bound lytic murein transglycosylase A were excluded from further analyses due to their high homology among bacteria (&#x0003e;30 genera). Identity of the full-length genes was ascertained by sequencing. The expression of correct fusion constructs was determined via SDS-PAGE, see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. All proteins were successfully expressed as fusion constructs showing the correct size including the protein of interest and the 34&#x000a0;kDa HaloTag&#x02122;. In contrast to the other proteins, SEN2278 and SEN2659 show lower intensities in PAGE. Nevertheless, this was expected as membrane proteins tend to agglomerate more easily due to the presence of extensive hydrophobic regions. Agglomeration leads to the formation of inclusion bodies, which remain inaccessible after lysis without special treatment.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Validation of correct expression of the full-length candidates (<italic>marked red</italic>) and the controls via SDS-PAGE.

SEN1019 scored the highest intensities with a mean of 1.7 in ELISA, followed by both parts of the large repetitive protein SEN4030 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Indirect ELISA measurements require purified proteins, which are added in a defined amount. During purification the HaloTag&#x000ae; is cleaved off by a special endonuclease and target proteins are immobilized undirected on the well surface. On the contrary, fusion proteins are subjected directly after lysis without additional purification in microarray experiments thanks to the specific interaction of HaloTag&#x000ae; and its ligand on the microarray surface. Still, microarray-based immunoscreenings achieved similar results, see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The box-whisker-plot shows the contrast values (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12) normalized to the known immunogenic protein FimA, a type-1 fimbriae involved in bacterial attachment to epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. All mean values were below 1; yet, the endonuclease SEN1019 displayed the highest mean intensity with 0.63. The investigated segments of SEN4030, SEN2659 and SEN2278 displayed intensities ranging from 0.4 to 0.5. Comparing both ELISA and microarray analyses, the normalized intensities differ in the two methods applied. Whereas SEN1019, SEN2659, and both parts of SEN4030 reached normalized intensities above 1, i.e. displaying a higher intensity than the positive reference FimA, in ELISA measurements, the intensities were below 1 in microarray analysis. Despite these differences, both methods show similar tendencies regarding protein candidates with immunodominant character. Additionally, microarray analysis combined results from two different antibodies reactive to <italic>S. enterica</italic>, while ELISA measurements were performed with one antibody only. Moreover, ELISA measurements represent only one fourth of the data in comparison to microarray analysis. This might have caused the observable variance in the results. Although, some uncertainty remains regarding the specificity of the polyclonal antibodies to the investigated proteins, the use of polyclonal mixtures is a prerequisite for broad initial screenings aiming at identifying novel antigens.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>ELISA of full-length purified proteins to analyze their immunogenic character using a rabbit polyclonal IgG to <italic>S. enterica</italic> antibody (Acris).

It is 98.6&#x000a0;% identical to SiiE, yet 76 amino acids are unique. SiiE is part of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity island 4 (SPI4) encoding for a type I secretion system, which secretes the adhesin SiiE. However, the protein is also partially surface-anchored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Bioinformatic analysis revealed a variety of Ig-like domains and fibronectin (type III) domains. Both domains are found in surface proteins characteristic for protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. 53 bacterial Ig-like domains are required for contact to cell surfaces. Deletion of ten or more bacterial Ig-like domains have been shown to result in a reduced infectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The fold is stabilized by Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding, which is not essential but still affects SiiE structure and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

The method used provides fast and accessible identification of antigens within two weeks starting from cDNA library construction. Furthermore, it allows for the potential illumination of virulence-associated factors, like SEN2278 and SEN4030. These proteins influence pathogenicity in <italic>Salmonella</italic> and are potential candidates for <italic>Salmonella-</italic>specific diagnostics. Nevertheless, further analyses characterizing the epitope binding regions and comprehending the gene expression levels, especially during infection, are necessary. Furthermore, determining the affinity and specificity of generated antibodies are essential prior to diagnostic application. Still, as immunogenicity assays on microarrays and ELISA have revealed, four proteins showed prominent immunogenicity. The highest intensity was obtained for the endonuclease (SEN1019), followed by a large repetitive protein (SEN4030), the multidrug resistance protein A (SEN2659), and the ais protein (SEN2278). Membrane-association of the latter three proteins grants an ideal prerequisite for effective point-of care diagnostics. Furthermore, specificity is required for clinical applications, thus <italic>Salmonella</italic> conserved proteins - the large repetitive protein (SEN4030) and the putative isomerase (SEN1504) &#x02013; represent optimal candidates for future endeavors. Consequently, as the large repetitive protein combines these key features it shows the highest probability to be outstandingly relevant for a diagnostic purpose.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [03IS2201A].
