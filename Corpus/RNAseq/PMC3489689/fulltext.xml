In the apicomplexan parasite <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) has previously been reported to play a critical role in four key stages of the life cycle. The <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> isoform (PfPKG) is essential for the initiation of gametogenesis and for blood stage schizont rupture and work on the orthologue from the rodent malaria parasite <italic>P. berghei</italic> (PbPKG) has shown additional roles in ookinete differentiation and motility as well as liver stage schizont development. In the present study, PfPKG expression and subcellular location in asexual blood stages was investigated using transgenic epitope-tagged PfPKG-expressing <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites. In Western blotting experiments and immunofluorescence analysis (IFA), maximal PfPKG expression was detected at the late schizont stage. While IFA suggested a cytosolic location, a degree of overlap with markers of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was found and subcellular fractionation showed some association with the peripheral membrane fraction. This broad localisation is consistent with the notion that PfPKG, as with the mammalian orthologue, has numerous cellular substrates. This idea is further supported by the global protein phosphorylation pattern of schizonts which was substantially changed following PfPKG inhibition, suggesting a complex role for PfPKG during schizogony.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the European Commission FP7 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/home_en.html">http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/home_en.html</ext-link>)project, &#x02018;MALSIG&#x02019; (Ref 223044) and a Wellcome Trust (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/">http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/</ext-link>) Project Grant (Ref 094752) to DB.

In the human host, following an initial phase of development in the liver, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invades erythrocytes, where it matures from a ring to a trophozoite stage and nuclear division gives rise to the schizont stage, which releases merozoites ready to invade new red blood cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048206-Bannister1">[3]</xref>. In mammalian cells, cGMP-signalling is involved in a broad range of cellular processes, such as calcium homeostasis, platelet activation, phototransduction and smooth muscle contraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048206-Francis1">[4]</xref>.

To investigate whether PfPKG is cytosolic or bound to membranes, sequential extraction of parasite proteins in hypotonic, carbonate and SDS/TX-114 buffers was performed. While hypotonic lysis solubilises cytosolic proteins, carbonate treatment releases proteins that are indirectly attached to membranes by e.g. binding to integral membrane proteins, whereas integral membrane proteins are carbonate-insoluble and remain in the membrane fraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048206-Fujiki1">[29]</xref>. Most of the HA-tagged PfPKG was solubilised during hypotonic lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048206-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), arguing for a mainly cytosolic location of the protein. The subsequent carbonate treatment, which solubilises peripheral membrane proteins, released virtually all of the remaining PfPKG protein. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (PfGAPDH) used as a cytosolic marker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048206-Daubenberger1">[30]</xref>, was entirely solubilised by the hypotonic lysis.

An integral membrane protein, the protease plasmepsin V (PfPMV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048206-Klemba1">[31]</xref>, which is located in the ER-membrane, was resistant to carbonate extraction, as demonstrated previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048206-Klemba1">[31]</xref> and was solubilised upon SDS/TX-114-extraction of the membranes after carbonate treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>PfPKG Location Overlaps with that of Cytoplasmic and ER Protein Markers</title><p>The subcellular location of PfPKG was investigated by IFA using the parasite clone PfPKG-HA-3A.

To evaluate the subcellular location of PfPKG in blood-stage parasites, dual labelling of HA-tagged PfPKG in the PfPKG-HA-3A clone, together with protein markers of known subcellular compartments was performed.

These changes were not observed in compound 2-insensitive parasites with the gatekeeper mutation (PfPKG<sub>T618Q</sub>), a result that firstly confirms the selectivity of compound 2 for PfPKG, but also points to a complex pattern of PfPKG-dependent phosphorylation events. Importantly, in addition to decreases in phosphorylation events following PfPKG inhibition with compound 2, there were also increases in phosphorylation. This complex pattern of phosphorylation changes following inhibition of PfPKG indicates that this kinase is likely to be in a key position in protein phosphorylation cascades.

Also, schizont morphology and phosphorylation events in response to treatment with specific PKG inhibitors were examined. In transgenic <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites, HA- and PTP-tagged PfPKG expression was detectable throughout the erythrocytic stages of the life cycle, but was found to be maximal at the segmented schizont stage in both Western blot and IFA. These data are in agreement with maximal <italic>PKG</italic> mRNA expression measured in mature blood stage schizonts of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites according to available transcriptome data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048206-Llinas1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048206-Otto1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048206-Westenberger1">[40]</xref> and are consistent with the role of PfPKG in schizont rupture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048206-Taylor1">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Subcellular fractionation and IFA analysis suggested that PfPKG has a primarily cytosolic location. In segmented schizonts, PfPKG staining was maximal in the area surrounding the nuclei and in dual staining experiments, there was marked overlap of PfPKG-HA with the ER-marker proteins PfBiP and PfPMV. This was reflected in a higher Pearson coeffient for these co-staining experiments, than with, for example, PfRab11A, a marker of vesicle trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048206-AgopNersesian1">[33]</xref>.</p><p>The absence of the N-terminal acylation motifs in PfPKG, which are present in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and <italic>Eimeria</italic> PKG orthologues, strongly suggests that PfPKG is unlikely to be directly anchored to parasite membranes. In the present study, solubilisation experiments support this notion since carbonate extraction solubilised HA-tagged PfPKG. While the integral membrane protein PfPMV was found in the SDS/TX-114-fraction of membranes following carbonate treatment, only traces of PfPKG were found in this fraction, suggesting that the kinase does not behave as an integral membrane protein. However, the presence of PfPKG-HA in the peripheral membrane fraction after hypotonic lysis suggests that the kinase may be partially associated with the membrane in late schizonts through protein-protein interaction with a membrane-bound protein or complex. Together with the IFA findings, this suggests a potential location of PfPKG in the proximity of the early secretory pathway in late stage <italic>P. falciparum</italic> schizonts and possibly an interaction with ER membranes through an ER-localised protein complex.</p><p>The potential role of PfPKG in regulating assembly of specific cellular compartments in schizonts was analysed microscopically following treatment of parasites with compound 1. Although compound 1 inhibits <italic>P. falciparum</italic> merozoite egress, the integrity of IMC, exonemes and micronemes appeared to be unaffected, suggesting that the block likely occurs after differentiation of these cellular compartments. This is interesting, since it was recently found that PfPKG function is required for successful processing of PfMSP1 by PfSUB1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048206-Dvorin1">[13]</xref>. In conjunction with the present results, it is tempting to speculate that PfPKG regulates the activation or release of PfSUB1, rather than its cellular trafficking to the exonemes. The previously reported effect of greater separation of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> merozoites in schizonts after compound treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048206-Taylor1">[8]</xref> was not observed in the present study, where treatment time was 6 hours rather than 24 hours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048206-Taylor1">[8]</xref>. This longer treatment exposed schizonts that are mature, but unable to egress, to the drug in culture for several hours, most likely accounting for the stronger morphological differences between treated and untreated schizonts.</p><p>Analysis of the global phospho-proteome using fractionation of metabolically labelled parasites treated with compound 2 indicated that inhibition of PfPKG resulted in changes in the phosphorylation status of over 20 parasite proteins. The changes observed in the phosphoproteome following PfPKG inhibition were seen to be complex, with both increases as well as decreases in phosphorylation. Notably very few changes were seen in parasites expressing the inhibitor insensitve PfPKG<sub>T618Q</sub> mutant, indicating that compound 2 had few off-target effects. The expression and sub-cellular localisation data reported here are consistent with a role for PfPKG in egress and the extensive impact of inhibition of PfPKG on the phospho-proteome indicates that this kinase likely has a complex interaction network to effect its role in schizont rupture and merozoite egress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0048206.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>Endogenous tagging of the </bold><bold><italic>PfPKG</italic></bold><bold> locus by allelic replacement.
