The clinical severity can also vary widely, but MNDs are frequently very severe, causing fatality within months to years of diagnosis. Despite a range of causes and severities, motor neuron diseases are united by the common vulnerability of motor neurons. The reason why these cells are selectively vulnerable to the genetic or environmental insult is unknown. Importantly, however, not all motor neurons are equally affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. There are some pools of motor neuron in which there are high levels of pathology throughout the motor unit, and high levels of motor neuron loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In other pools in the same individual, there will be minimal evidence of motor unit pathology, even at late stages of disease. The reasons for this selective vulnerability are currently unknown, however this phenomenon creates an exciting and valuable opportunity to investigate the factors governing motor neuron vulnerability and pathology. By comparing different motor neuron groups we can investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease, the molecular mechanisms underlying motor neuron pathology and the mechanisms that regulate motor neuron vulnerability.</p><p>Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a childhood motor neuron disease caused by mutations and deletions within the survival motor neuron 1 gene (<italic>SMN1</italic>). There is a second partially functional copy of the <italic>SMN</italic> gene, termed <italic>SMN2</italic>. Due to a point mutation, <italic>SMN2</italic> predominantly produces a form of SMN that lacks exon 7, which is rapidly degraded. This gene therefore produces only low levels of the full length <italic>SMN</italic> transcript. The copy number of <italic>SMN2</italic> can vary, making it an important phenotypic modifier, with disease severity closely correlating to the number of copies of the <italic>SMN2</italic> gene. For this reason, SMA has a range of clinical severities, which are classified into types 0 to 4 based on age of onset and motor milestones achieved. Despite a degree of controversy in the field as to the cell types affected in SMA, it is clear that motor neurons are particularly vulnerable to reduced SMN levels. Indeed, SMA is typified by the loss of lower motor neurons and the atrophy of associated skeletal musculature.</p><p>In SMA patients there is evidence of pathology at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Indeed in models of SMA, structural pathology in the motor neuron is first observed at the NMJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. NMJs are lost early in the disease, with denervation evident in some muscles prior to symptom onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Additional defects at the NMJ include neurofilament accumulation, poor terminal arborisation, delayed post-synaptic maturation, defects in calcium handing and a disruption in synaptic vesicle release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Importantly, not all NMJs are equally affected. This has been well characterised in mouse models of SMA, where there appears to be high levels of NMJ loss in some muscles and very low levels of NMJ loss in others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This selective vulnerability has even been observed within single muscles, where there are areas of high levels of NMJ loss, and other areas showing no apparent denervation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The reasons for this differential vulnerability are unclear. One study has investigated the various aspects of differentially vulnerable motor units, including motor unit size, muscle fibre type, NMJ size, branching patterns and Terminal Schwann cell number but found no correlation with differential vulnerability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. There is some evidence that differential vulnerability might correlate with a differential sprouting competence, presenting the possibility that relative plasticity can be an important modifier. Furthermore, recent work has shown that there are defects in synaptic remodelling at the NMJ in a mouse model of SMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However, this has not been shown to be a definitive modulator of vulnerability. The reasons for the variability in NMJ vulnerability are therefore currently unclear.</p><p>The reasons why motor neurons are selectively vulnerable to a reduction in Smn are currently undefined and the cellular functions for Smn have long been debated. The best described function for Smn is in pre-mRNA splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Growing evidence suggests that a reduction in Smn does not result in widespread splicing defects however it has been suggested that reduced Smn levels may cause splicing defects in a small subset of RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Other roles for Smn have also been proposed, including transport of mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and a potential role as a translational regulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Ultimately, the precise cellular function of Smn that, when compromised in SMA, causes motor neuron pathology is unknown.</p><p>SMA research has been greatly facilitated by a number of mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. These models are traditionally concentrated at the severe end of the spectrum, with a life expectancy of less than 14&#x000a0;days of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Despite their limitations, they have been instrumental in understanding the pathophysiology of SMA and in therapeutic development. The development of the <italic>Smn</italic><sup><italic>2B/-</italic></sup> mouse model of SMA has been an important addition to existing mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This mouse was created by introducing a mutation in a splice enhancer site in the murine <italic>Smn</italic> gene, resulting in production of 10-15&#x000a0;% of normal Smn levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This mouse model displays all the hallmark pathologies associated with SMA but, with a phenotypic onset of around 10&#x000a0;days and a life span of around 28&#x000a0;days, has a slightly milder phenotype than most other models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Importantly, unlike other mouse models, the <italic>Smn</italic><sup><italic>2B/-</italic></sup> mouse has a prolonged pre-symptomatic time period, thus allowing analysis of the events preceding motor neuron loss in SMA.</p><p>In this study, we have used the <italic>Smn</italic><sup><italic>2B/-</italic></sup> mouse model of SMA to investigate the transcriptional changes that occur in differentially vulnerable motor neurons. We have identified and defined muscles with differential levels of NMJ pathology and identified the time points associated with the onset of degeneration. At the pre-degenerative time points, we have used retrograde tracers to identify the motor neuron cell bodies which correspond to these differentially vulnerable NMJs and isolated them by laser capture micro-dissection. Vulnerable and less vulnerable motor neuron populations were isolated from both SMA and wild-type control mice. We then performed RNAseq on these differentially vulnerable motor neuron pools. Comparative bioinformatics analysis and functional clustering was performed to identify the transcriptional changes that correlate with reduced Smn levels, increased vulnerability and increased pathology. We demonstrate that reduced Smn levels are correlative with a decrease in transcripts implicated in ribosome, rRNA binding, ubiquitin and oxidative phosphorylation. We demonstrate a selective up regulation of cell death pathways in selectively vulnerable motor neurons, and demonstrate that an increase in these transcripts is observed prior to NMJ loss. Finally, we demonstrate that there is a decrease in markers of DNA repair in selectively vulnerable motor neurons. Overall this work details a four way comparative analysis of differentially vulnerable motor neurons using high resolution transcriptional profiling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Mouse maintenance</title><p>The <italic>Smn</italic><sup><italic>2B/-</italic></sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] were established in our laboratory and maintained in the University of Ottawa vivarium on a C57BL/6 x CD1 hybrid background.

Fluorescent motor neurons were then identified and imaged on an inverted epifluorescent microscope. During this process, slides were kept frozen using a freezing aerosol. Images were assembled and montaged using Adobe Photoshop and printed onto overhead transparencies. In the interim, slides were nissl stained and dehydrated as follows: 75&#x000a0;% EtOH, 30&#x000a0;s; ddH2O, 30&#x000a0;s; 1&#x000a0;% Toludine blue, 60&#x000a0;s; ddH2O, 30&#x000a0;s; 75&#x000a0;% EtOH, 30&#x000a0;s; 95&#x000a0;% EtOH, 30&#x000a0;s; 100&#x000a0;% EtOH x 3, 60&#x000a0;s; Xylene, 5&#x000a0;min; Air dry, 5&#x000a0;min.

Labelled motor neurons were identified by realigning the printed images of the fluorescent motor neurons with the nissl stained motor neurons on the LCM computer screen. This step was necessary due to the water soluble nature of the RhDextran, which is lost during LCM processing. Laser settings were optimised for motor neuron cell body size.

After that, 36&#x000a0;cycles of single-end sequencing was performed with the Genome Analyzer IIx (Illumina). Reads were mapped to the mouse mm9 assembly using tophat (v1.4.0) using the transcripts from Ensembl release 67 to guide mapping.&#x02009;Quality control was performed using RNAseQC and FastQC. Relative transcript levels were compared using CuffDiff software v1.3 using the UCSC transcript model. Significance was considered with a Q-value of less that 0.05. The statistic package R was used to identify transcriptional changes which were common in more than one data set i.e. identifying transcriptional changes occurring in SMAv and SMAr motor neurons compared to their respective wild-types. Fold changes were converted to log2. Therefore no change, which is equivalent to a one fold change is equal to log<sub>2</sub>1, which equals 0. Therefore all numbers greater than 0 imply an up-regulation. All numbers less that 0 imply a down-regulation. As the biological consequences for a specific magnitude of change are not known, we have not applied any fold change restrictions to the data.</p><p>Functional clustering was performed using the functional annotation clustering tool available on the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) online software from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Using this tool, enrichment analysis was performed using over 40 annotation categories. An algorithm was then applied which clustered the functional annotations based upon the degree of co-associated genes. Only those functional annotations that had a significant non-adjusted P value, were clustered. Those clusters with an enrichment score of &#x0003e;1.3 are considered significant. The enrichment score is a Log10 representation of the non-adjusted P value. Therefore an enrichment score of 1.3 is reflective of a P value of 0.05. This software also provides Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotation to identify specific cellular pathways that contain an enrichment for differentially expressed genes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>qPCR</title><p>For q-RT-PCR on laser captured motor neurons, motor neuron cell bodies were isolated and RNA was extracted and amplified as above and cDNA was diluted to approximately 100&#x000a0;ng/&#x003bc;l.

To do this, we first identified two differentially vulnerable and experimentally accessible pools of motor neurons. We aimed to identify one pool of motor neurons in which we saw a high degree of NMJ loss, and another pool of motor neurons in which there was minimal or no evidence of NMJ loss at end stage of disease. For this study, it was important to us to use muscles that fulfilled the following criteria. Firstly, we aimed to use thin and flat muscles, which are easy to perform immunofluorescence on, thus allowing comprehensive analysis of the whole muscle. This was important so we could accurately quantify the level of morphological pathology present, and to ensure uniformity of pathology throughout the muscle. Secondly, muscles had to be experimentally accessible. This was important so tracer injections could be performed to specifically target the muscle group of interest with minimal trauma or risk of injection side effects, which may occur in the diaphragm or intercostal for example. Lastly, we felt it was preferable to use local groups of muscles, rather than single muscles. Clearly there is significant molecular variability between muscles. By using muscle groups, we minimised the contribution of inter-muscular variability. After investigating NMJ pathology in a range of muscles situated throughout the body, we defined our vulnerable group as those motor neurons innervating a group of abdominal muscles, specifically transversus abdominis (TVA), rectus abdominis (RA) and external oblique (EO). Collectively 20.5&#x000a0;% of NMJs were denervated by P21 in these muscles, and all these muscles display significant NMJ defects (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We observed defects such as neurofilament accumulation and poor terminal arborisation. Endplates appeared immature and there was a high number of vacant denervated endplates. Importantly, pathology was uniform throughout each muscle (data not shown). For our less vulnerable group of motor neuron, we chose to use motor neurons innervating a group of cranial muscles, encompassing levator auris longus (LAL), auricularis superior (AS) and adductor auris longus (AAL). Collectively, 97.9&#x000a0;% of NMJs were fully occupied at P21 in these muscles (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Pre-synaptic terminals appeared more elaborate compared to those in abdominal muscles, and endplates displayed more complexity consistent with a more mature phenotype. Again, pathology was generally consistent throughout each muscle. One exception to this was a slight increase in NMJ pathology in the rostral band of the LAL muscle compared to the caudal band, where we observed 95.6&#x000a0;% of denervated endplates compared to 98.3&#x000a0;% in the LALc. Intriguingly, this is actually the opposite to what is observed in more severe mouse models of SMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].

We therefore aimed to identify a time point just prior to the onset of NMJ loss in vulnerable muscles. We performed a time course analysis of NMJ loss in the TVA, RA, IO and EO muscles. This revealed that the latest time point at which there was no evidence of NMJ loss was P10 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

For abdominal muscle, RhDextran was injected into the space between the TVA and RA/EO muscles. For cranial muscles, RhDextran was injected into the space between the LAL and AS/AAL muscles. For initial experiments, mice were sacrificed 24&#x000a0;h later and muscles were analysed for the presence of RhDextran. Analysis of abdominal muscles revealed strong staining in the superior parts of the EO, RA and TVA (data not shown). Importantly, the dye remained relatively local to the site of injection, and did not leach to surrounding intrinsic back or appendicular muscles. Equivalent analysis was performed in the cranial muscles. Strong staining was observed in the LAL, AS and AAL muscles and again dye was observed to remain local to the site of injection, with minimal leakage to surrounding muscles or to the contralateral side. This analysis confirmed that we were labeling the targeted muscles specifically and robustly.</p><p>For subsequent experiments, mice were sacrificed 48&#x000a0;h following RhDextran injection and spinal cords and brainstems were analysed for the presence of RhDextran staining. This revealed a discrete cluster of motor neurons in the thoracic spinal cord, which correspond to the motor neurons innervating the abdominal muscles, and a cluster of labeled motor neurons in the facial nucleus of the brainstem, corresponding to those motor neurons innervating the cranial muscles (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

Transcriptional analysis was performed using RNAseq and expression profiles were compared between each experimental group (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). For each comparison, around 17,500 genes were identified and compared. From this number, there were around 1200 to 1500 transcriptional changes between each of our four comparative groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Encouragingly, preliminary analysis of the data revealed a number of changes that have been previously implicated in pathology in SMA or in motor neuron vulnerability. For example, we observed a significant 4.8 Log<sub>2</sub> fold up regulation of cyclin dependant kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1a) between SMAv and WTv motor neurons, and a 2.8 Log<sub>2</sub> fold up regulation of CDKN1a between SMAr and WTr motor neurons. Interestingly, a significant up-regulation of CDKN1a has been reported in numerous other models of SMA, including in other mouse models of SMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] and embryonic stem cell derived motor neurons from SMA mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. We revealed a significant 1.3 Log<sub>2</sub> fold down-regulation of chondrolectin (Chodl), which has previously been described in other mouse models of SMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. There was a significant 1.03 fold Log<sub>2</sub> up-regulation of the Fused in Sarcoma transcript (Fus), which has been implicated in motor neuron pathology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and the protein has been shown to interact with Smn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. We also observed a significant 3.5 Log<sub>2</sub> fold down regulation of insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF1) which has previously been reported in serum and liver of a SMA mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Interestingly, we did not observe any change in Fus, IGF1 or Chodl in SMAr motor neurons compared to WTr. As these genes have also been implicated in motor neuron pathology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], this perhaps indicates that these genes are involved in motor neuron pathology, which occurs as a secondary effect to the loss of Smn protein.

We reasoned that Smn levels are reduced in both SMAv and SMAr motor neurons compared to their respective wild-type counterparts. We therefore looked for the transcriptional changes that occurred in both of these populations. In SMAr motor neurons, there were 1557 transcripts, which were statistically up or down regulated compared to WTr motor neurons. In SMAv motor neurons, there were 1277 transcripts, which were statistically up or down regulated compared to WTv motor neurons.

This revealed a number of significantly altered functional clusters (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). As we were looking for transcripts implicated in the function of Smn, we decided to focus on transcripts that are down-regulated in SMAv and SMAr motor neurons. The most significant clusters which were down-regulated comprised of transcripts involved in the ribosome and cytosolic ribosome. This was closely followed by transcripts implicated in rRNA binding. Indeed there was considerable overlap between these three functional clusters, with the majority of rRNA binding proteins also implicated in the ribosome (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In order to confirm this down regulation of transcripts involved in rRNA binding and ribosome, we performed qPCR validation on new biological replicates of cDNA samples prepared from motor neurons isolated as described above, and compared transcript levels between SMAv and WTv samples. This confirmed a down-regulation of RPL7, RPLP1, RPS27a and MRPL20 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>).

Smn has long been established as an RNA binding protein, with work generally focused on its role as an mRNA binding protein, and its role on pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA transport. Less is known about its potential role in rRNA metabolism. It is easy to speculate that reduced Smn levels may disrupt the production or assembly for rRNA and lead to downstream defects in ribosomal function. Furthermore, Smn has recently been identified as a negative regulator of translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Smn has also been shown to localise to the nucleolus and interact with non-ribosomal nucleolar proteins, suggesting that it has a role in ribonucleoprotein complex assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Interestingly, recent work has identified that mutations in genes involved in ribosome subunit assembly and maturation lead to motor neuron specific defects in Spinal Muscular Atrophy with Respiratory Distress (SMARD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This work therefore creates an intriguing parallel between SMA and SMARD and warrants further work into ribosome assembly and function in Smn depleted motor neurons.</p><p>The functional clustering also revealed a down regulation of transcripts involved in ubiquitin metabolism (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). The down regulation of ubiquitin (Ubb) was confirmed by qPCR (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). A disruption in ubiquitin homeostasis has recently been reported in SMA mouse models. Specifically, the authors observed a disruption in proteins implicated in ubiquitination in proteomic analysis on synapses from P1 SMA mice and a marked reduction in ubiquitin activating enzyme 1 (UBA1) levels in spinal cord and muscle from SMA mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. They suggest this down-regulation in UBA1 leads to an increase in beta-catenin levels, and inhibition of beta-catenin signalling rescued motor neuron specific defects in zebrafish and mouse models of SMA. This work therefore confirms the disruption of this pathway and promotes further work to dissect the mechanism by which a reduction in Smn levels lead to a disruption in ubiquitin homeostasis.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Down-regulation of transcripts involved in Ubiquitination. <bold>a</bold> Gene list show transcripts associated with ubiquitin which were statistically significantly altered in SMAv and SMAr motor neurons compared to their respective wildtypes.

Encouragingly, oxidative phosphorylation was also the top hit on a proteomic screen on synapses from a P1 SMA mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Of particular note, we reveal a down regulation of haemoglobin beta 1 (Hbb-b1) which was confirmed by qPCR between SMAv and WTv motor neurons (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>). Interestingly, we also noted a strong increase in Hbb-b1 levels in WTr motor neurons compared to WTv. This suggests that Hbb levels may be higher in less vulnerable motor neurons. This makes haemoglobin an exciting candidate as a regulator of motor neuron vulnerability. Indeed, recent work has demonstrated that haemoglobin subunits are expressed in neurons in both rats and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and colocalised with the mitochondria inner membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. They have been observed to be up-regulated in response to ischemic-reperfusion injury in rats and in an <italic>in vitro</italic> ischemic injury model in primary cortical neuron cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Furthermore, haemoglobin chains have been shown to be down-regulated in a rat model of chronic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], in microglia, astrocytes and brain mitochondria from aged mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The role of haemoglobin in neurons is unclear, although it been suggested to act as an oxygen carrier or to be protective against oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. We may speculate about the relationship between Smn and haemoglobin, however it is perhaps more likely that the down-regulation of Hbb transcripts that we observed is a downstream consequence of the cellular defects caused by a reduction in Smn levels. However, as outlined above, there is strong evidence that haemoglobin can influence pathways implicated in neuronal vulnerability, and this makes it an exciting candidate for further investigation.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Down-regulation of transcripts involved in oxidative phosphorylation. <bold>a</bold> Gene list show transcripts associated with oxidative phosphorylation which were statistically altered in SMAv and SMAr motor neurons compared to their respective wildtypes.

However, we must remember that this up-regulation is occurring in two different mouse models of SMA at a pre-degenerative time point, prior to any NMJ loss. This suggests that cell death pathways are activated at the cell body prior to pathology at the NMJ. A central debate in the SMA research field has been whether SMA is due to a loss of a central housekeeping function for Smn, or whether it is due to a loss of a specific axonal or synaptic role for Smn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The observation that NMJs are lost so early in the disease has often been used as evidence for the latter. The data presented here suggests that cell death pathways are activated before degenerative events can be observed at the axon or NMJ. Clearly, this work does not eliminate a role for Smn in the axon or synapse. It also remains possible that defects in this synaptic or axonal role leads to cell death activation at the cell body, which is followed by the withdrawal of synaptic and axonal compartments. However, it is intriguing to draw parallels to congenic myasthenia syndromes, which are caused by specific synaptic defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In these conditions there is profound synaptic dysfunction and denervation, however this does not lead to activation of cell death pathways and motor neuron cell body loss. Further work is clearly required to determine the time course and specific location of motor unit pathology in SMA and investigate whether synaptic defects in SMA are a cause or consequence of cell death pathway activation at the cell body.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>What transcriptional changes correlate with motor neuron vulnerability: Transcriptional differences selectively occurring in vulnerable motor neurons</title><p>In this study we were particularly keen to identify regulators of motor neuron vulnerability. For this analysis, we reasoned that any changes that occurred only in SMAv motor neurons compared to either WTv motor neurons, or to SMAr motor neurons, could be specifically implicated in NMJ and motor unit pathology. We therefore looked for transcriptional changes that occurred in SMAv motor neurons compared to SMAr and compared to WTv. By comparing SMAv and SMAr motor neurons, we identified 1299 transcripts that were up or down-regulated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). As highlighted above, when comparing SMAv and WTv motor neurons, we identified 1277 transcripts that were up or down-regulated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Of the changes that were identified in these two comparisons, 292 were common, and notably 94&#x000a0;% occurred with the same directional regulation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). Indeed we found 140 and 134 transcriptional changes which were up or down regulated respectively in SMAv motor neurons compared to both WTv and SMAr (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Of particular note, both IGF1 and IGF2 were significantly down-regulated in SMAv motor neurons. IGF1 has previously been reported to be down-regulated in SMA models, and increasing IGF1 levels have been shown to be phenotypically beneficial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. IGF2 levels have been associated with differential neuronal vulnerability in an ALS model, down-regulated in an experimental model of stress, and suggested to have neuroprotective qualities against excitotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. RNAseq results also implied that PMAIP and CDKN1a were selectively up-regulated in SMAv motor neurons. For PMAIP, this result was confirmed by qPCR (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>).</p><p>Functional clustering of these changes highlighted a number of cellular pathways, which are detailed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. Due to their enrichment selectively in vulnerable motor neurons, these clusters are all potentially of interest and worthy of further investigation. We were particularly interested to note the decrease in factors involved in the positive regulation of DNA repair. The transcripts within this functional cluster are listed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. This presents the possibility that the response to DNA damage is decreased in selectively vulnerable motor neurons. In order to investigate this further, we looked at phospho-histone H2AX (pH2AX) levels in differentially vulnerable motor neurons (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). pH2AX is one of the first proteins to be recruited to sites of DNA damage, and recruits other proteins involved in DNA repair to form a DNA repair complex. Immunohistochemical staining of differentially vulnerable motor neurons with antibodies against pH2AX revealed a marked increase in foci number in WTr motor neurons compared to WTv. This suggests that there is a basal increase in the level of DNA repair occurring in less vulnerable motor neurons. The number of pH2AX foci was reduced in both SMAv and SMAr motor neurons compared to WTr, suggesting a further decrease in the levels of DNA repair in <italic>Smn</italic><sup><italic>2B/-</italic></sup> motor neurons. Interestingly, there remained a trend for increased DNA repair in SMAr motor neurons compared to SMAv. This data indicated that the number of DNA repair complexes correlates with relative vulnerability.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Statistically altered functional clusters of transcripts that are differentially expressed in SMAv compared to WTv and SMAr</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Down in SMAv</th><th colspan="2">Up in SMAv</th></tr><tr><th>Cluster</th><th>Enrichment</th><th>Cluster</th><th>Enrichment</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Metal Ion Binding</td><td>3.07</td><td>Mitochondrial inner membrane</td><td>1.38</td></tr><tr><td>Positive regulation of transcription</td><td>2.52</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Membrane</td><td>1.73</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Chromatin/methylation</td><td>1.47</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Positive regulation of DNA repair</td><td>1.38</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Nucleotide Binding</td><td>1.35</td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>

It is unclear whether this is because there is a greater requirement for DNA repair in less vulnerable motor neurons, or whether the requirement is similar in both cell populations, but DNA repair is just more efficient in less vulnerable cells. The DNA damage repair system is a crucial system to maintain genomic integrity, which is especially relevant for terminally differentiated and long-lived cells such as neurons. It is easy to speculate how an increase in the activity in the basic cellular repair mechanisms could be neuroprotective. Indeed, DNA damage can be a key mechanism by which apoptosis is induced. The increase in DNA repair in less vulnerable motor neurons may reduce the likelihood of apoptotic activation. A number of hypotheses state that stressed cells cope better with additional stress. It is possible that this basal higher level of cellular stress primes selective motor neuron populations to cope better with the additional stresses when Smn levels are reduced. Clearly this idea requires further validation in this context, however this has important implications both for development of neuroprotective strategies, and for understanding the mechanisms by which sub-populations of neurons are rendered more vulnerable to a variety of insults.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the data presented above represent detailed transcriptional analysis on differentially vulnerable motor neurons from an SMA mouse model at a pre-symptomatic time point. They highlight a number of pathways which are disrupted upon Smn depletion, including a reduction of transcripts involved with the ribosome, rRNA binding, ubiquitination and oxidative phosphorylation. Subsequent work is required to ascertain the mechanisms by which reduced Smn levels impact upon these pathways. We have also revealed an early and selective up-regulation of cell death pathways, and it will now be key to understand how cell death pathway activation relates to the time course of pathology within the motor unit. Finally, we show that, among a number of pathways of potential interest, an increase in DNA damage repair complexes correlate with a reduced vulnerability. Future efforts dissecting the mechanism of this protection are now warranted.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="40478_2015_231_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>Table shows a summary of the sequencing data obtained from the RNAseq analysis, as analysed using Tophat software.
