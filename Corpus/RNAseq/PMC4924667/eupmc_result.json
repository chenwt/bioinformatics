    "Tripartite motif-containing 29 (TRIM29) has been reported to be dysregulated in human cancers. Up-regulation of TRIM29 was first observed in NPC cell lines by a genome-wide transcriptome analysis in our previous study. However, its expression biological function and clinical significance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remain unclear. In this study, TRIM29 expression was validated by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry in 69 NPC samples. Notably, TRIM29 protein expression was significantly and positively correlated with the tumor size, clinical stage and metastasis. TRIM29 was identified as the direct target of miR-335-5p and miR-15b-5p, both of which were down-regulated and negatively associated with TRIM29 expression in NPC cell lines and clinical samples. Ectopic TRIM29 expression promoted proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration and invasion in NPC cells, while its depletion inhibited cell invasion and EMT phenotype. Mechanistically, TRIM29 overexpression reduced PTEN expression and increase phosphorylated protein level of AKT, p70S6K and 4E-BP1. Correspondingly, AKT inhibitor and Rapamycin blocked the effect of TRIM29 on cell invasion. In conclusion, our results suggest that miR-335-5p and miR-15b-5p down-regulation results in TRIM29 over-expression, which induces proliferation, EMT and metastasis of NPC through the PTEN/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway."
