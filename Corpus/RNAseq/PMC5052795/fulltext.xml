Here we apply micro-scale chromatin profiling to survey the distal enhancer landscape of primary gastric adenocarcinoma (GC), a leading cause of global cancer mortality. Integrating 110 epigenomic profiles from primary GCs, normal gastric tissues and cell lines, we highlight 36,973 predicted enhancers and 3,759 predicted super-enhancers respectively. Cell-line-defined super-enhancers can be subclassified by their somatic alteration status into somatic gain, loss and unaltered categories, each displaying distinct epigenetic, transcriptional and pathway enrichments. Somatic gain super-enhancers are associated with complex chromatin interaction profiles, expression patterns correlated with patient outcome and dense co-occupancy of the transcription factors CDX2 and HNF4&#x003b1;. Somatic super-enhancers are also enriched in genetic risk SNPs associated with cancer predisposition. Our results reveal a genome-wide reprogramming of the GC enhancer and super-enhancer landscape during tumorigenesis, contributing to dysregulated local and regional cancer gene expression.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

Cancer transcriptomes can be reprogrammed by genomic alterations (somatic mutations, copy number alterations and structural variations) affecting signalling molecules and transcription factors (TFs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Besides protein-coding genes, <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements in noncoding genomic regions can also influence transcriptional programs by facilitating or restricting TF accessibility<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Distinct regulatory element classes are defined by different epigenomic marks, involving DNA methylation, histone methylation/acetylation and other combinations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. For example, promoters are marked by histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3), enhancers by H3K4me1, active regulatory elements by H3K27ac and repressive features by H3K27me3<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.

It has also been proposed that because epigenetic modifications are more stable than RNA transcripts, histone modification profiling may offer a better measure of transcriptional status than RNA sequencing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p><p>Enhancers are regulatory elements localized distal to promoters and transcription start sites (TSSs). Occupying 10&#x02013;15&#x00025; of the human genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, enhancers play important roles in cell identity and tissue-specific expression by regulating one or more genes at large distances (&#x0003e;1&#x02009;Mb)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Recent studies have demonstrated that enhancers can be subdivided into different classes, with one such class comprising enhancer clusters occurring in close proximity, referred to as &#x02018;super-enhancers'<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Compared to typical enhancers, super-enhancers are larger in size, exhibit higher TF binding densities and are strongly associated with key cell identity regulators, similar to locus control regions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, DNA methylation valleys<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, transcription initiation platforms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> and stretch enhancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Super-enhancers are also enriched in disease-associated genetic variants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, are acquired by cancer cells at key oncogenes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, and importantly are more sensitive to therapeutic perturbation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p><p>The emerging importance of super-enhancers in human disease, coupled with their exquisite tissue-specificity, raises a need for comprehensive super-enhancer catalogues of different cell types and disease conditions. In cancer, such super-enhancer catalogues are indeed emerging, for both haematological and solid malignancies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. However, most of these studies to date have relied on <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured cancer cell lines, which have two limitations. First, <italic>in vitro</italic> cell lines are known to experience substantial epigenomic alterations after repeated passaging<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Second, for many cancer cell lines, matched normal counterparts are frequently not available, complicating the ability to identify true tumor-specific somatic alterations.</p><p>Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the third leading cause of global cancer mortality<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Most GCs are adenocarcinomas, and molecular studies have revealed key genetic alterations associated with gastric malignancy, including mutations in chromatin modifier genes such as <italic>ARID1A</italic>, and amplifications in <italic>HER2</italic>, <italic>FGFR2</italic> and <italic>MET</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. In contrast to genetic alterations, our knowledge of the GC epigenome remains poorly understood, with current knowledge largely confined to patterns of aberrant DNA methylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p><p>To address the role of histone modifications in GC, we recently reported a proof-of-concept study employing micro-scale chromatin profiling (Nano-ChIPseq) to survey histone modifications in primary GCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. In this study, we extended this effort to characterize the GC super-enhancer landscape. By integrating predicted super-enhancer data from both cell lines and primary tumours, we provide evidence that like enhancers, predicted super-enhancers are heterogeneous and can be further subclassified into biologically distinct subgroups with impact on tumour-specific gene expression, cancer hallmarks and disease genetic variation. We also found that in GCs, predicted super-enhancers exhibiting somatic gain are associated with CDX2 and HNF4&#x003b1; occupancy. Taken collectively, our results reveal a pervasive reprogramming of the gastric super-enhancer landscape during tumourigenesis, underpinning wide-spread alterations in cancer gene expression.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Distal predicted enhancer landscapes of GC cell lines</title><p>Using Nano-ChIPseq, we generated 110 chromatin profiles from 19 primary GCs, 19 matched normal gastric tissues and 11 GC cell lines covering multiple histone H3 modifications (H3K27ac, H3K4me3, H3K4me1) (average &#x0223c;3.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> reads per profile). Clinical information and molecular classification of the primary GCs is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, sequencing statistics in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref> and clinico-pathological details for the GC lines in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>. Our series included 10 gland forming adenocarcinomas (53&#x00025;, intestinal type), 6 samples with highly infiltrating isolated cells (32&#x00025;, diffuse type) and 3 GC samples (15&#x00025;) of mixed histology. More than 60&#x00025; of the tumours (<italic>n</italic>=12) were Stage 3 or above (AJCC 7th edition). We performed extensive quality control analysis of the Nano-ChIPseq data, including variations in mapping quality filters, analysis of biological replicates and promoter ChIP-enrichment, and assessment by the quality control software CHANCE (CHip-seq ANalytics and Confidence Estimation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Increasing mapping threshold stringencies (from MAPQ &#x02265;10 to 20) did not appreciably alter mapping statistics: &#x0003e;90&#x00025; of the total mapped reads were retained, and 85&#x00025; of ChIP-enriched peaks and 98&#x00025; of predicted enhancers were rediscovered respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Histone peak concordance between biological replicates of KATO-III cells generated by Nano-ChIPseq, and also against independent KATO-III H3K27ac data generated by conventional ChIP-seq<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, confirmed high reproducibility (overlaps of &#x0223c;85 and &#x0223c;90&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Comparisons of input and input-corrected H3K27ac and H3K4me3 signals at 1000 promoters associated with highly expressed protein-coding genes revealed successful enrichment in 48 out of 50 (96&#x00025;) H3K27ac and 42 out of 42 (100&#x00025;) H3K4me3 libraries respectively. CHANCE analysis of ChIP enrichment, particularly for H3K4me1 (which is depleted at promoters), revealed that the large majority (85&#x00025;) of samples exhibited successful enrichment (Methods). These results demonstrate the good technical quality of the Nano-ChIPseq cohort. Besides Nano-ChIPseq, the samples were also processed for DNA methylation analysis (Infinium HumanMethylation 450&#x02009;K BeadChip arrays), copy number analysis (Affymetrix SNP arrays) and Illumina RNA-sequencing.</p><p>We chose to use GC cell lines as a discovery cohort to discover cancer-associated distal enhancers in GC, as cell lines are purely epithelial in nature, have the highest data quality, and because previous studies have shown that stromal contamination in primary tissues can influence genomic results<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. We also focused on recurrent epigenetic alterations present in multiple GC samples, which reduces the introduction of &#x02018;private' epigenetic alterations associated with individualized cell line features. First, we mapped genome-wide <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements based on H3K27ac signals, previously shown to mark active promoters and enhancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. To enrich for enhancer elements, we focused on H3K27ac signals located distant from known annotated TSSs (TSSs; &#x0003e;2.5&#x02009;kb) in accordance with previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We then further refined the enhancer predictions using aggregated H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 data, excluding from analysis predicted enhancers exhibiting high H3K4me3/H3K4me1 log ratios (&#x0003e;2.4)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Using this approach, we identified 3,017 to 14,338 putative distal enhancers in the GC lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), with an average genomic footprint of 25&#x02009;Mb/line.</p><p>In total, we detected 36,973 predicted distal enhancer regions, spanning &#x0223c;140&#x02009;Mb or approximately 5&#x00025; of the human genome. The predicted enhancers exhibited a bimodal H3K27ac signal distribution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), were depleted of H3K4me3 and were enriched in H3K4me1 signals, similar to enhancer modification profiles reported in previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Visual comparison of selected H3K27ac-enriched regions revealed that some regions are active in multiple lines (&#x02018;recurrent') while other regions are active in only one line (&#x02018;private'). These observations are similar to previous results in both lymphoblastoid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and colon carcinoma cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Approximately 47&#x00025; of the predicted enhancers were recurrent, exhibiting activity in at least two GC cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). The percentage of recurrent enhancers was significantly lower compared to promoters (67 versus 47&#x00025;, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;2.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>, one-sided proportion test), indicating that enhancer activity is highly variable across GC cell lines.</p><p>We validated the predicted enhancers by integrating publicly available epigenomic datasets. Using DNase I hypersensitivity (DHS) data of normal gastric tissues from the Epigenome Roadmap, we found that DHS signal distributions (log-transformed RPKM) at predicted enhancers were significantly greater than randomly selected regions (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;2.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>, one-sided Welch's <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>, Methods), indicating that predicted enhancers are associated with open chromatin. When compared against DHS and H3K27ac data of nine different tissue and cellular categories<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, predicted enhancers exhibited the highest overlap with DHS-positive and H3K27ac-positive regions from digestive and epithelial tissues (fetal intestine, gastric and small intestine), and were distinct from non-epithelial tissue types such as blood and T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Supporting their regulatory potential, 54&#x00025; of the predicted enhancers (<italic>n</italic>=20,127) were associated with EP300 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, empirical test), and 92&#x00025; with TF binding sites.

Prior to analysis, we confirmed that the primary gastric normal samples were indeed reflective of gastric epithelia, by correlating against published profiles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Discussion</xref>).

Close to half of the predicted super-enhancers (<italic>n</italic>=1748; 47&#x00025;) exhibited somatic gain in two or more primary GCs (&#x0003e; 2-fold enrichment in tumour, minimum 0.5 RPKM difference), and principal component analysis (PCA) using these gained predicted super-enhancers confirmed separations between GC and matched normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Supporting the consistency of these results, the vast majority of these recurrent somatic gain predicted super-enhancers (85&#x00025;, &#x0003e;1.5-fold change threshold) were rediscovered when using only those normal/tumour (N/T) primary pairs passing all quality control criteria (14 pairs, see earlier). Unexpectedly, despite their activity in cancer cell lines, a substantial proportion of predicted super-enhancers (18&#x00025;) were associated with somatic loss rather than gain in primary GCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>).

For both single-TF and double-TF silencing, H3K27ac depletion occurred more prominently at somatic gain predicted super-enhancers compared to predicted typical enhancers, suggesting a heightened sensitivity of super-enhancer activity to TF depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 16d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4</xref>; <italic>P</italic>=5.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>; <italic>P</italic>=1.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;17</sup>; <italic>P</italic>=1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup> for <italic>CDX2</italic>, <italic>HNF4</italic>&#x003b1; and <italic>CDX2/HNF4</italic>&#x003b1; respectively, one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test). Supporting the specificity of these effects, H3K27ac depletion at predicted super-enhancers was more pronounced at regions centred at CDX2 or HNF4&#x003b1; binding sites, particularly at sites co-occupied by both factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6h</xref>). Similar results were also obtained in SNU16 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 16e</xref>). Next, to assess relationships between predicted super-enhancers and gene expression, we focused on predicted super-enhancers exhibiting H3K27ac depletion after TF silencing. We observed that &#x0003e;60&#x00025; of predicted super-enhancer target genes also exhibited reduced expression after TF silencing (si<italic>CDX2</italic>, <italic>P</italic>=4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>, empirical test; si<italic>HNF4</italic>&#x003b1;, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>, empirical test; si(<italic>CDX2/HNF4</italic>&#x003b1;), <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>, empirical test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 16f</xref>). This proportion significantly exceeded that expected by chance, as assessed by permutation analysis (Methods).

Epigenomic deregulation has emerged as an important pathway in gastric tumorigenesis, with chromatin modifier genes (eg, <italic>ARID1A</italic>) being frequently mutated in GC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref> and epigenetic alterations associated with gastric pre-malignancy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. To date however, the vast majority of GC epigenomic studies have focused on promoter DNA methylation in the context of tumour suppressor gene silencing (for example, <italic>CDH1</italic>, <italic>RUNX3</italic>). In contrast, very little is currently known about distal regulatory elements (that is, enhancers) in GC.</p><p>Here, we analysed &#x0003e;35k predicted enhancer elements identified through micro-scale histone modification profiling of primary gastric tumours, matched non-malignant tissues and GC cell lines. Small-scale ChIP protocols are known to be technically challenging and may sometimes result in significant between-sample variability. Reassuringly, we have previously demonstrated that Nano-ChIP signals between tumours and normal samples exhibit a good concordance with orthogonal ChIP-qPCR results<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> and in the present study we also performed extensive quality control analyses, including variations in mapping stringency, biological replicate analysis, promoter ChIP enrichment and CHANCE analysis, to confirm that the vast majority (85&#x02013;100&#x00025;) of our Nano-ChIPseq libraries are of acceptable quality. Our focus on recurrent epigenomic alterations present in multiple samples further ensured that our biological conclusions are likely to be robust, as shown by the observation that 84&#x00025; of the recurrent somatic gain predicted super-enhancers were still rediscovered when analysis was confined to only those &#x02018;high-quality' tumour/normal pairs passing both promoter-based and CHANCE quality analysis. Nevertheless, we also note there is still scope for improving the data quality of such experiments, such as using spike-in approaches to better ascertain inter-experimental variations or to exclude extreme experiments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>.</p><p>Our study was motivated by recent studies in other cancer types demonstrating a fundamental role for distal enhancers and super-enhancers in cell identity and disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Indeed, in our study and others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, recurrent predicted super-enhancers largely manifested at known oncogenes and genes participating in oncogenic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). We also observed high levels of enhancer variation between individual samples, exceeding proximal promoter elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). When compared against other tissues and tumour-types, almost 60&#x00025; of GC predicted super-enhancers were tissue-specific (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 15</xref>). It is worth noting that in the current study we studied GCs as a general category against matched non-malignant gastric tissues for maximal sensitivity; however, recent studies have highlighted distinct histopathological and molecular GC subtypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Indeed, a preliminary analysis comparing recurrent somatic gain predicted super-enhancers between 10 intestinal and 6 diffuse GCs identified 471 and 224 predicted super-enhancers specific to intestinal- and diffuse-type GCs respectively, and 516 common predicted super-enhancers. These results also suggest that there may exist distinct enhancer alterations in different histological subtypes of GC. Such findings reflect the exquisite tissue-specific nature of enhancer elements, and the consequent need for generating comprehensive enhancer catalogues in expanded patient cohorts and in many different tumour types.</p><p>The majority of samples analysed in our study were primary tissues derived directly from patients, rather than <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured cell lines. By comparing predicted enhancer activities (H3K27ac) between tumours and matched normals, we were able to further sub-classify cell line predicted super-enhancers according to their somatic alteration status (somatic gain, somatic loss and unaltered). Supporting their biological distinctiveness, the subcategorized predicted super-enhancers also displayed specific differences in other orthogonal features, including epigenomic patterns (H3K4me1, DNA methylation), gene transcription and cancer hallmarks. Notably, in our data only a small fraction of somatic gain predicted super-enhancers localized to regions of copy number amplification. Our results thus complement recent studies implicating focal amplification as a mechanism for super-enhancer activity in cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. The ability to subclassify predicted super-enhancers according to <italic>bona-fide</italic> somatic gain or loss is likely to improve downstream attempts to pinpoint oncogenic mechanisms responsible for establishing super-enhancers in cancer. Such approaches are also possibly extendable to other disease states<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>.</p><p><italic>A priori</italic> consideration of predicted super-enhancer heterogeneity may also prove useful when analysing germline variants associated with disease risk. While previous findings have reported that disease-associated SNPs are generally over-represented in regulatory elements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, we found that somatic altered, but not unaltered predicted super-enhancers, were specifically enriched in SNPs associated with cancer and inflammatory gastrointestinal disease (a known risk factor for gastrointestinal cancer). SNPs in these regions may alter disease risk and cancer development through several non-exclusive mechanisms, including modification of TF binding motifs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>, regulation of long-range chromatin interactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> or alteration of H3K27ac levels. Indeed, in our study, we observed that two SNPs associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk (rs10505477 and rs10411210)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref> were also associated with local changes in chromatin modification in primary GCs. There are several reasons why it may be plausible to integrate CRC risk data with GC. First, at least one of these CRC risk SNPs (rs10505477) has been reported to also influence GC clinical outcome in both treatment response and patient survival<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>. Second, the key TFs associated with the GC predicted super-enhancers (<italic>CDX2</italic>, <italic>HNF4</italic>&#x003b1;) are also known to regulate colonic development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>. Third, the role of intestinal metaplasia (IM) as a pre-malignant risk factor for GC is well-established, and in IM the gastric epithelial cells adopt a cellular architecture and appearance similar to colonic epithelium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. The observation that these genetic variants, while present in germline DNA, may influence chromatin structure and gene expression in the tumour has also been observed in CRC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>. These results further highlight the importance of studying aberrant epigenetic states to refine our understanding of germline processes underlying disease predisposition.</p><p>Our results suggest certain general principles regarding how individual super-enhancers in GC might interact with the <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans-</italic>acting transcriptional machinery. Using two distinct long-range chromatin interaction assays (Capture-C and 4C), we observed several examples of somatic gain predicted super-enhancers engaging both proximal and distal genes exhibiting elevated tumour expression. It has been proposed that genes linked to somatic gain predicted super-enhancers are likely to occupy similar topological associating domains, established through cohesin-mediated enhancer-promoter loops<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>. The ability of somatic gain predicted super-enhancers to influence both proximal and distal gene expression implicates predicted super-enhancers as pivotal regulators of aberrant gene expression in gastric tumours, which can contribute to disease progression and chemoresponse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). At the <italic>trans</italic>- level, our data revealed that somatic gain predicted super-enhancers in GC are associated with CDX2 and HNF4&#x003b1; occupancy. Previous studies have shown that aberrant CDX2 expression in the stomach is associated with intestinal metaplasia of the mucosal epithelial cells, an important early event in gastric tumour formation and that CDX2 has the potential to function as a GC oncogene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>. HNF4&#x003b1; has also been recently implicated in GC, as a target of both the lineage-specific oncogenes KLF5 and GATA factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>, and the AMPK signalling pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Our results in primary human tumours are supported by recent findings in the mouse small intestine, where CDX2 has been found to regulate HNF4&#x003b1; occupancy to control intestinal gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>. Echoing these studies, we also found that CDX2/HNF4&#x003b1; depletion effected chromatin alterations at local regions concentrated at CDX2 and/or HNF4&#x003b1; binding sites. A potential limitation in our study is that the modest albeit significant differences in H3K27ac observed after TF silencing may be due to use of transient knockdown compared to stable gene silencing. While it is thus possible that CDX2 and HNF4&#x003b1; may influence GC super-enhancer activity in a more wide-spread manner, these results nevertheless support a specific role for CDX2 and HNF4&#x003b1; in GC predicted super-enhancer maintenance.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates a role for heterogeneity in predicted super-enhancers and the utility of intersecting chromatin profiles from primary tissues and cell lines to dissect regulatory biology. This first-generation roadmap of GC distal enhancers now renders possible future integrative studies involving transcriptional features associated with GC predicted enhancers (eRNAs), and identifying somatic regulatory mutations perturbing predicted super-enhancer activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>. We also note that in this study, we have focused on heterogeneity between patients; however, intra-tumour heterogeneity is also emerging as an important mechanism of GC treatment resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>. Future studies should be focused on investigating the role of epigenetic deregulation in GC intra-tumour heterogeneity. Taken collectively, these studies will likely deepen our knowledge of GC enhancer biology and regulatory circuits underlying this deadly malignancy.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Primary tissue samples and cell lines</title><p>Primary patient samples were obtained from the SingHealth tissue repository with approvals from the SingHealth Centralised Institutional Review Board and signed patient informed consent. &#x02018;Normal' (that is, non-malignant) samples used in this study refers to samples harvested from the stomach, from sites distant from the tumour and exhibiting no visible evidence of tumour or intestinal metaplasia/dysplasia upon surgical assessment.

All cell lines were negative for mycoplasma contamination. For this study, we selected OCUM-1 and SNU16 cells as our main cell line models for two reasons. First, OCUM-1 and SNU16 cells were originally isolated from patients with poorly differentiated GC, and the majority of primary GCs in our study are poorly differentiated (63&#x00025;).

Peaks with significant ChIP enrichment (FDR&#x0003c;5&#x00025;) relative to input libraries were detected using CCAT (version 3). Peak densities within a region were computed by counting the total number of mapped reads normalized by the library and region size, a metric equivalent to reads per million mapped reads per kilobases (RPKM). This normalization method adjusts for biases due to the higher probability of reads falling into longer regions and has been applied in previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">74</xref>. We thus elected to apply RPKM-based normalization to make our study comparable to these other studies. To account for background signals, read densities of each ChIP library were corrected against the corresponding input library. Read densities across samples were corrected for potential batch effects (for example, date of ChIP assay) using COMBAT and to ensure equal sample variation.

Specifically, we computed median read densities of input and input-corrected ChIP signals at 1,000 promoters associated with highly expressed protein-coding genes. For each sample, we then compared read density ratios of H3K27ac over input as a surrogate of data quality, retaining only those samples where the H3K27ac/input ratio was greater than four-fold. Using these criteria, 48 out of 50 H3K27ac samples (GC lines and primary samples) exhibited greater than four-fold enrichment, indicating successful enrichment.

Besides GOrilla, we also studied functional enrichments associated with recurrent predicted super-enhancers and top predicted typical enhancers using GREAT using default parameters, as GREAT provides correction against genes flanked by larger intergenic regions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.

For PCA, we used signals from predicted super-enhancers showing somatic gain in two or more patients. PCA analysis was performed using R and plotted using the &#x02018;pca3d' package.

This result yielded a recommended sample size of 13 (average), which is met in our study (19N/T). Three classes of predicted super-enhancers were defined based on the primary samples: (i) somatic gain, (ii) somatic loss and (iii) unaltered. Genes associated with (i), (ii) and (iii) were mapped to gene groups previously reported in Hnisz, 2013 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), where each group is a compilation of several gene ontology categories and used as a proxy for various cancerous hallmarks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.

In brief, cultured cells were diluted into single-cell suspensions, and chromatin was cross-linked with 1&#x00025; formaldehyde for 10&#x02009;min at room temperature. Cells were lysed and cross-linked DNA was digested with the primary restriction enzyme HindIII-HF [R3104L, New England Biolabs (NEB)]. Next, HindIII-digested DNA was subjected to proximity ligation using T4 DNA ligase (EL0013, Thermo Scientific), followed by cross-link removal using Proteinase K (AM2546, Ambion), yielding 3C libraries. The 3C libraries were then subjected to a second restriction enzyme digestion using DpnII (R0543L, NEB), followed by a circularization reaction using T4 DNA ligase. For each viewpoint, 3.2&#x02009;&#x003bc;g of the resulting 4C templates was used to perform a scale-up inverse, nested PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>), of which 32 reactions (100&#x02009;ng in each) were pooled and purified using the MinElute PCR Purification kit (Qiagen). Ten micrograms of the PCR products were then run on 4&#x02013;20&#x00025; TBE PAGE gels (5&#x02009;&#x003bc;g per well). On the gel, smears from 200 to 600&#x02009;bp were excised and unwanted PCR product bands were removed. DNA was then extracted from the cut-out gel pieces for next-generation sequencing on an Illumina Miseq (2 &#x000d7; 250&#x02009;bp).</p><p>Inverse primers were designed based on a viewpoint concept. The UCSC Genome Browser (assembly: Feb. 2009 (GRCh37/hg19)) was used to locate the region of interest. Upon addition of HindIII and DpnII tracks, two HindIII restriction sites flanking the region of interest were identified and the sequence between the nearest HindIII and DpnII restriction sites were selected as the viewpoint region. Based on this region, two pairs of primers (outer and nested) were designed using the Primer-BLAST program (National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)) with the following adaptations to the default settings: optimal primer melting temperature of 58&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, with a minimum of 55&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and maximum of 60&#x02009;&#x000b0;C; GC content between 39 and 60&#x00025;.

Briefly, sequences corresponding to 100&#x02009;bp upstream/20&#x02009;bp downstream of the 5&#x02032; end of the enhancer, and sequences corresponding to 20&#x02009;bp upstream/100&#x02009;bp downstream of the 3&#x02032; end of the enhancer, were used for the search. Top hits with the lowest level of coding region off-target predictions were chosen. sgRNAs were cloned into the pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP or -Puro vectors (Addgene). Briefly, pairs of oligonucleotides were designed and procured from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. for each CRISPR target. Oligonucleotide pairs were then annealed to form DNA duplexes containing overhangs on both sides for ease of cloning. Guide RNAs used to target 5&#x02032; ends of individual enhancers were cloned into Bbs I-digested pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP vectors, while sgRNAs targeting 3&#x02032; ends of each enhancer were cloned into Bbs I-digested pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro vectors. The inserts and vectors were ligated using T4 DNA Ligase (New England Biolabs). DH5&#x003b1; cells were transformed with the ligation product and plated on LB agar supplemented with ampicillin.

For this study, we focused on SNPs occurring in noncoding regions and excluded SNPs within coding regions. We computed overlaps between SNPs from each trait/disease and somatic predicted super-enhancers using BEDtools &#x02018;intersect' (nGWAS), and compared nGWAS against the total number of disease-associated SNPs outside the predicted super-enhancers (nGWAS'). As an additional control, we created an &#x02018;SNP background' model using a set of all SNPs from two commonly used SNP arrays (Illumina HumanHap550 and Affymetrix SNP6). The number of SNPs from the SNP background overlapping the predicted super-enhancers was calculated (nBackground) and compared against the total number of background SNPs outside the predicted super-enhancers (nBackground&#x02032;). The ratio of normal SNPs in predicted super-enhancers was computed as nBackground/nBackground&#x02032;. Expecting that the increased number of disease-associated SNPs in predicted super-enhancers is associated with a high prevalence of SNPs in these regions, our null hypothesis is therefore that there is no difference between the ratio of disease-associated SNPs and the ratio of normal SNPs (enrichment ratio). Chi-square tests were conducted, with enrichment <italic>P</italic>-values of&#x0003c;0.01 considered statistically significant. To understand the relationship between risk-associated SNPs and histone modification, we identified validated SNPs in gastrointestinal diseases (for example, ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer) found to be associated with disease in at least two independent studies.

CDX2 (MU392A-UC, Biogenex) and HNF4&#x003b1; (sc-8987, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies were used for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). ChIPed DNA (10&#x02009;ng) was used for ChIP with DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) library construction following manufacturer protocols (New England Biolabs).

In an initial analysis comparing recurrently gained predicted super-enhancers specific to intestinal and diffuse-type GCs (10 intestinal, 6 diffuse), we did not observe any significant differences in CDX2 binding between the two subtypes. A deeper analysis revealed, however, high within-subtype variability in <italic>CDX2</italic> expression between individual tumours of the same subtype, consistent with previous reports that CDX2 expression is not absolutely associated with intestinal subtype GC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">79</xref>.

CDX2 binding density were then computed at recurrent somatic gain predicted super-enhancers identified in GC samples showing high (<italic>n</italic>=8) and low (<italic>n</italic>=8) <italic>CDX2</italic> expression. In differential binding signal analysis, we computed binding signals for CDX2 and HNF4&#x003b1; for 200 bins spanning those predicted super-enhancers showing somatic gain or no alteration in primary samples and also detected in OCUM-1 or SNU16 cell lines. Signals were measured in RPKM units. To estimate the effect of TF knockdown on H3K27ac strength, we defined an internal control comprising observed variation of H3K27ac signals between independent wild-type (WT) samples. We then measured differences between WT samples against TF-silenced (siCDX2, siHNF4&#x003b1;, or double TF) samples, which were then compared against this background variation. Subregions with differences&#x0003e;99&#x00025; of background variation were termed as H3K27ac depletion; while differences&#x0003c;1&#x00025; of the background variation were termed as H3K27ac gain. Statistical enrichments of H3K27ac-depleted subregions corresponding to predicted super-enhancers were conducted using one-sided Fisher's exact test. To study relationships between the differential regions and their distances to nearby CDX2/HNF4&#x003b1; binding sites, the regions were also segregated into three categories (near, moderate, distal) based on their distance distribution. Mid-point locations between the CDX2 and HNF4&#x003b1; summits were used to analyse distances between H3K27ac-depleted subregions and CDX2-HNF4&#x003b1; cobinding sites. To study associations between gene expression and somatic gain predicted super-enhancers in TF-silenced cells, we selected genes linked to predicted super-enhancers exhibiting significant positive expression correlations with H3K27ac predicted super-enhancer signals in primary samples (<italic>r</italic>&#x0003e;0.4; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, two-sided <italic>t</italic>-test) and also observed in the GC cell lines. To assess the significance of TF knockdown on predicted super-enhancer target gene expression, we used a permutation approach. Specifically, focusing on predicted super-enhancers exhibiting H3K27ac depletion after TF silencing, we permuted the actual super-enhancer to gene assignments 10,000 times. An empirical <italic>P</italic>-value was then derived by counting the number of times the number of downregulated genes in the permuted gene/super-enhancer set exceeded the experimentally observed number of downregulated genes in the actual gene/super-enhancer set.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Data availability</title><p>Histone NanoChIP-seq (GSE76153 and GSE75898), SNP array (GSE85466), RNA-seq (GSE85465) and DNA methylation data (GSE85464) generated during this study have been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus.
