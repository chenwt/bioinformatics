However, the degree of Tfh cell heterogeneity and function is not fully understood. We used a novel IL-21eGFP reporter mouse strain to analyze the diversity and role of Tfh cells. Through the analysis of GFP expression in lymphoid organs of IL-21eGFP mice, we identified a subpopulation of GFP<sup>+</sup>, high IL-21 producing Tfh cells present only in Peyer&#x02019;s Patches. GFP<sup>+</sup>Tfh cells were found to be polyclonal and related to GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Tfh cells of Peyer&#x02019;s Patches in TCR repertoire composition and overall gene expression. Studies on the mechanisms of induction of GFP<sup>+</sup>Tfh cells demonstrated that they required the intestinal microbiota and a diverse repertoire of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and B cells. Importantly, ablation of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells resulted in a reduced frequency of Peyer&#x02019;s Patches IgG1 and germinal center B cells in addition to small but significant shifts in gut microbiome composition. Our work highlights the diversity among IL-21 producing CD4<sup>+</sup> Tfh cells, and the interrelationship between the intestinal bacteria and Tfh cell responses in the gut.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are crucial to the development of T cell-dependent antibody responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.

Flow cytometry analysis of GFP<sup>+</sup>Tfh, GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Tfh cells, and non-Tfh CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from PP of IL-21eGFP mice showed that both Tfh populations expressed the Tfh master transcription factor Bcl6, but the expression was higher in GFP<sup>+</sup>Tfh than in GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Tfh cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). A similar expression pattern was observed for IL-21 and ICOS, although the differences between Tfh populations did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2a,b</xref>).

If GFP<sup>+</sup> and GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Tfh cell populations were unrelated, there would be minimal overlap of the TCR repertoires. An intermediate situation would arise if GFP<sup>+</sup>Tfh cells originated from GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Tfh cells and constituted a fairly stable subpopulation.</p><p>GFP<sup>+</sup>Tfh, GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Tfh, and GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> non-Tfh cells were purified from PP of three individual mice from different litters and the VDJ domains of their TCR&#x003b2; genes were sequenced using RNAseq. All populations displayed broad V &#x003b2; usage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). The number of unique CDR3 peptide sequences, as exemplified by tree plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), was highest in non-Tfh CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, intermediate in GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Tfh cells, and lowest in GFP<sup>+</sup>Tfh cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Analysis of the number of unique TCR&#x003b2; CDR3 sequences using computational &#x003b1; diversity showed the highest diversity in the repertoire of non-Tfh CD4<sup>+</sup> cells and the lowest in the repertoire of GFP<sup>+</sup>Tfh cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Comparing repertoires of unique CDR3 peptide sequences revealed that an average of 43% of the repertoire of unique sequences of GFP<sup>+</sup>Tfh cells was shared with the GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Tfh population of the same mouse, compared to 8% shared with non-Tfh CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Tfh cells in turn shared an average of 17% of their repertoire with GFP<sup>+</sup>Tfh cells, and 9% with non-Tfh CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of the same mouse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5a</xref>).</p><p>We then used &#x003b2; diversity computational analysis of TCR&#x003b2; CDR3 repertoires to generate a matrix of pair-wise comparisons of the overall repertoire composition of each of the three PP CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell populations in each mouse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5b</xref>). This analysis takes into account the number as well as the frequency of unique sequences: the maximum pair-wise comparison value of 1 reflects complete repertoire identity, while a value close to zero indicates unrelated repertoires. Comparing GFP<sup>+</sup>Tfh and GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Tfh populations from the same mouse yielded the highest &#x003b2; diversity values (0.181, 0.158, 0.172). GFP<sup>+</sup>Tfh and GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Tfh cells exhibited low relatedness with non-Tfh CD4<sup>+</sup> cells within the same animal (0.012, 0.016, 0.013 and 0.028, 0.044, 0.036, respectively). Pairwise comparisons of cell populations between different animals also yielded low &#x003b2; diversity values (0.004 to 0.035).</p><p>The TCR&#x003b2; repertoire analysis thus showed a high degree of relatedness between GFP<sup>+</sup>Tfh and GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Tfh cells from PP, suggesting a process of ongoing selection by common antigens and interconversion between the two phenotypes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing IL-21 and GFP is driven by TGF&#x003b2;, IL-6 and RA <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>We next sought to determine if IL-21/GFP expression could be induced in CD4<sup>+</sup> spleen cells from IL-21eGFP mice <italic>in vitro</italic> under conditions that mimic the gut microenvironment.

CD226, CD96 and TIGIT are all ligands of the poliovirus receptor (PVR/CD155). TIGIT<sup>+</sup> human Tfh cells have been shown to have enhanced B-cell helper function compared to TIGIT<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Tfh cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, and the TIGIT receptor CD155 was found expressed in a subset of human follicular dendritic cells (FDC), suggesting interactions of TIGIT<sup>+</sup> Tfh cells with CD155<sup>+</sup> FDC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>.

One indication of clonal relatedness is the degree of TCR repertoire overlap: we found that more than 40% of the unique TCR&#x003b2; CDR3 sequences from GFP<sup>+</sup>Tfh cells were contained within the larger GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Tfh repertoire. Statistical analysis confirmed that the GFP<sup>+</sup>Tfh and GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Tfh<sup>+</sup> cell TCR&#x003b2; repertoires in each mouse were highly related.

We carried out adoptive transfer experiments to understand the nature of the T-B interactions driving the development of GFP<sup>+</sup>Tfh cells in PP. Infusing polyclonal splenic GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from IL-21eGFP mice into TBmc mice, which have na&#x000ef;ve monospecific T and B cell repertoires, resulted in the differentiation of CXCR5<sup>+</sup>PD-1<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> cells from donor cells. However, the highly differentiated GFP<sup>+</sup>Tfh cell population did not form unless polyclonal B cells were co-transferred, suggesting that Tfh differentiation requires antigen-specific cognate interactions of T and B cells. A possible explanation is that polyclonal B cells provided a large repertoire containing clones that recognize intestinal antigens, and would effectively present the intestinal antigens to CD4 clones through cognate interactions. In contrast, monospecific B cells from TBmc mice do not bind intestinal antigens, and would not engage efficiently with intestinal-antigen specific CD4 cells.</p><p>To determine whether the gut microbiota was the source of antigenic stimulation we used various antibiotic treatments to deplete gastrointestinal bacteria populations and assess the impact on GFP<sup>+</sup>Tfh cells. Broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment significantly reduced levels of IL-21 in PP. However, depletion of Vancomycin-sensitive bacteria had the greatest negative impact on the differentiation of GFP<sup>+</sup>Tfh cells, suggesting a role for gram positive bacteria. Innate recognition of bacteria by DCs and FDCs may be the mechanisms whereby IL-21 production by Tfh cells is induced in PP, analogous to the process in Th17 cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. Direct sensing of microbial products by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells may also be necessary, as demonstrated previously for microbiota-induced Tregs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. Further investigation will be required to define the precise link between bacteria and the induction of highly differentiated Tfh cells in PP, and to account for the role of polyclonal B cells.</p><p>GFP<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and IL-21 production in PP of IL-21eGFP mice were first detected at 3&#x02013;4 weeks of age, coincident with increased mucosal IgA and IgG1, and with weaning. Thus, mucosal immune responses in the IL-21eGFP reporter mice are supported by an established gut microbiota, which is well known to develop with age in both mice and humans.</p><p>The inclusion of a DTR tag in IL-21eGFP mice enabled the specific depletion of GFP expressing cells to assess their function. Preventing the establishment of GFP<sup>+</sup>Tfh cells in the PP of young mice led to a significant reduction in PP GC B cells and GC IgG1 cells, confirming the importance of IL-21-producing Tfh cells in driving the GC reaction and the production of IgG1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. There were no changes in serum IgG1 concentration in DT treated IL-21eGFP mice. This suggests that IgG1 cells that differentiate in PP do not give rise to the majority of serum IgG1. No changes were detected in IgA cell number in PP, or in the levels of fecal IgA levels when GFP<sup>+</sup> T helper cells were ablated. There were also no changes detected in the production of IgG2a, IgG2b or IgG3 in PP. Production of IgA in the gut occurs through T-dependent and independent mechanisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref> and IL-21 has been implicated in the production of mucosal IgA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. It is thus possible that GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Tfh cells, which are less differentiated than GFP<sup>+</sup>Tfh cells, provided enough IL-21 to maintain normal production of IgA, or that IgA levels were maintained through compensatory T cell independent mechanisms. This may also apply to other immunoglobulin isotypes.</p><p>Another possibility is that ablation of the highly differentiated PP Tfh cells did result in some changes in IgA production that were not detected in our assays, but might have been responsible for the described changes in bacteria composition. Future in depth studies of immunoglobulin repertoire in the presence or absence of the GFP<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells will determine if these cells regulate antibody specificity and affinity.</p><p>The decrease in IgG1<sup>+</sup> PP cells after GFP<sup>+</sup> cell ablation is compatible with the fact that most IgG1<sup>+</sup> cells in PP have a GC phenotype, and GFP<sup>+</sup> T cell ablation decreased GC cells in this location. In addition, IgG1 is particularly dependent on IL-21, as it is the most decreased immunoglobulin in IL-21 or IL-21R deficient mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Unlike IgA, IgG1 does not readily traverse the epithelium, except during inflammation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>, therefore its role in the gut is poorly understood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>.

In addition, as some bacteria can bind to the surface of, and perhaps enter PP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>, IgG1 could interact with these microbes directly within the mucosal tissue.

We have thus generated an experimental system that can facilitate the identification of the specific antigenic determinants, cellular interactions and environmental factors involved in the induction of highly differentiated intestinal Tfh cells.
