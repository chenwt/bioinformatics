Mature miRNAs can be stably detected in extracellular vesicles (EVs) in biofluids, therefore they are considered to have great potential as biomarkers. In the present study, we investigated whether miRNAs have a distinct expression pattern in urine-EVs of prostate cancer (PCa) patients compared to control males. By next generation sequencing, we determined the miRNA expression in a discovery cohort of 4 control men and 9 PCa patients. miRNAs were validated by using a stemloop RT-PCR in an independent cohort of 74 patients (26 control and 48 PCa-patients). Whereas standard mapping protocols identified &#x0003e; 10 PCa associated miRNAs in urinary EVs, miR-21, miR-375 and miR-204 failed to robustly discriminate for disease in a validation study with RT-PCR-detection of mature miRNA sequences. In contrast, we observed that miRNA isoforms (isomiRs) with 3&#x02032; end modifications were highly discriminatory between samples from control men and PCa patients. Highly differentially expressed isomiRs of miR-21, miR-204 and miR-375 were subsequently validated in an independent group of 74 patients. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of three isomiRs, resulting in a 72.9% sensitivity with a high (88%) specificity and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.866. In comparison, prostate specific antigen had an AUC of 0.707 and measuring the mature form of these miRNAs yielded a lower 70.8% sensitivity and 72% specificity (AUC 0.766). We propose that isomiRs may carry discriminatory information which is useful to generate stronger biomarkers.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>liquid biopsy</kwd><kwd>isomiRs</kwd><kwd>miRNA</kwd><kwd>RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>extracellular vesicles</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Prostate cancer is the most common form of human cancer, with the second cancer related cause of death in Western males [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Human prostate cancer has a complex etiology and despite improved knowledge in the molecular underpinnings of this disease, accurate diagnosis and targeted treatment remains challenging. Suspicion of PCa is generally raised when patients have elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, and/or abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Subsequently, invasive prostate tissue biopsies are required to determine the histological presence of prostate cancer. While elevated serum PSA levels above 4.0 ng/ml increases the risk of PCa significantly [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], increased PSA levels is not specific for PCa. As a consequence, about 70&#x02013;80% of the prostate-tissue biopsies are unnecessary [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Due to the multifocal growth of PCa within the prostate, there is a chance that PCa is not detected even when multiple prostate-tissue biopsies are taken and accurately examined. It has been estimated that about 20% of PCa cases are not detected with an initial set of biopsies, leading to frequent and often unnecessary repeat-biopsies in patients that have no clinical disease [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Apart from the highly invasive nature of taking tumor biopsies, patients may develop infection (sepsis) as a consequence of the procedure [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This is becoming a concern regarding the increased antimicrobial resistance, despite the use of pre-biopsy antimicrobial prophylaxis [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, minimally-invasive alternatives for accurate detection of PCa are needed.</p><p>Recent studies indicated that extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are small membrane vesicles, are released by (prostate) cancer cells into the extracellular environment. Because of the anatomical location, prostate EVs can be found in urine [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and their levels can be increased after DRE [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Because urine can easily be collected after DRE, analysis of urinary-EV content seems a promising approach for diagnostic testing on PCa as it has several advantages, notably their enrichment for miRNAs that can serve as PCa markers. Apart from prostate cancer, in many cancer types the expression of a prominent class of small gene regulators known as microRNAs (miRNAs) is consistently deregulated. The importance of miRNAs in PCa development is underscored by multiple studies that demonstrated the aberrant miRNA expression in PCa tissues compared to normal tissues [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, miRNAs play important and unique roles with respect to cancer development and progression [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. EV-associated miRNAs can easily be extracted and quantified by qRT-PCR because they are protected from enzymatic degradation. miRNAs in association with EVs have been described to have diagnostic potential for (prostate) cancer patients. For example, miR-141 and miR-375 are increased in serum of metastatic prostate cancer patients [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Mature miRNAs are consistently annotated in the public registry miRBase as &#x0223c;22 nucleotide-long sequences. Developments in next-generation miRNA sequencing analysis have revealed that in reality many miRNAs in biological samples exist as multiple length variants [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Such length variations are usually located at the 3&#x02032;end of the miRNA sequences [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. miRNAs with terminal end variations are called isomiRs. IsomiRs comprise many modifications, including elongations, trimmings, sequence variants for example by editing and non-templated additions (NTAs) [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. IsomiRs are found to varying degrees in deep sequencing analyses depending on tissue origin and disease state [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Inexact post-transcriptional processing of miRNAs is thought to be the result of inaccurate Drosha and Dicer processing while isomiRs broaden the complexity in gene-regulatory networks. Even though the exact function of 3&#x02032; end modifications are still under investigation, increasing evidence suggests that a proportion of isomiRs is related to disease state possibly due to differences in stability and turnover [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Most recently, Telonis et al. studied miRNA datasets from TCGA and demonstrated that isomiRs in breast-cancer tissues can separate subtypes [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We previously demonstrated that certain miRNA modifications favor or disfavor their release via urinary EVs [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], a rule that may also apply to EVs from different sources as shown by others [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, current knowledge of isomiRs in many biological settings is still nascent and as far as we know a potential association with (prostate) cancer has not been demonstrated.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated whether mature miRNAs and their isomiRs have a distinct expression pattern in urine-EVs of PCa patients compared to control men, and analyzed their potential use as biomarker. Here we applied a next-generation sequencing approach to analyze mature miRNAs and isomiR patterns using a recently developed comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline that classifies EV-associated miRNAs including isomiRs [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In this study, we addressed the question whether detection of urine-EV isomiRs can reliably report the presence of prostate cancer. Strikingly, our observations show that measuring a small panel of EV-associated isomiRs provides superior clinical information over existing serum PSA measurements and standard detection of miRNAs in urine EVs.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Urine EV isolation and miRNA sequencing</title><p>EVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation and electron microscopy pictures show urinary-extracellular vesicle population with the expected size of 50&#x02013;150 nm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). A slight improvement was found on the level of background debris when EVs were isolated from a sucrose gradient (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The effect of storage at 4&#x000b0;C, &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C or &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C cell free urine on the EV-yield and structure was limited as determined by electron microscopy and by measuring the levels of vesicle markers Alix and TSG101 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). To test for the integrity of isolated EVs and to remove any contaminating RNA associated with cellular debris that may be present in EV pellet we incubated each sample with RNAse-A for 1 hour at 37C. We found that RNAse-A treatment had no effect on small RNA encapsulated in EVs as assessed by the Bioanalyzer small RNA chip (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>), thus confirming the integrity of isolated EVs. However, at this point we cannot formally distinguish whether a slight change observed in small RNA landscape may reflect the RNAse-A activity on RNA molecules &#x02018;stuck&#x02019; to the outer membrane of EVs or whether a small amount of EVs have a damaged membrane integrity and therefore renders EV-RNA accessible to RNAse-A activity. We employed Illumina small RNA sequencing (PE100) as a method to examine the total miRNA profile in urine-EVs from 13 patients, including control men, patients with localized PCa and patients with high-risk PCa (the patient characteristics are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). From these patient samples, we used total RNA isolated (e.g. the highest concentrations of RNA possible per sample) for RNA for library preparation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). A total of 28 million raw reads were obtained (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Of these reads, about 50% could be mapped to the human genome with high confidence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>) and with limited variation between the different samples. The reads were mapped to 32,000 individual loci of the human genome (hg19). The length distribution of the mapped miRNA sequences varied from 18 to 25 nt, of which most miRNAs were of 22 nt in length. The most abundant miRNA in urinary EVs of all patients was miR-10b-5p (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). miR-10b is highly expressed in various tissues, including kidney and has previously also been observed by others in urine EVs, and also in EVs secreted by the PC-3 prostate cancer cell line [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The top 10 of highly expressed miRNAs was comparable between all patient groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). For all tested urine-EV samples, in addition to miRNAs, which accounted for 44% of the aligned reads, we could classify all other groups of small RNAs. An average of 37% of the aligned reads mapped to the class of tRNAs, and 12% to rRNAs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Small RNA sequences that mapped to the other ncRNAs such as snRNAs, snoRNAs, piRNA and repeats were represented by less than 2% of the total mapped reads (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Urine-EV RNA sequencing</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) EM pictures of EVs isolated by ultra-centrifugation.

Surprisingly, the miRNA abundance in urine-EVs of patients (<italic>n</italic> = 9 patients) with confirmed PCa was lower compared to their relative expression in non-cancer control (<italic>n</italic> = 4 control men) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). For accurate detection of the candidate miRNAs in urine-EVs, high abundance is important to increase the sensitivity. In the 10 most frequent miRNAs that were differentially expressed (fold changed &#x0003e; = 2, (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.02)) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>), several miRNAs meeting these criteria were previously related to PCa [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To further verify the RNAseq expression data with an independent method, we examined the expression levels of 3 candidate miRNAs by sequence specific stem-loop based RT-PCR assay. We selected miRNAs miR-204, miR-375 and miR-21, which had the highest expression in urine-EVs of patients with PCa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) and were previously related to PCa development and progression [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The relative abundance of these three candidate miRNAs was determined using total RNA isolated from urine EVs of 74 patients by RT-PCR. Whereas the results of RNAseq analysis revealed that three miRNA candidates are significantly differentially expressed between two patient groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), none of those were differentially present between control and PCa patients in qRT-PCR assay analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Because the primers for qRT-PCR were specifically directed towards the mature miRNA sequence (e.g. the miRBase annotated sequence), we analyzed the expression of the mature sequence in our RNAseq data. In agreement with the qRT-PCR data, the reads corresponding to mature sequence of miR-204, miR-21 and miR-375 alone were less differentially expressed in PCa patients compared to control men (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). The most striking observation was for miR-204, of which the mature sequence abundance was virtually the same between control and PCa patients and in full agreement with the qRT-PCR results (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B&#x02013;2C</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Detection of mature miRNAs is unreliable for validation of RNA sequencing data</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Boxplot of the RNA-sequencing expression (RPM) of the three selected miRNAs, miR-204, miR-21 and miR-375.

These three isomiRs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) were measured by making use of custom designed stem-loop qRT-PCR primers that are optimized to recognize these isomiR-sequences. We used the same patient cohort in which the mature miRNA sequences were measured by qRT-PCR (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In agreement with the RNA sequencing data, we now measured a significant difference between control and PCa patients in abundance of the isoforms of miR-204, miR-21 and miR-375 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C&#x02013;4D</xref>).</p><p>We evaluated the performance of the three miRNA-isoforms by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and compared the outcome with that of ROCs calculated based on the measurement of mature miRNAs alone. For PSA the predictive accuracy (AUC) was 0.707, which is highly similar to what has been determined before in large patient cohorts [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). The predictive accuracy for prostate cancer was decidedly higher for the combined set of isomiRs (AUC 0.821), compared to that of the mature-miRNA panel alone (AUC 0.661) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). The predictive accuracy could be improved further when combining with sPSA to an AUC of 0.866 and 0.766, for the isomiR-set and mature miRNA-set, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>). For PSA alone, a concentration of 7.5 ng/ml was the cutoff point that maximized the sensitivity (70.8%) and specificity (60.0%) for the detection of PCa. However, when considering 4 ng/ml as cutoff point, the sensitivity for the detection for PCa was 85.4% and specificity only 32.0%. When decreasing PSA cutoff to 3 ng/ml, this was 95.8% and 24.0%, respectively. On the basis of the predictor model for the sets of 3 isomiRs, a probability of 0.77 was the cutoff point that maximized the sensitivity (72.9%) and specificity (88%) for the detection of PCa in urine-EVs. At this cutoff point, the positive predictive value (PPV) was 92.1% and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 62.9%. For the combined miRNAs at the optimized cut-off point of 0.68 resulted in a lower sensitivity (70.8%) and specificity (72.0%) for the detection of PCa in urine-EVs, compared to that of the isomiR-set. At this cutoff point, PPV was 54.8% and the NPV was 81.0%, which is much lower than the isomiR-panel, showing the strength the selected isomiRs in detection of PCa.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the present study we demonstrate that urine EVs can be used for minimally invasive tests to detect PCa in suspect individuals. We show that isomiRs present in urinary EVs, more so than mature miRNA sequences are able to detect prostate cancer in suspected patients. Specifically, we identified isomiRs of miR-21, miR-375 and miR-204 that distinguish controls from PCa patients. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis we calculated an AUC of 0.821 based on these three isomiRs combined with PSA, showing the potential of these isomiRs for minimally-invasive testing on PCa.</p><p>The discovery that miRNAs are sorted into EVs, both by healthy and by cancer cells, has become a general observation made in many laboratories [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The applicability of EV-associated nucleic acids, including miRNAs for diagnostic purposes is gaining increasing interest from both clinicians and pharmaceutical industry that seek minimally-invasive diagnostics [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A large variety of biofluids such as blood, seminal fluid, breast milk, sputum, cerebrospinal fluid and also urine are known to contain (secreted) miRNAs. Urine is an attractive biofluid as its collection is non-invasive and contains a high concentration of EVs produced by a selected group of organs (prostate, bladder, kidneys and urothelial cells). This is in contrast with blood serum and plasma as biofluids that contain EVs from all organs of the body and are dominated by platelet-derived vesicles [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, in some patients the EVs yield was extremely low, even though all patients had received DRE. This rate is comparable to observations of others [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Counter intuitively this may, in part, be related to higher amount of liquid consumption. This has previously been described in studies that analyzed urine [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and sediments [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Fluid restriction may lead to an increase in EV yield. Furthermore, it has been suggested that pre-amplification procedures prior to RT-PCR may increase the cDNA number and thereby improve the detection [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>With a genome-wide small RNA (Illumina) sequencing analysis, we were able to identify numerous small RNA species present in urine EVs. Apart from the identification of well annotated miRNA-related sequences, the other dominant small RNA sequences mapped to human genome appear to be short fragments of known RNA classes such as tRNA, rRNA, Y RNA and mRNA. The presence of tRNA fragments in urine and sera of cancer patients has been previously documented [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and seems to correlate with high turnover of tRNAs in cancer tissue. Although the tRNA fragments are present in high amounts in prostate biopsies from metastatic patients [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and their generation may be androgen-dependent [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], the molecular basis behind their biogenesis, function and potential use as biomarker in urinary EVs remains to be further elucidated.</p><p>During the analysis of small RNA class distribution, we observed that small RNA sequences belonging to miRNA class exhibited the most significant deregulation between samples of control men and PCa patients. Among those we identified miRNA sequence variants commonly referred to as isomiRs [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Although the biological relevance of isomiR expression in cancer development and progression is not well understood, we found that isomiRs are present at different relative frequencies in urine EVs of PCa patients compared to urine EV samples from control men. An additional conclusion of this study is that detection of mature miRNA sequences as listed in miRBase using dedicated stemloop RT-PCR does not always correspond with RNAseq results. This seems to depend on the analysis thresholds that are applied and could explain why some miRNAs fail as cancer biomarkers in validation studies [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This underlines the importance of analyzing the presence and abundance of certain isomiRs when validation by stemloop RT-PCR is preferred [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Even though the stem-loop PCR primer method is in theory useful for detecting defined 3&#x02032;-end isomiR-sequences, cross-detection of related miRNA sequences may occur [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Importantly, the isomiRs that we selected in this study as potential PCa biomarkers were selected for their differential abundance in urinary samples obtained from high-throughput sequencing data. We validated the RNA-sequencing data observed differences in abundance for isomiRs and their mature forms using stemloop primers [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In general, we measured several-fold differences in abundance between the mature vs isomiRs in concordance with the RNA-sequencing read abundance, suggesting that cross-detection is probably does not have a significant impact on the PCR measurements. A small percentage of cross-detection may still occur, and can therefore not be excluded at this stage. We previously reported that many miRNAs are generally comparably expressed in (tumor) cells and detected in their secreted EVs, while other miRNAs show specific cellular retention or abundance in EVs [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. More specifically, we found that 3&#x02032;uridylated miRNAs are more abundant in EVs than could be expected from their relative abundance in producing tumor cells. In contrast, miRNAs that are 3&#x02032;adenylated are generally underrepresented in EVs compared to their relative expression within the cells [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This disruption is emphasized by a recent observations by Boele et al. [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], which described that the poly(A) polymerase PAPD5-mediated adenylation of miRNA-21 is disrupted in cancer. A disruption of post-transcriptional processing of miRNAs can affect their stability, activity, RISC-loading potential, turnover, or affect their enrichment in secreted EVs, and as a consequence measuring of isomiRs may be useful for cancer-specific detection. Notably, the study by Boele and colleagues could explain why several PCa-related miRNAs are actually less abundant in urine EVs even though these are upregulated in cancer tissues. Furthermore, these decreased PCa-related miRNAs in urine were also observed previously by Sapre <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Additional studies are essential to determine the physiological significance of post-transcriptional miRNA modifications, EV sorting and the role of these processes in cancer development and usefulness for liquid biopsy tests. The modifications such as non-templated nucleotide additions are generated by RNA-modifying enzymes called ribonucleotidyl transferases (rNTAs) but their role in cancer remains largely unexplored.</p><p>In conclusion, in this study we demonstrate that detection of EV-associated isomiRs could allow minimally-invasive diagnosis of PCa patients. If validated in larger follow up studies, the isomiRs identified in this study could be useful to predict which patients suspected of PCa require a tissue biopsy and which patients are unlikely to suffer from PCa and may continue minimally-invasive monitoring.

In brief, the processing of the fastq format files included adapter trimming, deletion of reads &#x0003c; 15 nt, and to collapse all reads with identical sequences into one entry (unique reads). The read count assigned to each unique read represents the number of times the corresponding molecule has been sequenced. The reads were aligned using two approaches: all reads alignment to the human genome (hg19 from UCSC), using the bowtie seed alignment allowing one mismatch or all reads annotation by using known RNA databases (to assign reads to different RNA classes). Using one mismatch approach of mapping to the human genome, the seed alignment method avoids that strongly modified molecules (e.g. isomiRs) fail to map, which would impede their detection [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].
