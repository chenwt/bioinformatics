Upon antigen stimulation, MALT1 forms a complex with BCL10 and CARMA1, which is essential for initial I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; phosphorylation and NF-&#x003ba;B nuclear translocation. Parallel induction of MALT1 protease activity serves to inactivate negative regulators of NF-&#x003ba;B signalling, such as A20 and RELB. Here we demonstrate a key role for auto-proteolytic MALT1 cleavage in B- and T-cell receptor signalling. MALT1 cleavage occurred after Arginine 149, between the N-terminal death domain and the first immunoglobulin-like region, and did not affect its proteolytic activity. Jurkat T cells expressing an un-cleavable MALT1-R149A mutant showed unaltered initial I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; phosphorylation and normal nuclear accumulation of NF-&#x003ba;B subunits. Nevertheless, MALT1 cleavage was required for optimal activation of NF-&#x003ba;B reporter genes and expression of the NF-&#x003ba;B targets IL-2 and CSF2. Transcriptome analysis confirmed that MALT1 cleavage after R149 was required to induce NF-&#x003ba;B transcriptional activity in Jurkat T cells. Collectively, these data demonstrate that auto-proteolytic MALT1 cleavage controls antigen receptor-induced expression of NF-&#x003ba;B target genes downstream of nuclear NF-&#x003ba;B accumulation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Work in Mathijs Baens'/Peter Marynen's laboratory is supported by research grants from the FWO (G.0534.12), the &#x02018;Belgian Foundation against Cancer' (190-2008) and the &#x02018;Concerted Research Actions' (GOA grant GOA/11/010).

Two other chromosomal translocations, t(1;14)(p22;q32) and t(14;18)(q32;q21), are also associated with MALT lymphoma and result in IgH enhancer-driven overexpression of BCL10 and MALT1 respectively <xref rid="pone.0103774-Willis1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0103774-Streubel1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.

Antigen triggering of T- and B-cells activates a cascade of tyrosine phosphorylation events that converge at the activation of Ser/Thr kinases such as PKC&#x003b8; and PKC&#x003b2;, respectively. Activated PKC&#x003b8;/&#x003b2; (and most likely additional kinases) phosphorylate CARMA1, inducing a conformational change that exposes its coiled coil and CARD motifs <xref rid="pone.0103774-Sommer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103774-Matsumoto1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

It is thought that the formation of CBM oligomers in turn induces the recruitment, oligomerization and activation of the E3-ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAF6, resulting in Lys63-linked poly-ubiquitination of MALT1 <xref rid="pone.0103774-Oeckinghaus1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, BCL10 <xref rid="pone.0103774-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> as well as the ligase itself <xref rid="pone.0103774-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. These poly-ubiquitin chains assist CARMA1-dependent recruitment of the I&#x003ba;B kinase (IKK) complex via the ubiquitin-binding domain of the IKK&#x003b3; subunit <xref rid="pone.0103774-Wu2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, which then culminates in full IKK activation via poly-ubiquitination of IKK&#x003b3; <xref rid="pone.0103774-Zhou2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Activated IKK phosphorylates the NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitory protein I&#x003ba;B, which marks it for degradation by the proteasome, thereby releasing NF-&#x003ba;&#x00392; complexes and allowing their nuclear translocation.</p><p>MALT1 controls T- and B-cell activation not only through its adaptor function but also via its proteolytic activity <xref rid="pone.0103774-Coornaert1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103774-Rebeaud1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. TCR stimulation induces MALT1-mediated cleavage and inactivation of the NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor A20, resulting in a stronger NF-&#x003ba;B response and increased IL-2 production <xref rid="pone.0103774-Coornaert1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Moreover, MALT1-dependent cleavage of RELB, an NF-&#x003ba;B family member that acts as a negative regulator of T-cell activation <xref rid="pone.0103774-Weih1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, promotes NF-&#x003ba;B activation in an IKK-independent manner <xref rid="pone.0103774-Hailfinger1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. To date four additional MALT1 substrates have been identified: BCL10, CYLD, MCPIP-1 (also known as Regnase-1) and NIK. Cleavage of MALT1's binding partner BCL10 does not control NF-&#x003ba;B activity but is thought to affect integrin-mediated T-cell adhesion <xref rid="pone.0103774-Rebeaud1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Cleavage of CYLD, a de-ubiquitinating enzyme and known negative regulator of NF-&#x003ba;B signaling, was shown to be essential for TCR-induced JNK activation <xref rid="pone.0103774-Staal1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. MCPIP-1 is an RNAse that destabilizes mRNAs of T cell effector genes; its cleavage by MALT1 leads to stabilization of TCR-induced gene transcripts <xref rid="pone.0103774-Uehata1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Finally, cleavage of NIK by the API2-MALT1 fusion protein activates non-canonical NF-&#x003ba;B signaling, which contributes together with canonical NF-&#x003ba;B activation to MALT lymphomagenesis <xref rid="pone.0103774-Rosebeck1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. MALT1 protease activity is also essential for the survival of cells derived from the activated B-cell subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL) <xref rid="pone.0103774-Ferch1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103774-Hailfinger2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, which are addicted to constant MALT1-driven NF-&#x003ba;B signaling <xref rid="pone.0103774-Ngo1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p><p>The MALT1 protein was originally referred to as a &#x02018;paracaspase&#x02019; because it contains a caspase p20-like proteolytic domain preceded by a large pro-domain, consisting of a Death Domain (DD) and two immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains <xref rid="pone.0103774-Uren1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. As such, MALT1 structurally resembles initiator caspases. These have longer pro-domains and become catalytically active upon proximity-induced dimerization. Subsequent auto-proteolysis of the protease domain into p10 and p20 subunits is thought to stabilize activated caspase dimers <xref rid="pone.0103774-Boatright1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Oligomerization of the CBM complex in the lipid raft environment after antigen-receptor triggering is thought to promote MALT1 proteolytic activity by induced proximity, similar to initiator caspases. However, the mechanisms required to stabilize the active form of MALT1 seem to be fundamentally different from initiator caspases. Indeed, catalytically active MALT1 dimers are stabilized by mono-ubiquitination of MALT1 on lysine 644 in its C-terminal region following the protease domain <xref rid="pone.0103774-Pelzer1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103774-Cabalzar1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Whether MALT1, like initiator caspases, is also a target of its own proteolytic activity, and if such an auto-proteolysis event could contribute to NF-&#x003ba;B signalling, is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that MALT1 is a substrate of its own protease activity and that MALT1 auto-proteolysis is an essential step in antigen receptor-induced NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent gene transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Targeting MALT1 to the plasma membrane in 293T cells induces its cleavage into 19 and 76 kDa fragments</title><p>T or B cell receptor stimulation induces CARMA1-mediated recruitment of BCL10 and MALT1 to the lipid raft membrane fractions, which is essential for NF-&#x003ba;B activation <xref rid="pone.0103774-Egawa1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103774-Gaide1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103774-Hara2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.

When ectopically expressed in 293T cells, this construct was highly active, while MALT1 alone was unable to activate an NF-&#x003ba;B reporter (<xref rid="pone.0103774-Noels1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103774-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).

Mutation of either one of the two TRAF6 binding sites, E313A/E316A (T6Ig-m) or E806A (T6C-m), strongly impaired the potential of p76 to activate NF-&#x003ba;B signalling in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103774-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).

Cells expressing wild-type MALT1 showed a stimulus-dependent increase of gene reporter constructs containing the IL-2 promotor (IL-2p-Luc) or three NF-&#x003ba;B sites from the promoter of the kappa light chain of immunoglobulin (Ig&#x003ba;3-ConALuc), while this response was strongly impaired in J&#x00394;M-CA or J&#x00394;M-RA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103774-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Together, these findings clearly support a role for MALT1 auto-proteolysis in regulating NF-&#x003ba;B transcriptional activity. To explore this further, we performed RNA sequencing for stimulated Jurkat MALT1 cells and the mutant RACA, J&#x00394;M-CA and J&#x00394;M-RA cells. Compared to the Jurkat MALT1 cells, the three mutant cell lines showed between 79 and 278 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with a greater than two-fold change and a false discovery rate (FDR) q&#x0003c;0.001 after 3 or 18 hrs of stimulation with P/I (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103774.s008">Table S2</xref>). qRT-PCR analysis performed for a selection of top ranked genes confirmed the effects observed by RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103774.s009">Table S3</xref>).

First, activation of MALT1 induced its proteolytic cleavage at R149 in 293T cells. Second, recombinant MALT1 was able to cleave itself <italic>in vitro</italic> at R149. Third, continuous MALT1 auto-proteolysis was observed in ABC-DLBCL cells and SSK41 MALT lymphoma cells that have constitutive MALT1 protease activity. Fourth, B- and T-cell stimulation induced MALT1 cleavage. Finally, an un-cleavable MALT1 mutant did not prevent initial I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of NF-&#x003ba;B subunits but impaired the transcriptional activation of NF-&#x003ba;B target genes.</p><p>TCR engagement induces the redistribution of BCL10 and MALT1 to the membrane rafts at the TCR complex, which is essential to activate NF-&#x003ba;B signalling <xref rid="pone.0103774-Gaide1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103774-Che1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103774-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Artificial membrane anchoring of MALT1 not only activated its protease activity and NF-&#x003ba;B signalling, but also induced MALT1 auto-proteolysis. The resulting p76 cleavage product efficiently oligomerized and activated NF-&#x003ba;B signalling in a TRAF6-dependent manner. TRAF6 mediates K63-linked poly-ubiquitination of itself, MALT1 and IKK&#x003b3; which facilitates activation of the IKK complex and phosphorylation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;. This mechanism and also the nuclear accumulation of the NF-&#x003ba;B subunits were however not affected in MALT1-deficient Jurkat T cells expressing un-cleavable MALT1 (J&#x00394;M-RA), suggesting a role for MALT1 auto-proteolysis further downstream in regulating NF-&#x003ba;B transcriptional activation. Interestingly, MALT1 was reported to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm and its nuclear retention reduced NF-&#x003ba;B signalling <xref rid="pone.0103774-Nakagawa1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, suggesting an inhibitory function for MALT1 in the nucleus. Whether MALT1 auto-proteolysis relieves this inhibitory potential on NF-&#x003ba;B signalling will be an interesting aspect of future work.</p><p>MALT1 controls T- and B-cell activation via both its adaptor and protease function. As an adaptor, MALT1 is required for building up the proximal signalling complex that controls the IKK-dependent activation of the canonical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, as well as the activation of the c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) dependent transcriptional pathway. The protease function of MALT1 apparently serves to promote gene transcription by inactivating negative regulators of NF-&#x003ba;B and JNK signalling, like A20, RELB and CYLD. Moreover, MALT1-dependent cleavage of the RNAse MCPIP1 (also known as Regnase-1) is thought to lead to the stabilization of the resulting transcripts <xref rid="pone.0103774-Uehata1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Auto-processing of MALT1 did not affect these functions, since the processing-deficient R149A mutant showed normal protease activity and an unaltered capacity to promote IKK or JNK activation. The data presented in this study therefore reveal a highly interesting novel aspect of MALT1's function, which is controlled by the auto-proteolytic removal of the N-terminal death domain and the BCL10 binding site. This results in the formation of an active C-terminal p76 fragment of MALT1 that dissociates from BCL10 and oligomerizes to promote NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent transcription in a TRAF6-dependent manner. These findings support a model in which the p76 fragment of MALT1, in combination with TRAF6 and potentially additional components, directly or indirectly affects the transcriptional activity of NF-&#x003ba;B complexes by means that remain to be discovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103774-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0103774-g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0103774.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Model for MALT1 functions in TCR-mediated NF-&#x003ba;B1 activation.</title><p>A) The adaptor function of MALT1 is required for TCR-mediated activation of the IKK complex. Via formation of the CARMA1/BCL10/MALT1 complex MALT1 controls TRAF6-mediated K63 poly-ubiquitination of the gamma subunit of the IKK complex. Concurrent phosphorylation of IKK&#x003b2; activates the IKK complex that phosphorylates the NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor I&#x003ba;B, induces its proteasomal degradation and allows nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B complexes consisting of p50, p65 and REL. B) Parallel induction of MALT1 protease activity prevents de-ubiquitination of IKK&#x003b3; and possibly other substrates via A20 cleavage and facilitates DNA binding of p65- or REL-containing NF-&#x003ba;B complexes via RELB cleavage.

Compared to flow cytometry, in which only eYFPhi cells are included in the analysis, the Western blot analysis shows a higher percentage of reporter cleavage because all cells (including cells expressing low levels of the reporter) are lysed and analyzed.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0103774.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0103774.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p><bold>MALT1 and API2-MALT1 autoproteolysis in SSK41 lymphoma cells.</bold> A) Immunoblot of lysates from SSK41 cells, left untreated or treated with 50 &#x000b5;M z-VRPR-fmk (36h), with antibodies against MALT1, cleaved BCL10 and tubulin.
