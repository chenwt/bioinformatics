Genome sequencing and expression data have become more cost-effective and easier to generate, resulting in an increase in the number of available genomes for analysis. In mycology, many of the genomes are poorly annotated, resulting in a need for large scale genome analysis to identify genes that have similar function. For pathogens, comparisons can help to find novel drug targets, mechanisms of infection, or common genes that might shed light on pathogenic and non-pathogenic lifestyles.</p><p>Homologs are genes that are shared among related organisms and can be used for genome comparisons. Homologs can fall into two different subclasses: orthologs and paralogs. Orthologs are derived from a common ancestor but usually diverge by speciation, resulting in retention of similar functions during evolution. In contrast, paralogs typically diverge after speciation and are the result of gene duplication events and may or may not retain similar functions. Orthologs and paralogs can be useful tools in genome comparison studies because they can highlight genes shared among species that are important to conserved biological processes or can reveal those genes that are unique to a particular subset of fungi, such as families of fungi or fungi with a specific lifestyle. Several algorithms have been developed to study orthologs across species, but most are limited to comparisons between only two species. OrthoMCL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] is an algorithm used for the identification of orthologs between multiple species. Developed by Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], OrthoMCL uses multiple steps including BLASTp and Markov clustering in order to group genes into likely orthologous clusters. Using such algorithms, genes with similar functions as well as those genes unique to each species can be identified.</p><p>The Magnaporthaceae family of fungi contains several economically important plant pathogens. Among the pathogenic members of this family are <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>, <italic>Gaeumannomyces graminis</italic> var. <italic>tritici</italic>, and <italic>Magnaporthe poae. M. oryzae</italic> is known as the rice blast fungus and causes disease in rice, wheat, and barley following landing of conidia on the host plant leaf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Upon germination on the hydrophobic leaf surface, the formation of a specialized infection structure, the appressorium, is stimulated. The appressorium penetrates the leaf surface allowing the fungus to invade and spread in the plant tissue. <italic>M. oryzae</italic> outbreaks have been known to devastate vast acreages of rice on a regular basis and is a major concern for global food security [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. More recently, <italic>M. oryzae</italic> has also been shown to cause disease on other cultivated grasses including barley and wheat, increasing its threat to the food supply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. <italic>G. graminis</italic> var. <italic>tritici</italic> is the causative agent of take-all disease in wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Unlike <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, which targets the leaf of the plant, <italic>G. graminis</italic> var. <italic>tritici</italic> attacks the roots of wheat plants resulting in root rot. Hyphae of the soil-borne fungus wrap around the root and invade the root structure causing tissue necrosis and subsequent killing of the plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. <italic>M. poae</italic>, the causative agent of summer patch disease in turf grasses, acts in a similar manner to <italic>G. graminis</italic> var. <italic>tritici</italic> and attacks the roots of grasses causing root-rot and subsequent host plant death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Identification of proteins that are involved with host-pathogen interactions has, until recently, relied on molecular biology techniques at the bench. For plant pathogens, several classes of proteins are frequent targets of further study including carbohydrate active enzymes (CAzymes), transcriptional regulators, and secreted proteins. CAzymes can be classified into six subsets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]: auxiliary activity (AA), carbohydrate binding molecules (CBM), carbohydrate esterases (CE), glycoside hydrolases (GH), glycosyltransferases (GT), and polysaccharide lyases (PL). Comparative studies of CAzymes in 103 fungal proteomes were performed by Zhao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and showed for <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, <italic>G. graminis</italic> var. <italic>tritici</italic>, and <italic>M. poae</italic> that GHs were the most abundant class. Targets of GHs include cellulose, glycans, glucans, and chitin, suggesting both plant and fungal targets for this enzyme class [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Fungal effector proteins are secreted proteins, often less than 250 amino acids in length, which interact with host plant proteins in order to modulate the host immune system and promote infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Effectors proteins have been shown to be highly diversifying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and may be undergoing accelerated evolution. Studies in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> have shown that some effector proteins are undergoing high rates of diversification in order to evade the host immune response, suggesting that there is selection pressure by the host environment to rapidly accumulate non-synonymous mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. These data suggest that diversification of genes through mutation is one mechanism for fungi to evolve to escape plant recognition. This concept of two-speed genome evolution, where virulence genes evolve more rapidly than other genes, has implicated repetitive DNA elements, including retrotransposons, in the increased rate of evolution in effector proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Together, CAzymes and small secreted proteins are critical to initial host-pathogen interactions that allow a fungal pathogen to degrade and enter host cells while modulating their response to invasion. With more recent advances in bioinformatics, both CAzymes and small secreted proteins of special interest can be identified and characterized prior to studying them at the bench.</p><p>The goal of this study was two-fold: identify genes and gene clusters that are unique to the Magnaporthaceae family of fungi in order to identify genes that may be involved pathogenesis, and identify a core proteome of conserved genes and identify functional clusters that are undergoing rapid diversification. First, the protein sequences from 74 fungal genomes, including the genomes of <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, <italic>G. graminis</italic> var. <italic>tritici</italic>, and <italic>M. poae</italic>, were chosen from the Broad Institute&#x02019;s Fungal Genome Initiative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] for OrthoMCL analysis. The genomes included consisted of plant and animal pathogens as well as the genomes of model fungi, such as <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. OrthoMCL clusters that contained only genes from the Magnaporthaceae family of fungi and unclustered genes that are species specific were further analyzed. Gene Ontology annotation (GO annotation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and InterProScan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] protein domain identification were used to determine the putative functions for each cluster of orthologs. We hypothesized that genes and gene clusters involved with metabolic process would be highly represented in the Magnaporthaceae specific and species specific genes. The data suggests, however, that proteins with enzymatic function and transcriptional regulators were highly represented in orthologous clusters that are unique to the Magnaporthaceae. In addition, we used Hmmscan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], to identify Magnaporthaceae specific clusters and species specific &#x0201c;unique&#x0201d; genes that had putative CAzyme function. We found that few CAzymes were clustered by OrthoMCL, while a higher number were identified in the species specific genes.</p><p>Second, OrthoMCL clusters containing at least one gene from each of the three Magnaporthaceae species were identified as the &#x0201c;core proteome&#x0201d;. We hypothesized that secreted proteins and specifically secreted proteins with enzymatic and protease functions would be undergoing diversifying selection. In addition, we hypothesized that genes under diversifying selection would be closer to repetitive elements than genes that are under neutral or purifying selection. Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood (PAML) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] was used to identify genes that exhibited purifying selection or diversifying selection and compared to repetitive element locations in the genome. Additionally, secreted proteins were identified using TargetP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and SignalP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and were examined for their proximity to repetitive elements. Surprisingly, the data suggests that there is no correlation between genes undergoing diversifying selection or genes with higher mutations rates and distance to repetitive elements. In addition, we found no evidence that secreted proteins are subjected to more diversifying selection than purifying selection. Taken together, we found no evidence of two-speed genome evolution between the three Magnaporthaceae species examined.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ortholog clustering</title><p>Ortholog clustering can be used to identify important patterns in gene conservation across diverse organisms such as the fungal kingdom when comparing a large number of eukaryotic genomes. Clustering can also reveal unique sets of genes that are important to one species or group of fungi that are not found in other species. In order to identify genes that are unique to and shared among the three Magnaporthaceae species (<italic>M. oryzae</italic>, <italic>M. poae</italic>, and <italic>G. graminis</italic> var. <italic>tritici</italic>), we utilized an ortholog clustering algorithm. Seventy-four fungal genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] were used to for ortholog identification using OrthoMCL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The genomes used represented human pathogens, plant pathogens, model organisms, and environmental fungi (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>), and represented four phyla and twelve classes of fungi. These genomes were chosen for OrthoMCL analysis because all genomes were sequenced, assembled and annotated using a similar work-flow by the Broad Institute. 12,991 protein sequences were analyzed for <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, while 14,650 and 12,329 were analyzed for <italic>G. graminis</italic> var. <italic>tritici</italic> and <italic>M. poae</italic> respectively (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Approximately 22&#x02013;25&#x000a0;% of Magnaporthaceae species genes were removed from clustering analysis after BLASTp alignment. An additional 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;% of Magnaporthaceae genes were either not clustered with any other genes or were clustered with genes from a single species. These genes, along with the gene removed after BLASTp analysis were combined to create the &#x0201c;unique gene&#x0201d; category (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>OrthoMCL and unique gene summary</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Input genes</th><th>Clustered genes</th><th>% Clustered</th><th>Unclustered</th><th>Clustered as single species</th><th>Total unique genes</th><th>% Unique</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Six of the most abundant categories were genes involved in enzymatic activity, including metabolic process (228 genes), hydrolase activity (197 genes), transferase activity (161 genes), proteolysis (86 genes), and peptidase activity (70 genes). Categories that include nuclear localization and DNA binding were also common with 168 and 154 genes, respectively. Metal ion binding and zinc ion binding were both identified as putative functions in a large number of clusters (109 and 99, respectively).

In addition, we identified which genes are unique to each species and determined putative gene functions (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, and Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). OrthoMCL revealed a core proteome for the Magnaporthaceae of 6518 clusters that contain at least one gene from <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, <italic>G. graminis</italic> var. <italic>tritici</italic>, and <italic>M. poae</italic>. To our surprise, further analysis of the core proteome using PAML revealed that there is no correlation between PAML score and distance to repetitive elements (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>) or degree of mutation to repetitive elements (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>), while analysis of clusters that are undergoing diversifying or purifying selection showed no enrichment of secreted proteins nor small secreted proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9a</xref>, <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">b</xref>).</p><p>GO annotation and InterProScan analysis of the clusters unique to the Magnaporthaceae species showed that proteins with enzymatic function and proteins involved in transcriptional regulation were the most common. However, these categories are also common in the genes that are unique to each species. These data suggest that both categories may contribute to speciation but not enough evolutionary time has passed to separate the genes in the shared clusters into unique genes. Alternatively, there may be some evolutionary pressure to maintain the genes within the 295 shared clusters, such as environmental conditions or host plant conditions. Putative function analysis was performed at the cluster level, thus leaving the potential that analysis at the sequence level will reveal specific conserved regions of the genes within each cluster.</p><p>Interestingly, more CAZymes were found to be specific to each species compared with the Magnaporthaceae specific clusters (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). These data suggest that CAZyme gene sequences are plastic and may contribute to speciation. Fungi produce a large number of CAZymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and an abundance of proteins with redundant functions may result in the diversity observed in our data. Zhao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] showed that there were similar ratios of each CAZyme class found in fungi that infect similar hosts, such as monocots or dicots. However, CAZymes may vary based on route of infection rather than the type of host plant. <italic>M. oryzae</italic> infects the leaf of a plant while <italic>G. graminis</italic> var<italic>. tritici</italic> and <italic>M. poae</italic> infect the root of the plant. <italic>G. graminis</italic> and <italic>M. poae</italic> share 12 clusters that contain CAZymes that are not shared with <italic>M. oryzae</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). One hypothesis for the abundance of shared CAZymes is that these clusters contain genes needed to infect the root of the host plant. Our CAZyme analysis suggests that glycosyltransferases may be important in the environmental or host-pathogen interactions in <italic>M. poae</italic> and <italic>G. graminis</italic> var. <italic>tritici</italic>, while glycoside hydrolases and carbohydrate binding molecules are most abundant among the <italic>M. oryzae</italic> unique genes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Further analysis of the CAZyme families may reveal specific enzyme targets for each cluster that are important to infection at the root or leaf.</p><p>In addition to enzymes, transcription factors were identified as abundant in both the Magnaporthaceae specific clusters and the unique gene groups for each species (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). More specifically, the zinc finger and fungal-type zinc finger transcription factors were common in both analyses. These data suggest that adaptation to environmental and host-plant stresses may be dependent on transcriptional regulation in addition to altering protein function through mutation. Preliminary RNAseq data of the three species under several stress conditions, such as heat, cold, and osmotic stress, suggest that relatively few clusters exhibit similar transcriptional regulation (data not shown), however, additional experiments must be performed to confirm these data.</p><p>The ratio of purifying and diversifying clusters compared with clusters under neutral selection varied depending on the presence or absence of paralogs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). In clusters that contained one or more paralogs, there was an increase in the proportions of both diversifying and purifying genes. There are several proposed functions for gene duplication in fungi. First, gene duplication of genes with highly conserved function (purifying genes) may be needed to maintain genes with redundant function. Second, duplication of conserved genes may result in increased protein production. Third, gene duplication of diversifying proteins may be needed to develop a novel function for the gene group. Our data suggests that the gene duplication observed in the core proteome results in both conserved and novel functions. Closer analysis of clusters and their function would be needed to further understand the nature of each gene duplication.</p><p>It has been suggested that in <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, genes encoding effectors are undergoing more rapid evolution than other genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. As hypothesized for antagonistic co-evolution between organisms, the zig-zag model of host and pathogen evolution suggests that as the host immune system evolves to recognize certain pathogen effector proteins, then the pathogen must, in turn, evolve to evade the host immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The avirulence genes (AVR) in <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, <italic>Leptosphaeria maculans</italic>, <italic>Leptospheraeria biglobosa</italic>, and other phytopathogenic fungi, have been shown to have undergone gene duplication, translocation, and RIP mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], supporting the idea that these effector proteins are undergoing rapid mutation. Interestingly, the zig-zag model of evolution between host and pathogen is not limited to fungal pathogens nor plant hosts, but is also seen in a variety of host-pathogen interactions such as mammalian parasitic pathogens including the malaria causing <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The merozoite surface protein I (MSP1) gene in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is highly polymorphic, allowing for evasion of the host antibody response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, it has been suggested that proximity to repetitive elements, such as retrotransposons, contributes to rapid diversification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. More specifically, the <italic>M. oryzae</italic> LTR retrotransposon, Maggy, has been found to be associated with T:A enriched regions due to RIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Our data does show that in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> unique proteins and, more specifically, small unique proteins are closer to repetitive elements, including LTR classification (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>, <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). However, these observations were not seen in either <italic>G. graminis</italic> var. <italic>tritici</italic> or in <italic>M. poae</italic>, suggesting that increased diversification due to repetitive element proximity, and more specifically proximity to Maggy and similar retrotransposons, is not universal to the Magnaporthaceae family of fungi.</p><p>It is important to note that the purpose of this study was to compare three genomes of related phytopathogenic fungi at the family level. While our data shows no evidence of a two-speed genome evolution in the Magnaporthaceae, evidence of small scale evolution, such as diversification observed between strains, may still be found. While we hypothesized that evidence of a two-speed genome evolution would be observed among the Magnaporthaceae family, our analyses, which were performed in several different ways (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>, <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">b</xref>, <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">c</xref>, <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9a</xref>, <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">b</xref>) failed to support the hypothesis.</p><p>Our data showed that at the genome level, there is no evidence to suggest multi-speed genome evolution or that proximity to repetitive elements plays a role in diversification of genes. Our core proteome analysis consisted of 6518 clusters containing a total of 22,085 genes from <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, <italic>G. graminis</italic> var. <italic>tritici</italic>, and <italic>M. poae</italic>. We examined the proximity of genes undergoing diversifying or purifying selection to repetitive elements and determined there was no significant difference between the two groups in any species (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). To confirm these data, PAML scores were graphed against distance to repetitive elements, R<sup>2</sup> values were near zero (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>) and mutation analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>) also confirmed no correlation between degree of mutation and proximity to repetitive elements. Because sequence homology is used to cluster orthologs in OrthoMCL, it is possible that more conserved genes were used in our analysis. Thus by comparing orthologs, the data may be skewed towards neutral or purifying clusters. However, by using a low cutoff of 50&#x000a0;% sequence homology implemented in OrthoMCL to cluster orthologs, clustering should include a wider range of diversified genes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Taken together, our data suggests that there is no evidence for two-speed evolution at the genome level. Additionally, repetitive element proximity has no influence on diversification of purification of orthologous clusters. While it is possible for more rapid evolution can occur on a small scale, such as a small group or functional class of proteins, these trends cannot be observed at the genome level.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Genome sequences and OrthoMCL</title><p>Genome, transcript, and protein sequences for 74 fungal genomes were downloaded from the Fungal Genome Initiative at Broad Institute of Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].
