To find the integrated mechanisms of tolerance, we used ecotypes of the monocot model plant <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic> to screen for genetic material with contrasting submergence tolerance. For this purpose, we used a set of previously studied drought sensitive/tolerant ecotypes and the knowledge that drought tolerance is positively associated with submergence stress. We decided to contrast aerial tissue transcriptomes of the ecotype Bd21 14-day-old plants as sensitive and ecotype Bd2-3 as tolerant after 2 days of stress under a long-day photoperiod. Gene ontology and the grouping of transcripts indicated that tolerant Bd2-3 differentially down-regulated <italic>NITRATE REDUCTASE</italic> and <italic>ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE</italic> under stress and constitutively up-regulated <italic>HAEMOGLOBIN</italic>, when compared with the sensitive ecotype, Bd21. These results suggested the removal of nitric oxide, a gaseous phytohormone and concomitant reactive oxygen species as a relevant tolerance determinant. Other mechanisms more active in tolerant Bd2-3 were the pathogen response, glyoxylate and tricarboxylic acid cycle integration, and acetate metabolism. This data set could be employed to design further studies on the basic science of plant tolerance to submergence stress and its biotechnological application in the development of submergence-tolerant crops.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Plants are genetically prepared to cope with soil flooding, as this is a challenge commonly faced during their lifespan. Flooding can be divided into two general categories: waterlogging, when water only covers the roots, and submergence, when even aerial tissues are left underwater<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. In natural environments, flooding patterns have a strong influence on the type of species that colonize an area<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. In agricultural fields, flooding can cause crop yield reductions that mount up to billions of dollars of losses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> and can cause a descendent economic cycle that can lead to poverty and migration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.Whether a consequence of days-long torrential rain associated with a tropical hurricane, or an hour-long winter rain, flooding can: disrupt O<sub>2</sub> diffusion from the air to plant tissues, making O<sub>2</sub> available at subnormal concentrations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> (&#x0003c;21% w/w, hypoxia); increase pathogen accession to cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>; block natural light<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>; and, when the water recedes, can create oxidative stress during recovery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. The systematic study of plant responses to waterlogging, submergence, hypoxic and anoxic stress has identified that plants take action towards diminishing the deleterious effects of these drawbacks. These responses also have normal physiological roles during germination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, organ development (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), and crosstalk to other stresses, such as soil compaction, hydrocarbon pollution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, droughts, oxidative stresses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, the dark<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and pathogens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p><p>In plants, O<sub>2</sub> supply disruption is confronted with a quick and sophisticated transition from an aerobic to anaerobic fermentative metabolism that can be divided into three phases: sensing, setting and maintenance. Oxygen sensing is achieved through constitutively expressed transcription factors of the <italic>ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTORS</italic> group VII (<italic>ERF</italic>s-<italic>VII</italic>; reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), which possess a characteristic Met-Cys N-terminal domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> (domain CMVII-1). Under normoxic (21% O<sub>2</sub> w/w) conditions, ERFs-VII are substrates for the N-end rule enzymatic post-translational removal of Met<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and the concomitant oxidation of its second cysteine to cysteine sulfinic, or cysteine sulfonic acid by plant cysteine oxidases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> (PCO). This step occurs in the presence of O<sub>2</sub> and the gaseous phytohormone nitric oxide (NO) and constitutes a signal for proteasome degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Under hypoxic&#x02013;anoxic conditions, cysteine oxidation is no longer performed and ERFs-VII proteins are stabilized and directed to the cell nuclei, where they induce transcriptional activation, directed towards setting an effective fermentative metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. During this stage, a group of genes collectively known as the Hypoxia Core Genes (HCG) are induced; these include well-known fermentative enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC), alanine aminotransferase (AAT) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GDH). HCG help to avoid the over-reduction of the NAD<sup>+</sup> /NADH pool and maintain ATP synthesis through glycolysis and diverse fermentative routes at the expense of starch reserves<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. This transcriptional activation is complemented with a translatomic change that has, as a consequence, the preferential ribosome loading of hundreds of signalling transcripts under anoxic conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p><p>During maintenance of the anaerobic metabolism, different auto-regulatory loops modulate the intensity of the response, of which two examples have been characterized: one involving <italic>PCO</italic> and the other the <italic>HYPOXIA RESPONSE ATTENUATOR 1 (HRA1</italic>). PCO promotes ERFs-VII cysteine oxidation and protein targeting to proteasomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, while HRA1 inhibits ERFs-VII binding to DNA through direct protein&#x02013;protein interactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Both <italic>PCO</italic> and <italic>HRA1</italic> are direct transcriptional targets of ERFs-VII. At the maintenance stage, a second group of strongly hypoxia-inducible ERFs-VII takes on the role of sustaining the transcriptional expression of HCG after the initial response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. If starch reserves are sufficient to fuel anaerobic energy extraction and allow survival until the water recedes, during reoxygenation, the plant cell has to manage a strong reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst, and paradoxically, a dehydration stress. Both challenges are faced with the induction of oxide-reduction enzymes and ABA sensitization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Interestingly, at this stage, there is also another auto-regulatory loop that involves ERFs-VII, ABA and NO<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p><p>The increased possibility of susceptibility to pathogen attack during submergence is counteracted with the expression of WRKY transcription factors that mobilize a toolbox of genes allowing the plant to recognize and act on bacteria and fungi, such as leucine-rich repeat kinases (LRRK), receptor-like kinases (RLK), wall-associated kinases (WAK) and peroxidases (PER)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p><p>The management of low light accessibility is achieved through a set of molecular events leading to increased angle (hyponastic) repositioning of the leaves outside the water level, thus raising the possibility of sustaining photosynthetic activity under stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Recently, it has been shown that the gaseous hormone ethylene, which accumulates around submerged tissues, coordinates cell expansion and division to promote the hyponastic response through the inhibition of <italic>CYCLINA2;1</italic> expression (<italic>CYCA2</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p><p>In addition to these general mechanisms &#x02013; mostly discovered in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> &#x02013; plants that are native of flood-prone environments confront submergence with a set of physiological adaptations, such as aerenchymas, leaf gas films and focalized hyponastic responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. However, most wild and agricultural relevant plants do not show these adaptations or have not developed them effectively.</p><p>The grass family (<italic>Poaceae</italic>) is one of the most important sources of products that satisfy human nutritional needs; cultivars of four domesticated grasses, namely maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>; <italic>Panicoideae</italic>), wheat (<italic>Triticum ssp</italic>; <italic>Pooideae</italic>), sugarcane (<italic>Saccharum ssp</italic>.; <italic>Panicoideae</italic>) and rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>; <italic>Ehrhartoideae</italic>), provide &#x02248;50% of human caloric intake, with this proportion being even higher in developing countries<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. However, molecular characterization of the mechanisms for tolerance to submergence in the grasses is uneven: in rice, this endeavour has been sustained for decades<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, it has recently started in barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and maize<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> and only physiological characterization has been defined in wheat and sugarcane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.

We then performed a comparative RNAseq-based transcriptomic study of these contrasting ecotypes under control and submergence stress in the presence of long-day photoperiod (16&#x02009;h light/8&#x02009;h dark).

As Fukao <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> found that rice cultivars with enhanced submergence tolerance were also tolerant to drought stress; we decided to use this previous knowledge to select ecotypes that would display differential tolerance to submergence stress. We thus selected four ecotypes representing early or late flowering and high or low photosystem remnant activity under drought stress (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Submergence stress has been applied to plants in different formats; for example, continuous dark<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, continuous light<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>, a natural light cycle with midday harvesting<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> and an artificial light/dark cycle with multiple collecting times<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref> or single collecting times<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>.

Our aim was to characterize a submergence response that included active circadian cycle oscillations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> and the management of light-dependent oxidative stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p><p>All four selected <italic>Brachypodium</italic> ecotypes expressed a quiescent submergence response, since their plant tissue did not elongate after submergence stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Brachypodium</italic> displayed known stress affectations, such as leaf death and stunted growth, when compared to controls grown side-by-side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). This ecotype selection and format of submergence stress allowed the detection of contrasting tolerance material by both visual examination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>) and by median lethal time (LT<sub>50</sub>) quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>).

These data support the reports that drought and submergence stress share common tolerance mechanisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, since the ecotypes with most tolerant photosystems to drought stress (Bd1-1 and Tek10; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>) were also the most tolerant under submergence stress.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>Brachypodium</italic> ecotypes with contrasting tolerance to submergence and transcriptomic analysis</title><p>To find the transcripts, pathways and mechanisms differentially expressed in the submergence-susceptible and submergence-tolerant ecotypes of <italic>Brachypodium</italic>, we used a sequence-by-synthesis differential gene expression approach (RNA-Seq). As submergence-sensitive ecotype we choose Bd21 and as its tolerant counterpart, we decided to compare with the most developmentally similar ecotype Bd2-3. Although Bd1-1 and Tek10 were the most tolerant ecotypes, they have a more extended juvenile stage, up to 4-5 months to flowering transition when compared to Bd21<sup>46</sup>. Bd21 and Bd2-3 have a closer developmental program and temporality in their juvenile stages (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>); still, they have a contrasting submergence tolerance by both visual and quantitative parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>).

Based on the Zeitgeber Time (ZT0&#x02009;=&#x02009;start of daylight), we decided to collect at ZT13 (3&#x02009;h before the start of night). Our rationale was that this would allow us to incorporate in our data set diurnally oscillating transcripts that typically have low expression values<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref> and weak statistical significance at the more frequently used midday collection time, as previously shown for <italic>FT</italic> and <italic>CONSTANS (CO</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. We expect that these steps will increase the future usefulness of this data set to further characterize the importance of plants' diurnal cycle in the response to submergence stress.</p><p>The chosen intensity was 48&#x02009;h after imposing the stress, since our survival data and visual examination of stress symptoms indicated that this was the earliest point where the survival outcome was different between Bd21 and Bd2-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>); therefore, it would allow us to find mechanisms active in sustaining survival. As controls, we decided to use plants growing inside empty tanks located to the side of the submerged plants, thus removing any effects of light stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p>A total of 2.91&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>8</sup> reads were obtained, with 1.4&#x02013;3.1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>7</sup> individual library reads and &#x0003e;97% positive mapping to the <italic>Brachypodium</italic> genome v 2.1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>; GEO submission: GSE74222). To analyse the data, we selected an FDR of 5.0&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;05</sup> and a Log<sub>2</sub>FC value &#x0003e;1.5 or &#x0003c;&#x02212;1.5 for up- and down-regulated genes, respectively. There were 317 commonly up-regulated transcripts, 466 exclusively up-regulated in Bd2-3 and 706 exclusively up-regulated in Bd21. Regarding down-regulation, 330 transcripts were common, while 851 and 1026 were exclusive for Bd2-3 and Bd21, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). For abundance reference purposes, we looked for the most abundant up-regulated transcript in both ecotypes under submergence and it was Bradi4g44496, an unknown gene, with 8539&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;689 counts per million (CPM); while for the control samples, it was Bradi4g45010, which codes for the protein asparagine synthase 1, with 9819&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1866 CPM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p><p>With this information, we took three concomitant approaches to identify differentially expressed mechanisms. First, transcripts were classified into groups according to their differential expression among the two ecotypes (Bd21/Bd2-3), combining the three possible states of constitutively (Cons), up- or down-regulated; this resulted in eight groups (excluding constitutive&#x02013;constitutive; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). This strategy was verified by fuzzy K-mean clustering analysis obtaining similar results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Second, a gene ontology (GO; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>), an ortholog search (in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice) and PAGEMAN analysis of these transcript groups were performed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). Finally, a manual reconstruction of the known hypoxia pivotal biochemical routes was performed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1,2</xref>). As previously noted<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, a significant proportion of the transcriptome corresponded to unknown/unannotated transcripts; this varied from 142 transcripts in the group preferentially down-regulated in Bd21, up to 246 transcripts in the up-regulated group in Bd21.</p><p>To observe the functionality of expression grouping and to investigate if our transcriptomic data could be useful to find genes with diurnal oscillatory expression, we chose one transcript to represent each group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>) and performed a dusk-dawn expression kinetics at ZT13, ZT15, ZT22 and ZT2, immediately after imposing the submergence stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). <italic>ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE 1 (ADH1</italic>, Bradi4g22620; group Up&#x02013;Up), <italic>&#x003b1;-AMYLASE 1 (AMY1</italic>, Bradi3g58010; group Up&#x02013;Cons) and <italic>TRIACYLCLYCERLOL LIPASE LIKE 1 (TLL1,</italic> Bradi2g35450; group Down&#x02013;Cons) were selected.

As observed in the RNA-Seq data, <italic>TLL1</italic> was down-regulated under submergence stress in Bd21, but was constant and irresponsive in Bd2-3.

In the first subset, we found isoforms of organic acids modifying enzymes (e.g. phosphoenlolpyruvate decarboxylase, aldehyde reductase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase), p450 cytochromes and ACC oxidases; these may indicate a stronger constitutive ethylene synthesis in Bd2-3 than in Bd21. In the second subset, we found more transcripts for p450 uncharacterized cytochromes and all three <italic>Brachypodium NITRATE/NITRITE REDUCTASE</italic> (NR) annotated genes (Bradi3g37940, Bradi3g57680, Bradi3g57990). <italic>NRs</italic> were expressed more in the control Bd2-3 than in Bd21 (combined transcript abundances of 760&#x02013;913 and 90&#x02013;307 CPM, respectively) and were more strongly down-regulated in Bd2-3 than in Bd21 by submergence stress (31.9&#x02013;44.8 and 75.0&#x02013;82.6 CPM; Log<sub>2</sub>FC &#x02212;4.3 and &#x02212;1.2, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>).

Three <italic>HB</italic>-like annotated genes were found: two of them were statistically constitutive in both control and stress plants for both ecotypes (Bradi1g37100, 28.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1 CPM; and Bradi2g19690, 1.22&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.03 CPM) and a third transcript (Bradi1g69320, <italic>HB1</italic>), which was grouped with the Up&#x02013;Cons genes because of its very low expression in the controls of Bd21 (0.14&#x02013;0.19 CPM) and its constitutive expression in control Bd2-3 (26.2&#x02013;69.2 CPM).

We found five annotated <italic>NOR</italic> genes, two of them were up- or down-regulated, but accounted only for 3% of global <italic>NOR</italic> transcripts, while the others were not differentially expressed among the ecotypes or treatments.</p><p>We further measured <italic>HB1</italic> and <italic>AOX1</italic> expression by qPCR during the first 12&#x02009;h of stress. As indicated by RNA-Seq, Bd2-3 had a higher pre-stress <italic>HB1</italic> expression than Bd21. The difference was maintained until the early morning (ZT12), when its expression also increased in Bd21, probably indicating a normal ROS burst after the restart of illumination, as previously proposed by Lee <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.

This leaves the NO/HB-scavenging cycle as the most probable differential mechanism improving the ecotype tolerance in <italic>Brachypodium</italic> at the ERFs-VII protein level.</p><p>A manual and MEME-assisted analysis showed that this inducible/constitutive expression was correlated to a low/high domain diversity division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>), which could also be observed through phylogenetic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). Only Brad4g31040 &#x02013; i.e. groups with constitutive ERFs &#x02013; was still responsive to submergence stress, though not to the extent of inducible ERFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>).

The analysis of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ERFs-VII transcripts in the DIURNAL transcriptomic database showed that <italic>RAP2.3</italic>, previously considered as a constitutive ERF, is actually highly responsive to the length of the day and has an expression peak at the end of the night. <italic>RAP2.2</italic> is less responsive, but still has an observable oscillation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>). In <italic>Brachypodium</italic>, we found that Bradi1g72450 was responsive to both submergence and night; interestingly, it was not the gene sharing the most domain types with RAP2.3 (being Bradi2g27920).</p><p>This ERFs-VII toolbox seems to be a common feature of all the plants analysed so far, both mono- and dicotyledonous<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>. Even though <italic>Brachypodium</italic> is not a plant characteristic of semi-aquatic habitats, small grasses can be subjected to natural submergence stress in the wild (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Hypoxic stress responses are not only of importance for plant development but are also relevant during submergence stress and for the development of plant varieties tolerant to its negative effects. In this research, we aimed to discover physiologically relevant molecular mechanisms, by comparing the transcriptome of genetic materials with contrasting survival traits under submergence stress. By characterizing submergence-tolerant and submergence-sensitive ecotypes of the wild model grass <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic>, we found ROS management to be an important characteristic of the tolerant ecotype. This was most likely achieved through an integrated response involving constitutively expressed, induced and down-regulated mechanisms, such as the NO/<italic>HB</italic> cycle, general antioxidant responses and NR transcript expression, respectively. Transcripts involved in other mechanisms of increased complexity were also differentially expressed, for example transcripts of unknown function, signalling phosphorylation cascades (probably involved in the pathogen response) and the integration of the glyoxylate and TCA cycles. We expect that this information could be used to help design further experimentation aimed at expanding our current knowledge of physiological responses, with relevance for plant breeding programmes of submergence-tolerant crop cultivars.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Brachypodium ecotypes</title><p>Seeds of <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic> ecotypes Bd21, Bd2-3, Bd-1-1 and Tek10 were obtained from Professor David Garvin at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).
