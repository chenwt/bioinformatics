Our current knowledge of TEs in laboratory mouse strains is limited primarily to those present in the C57BL/6J reference genome, with most mouse TEs being drawn from three distinct classes, namely short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) and the endogenous retrovirus (ERV) superfamily. Despite their high prevalence, the different genomic and gene properties controlling whether TEs are preferentially purged from, or are retained by, genetic drift or positive selection in mammalian genomes remain poorly defined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using whole genome sequencing data from 13 classical laboratory and 4 wild-derived mouse inbred strains, we developed a comprehensive catalogue of 103,798 polymorphic TE variants. We employ this extensive data set to characterize TE variants across the <italic>Mus </italic>lineage, and to infer neutral and selective processes that have acted over 2 million years. Our results indicate that the majority of TE variants are introduced though the male germline and that only a minority of TE variants exert detectable changes in gene expression. However, among genes with differential expression across the strains there are twice as many TE variants identified as being putative causal variants as expected.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Most TE variants that cause gene expression changes appear to be purged rapidly by purifying selection. Our findings demonstrate that past TE insertions have often been highly deleterious, and help to prioritize TE variants according to their likely contribution to gene expression or phenotype variation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Transposable elements (TEs) have been highly influential in shaping the structure and evolution of mammalian genomes, as exemplified by TE-derived sequence contributing between 38 and 69% of genomic sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. TE insertions also can influence the transcription, translation or function of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Functional effects of TE insertions include their regulation of transcription by acting as alternative promoters or as enhancer elements and via the generation of antisense transcripts, or of transcriptional silencers. TEs can alter splice sites or RNA editing, provide alternative poly-adenylation signals or exons, modify chromatin structure or alter translation. Furthermore, TE insertion has been suggested to be a mechanism by which new co-regulatory networks arise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>TEs are classified on the basis of their transposition mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. A class I retrotransposon propagates in the host genome through an intermediate RNA step, requiring a reverse transcriptase to revert it to DNA before insertion into the genome. Class II DNA transposons do not have an RNA intermediate, and translocate with the aid of transposases and DNA polymerase. The overwhelming majority, over 96%, of TEs in the mouse genome are of the retrotransposon type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These are further classified into three distinct classes: short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) and the endogenous retrovirus (ERV) superfamily. The ERVs are ancient remnants of exogenous virus infections, consisting of internal sequence that encodes viral genes that are flanked by long terminal repeats (LTRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>TEs provide a potential source of variants that are detrimental to host viability and that promote disease. For example, an allele of the <italic>agouti </italic>locus in mouse contains an intra-cisternal A particle (IAP) retrotransposon upstream of the promoter that causes ectopic expression of the agouti protein leading to variation in fur color, obesity, diabetes and tumor susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-like family of ERVs is a potent source of mutagenesis. The first MuLV element insertion was observed to result in hairless and pleiotropic phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. That TEs are frequently detrimental can also be inferred from the strong bias in orientation of TEs found in introns of genes. Human intronic ERVs and LINEs, but not SINEs, show a tendency to disrupt expression when inserted into introns in the gene's transcriptional sense orientation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In mice there are over 50 examples of phenotypes attributed to spontaneous insertional mutagenesis by ERVs, with one class of functional variants, early transposon (ETn), showing a strong bias to be in the sense transcriptional orientation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This orientation bias is attributed to cryptic splice acceptor usage and/or inefficient read-through of the ERV LTR, which contains its own regulatory signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>TEs that are present in the C57BL/6J reference genome assembly exhibit this orientation bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], which indicates that TE insertions have often been deleterious over tens of millions of years of rodent evolution. By contrast, our knowledge of the intronic distribution and the structure of TE variants (TEVs) inserted during the recent <italic>Mus </italic>lineage has been largely derived from targeted approaches. Previous studies examined two ERV families in eight strains (IAP or ETn/MusD elements in C57BL/6J, A/J, DBA/2J, SPRET/EiJ, CAST/EiJ, MOLF/EiJ, WSB/EiJ and 129X1/SvJ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], with one study in particular focusing on intronic insertions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and another exploring LINE variation in four strains (129S1, 129X1, A/J and DBA/2J) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Such TEVs may exhibit a reduced orientation bias because weakly detrimental TEVs that have been inserted, in the sense orientation, during recent evolution may not have had sufficient numbers of generations to be effectively purged from the population. In addition, deleterious TEVs present in laboratory mice might have been maintained owing to their artificial inbreeding. It is thus plausible that TEVs contribute substantially to the genetic load and gene expression variation among inbred and wild mice.</p><p>We previously reported the generation and analysis of over a terabase of raw sequence from the genomes of 17 mouse strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and the structural variations called between these strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In this study we present extensive analyses of a set of TEVs that were subsequently derived from these sequence reads using an updated pipeline that was specifically designed to counter the difficulties inherent in identifying transposition events. We also present this new genome-wide catalogue of ERV, LINE, and SINE TEVs with deep TE subfamily, structural and orientation classifications across 18 (17 newly sequenced plus 1 reference) mouse strains.</p><p>This mouse genome project examined 13 classical laboratory (129P2/OlaHsd, 129S1/SvImJ, 129S5/SvEvBrd, A/J, AKR/J, BALB/cJ, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6NJ, CBA/J, DBA/2J, LP/J, NOD/ShiLtJ and NZO/HiLtJ) and 4 wild-derived mouse inbred strains (CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, WSB/EiJ and SPRET/EiJ), and each was compared to the C57BL/6J reference sequence. Altogether, this group encompasses approximately 2 million years (My) of evolutionary divergence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Concomitantly, RNA-Seq data were generated from whole brain tissue from 14 of the 17 mouse strains, thereby allowing us to consider the impact of genotypic differences on gene expression levels.</p><p>By taking advantage of these new data we provide a comprehensive analysis of the patterns of variation of all three TE classes across the <italic>Mus </italic>genus, and use these data to examine the extent to which genomic location influences the retention or purifying selection of TEVs among a large number of mouse strains. We first show variable ERV, LINE and SINE variant densities across the 18 mouse genomes, within chromosomal, intergenic and genic locations, and for different gene classes, and then account for these variable densities by invoking processes of neutral evolution and purifying or positive selection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Genome landscape of recently inserted TEVs</title><p>We computationally predicted 103,798 TEVs (28,951 SINEs, 40,074 LINEs and 34,773 ERVs) among the 17 sequenced mouse strains in addition to the C57BL/6J reference strain; 6 of these have previously been examined in some respects (129S1/SvImJ, A/J, DBA/2J, CAST/EiJ, WSB/EiJ and SPRET/EiJ), whereas others have, to our knowledge, not been systematically examined for TEVs (129P2/OlaHsd, 129S5/SvEvBrd, AKR/J, BALB/cJ, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6NJ, CBA/J, LP/J, NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/HiLtJ and PWK/PhJ) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). This number of TEVs is over four times higher than for all previous studies combined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We employed two approaches for TEV discovery, SVMerge, which combines the results of four methods of structural variant prediction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and RetroSeq (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). After filtering (Materials and methods), SVMerge predicted 44,401 non-redundant insertions within the lineage of the C57BL/6J reference strain, whereas the RetroSeq method inferred 59,397 TEV insertions occurring outside of this lineage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). We refer to these insertions, in the reference strain lineage and outside the reference lineage, as B6<sup>+ </sup>and B6<sup>- </sup>TEVs, respectively (B6<sup>+</sup>, TE present in C57BL/6J; B6<sup>-</sup>, not present in C57BL/6J). By further classifying TEVs according to type and class, we determined that virtually all mouse strain TEVs are drawn from subfamilies that were previously observed to be active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Each strain has approximately equal numbers of B6<sup>+ </sup>and B6<sup>- </sup>variants, as one might expect if TEVs accumulated at similar rates. There are higher numbers of TEVs relative to C57BL/6J in the wild-derived strains (SPRET/EiJ, PWK/PhJ and CAST/EiJ; 13.8 to 22.4 per Mb) than in the laboratory strains (4.2 to 6.3 per Mb; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). By examining the strain distribution patterns derived from 688 PCR validation of TEVs across 8 strains, we find relatively low false positive rates (11 to 22%); furthermore, by conservatively assuming the genomes of the three 129-derived substrains (129S1/SvImJ, 129P2/OlaHsd and 129S5/SvEvBrd) to be identical, we estimated false negative rates to be 5 to 28% across the classes (Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>). Given the available read length, insert size and coverage, there were limits to the degree to which subfamilies of TEVs could be reliably stratified. Differences in our ability to distinguish TEV subfamilies are attributable to contrasting sequence divergence in their first and last 300 bp. SINE subfamilies could not be distinguished, LINEs were classified as either full-length LINEs or LINE fragments, and ERVs were placed into subfamilies VL30, RLTR45, RLTR1B, RLTR10, MuLV, MaLR, IS2, IAP and ETn. However, the range of classes and families we investigated, to our knowledge, represents the broadest study of TEVs in the <italic>Mus </italic>lineage to date.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Distribution of TEVs across a phylogeny representing a primary subspecies history of 18 mouse strains</bold>. <bold>(a) </bold>This phylogeny (left), which averages across these strains' known phylogenetic discordances, was imputed by considering TEVs to be discrete morphologies. All nodes were supported by bootstrap values of 100%. Numbers of B6<sup>+ </sup>and B6<sup>- </sup>TEV insertions are shown (right), within and without the C57BL/6J lineage, respectively. Unless we have evidence for the contrary, we assume that a strain's genome is identical to that of C57BL/6J. Green and yellow bars represent numbers of TEV insertions in the C57BL/6J lineage (B6<sup>+</sup>; green) and insertions outside of this lineage (B6<sup>-</sup>; yellow), respectively. The large number of TEVs in SPRET/EiJ (bottom) indicates that these are most often absent in C57BL/6J (and other lab-based strains), rather than indicating that there is a larger number of TEs in SPRET/EiJ. <bold>(b, d) </bold>Proportions of TEV classes (ERVs, LINEs and SINEs) across the inferred phylogeny for C57BL/6J (b) and C3H/HeJ (d) lineages.

Numbers of predicted insertions are given below.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gb-2012-13-6-r45-1"/></fig><p>In order to interpret this vast catalog, we placed the TE insertions within a primary phylogeny of these mouse strains, which permitted an initial overview of the relative expansions of all the TE families over an approximate 2 My time period (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). This primary phylogeny matched the phylogeny expected from the heritage of the mouse strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. This analysis revealed the historic expansion of ERV families, most notably IAPs, in laboratory strains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b-e</xref>). ERVs were seen to contribute between 29 and 39% of all TEVs in the sequenced strains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b-e</xref>).</p><p>Different ERV families contribute, in sequence length, to greatly differing extents to the mouse genome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). The relative proportions of polymorphic, and apparently fixed ERVs, also vary considerably among these families (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>), in part reflecting the ages of past exogenous viral infections. The MuLV family, for example, arose recently and thus is found in a smaller number of copies that together show a higher fraction of variable elements (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a, b</xref>). ERVs are prone to recombination between their flanking LTR sequences. To estimate this recombination rate in different ERV families, we mapped TEVs to the inferred mouse strain primary phylogeny and observed increasing proportions of solo LTR elements with increasing phylogenetic divergence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). We estimate the average half-life for ERV recombination from provirus to solo-LTR to be approximately 0.8 My (assuming a constant rate and that all ERVs insert as proviruses; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c, d</xref>; Materials and methods). IAP elements recombine particularly rapidly, with a half-life we estimate to be approximately 0.7 My years (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c, d</xref>; Materials and methods). This is similar to a previous estimate derived from a single MuLV element within the <italic>dilute </italic>locus of DBA/2J mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. By contrast, the older family of ETn elements appear to be associated with a much slower rate of recombination. The differences in recombination rate may, in part, reflect variations in LTR lengths among different ERV families.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Structure and activities of ERV families</bold>. <bold>(a) </bold>Numbers of bases within nine ERV families present in the C57BL/6J reference genome. <bold>(b) </bold>Proportions of C57BL/6J bases belonging to each ERV TEV family relative to apparently fixed ERV sequence.

LINE TEVs show a bias for being located in A+T-rich sequence, whilst SINE TEVs tend to reside in G+C-rich sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. We also observed ERV TEVs to be more heterogeneous than SINEs or LINEs in their G+C bias, with MuLV TEVs being as enriched in high G+C sequence as SINEs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). In subsequent analyses we determined the extent and significance of enrichments and depletions by implementing a genome-wide association procedure that accounted for three potentially confounding effects, namely the different rates of TE insertion across (a) the G+C content spectrum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>), (b) different chromosomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>), and (c) sequence of varying length (Materials and methods) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Genome-wide nucleotide composition and chromosome biases for TEV density</bold>. <bold>(a) </bold>Cumulative distributions of TEV families according to their genomic GC context. SINE TEVs tend to occur in GC-rich sequence while LINE and ERV TEVs each show an AT preference, with the notable exception of the MuLV family, which is biased towards GC. TEVs showed no differences in these biases compared to all TEs in the reference genome assembly. <bold>(b) </bold>Chromosome biases in the densities of TEVs (x-axis) and apparently fixed TEs (y-axis). Each axis represents the observed density divided by the density expected from genome-wide random samples of sequence approximately matched according to G+C content (Materials and methods). Significant density deviations from the null expectation are indicated by color for TEVs or fixed TEs (yellow) or both (red). The spread in observed densities across chromosomes is greater for TEVs compared with the older, apparently fixed, TEs. There is a general tendency for chromosomes that exhibit elevated (decreased) TE densities to also exhibit increased (lower) densities of TEVs (excluding chromosome X: SINE R<sup>2 </sup>= 0.6756, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-4</sup>; LINE R<sup>2 </sup>= 0.0054, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.7; ERV R<sup>2 </sup>= 0.3836, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0047). The quadrants shaded grey match this correlation in ratios between TEVs and fixed TEs. Nevertheless, this trend does not explain the higher than expected density of TEVs on the X chromosome when compared with its lower than expected TE density. All chromosomal TE density points that fall within the orange shaded area show signals of positive selection according to the McDonald-Kreitman test (FDR 0.1%).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gb-2012-13-6-r45-3"/></fig><p>We find that apparently fixed TEs (SINEs, LINEs or ERVs) occur at relatively even densities across individual chromosomes having accounted for G+C content (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>, y-axis). An exception to this are SINEs on chromosome 11, which is unusual in at least two respects, namely its elevated replication rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and gene density. Nevertheless, when we took account of these factors in this analysis, the strong enrichment of SINEs remained essentially unchanged (data not shown; Materials and methods). The second notable exception are LINEs on the X chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], whose higher density has been attributed to increased rates of LINE insertions in both male and female germlines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, by contrast to monomorphic TEs, polymorphic TEVs are more unevenly distributed among the chromosomes (having accounted for G+C content) with, for example, chromosome 19 exhibiting a significant surfeit of SINEs and the X chromosome showing a strong deficit of all three TEV classes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>, x-axis). The depletion of polymorphic LINEs on the X chromosome was previously seen in a study of four mouse strains (A/J, DBA/2J, 129S1/SvImJ and 129X1/SvJ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. These G+C-accounted TEV biases on autosomes (A) and on the X-chromosome allowed us to calculate the male TEV insertion bias: &#x003b1; = (3(X/A) - 4)/(2 - 3(X/A)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. We obtain &#x003b1; values of 7.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.7 to 13.2), 7.3 (95% CI 5.5 to 11.9) and 151.8 (95% CI 18.5 to &#x0221e;) for ERV, LINE and SINE TEVs, respectively. These estimates of male TEV insertion bias are 3- to 68-fold higher than estimates based on substitution rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and imply that TE insertions occur almost exclusively in the male germline genome. By adapting the McDonald-Kreitman test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] (Materials and methods), we considered whether the ratio of fixed to polymorphic TEs is indicative of the past action of positive selection on TEVs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). Our results corroborate previous proposals of positive selection on LINE TEVs on the X chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-16</sup>). Our study, however, has the advantage of using genome-wide observations of fixed and polymorphic TEs.

Using our genome-wide association procedure, we tested for the over- or under-representation of TEVs across the genome within introns, or 5 kb flanking sequences of protein coding genes, or within the remaining intergenic sequence. No significant differences were found in the densities of SINE, LINE or ERV TEVs between first, middle or last introns (data not shown).

If TE insertions are random, and are not frequently deleterious, or if they are only mildly deleterious, then we would expect to observe no bias (orientation bias &#x02248; 50%). Instead, a strong orientation bias was evident for each of the three TE classes (32.6%, 41.7%, and 41.6% for ERV, LINE and SINE TEVs, respectively). The orientation bias for IAP TEVs was recently reported to be 25.9% for a redundant set of 3,317 intronic IAPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This is lower than our non-redundant set of 2,418 intronic IAP TEVs (orientation bias = 30.9%). The strong biases for ERVs and, to a lesser extent for LINEs, are consistent with these elements being depleted from introns (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). The orientation bias for SINE TEVs indicates that despite their enrichment in introns (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>), which is assumed to reflect a mutational bias, they are strongly depleted when inserted in the transcriptional sense orientation.

By contrast, these enrichments were reduced in sequence lying outside of these refined intervals but remaining within their overarching QTLs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a</xref>, Non-merge QTLs). These results provide evidence that TEVs contribute, to a limited extent, to at least some of the approximately 100 quantitative traits under consideration.

However, since many ERV insertion effects are often local, primarily affecting levels of a nearby exon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], and/or are cell type-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], these and likely other novel TEV <italic>cis </italic>effects on gene expression did not survive the stringent multiple testing correction required for genome-wide analysis.</p><p>We next considered whether TEVs, when considered together, were often causal variants of gene expression changes or quantitative traits. We compared expression levels among strains, acquired from RNA-Seq experiments of whole brain samples, for genes with or without an intronic TEV. Ascribing a gene expression difference to a specific TEV is confounded by the presence of other linked variants that may, instead, be causal. To account for this and to identify a conservative set of TEVs associated with gene expression differences, we calculated in each strain the expression for the constitutively expressed sequence and then normalized these mapped read levels between samples to allow for their comparison. By considering the presence or absence of a TEV as an experimental condition, differential expression of genes was calculated (Materials and methods). In a previous publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], we estimated that the proportion of expression heritability attributable to TEVs is no more than 10% across all genes. Despite this, we identified 28 of 48 differentially expressed genes having one or more TEVs (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>). TEVs were thus found two-fold more frequently associated with differential expression of genes into which they have been inserted than expected by chance (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01). We found no significant bias for the direction of expression change between strains associated with these TEVs. This finding then allowed us to investigate whether a specific TEV class contributes greatly to these gene expression differences. We would expect that when we account for the different TEV densities in genes, ERV, LINEs and SINEs would be equally likely to be associated with differential gene expression. However, we found ten-fold fewer LINEs and LINE fragments associated with differential gene expression than expected (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01). This implies that LINE insertions that cause changes in gene expression are substantially more likely to be purged by purifying selection than are ERV and SINE TEVs.</p><p>A recent publication showed that species-specific CTCF binding sites frequently occur in TEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. To examine if variation in gene expression could be associated with the presence or absence of such CTCF-associated TEVs, we intersected the B6<sup>+ </sup>TEVs with these CTCF binding site region predictions. We observed an increased expression variation between genes that flank a CTCF-binding TEV. The likelihood for this change was smaller than that obtained for the expression variance increase for 10,000 random samples (that is, empirical <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-4</sup>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7b</xref>).

We found that, similarly to fixed TEs, LINE TEVs show a location preference for A+T-rich sequence, whilst SINE TEVs tend to reside in G+C-rich sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). As was noted previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], these opposing tendencies are perplexing since LINEs and SINEs insert using the same endonuclease. One possible resolution to this puzzle is suggested by 'older' SINEs showing G+C distributions that differ from those for more recently inserted SINEs, perhaps because SINEs in A+T-rich sequence are more readily deleted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. If so, then we would expect G+C distributions for recent TEV insertions to differ from those for all TE insertions. Indeed, it has been proposed that observed genomic distributions will differ substantially from the original insertion site preferences, owing to a combination of selection and genetic drift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, we see no evidence of ongoing selection on SINE G+C bias, implying either that the selection is relatively rapid or that there is an unobserved bias at work.</p><p>MuLV TEVs show a higher G+C base composition preference compared to other ERV TEVs. As a consequence, MuLV elements are more likely to be inserted in sequence that is rich in functional elements, and thus may have a greater propensity for modifying gene expression levels.

We propose that the vast majority of all TE insertions in the <italic>Mus </italic>lineage have occurred in the male germline genome. While the degree of inter-chromosomal variation is decreased for apparently fixed ERV and SINE TEs in the genome, monomorphic LINE TEs are enriched on the X chromosome. We can conceive no alternative model other than strong positive selection for this apparent higher rate of fixation in excess of the rate of mutation.</p></sec><sec><title>Purifying selection on intronic TEVs</title><p>Variation in TEV densities in intergenic and genic regions compared with expected values indicate ongoing selective processes acting on TEVs. The significant deficits of ERV or LINE TEVs in introns indicate that many were deleterious and thus were selectively purged over these strains' evolutionary history. These observations agree with previous findings that LINE TE insertions are less well tolerated within gene-rich sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. While LINE and ERV TEVs are strongly depleted in genes associated with housekeeping functions, SINEs are enriched in such genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). <italic>De novo </italic>intronic insertion variants of LINEs or ERVs but not SINEs are thus likely to often dysregulate such genes. Interestingly, it is exactly these classes of genes whose regulation depends on TE-derived sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. The enrichment of SINE TEVs, in contrast to the depletions of ERV and LINE TEVs, is consistent with a previous proposal that SINEs preferentially insert within genes that are expressed in the germ line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], and is in agreement with the increased density of SINE TEVs in the vicinity of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. While all TEV classes are depleted in the immediate proximity of genes and splice donor and acceptor sites, SINEs are enriched within 10 kb of genes and have shorter exclusion zones near to functional sequence compared to ERV and LINE TEVs.</p><p>If it is assumed that TEVs that are inserted in the antisense orientation are not under selection, then orientation bias values imply that approximately 50% of all ERVs that inserted in the sense orientation into the introns of protein coding genes have been deleterious, as have been about one-third of LINE or SINE sense insertions. We might expect TEV orientation biases to be different between genes annotated with GO terms found either to be enriched or to be depleted in TEVs. However, no such differences were detected, which implies that antisense orientated TEVs may also commonly be deleterious (perhaps by affecting the expression of antisense transcripts), and that the ratio of sense-to-antisense deleterious TEVs is relatively constant among genes from different functional classes.</p><p>The observed orientation biases do not appear to be attributable to non-selective mutational or repair mechanisms. This is because we observe differences in orientation bias values for SINE and ERV TEVs depending on intron position in a gene, which in turn make less likely alternative models that explain orientation bias as being due solely to a mutational preference for TE preservation in the antisense strand, perhaps as a consequence of transcription-coupled repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><p>No substantial differences in orientation bias values between fixed and variant ERVs were observed. This implies that deleterious sense inserted ERV TEVs are not commonly segregating among these mice; rather, they have most often been purged very rapidly from the mouse population. Orientation bias was significantly and substantially stronger for apparently fixed LINE TEs than for recently inserted LINE TEVs, implying once more that purifying selection on sense inserted LINE TEVs tends to be less strong than on ERVs.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of TEVs on gene expression and quantitative traits</title><p>Regions annotated with refined QTLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] are significantly enriched in LINE and SINE TEVs. This is evidence that TEVs contribute, albeit rarely, to at least some of the approximately hundred traits that were considered. Many of these effects are likely to act either on exons flanking the TEV site, or on downstream elements, as has been observed for many known <italic>de novo </italic>ERV insertions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Although a small number of TEVs (132) were annotated as being in coding exons, due to breakpoint uncertainty some of these will instead be intronic. None of our ERV, LINE or SINE TEV sets was significantly associated with global expression level change measured using an RNA-Seq experiment of whole brain samples. This suggests that TEVs that survive purifying selection are only rarely associated with gene expression changes. Although <italic>de novo </italic>TE insertions frequently cause disruptions in genes' expression, such deleterious variants appear to be often purged by strong purifying selection and the genomic contribution of the remaining TEs to global gene expression variation thus appears minimal.</p><p>Clearly a subset of TEVs will affect the expression of their resident genes and their functions. Indeed, using a stringent statistical re-sampling approach to take into account confounding influences of strain and expression divergence, we found that TEVs are twice as likely to reside in a differentially expressed gene as expected by chance. Thus, among all genes that exhibit expression differences between strains, TEVs contribute more than expected by chance. Only 34 TEVs passed a stringent genome-wide test, and these TEVs contain significantly fewer LINEs than the null expectation that all TEV classes have equal effects. While it has been extensively documented in the literature that <italic>de novo </italic>LINE insertions can cause changes in gene expression, it appears that, in <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, purifying selection has preferentially purged such variants.</p><p>However, given that the proportion of expression heritability attributable to TEVs generally is no more than 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], many of the significant expression changes tabulated in Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">10</xref> will not be due specifically to the TEV but rather, for example, to co-segregating variants. Nevertheless, these data, together with evidence that the insertion and selection on TE insertions vary considerably according to class, transcriptional orientation, inter- or intragenic location, and gene functional category should now assist in distinguishing the minority of TEVs with a profound negative effect on organismal fitness from the majority of TEVs with little to no effect on fitness. There are a host of possible phenotypic consequences of TEVs outside the ones tested here, such as premature transcriptional termination at a distance triggered by ERVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It is also likely that some TEVs have phenotypic effects that are restricted to specific tissues and/or developmental time points. Although determining the full extent of such effects is beyond the remit of this paper, the extensive catalogue of TEVs that we have presented provides a valuable resource that should greatly facilitate such studies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We present a near complete catalogue of TE variation across 18 mouse strains, encompassing 2 My of divergence within the <italic>Mus </italic>lineage. We recaptured previously reported variation in the relative activities of different mouse TE families and also report evidence that the vast majority of TE activity has occurred in the paternal germ line. Strong signals of purifying selection are evident with respect to TE family, genomic location, orientation and functional category of encompassing genes. Most TEVs that are not purged by rapid and strong negative selection appear to have little, or no, effect on organismal fitness. Nevertheless, we found that a small fraction of TEVs are associated with relatively large effects on gene expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Sequencing data</title><p>Raw sequencing data were generated from 13 classical laboratory (129P2/OlaHsd, 129S1/SvImJ, 129S5/SvEvBrd, A/J, AKR/J, BALB/cJ, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6NJ, CBA/J, DBA/2J, LP/J, NOD/ShiLtJ and NZO/HiLtJ) and 4 wild-derived (CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, WSB/EiJ and SPRET/EiJ) mouse inbred strains as part of the Mouse Genomes Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].

In this study, we classify TEs into DNA elements, SINEs, LINEs and ERVs. ERVs have been further classified into the following families: IAP, ETn, MuLV, VL30, MaLR, RLTR10, IS2, RLTR45 and RLTR1B. A complete listing of RepBase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] classifications and conventional ERV super-classes corresponding to these families is provided in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>B6<sup>+ </sup>calling algorithms</title><p>Structural variant (SV) deletions in all inbred strains were detected using three methods: split-read mapping (Pindel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]), mate-pair analysis (BreakDancer, release-0.0.1r61 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]), and read-depth (CND [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]). Following merger of these calls into a non-redundant set, computational validation by local assembly and breakpoint refinement was performed. Details of the complete pipeline, SVMerge, are described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>SV calls were intersected with the RepeatMasker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] track of mm9 downloaded from UCSC on 20 July 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. SVs were then classified as B6<sup>+ </sup>TEV based on the following criteria: they must contain TE sequence as annotated by RepeatMasker, must be a deletion with respect to the C57BL6/J reference assembly and sequence annotated as TE needed to be within 50 bp of the SV breakpoints. TEVs were then further classified into superfamilies and TE structure types: LINE, fragment of a LINE, SINE, DNA transposon, LTR bound element or as more 'complex'. The LTR bound elements were further subdivided based on structure: solo-LTR (containing only a single LTR), LTR-int (the deleted sequence if comparing a provirus element to a solo-LTR), provirus (an intact ERV with two LTRs and internal sequence), pseudoelement (ERV with partial LTR on either end and/or poly-A tail), hybrid provirus (multiple RepeatMasker subfamily annotations within one repeat) or hybrid pseudoelement. A flowchart of the classification criteria can be found in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S11">11</xref>.</p><p>Of 145,429 SVs that are absent from the C57BL/6J assembly, 11% did not appear to contain TE sequence, 21.2% TE sequences did not coincide with the SV breakpoints and 33.4% were denoted as being complex, meaning that they contained either simple repeats or multiple events of TE insertion. The categories DNA transposons (<italic>n </italic>= 283), LTR-int (<italic>n </italic>= 317), pseudoelement (<italic>n </italic>= 12), hybrid pseudoelement (<italic>n </italic>= 36) and complex (<italic>n </italic>= 48,521) were subsequently disregarded in further analyses. The remainder were classified into the TE repeat families corresponding to the probes used in the B6<sup>- </sup>calls (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Although most TE families were classified based on their RepeatMasker annotations, LINE elements were classified as LINE fragments (hereafter referred to as LINE_frag) if the length of the element was less than 5 kb. The minimum cutoff was determined by the local minima between the frequency distribution curves of small fragments and the predominance of LINEs of lengths near the 6.4 kb canonical sizes (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>B6<sup>- </sup>calling algorithms</title><p>TE insertions that were present in any strain but absent from the C57BL/6J mm9 reference sequence (denoted as B6<sup>- </sup>calls) were identified using RetroSeq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. RetroSeq seeks inconsistently mapped read pairs where one end is mapped confidently (referred to as anchor reads) but the other end is either not mapped to the reference or mapped to a distant location on the reference with low mapping quality. The non-mapping or distantly mapped mates are then aligned to the ERV probes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). RetroSeq requires the anchoring read to have a minimum mapping quality of 30 and at least 10 independent read pairs to support a call. Alignments to Repbase were performed with SSAHA2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>] with a minimum of 80% identity and hit length of 36 bp. RetroSeq clusters the supporting read anchors to produce variant calls to approximately 1 to 2 kb resolution. The initial seed call windows were subject to further checking as follows. To identify the putative breakpoints, we scanned the region for positions with coverage fewer than ten reads and positions with low coverage mismatches (false alignments at the breakpoints can appear as false SNPs). For each putative breakpoint, we checked the ratio of forward/reverse orientated anchor reads at either side of the breakpoint. For the breakpoint to be accepted, we required at least 10 forward orientated anchors within 450 bp upstream and 10 reverse orientated anchors within 450 bp downstream. We also required that the ratio of forward-to-reverse anchors in the 450 bp upstream and 450 bp downstream to be less than 2-to-1. Furthermore, we required the distance from the final forward orientated upstream anchor to the first reverse orientated downstream anchor to be less than 120 bp. We then removed any calls that occurred within 50 bp of a region annotated by Repeatmasker as a 'simple_repeat' or 'low_complexity' or a SINE, LINE or ERV element in the mm9 reference.</p><p>Due to the differences in sequencing depth across the strains, it was necessary to carry out a computational genotyping step in order to correct for false negatives in the strains with lower sequencing coverage. For each TEV call and each strain that the call was not made in, we examined the reads 300 bp upstream and downstream and counted the number of putative anchor reads. If there were at least five forward orientated anchor reads upstream and five reverse orientated anchor reads downstream, then we called the TEV as being present in the strain.</p></sec><sec><title>B6<sup>- </sup>orientation</title><p>To determine the sense or antisense orientation of the B6<sup>- </sup>elements, we carried out local <italic>de novo </italic>assembly with Velvet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>] of the reads that mapped within 600 bp upstream and downstream (including their mates) of the putative breakpoint. We realigned the contigs to the reference with SSAHA2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>] and detected contigs that align incompletely at the breakpoints.

For each B6<sup>- </sup>TEV in the above strains, if there were more than two read pairs spanning the insertion breakpoint, then we estimated the size of the element to be &#x0003e; 3 kb. This information was used to assign an approximate size status to the LINE and ERV calls. To validate this approach, we observed that almost all (&#x0003e; 95%) SINE calls were spanned (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>B6<sup>+ </sup>validation</title><p>An estimate of 2.6% was made for the false positive rate in the B6<sup>+ </sup>calls from the percentage of TEVs from families considered to be inactive in the mouse lineage.

Therefore, we counted the number of TEVs where there was a call made in two out of the three 129-derived substrains and assumed the missing call to be a false negative. For B6<sup>+ </sup>calls, we obtained false negative estimates of 13.3%, 14.4%, and 9.5% for SINE, LINE, and ERV classes, respectively (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>B6<sup>- </sup>validation</title><p>To measure the false positive rates of the B6<sup>- </sup>TEV calls, we performed 53, 34 and 47 random PCRs across SINE, LINE, and ERV superfamilies, respectively. Primers were designed using Primer3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>] and purchased from MWG (Ebersberg, Germany). For each insertion call, several independent PCR reactions were carried out, including two reactions with Hotstar Taq (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and a reaction with LongRange PCR Kit (Qiagen). Reactions were performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. PCR gel images were then taken to assess the performance of the PCR reaction (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>).

All sequencing reactions were run out on an ABI3700 sequencer and assembled using PHRED/PHRAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Consed was used for editing and visualization of the assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. Strains with and without the insertion were aligned in one single contig.

Read counts from strains with the TEV and strains without the TEV were randomly sampled and compiled into tables representing four measures (two strains each with two replicates) of expression for each gene in strains with the TEV and four for the strains without the TEV. For each gene sampled, a corresponding set was generated from genes that are without TEVs in any strain. The resulting tables were analyzed using the DESeq R package to test for differential expression between RNAseq data sets. A Benjamini-Hochberg FDR of 10% was used as a cutoff for each of 100 resampling tests.

To treat B6<sup>+ </sup>and B6<sup>- </sup>TEVs equivalently with respect to placing them on the reference genome (in which B6<sup>+ </sup>TEVs have an identifiable length whereas B6<sup>- </sup>TEVs do not), the 5' base of each TEV was taken to be the TEV's location on the reference genome, regardless of orientations for TEV or gene. This procedure assumes that TEV properties are identical on the forward and reverse strands of assembled chromosomes in the reference genome. For each genomic space, upstream, downstream or intronic sequence, the maximum distance (the half-way point to the next gene or exon) was recorded. Distance from the exon or gene was divided into bins and each scaled using the maximum number of bases in each span present in the genome. Using these scaled bin sizes, we calculated the density of TEVs (Number of TEVs within the relevant distances/Average number of bases over those distances). The bin sizes used in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a, b</xref> were taken from the Fibonacci series to allow improved visualization of the data relative to linear or logarithmic scaling.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ANOVA: analysis of variance; bp: base pair; CI: confidence interval; ERV: endogenous retrovirus; ETn: early transposon; FDR: false discovery rate; GAT: Genomic Association Tester; GO: Gene Ontology; IAP: intra-cisternal A particle; LINE: long interspersed nuclear element; LTR: long terminal repeat; MuLV: murine leukemia virus-like; My: million years; QTL: quantitative trait locus; SINE: short interspersed nuclear element; SV: structural variant; TE: transposable element; TEV: transposable element variant.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KW and BY performed the SV calling from which CN performed B6<sup>+ </sup>calling.
