Characterization of their regulation is important for gaining insights into these features. Relatively little is known about how conjugation of Gram-positive plasmids is regulated. We have characterized conjugation of the native <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> plasmid pLS20. Contrary to the enterococcal plasmids, conjugation of pLS20 is not activated by recipient-produced pheromones but by pLS20-encoded proteins that regulate expression of the conjugation genes. We show that conjugation is kept in the default &#x0201c;OFF&#x0201d; state and identified the master repressor responsible for this. Activation of the conjugation genes requires relief of repression, which is mediated by an anti-repressor that belongs to the Rap family of proteins. Using both RNA sequencing methodology and genetic approaches, we have determined the regulatory effects of the repressor and anti-repressor on expression of the pLS20 genes. We also show that the activity of the anti-repressor is in turn regulated by an intercellular signaling peptide. Ultimately, this peptide dictates the timing of conjugation. The implications of this regulatory mechanism and comparison with other mobile systems are discussed.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Bacteria evolve rapidly due to their short generation time and their ability to exchange genetic material, which can occur via different processes, collectively named Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT). Most bacteria contain, besides a single chromosome, autonomously replicating units called plasmids. Many plasmids carry genes enabling them to be transferred into plasmid-free bacteria. This process, called conjugation, contributes significantly to HGT. Many plasmids also contain antibiotic resistance genes. Therefore, plasmid conjugation plays a major role in the spread of antibiotic resistance. Understanding the regulation of conjugation genes is essential for designing strategies to combat the spread of antibiotic resistance. We have studied the regulation of the native plasmid pLS20 from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. Besides being a soil bacterium, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> is a gut commensal in animals and humans. Here we unraveled the mechanisms controlling conjugation and found that pLS20 conjugation genes become activated when plasmid-free recipient cells are present. We have identified the repressor protein that keeps conjugation in an &#x02018;OFF&#x02019; state, and an anti-repressor that activates conjugation. The activity of the anti-repressor is inhibited by a pLS20-encoded peptide that is secreted from the cell and can be absorbed by cells, after a secondary processing step. Ultimately, it is the signaling-peptide that dictates when conjugation genes become activated.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Work in the Madrid lab was funded by grant BFU2008-04034/BMC from the Ministry of Science and Innovation of the Spanish Government.

The main mechanisms responsible for HGT are transformation mediated by natural competence, transduction, phage-related chromosomal islands (PRCI) and conjugation performed by plasmids or ICEs <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Ochman1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1003892-Novick1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Conjugation is the process by which a DNA element is transferred from a donor cell to a recipient cell. Consequently, conjugation requires direct contact between the donor and the recipient cells. Often conjugative elements are present on plasmids, but they can also be found as mobile elements that are integrated in a bacterial chromosome. These latter forms are generally named integrative and conjugative elements (ICE).</p><p>The basics of the conjugation mechanism among plasmids are conserved. For a plasmid to be conjugative it requires a set of genes encoding proteins that (i) process the plasmid DNA into the form that can be transferred, which generally is single-stranded DNA, and (ii) generate a membrane-associated mating channel, called transferosome, through which the ssDNA is transported. The intercellular transferosome is a form of type IV secretion system. Generation of the ssDNA plasmidic form involves a relaxase, which forms a nucleoprotein complex called the relaxosome that introduces a site- and strand-specific nick within the origin of transfer (<italic>oriT</italic>). The relaxase remains covalently attached to the nicked DNA and the relaxasome is linked to the transferosome via the so-called coupling protein. Upon transfer of the ssDNA strand into the recipient cell through the transferosome, the attached relaxase directs recircularization of the ssDNA in the recipient cell.</p><p>Good understanding of the process of conjugation and its transcriptional regulation can provide insights into bacterial evolution. Such knowledge will also have important socio-economic, medical and biotechnological implications. For instance, it may provide valuable information to help control the explosive global spread of antibiotic resistance, and it may form the basis to construct tools to modify clinically or industrially important bacteria that are reluctant to genetic manipulation by other approaches. The process of conjugation and its transcriptional regulation has been studied in considerable detail for various plasmids present in Gram-negative (Gram<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) bacteria (for review see, <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Frost2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1003892-Fronzes1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>). However, comparatively little is known about conjugation systems on plasmids from Gram-positive (Gram<sup>+</sup>) bacteria, many of them industrially and medically important organisms, although interest in this field is increasing (for general review see, <xref rid="pgen.1003892-AlvarezMartinez1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Grohmann1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>). The conjugation machineries of plasmids from some Gram<sup>+</sup> bacteria have been studied in more depth. Examples of these are (i) the broad host-range plasmid pIP501, originally isolated from <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003892-Horodniceanu1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003892-GoessweinerMohr1" ref-type="bibr">[11, and references therein]</xref>, pCW3 of <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003892-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, the <italic>Staphylococcal aureus</italic> plasmids pGO1 and pSK41 <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Caryl1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and the <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> plasmids pAD1 and pCF10. For the latter plasmids their transcriptional regulation has also been studied (for review see, <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Clewell1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1003892-Chatterjee1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>). A characteristic feature of these latter plasmids is that conjugation is induced by pheromones that are produced by plasmid-free recipient cells.</p><p>
<italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> is one of best studied Gram<sup>+</sup> bacteria <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Sonenshein1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Sonenshein2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Although many natural isolates of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> harbor one or more plasmids <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Titok1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, little is known about conjugation systems present on <italic>B. subtilis</italic> plasmids. The main reason for this is that most <italic>B. subtilis</italic> studies are based on a few plasmid-free strains. For this reason and the other reasons stated below, we chose to study the regulation of plasmid conjugation in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. First, due to its ability to develop natural competence, its genome and resident plasmids are amenable to genetic manipulation <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Sonenshein1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Sonenshein2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Second, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> is closely related to fastidious and pathogenic bacilli like <italic>B. cereus</italic> and <italic>B. anthracis</italic>, respectively, and more distantly related to the Gram+ pathogen <italic>Listeria</italic>. Third, being a soil-dwelling bacterium that is found all over the world, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> may interact with a plethora of other bacteria and can be an effective vehicle for the transit of genes to and from other bacteria. This may be further underlined by the fact that it has become clear in recent years that various <italic>B. subtilis</italic> strains are also gut commensals in animals and humans <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Cutting1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. It is therefore not unlikely that <italic>B. subtilis</italic> plasmids play an important role in HGT at various levels and this warrants a better understanding of them. For our studies we chose the 65 kb <italic>B. subtilis</italic> plasmid pLS20, which has been identified originally in the <italic>Bacillus subtilis natto</italic> strain IFO3335 <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Tanaka1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and shown to be conjugative even in liquid medium <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Koehler1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Itaya1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>Earlier studies have determined the replication region of pLS20 <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Meijer1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, and showed that it uses a dedicated mechanism involving the actin-like Alp7A protein for its segregation <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Derman1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In addition, we recently discovered that pLS20cat, a derivative of pLS20 carrying a chloramphenicol-resistance gene (Cm) <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Itaya1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, encodes a protein that suppresses the development of natural competence of its host <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Although it has been shown that the conjugation machinery is predominantly formed at the cell poles <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Bauer1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, little is known about the process of conjugation itself.</p><p>In this work we studied the transcriptional regulation of the pLS20 conjugation genes. We identified an Xre-type repressor as the main transcriptional repressor that keeps the pLS20 conjugation system in the default &#x0201c;OFF&#x0201d; state. We show that pLS20 conjugation is not activated by recipient pheromones. Instead, activation of conjugation is exerted by a plasmid-encoded anti-repressor that belongs to the family of Rap proteins; most other members of which are involved in regulation of developmental processes in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. Moreover, we show that activation of the conjugation genes is ultimately controlled by a signaling peptide that regulates the activity of the anti-repressor. To our knowledge, such a regulatory circuitry mechanism has never been described before for plasmids.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>pLS20 conjugation is not activated by pheromones</title><p>Conjugation systems present on Gram-positive <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> plasmids are induced upon sensing a recipient-produced pheromone (for review see, <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Dunny1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>). To study whether the conjugation system of pLS20 is also induced by pheromones we determined conjugation efficiencies in liquid medium under different conditions using a Cm-labeled derivative of pLS20, pLS20cat <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Itaya1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Under the first condition, overnight grown cultures of donor (PKS11) and recipient (PKS7) cells were diluted and grown separately. At different times during growth, aliquots of the donor and recipient cells (&#x0223c;1&#x02236;1 ratio) were mixed and their conjugation efficiencies were determined after a mating period of 15 min. The results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003892-g001">Figure 1</xref> show that conjugation efficiencies increased during growth, reaching maximum levels near the end of the exponential growth phase, followed by a steep decrease in efficiencies at later times. The conjugation efficiency patterns obtained are similar to that published previously <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Itaya1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The observed increase in conjugation efficiency during the exponential growth phase might be due to accumulation of a conjugation activating signaling molecule produced by recipient cells. If this were the case, replacing the growth medium of the recipient cells with fresh medium before mixing with the donor cells should result in a reduction in conjugation efficiency. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003892-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows however that this treatment did not significantly affect conjugation efficiencies, strongly indicating that regulation of conjugation of pLS20 is fundamentally different from that of the enterococcal plasmids.</p><fig id="pgen-1003892-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1003892.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Conjugation kinetics of pLS20cat without and with replacing the recipient growth medium.</title><p>Conjugation kinetics of pLS20cat was determined as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> using strains PKS11 and PKS7 as donor and recipient strain, respectively.

Altogether, these results indicate that the pLS20 conjugation system is not activated by recipient-produced signaling molecules. Instead, they support the view that under our standard conditions the conjugation system is continuously repressed except for a rather small window of time near the end of the exponential growth phase.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Rco<sub>LS20</sub>, an Xre-type regulator protein encoded by pLS20 gene 27c, represses conjugation of pLS20</title><p>The observation that efficient conjugation occurred only during a short time window raised the possibility that conjugation is kept in the default &#x0201c;OFF&#x0201d; state by a transcriptional repressor protein, and is switched on only in a certain period during growth when the repressor is inactivated. To identify a possible conjugation repressor gene we sequenced and annotated pLS20cat, and used this information to construct a genetic map of pLS20cat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003892-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The following features identified gene 27c as a possible candidate encoding a conjugation repressor. First, <italic>in silico</italic> analysis indicated that it encodes an Xre-type, transcriptional regulator with a Helix-Turn-Helix (HTH) domain in its N-terminal region (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003892.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Second, gene 27c is located immediately upstream of a divergently oriented putative conjugation operon spanning genes 28 to 74. Several of the genes in the 28 to 74 region are predicted to be homologues of essential conjugation genes present on other conjugative plasmids, and homologues of essential conjugation genes are not found outside this region of pLS20cat (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003892-g002">Figure 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003892.s002">Table S1</xref> gives an overview of the comparative analysis of genes in this region that includes details on the putative translation start sites.</p><fig id="pgen-1003892-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1003892.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Genetic map of pLS20cat.</title><p>(Putative) genes are numbered.

Due to differences in annotation we prefer to maintain our nomenclature.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1003892.g002"/></fig><p>To test whether gene 27c indeed encodes a repressor of the conjugation genes we studied the effect of ectopic expression of gene 27c on pLS20cat conjugation. For this, we constructed strain PKS14 that harbors plasmid pLS20cat and contains an ectopic copy of gene 27c under the control of the IPTG-inducible P<sub>spank</sub> promoter at the chromosomal <italic>amyE</italic> locus. Conjugation efficiencies for pLS20cat were determined when PKS14 donor cells were grown in the presence or absence of IPTG. Since maximum conjugation levels occur near the end of the exponential growth phase (see above), we first determined conjugation efficiencies of pLS20cat during this phase. As a control, conjugation efficiencies of pLS20cat were determined in the wild type background (strain PKS11). The results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003892-t001">Table 1</xref> show that ectopic expression of pLS20cat gene 27c resulted in a dramatic decrease (&#x0003e;50,000 fold) in pLS20cat conjugation efficiency, supporting the view that it encodes a repressor of conjugation. In the absence of inducer, strain PKS14 showed a small but noticeable decrease in conjugation efficiency (25 to 30-fold) compared to that of strain PKS11 (pLS20cat in the wild type background).

To establish whether Rco<sub>LS20</sub> exerts its inhibitory effect on conjugation at the level of transcription and to identify genes that are under the control of Rco<sub>LS20</sub>, we performed RNAseq analysis to determine the expression pattern of all pLS20cat genes in a wild type background, and when grown in the presence of ectopic Rco<sub>LS20</sub> expression. Thus, total RNA was isolated from late exponential phase cells of PKS11, and of PKS14 grown in the presence of IPTG. In parallel, total RNA was isolated from plasmid-free <italic>B. subtilis</italic> 168 cells grown under the same conditions to serve as a negative control. After processing, the RNA samples were used to generate cDNA libraries using a &#x0201c;directional RNA-seq&#x0201d; procedure that preserved information about a transcript's direction. The generated libraries were subjected to Illumina sequencing resulting in a total of about 56.5&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> reads of 36-nt that passed the quality control settings. Of these, 1,596,385 reads mapped to the pLS20cat genome, and were used to calculate the apparent expression level of individual genes.

Second, we constructed a derivative of pLS20cat, pLS20phr, in which the <italic>phr<sub>LS20</sub></italic> gene was deleted and tested its conjugation kinetics. The results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003892-g006">Figure 6B</xref> show that inactivation of <italic>phr<sub>LS20</sub></italic> had similar effects on conjugation as those observed in the presence of ectopic expression of Rap<sub>LS20</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003892-g005">Figure 5</xref>) or inactivation of <italic>rco<sub>LS20</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003892-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, in the absence of <italic>phr<sub>LS20</sub></italic> conjugation efficiencies are high and conjugation occurs during a very broad time window.</p><p>Under our laboratory conditions, efficient conjugation is limited to a rather small time window before the end of the exponential growth phase (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003892-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The results that Phr*<sub>LS20</sub> inhibits the activity of Rap<sub>LS20</sub>, and that conjugation levels are high at all growth phases for pLS20phr indicate that the amount of Rap<sub>LS20</sub> protein is not the limiting factor for activating conjugation but that its activity is inhibited by Phr*<sub>LS20</sub> during early exponential as well as stationary growth phases. Phr*<sub>LS20</sub>-mediated inhibition of conjugation during stationary phase is most likely due to the accumulation of Phr*<sub>LS20</sub> during growth, which will reach Rap<sub>LS20</sub>-inhibiting threshold levels at or near the end of the exponential growth phase. However, the low levels of conjugation during early exponential growth cannot be explained by a similar kind of reasoning because the freshly diluted culture will contain low levels of Phr*<sub>LS20</sub> in the culture medium. One possible explanation for this is due to feasible intrinsic features of early exponential cells. This is very unlikely though taken into account that high levels of conjugation were obtained at early exponential growth phase with pLS20phr, pLS20rco or when Rap<sub>LS20</sub> was ectopically expressed. An alternative explanation could be that Rap<sub>LS20</sub>-inhibiting levels of Phr*<sub>LS20</sub> are still present inside the cells after overnight grown cultures are diluted in fresh medium. If this were the case, then high conjugation levels would be expected at early exponential growth phase by first growing the diluted overnight culture of donor cells to the end of the exponential growth phase and then diluting it again. The result of this experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003892-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) shows that high conjugation levels were indeed observed at early exponential growth phase under these conditions. Altogether, these results provide strong evidence that Phr*<sub>LS20</sub> is the determining factor in regulating the time window at which conjugation genes are activated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we report for the first time the regulation of a conjugation system present on a native <italic>B. subtilis</italic> plasmid.

The alignment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003892-g007">Figure 7</xref> shows that these residues are not conserved in Rap<sub>LS20</sub> or Rap<sub>576</sub>, consistent with our finding that Rap<sub>LS20</sub> does not affect competence. Thus, residues important for interaction with Spo0F or ComA are not conserved in Rap<sub>LS20</sub>, which most probably explains why Rap<sub>LS20</sub> does not affect sporulation or competence.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that Rap proteins involved in the regulation of the competence and sporulation pathways act as modulators, by inhibiting and/or delaying these developmental processes. On contrary, Rap<sub>LS20</sub> functions as an activator, and rather than being a modulator, it plays a decisive role in the conjugation process by relieving Rco<sub>LS20</sub>-mediated repression. Thus, whereas conjugation levels were severely affected in the absence of <italic>rap<sub>LS20</sub></italic>, conjugation was stimulated at all growth phases when Rap<sub>LS20</sub> was ectopically expressed, accompanied by activation of the Rco<sub>LS20</sub>-repressed genes as analyzed by transcriptional profiling.</p><p>However, the ultimate determining factor responsible for defining the time window during which conjugation occurs is Phr*<sub>LS20</sub>. The observation that addition of synthetic Phr*<sub>LS20</sub> peptide inhibits conjugation suggests that the peptide acts in cell-cell signaling rather than being an autocrine signal. Elevated conjugation levels were obtained at all growth phases for pLS20phr that lacked the <italic>phr<sub>LS20</sub></italic> gene. These results strongly indicate that sufficient amounts of Rap<sub>LS20</sub> are available to stimulate conjugation at all growth phases but that, under our standard laboratory conditions, its activity is inhibited by Phr*<sub>LS20</sub> during early exponential and stationary growth phases, allowing efficient conjugation to occur only during a rather narrow time window near the end of the exponential growth phase.</p><p>The concentration of Phr*<sub>LS20</sub> is expected to be high when all or the majority of the cells in a population produce the peptide, and low when the majority of the cells are not producing the peptide. In other words, conjugation genes will be activated specifically when donor cells are surrounded by recipient cells, and not by other donor cells. Besides preventing futile expression of conjugation genes when recipient cells are not present, strict regulation of the conjugation genes is likely to serve other purposes. For instance, pLS20cat replicates via the theta mode of replication <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Meijer1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. During conjugation, however, replication switches to the rolling circle mode to generate the ssDNA strand that is destined to be transferred into the recipient cell. Simultaneous replication of the theta and rolling circle modes are likely not compatible and strict regulation of the conjugation genes, amongst which are those involved in initiating rolling circle replication, contributes to selecting the mode of replication according to the circumstances. In addition, it is likely that expression of the conjugation genes poses a large burden to the cell. This view is supported by our observations that growth is affected in cells harboring pLS20rco and pLS20phr, i.e. plasmids containing alterations leading to constitutive expression of the conjugation genes.</p><p>A summary of the regulatory circuitry of the pLS20 conjugation genes is schematically presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003892-g008">Figure 8</xref>. Rco<sub>LS20</sub> is responsible for maintaining conjugation in the default &#x0201c;OFF&#x0201d; state by repressing the conjugation genes. Rap<sub>LS20</sub> can activate conjugation by relieving Rco<sub>LS20</sub>-mediated repression, but is only able to do so when its activity is not inhibited by the Phr*<sub>LS20</sub> signaling peptide. Therefore, conjugation of the pLS20cat plasmid is strictly regulated by the Phr*<sub>LS20</sub> peptide-mediated quorum sensing (QS) mechanism. QS is a common way by which bacteria communicate with one another using small and diffusible chemical signaling molecules. When the concentration of a signaling molecule reaches a certain &#x0201c;quorum&#x0201d;, bacteria respond by altering its gene expression profile at a (sub)population-wide scale (for review see, <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Waters1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Thoendel1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>). Several cellular processes in both Gram+ positive and Gram- bacteria have been shown to be regulated by QS, among them the development of natural competence in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus pneumonia</italic>, <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Solomon1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Pottathil1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Thoendel1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Here, we show that QS plays a role in HGT at another level by regulating expression of conjugation genes of plasmid pLS20. So far, QS has been reported to regulate conjugation genes of only a few other conjugative elements. These include the transfer of the tumor-inducing pTI plasmid of the Gram- <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> into plant cells. In this case, activation of conjugation requires two signaling peptides, one produced by the plant and the other by the donor cell <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Regulation of conjugation of the enterococcal plasmid pCF10, -and probably in a similar way pAD1-, also involves two signaling peptides, one produced by donor and the other by recipient cells. The two peptides compete for binding to a single transcriptional regulator, PrgX, and act antagonistically on conjugation. However, instead of being an activator, PrgX is a repressor. When PrgX is bound to the donor-produced signaling peptide the complex binds DNA and represses the conjugation genes. Conjugation genes become activated when recipient-produced signaling peptide replaces the donor-produced signaling peptide in the PrgX/peptide complex thereby inactivating the repressor activity of PrgX. Consequently, conjugation genes are activated by recipient produced signaling peptides <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Chatterjee1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Our results show that the QS mechanism to regulate conjugation genes of pLS20 differs in various aspects from those regulating conjugation of the pTi and pCF10/pAD1 plasmids. First, regulation of pLS20 conjugation genes involves not two but only one signaling peptide, Phr*<sub>LS20</sub>. Second, the signaling peptide does not act directly on the transcriptional regulator but instead regulates activity of another protein, Rap<sub>LS20</sub>, which functions as an anti-repressor. And third, the signaling peptide does not function to activate conjugation genes but to return the conjugation system to the default &#x0201c;OFF&#x0201d; state by inhibiting the activity of the anti-repressor.</p><fig id="pgen-1003892-g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1003892.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Model of regulatory circuitry of pLS20 conjugation genes.</title><p>A.

<xref rid="pgen.1003892-Auchtung1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. There are several similarities but also interesting differences between the conjugation systems present on plasmid pLS20 and the chromosomal ICE<italic>Bs1</italic>. In both systems, transcription of the conjugation genes are repressed by an Xre-type repressor (Rco<sub>LS20</sub> and ImmR, respectively) and the gene encoding the repressor protein is divergently oriented with respect to a large putative operon encoding the structural conjugation genes. In addition, in both cases conjugation is activated by a Rap protein (Rap<sub>LS20</sub> and RapI, respectively) whose activity is controlled by a quorum sensing peptide encoded by the downstream <italic>phr</italic> gene. As we have proposed for <italic>rap<sub>LS20</sub>-phr<sub>LS20</sub></italic>, a major function of the <italic>rapI-phrI</italic> cassette of ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> is a sensing mechanism to induce genes required for conjugation when recipient cells are present <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Auchtung1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p><p>However, there are several important differences between the Rap<sub>LS20</sub>-Phr<sub>LS20</sub> and the RapI-PhrI systems. One significant difference is that transfer of ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> requires, besides RapI, the ICE<italic>Bs1</italic>-encoded ImmA protein to relieve the ImmR-mediated repression of the ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> genes <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Bose1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. The <italic>immA</italic> gene is located immediately downstream of <italic>immR</italic>. ImmA is a protease that cleaves ImmR and its activity is probably controlled by RapI <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Bose2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. However, an <italic>immA</italic> homologue is not present on pLS20cat. More importantly, our preliminary results indicate that Rap<sub>LS20</sub> functions directly as the anti-repressor of Rco<sub>LS20</sub> (to be published elsewhere). Another major difference is that efficient mating of ICE<italic>Bs1</italic>, like most other ICEs, is limited to solid media, whereas pLS20 mates also efficiently in liquid medium <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Koehler1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Itaya1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Guglielmini1" ref-type="bibr">[54, this study]</xref>. In a typical solid medium conjugation experiment, a concentrated mixture of donor and recipient cells is incubated on a solid surface for several hours, permitting donor cells to intimately contact recipient cells for a prolonged period of time. These conditions also correlate with high cell density, cell crowding and starvation, i.e. stationary phase conditions at which cells generally induce developmental pathways in order to cope with the suboptimal growth conditions.</p><p>The third difference is the timing of transfer. Auchtung <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Auchtung1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> reported that conjugation of ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> is low during mid exponential and much higher during stationary growth. The authors provided evidence that <italic>rapI</italic> is negatively regulated by the transition state regulator AbrB, which represses transcription of several <italic>B. subtilis</italic> genes specifically during the exponential growth phase <xref rid="pgen.1003892-Strauch1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Thus, RapI stimulates transfer of ICEBs1 during stationary phase conditions that favor intimate intercellular contacts; conditions that typically occur during conjugation on solid medium. In <italic>B. subtilis</italic> such conditions also stimulate initiation of the sporulation pathway. Most probably, sporulation and conjugative transfer of an ICE element are not compatible and hence efficient transfer of the ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> element would benefit from inhibiting sporulation in that cell. Interestingly, we have found that ectopic expression of RapI strongly affects sporulation. In agreement with our results, it has been shown very recently that RapI can dephosphorylate Spo0F <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003892-Parashar3" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Together these results demonstrated that RapI has a dual function: it activates transfer of ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> during stationary phase and inhibits the initiation of sporulation that is normally stimulated under these conditions.</p><p>We have shown that Rap<sub>LS20</sub> regulates conjugation of pLS20cat in a strikingly different manner. Several results showed that efficient pLS20cat conjugation occurs during exponential growth and that it is strongly inhibited during stationary growth. This important difference may be related to the fact that conjugation of pLS20cat occurs efficiently in liquid medium when cells have a planktonic lifestyle and probably spend more time in the exponential growth phase than cells growing in sessile communities. Our results on Rap<sub>LS20</sub>, together with published results on other Rap proteins, demonstrate the enormous plasticity of how these proteins have evolved into versatile regulatory proteins that control diverse cellular processes by interacting with a wide range of other regulatory proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Bacterial strains, media, oligonucleotides and peptides</title><p>

Of the total reads, a percentage between 92.48 and 98.51% could be mapped to the reference genome with 79 to 106-fold sequencing coverage across the entire genome.

This database was used to identify such contaminating sequences from the unmapped reads. Of total reads, percentages between 0.18% and 0.56% were assigned to UniVec database sequences, revealing very low levels of vector contamination. Unmapped reads were discarded for further analysis.
