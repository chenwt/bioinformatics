RNA samples from 8 testes of boars that received either a diet enriched in methylating micronutrients or a control diet were analyzed by microarray analysis. We found moderate differential expression between testes of differentially fed boars with a high FDR of 0.82 indicating that most of the differentially expressed genes were false positives. Nevertheless, we performed a pathway analysis and found disparate pathway maps of development_A2B receptor: action via G-protein alpha s, cell adhesion_Tight junctions and cell adhesion_Endothelial cell contacts by junctional mechanisms which show inconclusive relation to epigenetic inheritance. Four RNA samples from sperm cells of these differentially fed boars were analyzed by RNA-Seq methodology. We found no differential gene expression in sperm cells of the two groups (adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value&#x0003e;0.05). Nevertheless, we also explored gene expression in sperm by a pathway analysis showing that genes were enriched for the pathway maps of bacterial infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) airways, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis p.3 and cell cycle_Initiation of mitosis. Again, these pathway maps are miscellaneous without an obvious relationship to epigenetic inheritance. It is concluded that the methylating micronutrients moderately if at all affects RNA expression in testes of differentially fed boars. Furthermore, gene expression in sperm cells is not significantly affected by extensive supplementation of methylating micronutrients and thus RNA molecules could not be established as the epigenetic mark in this feeding experiment.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>These authors have no support or funding to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="5"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in mammals is the transmission of environmentally induced epigenetic states to progeny that were not exposed to that environment including the germ cells from which they come from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078691-Jirtle1">[1]</xref>. The extent and the specificity to which acquired epigenetic modifications during an individual's life time are transmitted to next generations are controversially discussed. However, effects of environmental exposure on pregnant females that are reflected in the subsequent F1 and F2 generations are also considered as transgenerational epigenetic inheritance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078691-Daxinger1">[2]</xref>. These authors further introduced the term &#x02018;transgenerational epigenetic inheritance via the gametes&#x02019; that refers to effects on the phenotype that are non-mendelian and transmitted as epigenetic marks including RNA and proteins via the gametes. It is well established in mice that the epigenome undergoes genome wide epigenetic reprogramming during gametogenesis and embryogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078691-Reik1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078691-Sasaki1">[4]</xref>. It is assumed that this epigenetic resetting is conserved in mammals arguing against widespread inheritance of epigenetic modifications induced by ancestral environmental effects. However, there are chromosomal regions that are particularly resistant to reprogramming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078691-Lane1">[5]</xref>. The extensively studied and often quoted examples of inducible DNA methylation in IAP retrotransposons at the agouti viable yellow (<italic>A<sup>yv</sup></italic>) and the axin fused (Axin<italic><sup>Fu</sup></italic>) alleles did not persist to the third generation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078691-Morgan1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078691-Rakyan1">[7]</xref>. Transgenerational effects were demonstrated in an epidemiological study in humans from Northern Sweden. These &#x000d6;verkalix data showed a link between grandparental food supply during their slow growth period and the mortality risk ratio of their grandsons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078691-Kaati1">[8]</xref>. More recently it was reported that F1 offspring responded to F0 paternal protein diet showing elevated hepatic expression of many genes that are involved in lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis in the low-protein diet compared to the control group. In addition reproducible changes in DNA methylation were detected at a putative enhancer of the lipid regulator <italic>Ppara</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078691-Carone1">[9]</xref>. Transgenerational perpetuation of DNA methylation was assumed to be a result of incomplete DNA methylation erasure during gametogenesis and early embryogenesis. At least at the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele it was shown that DNA methylation is unlikely to be the epigenetic mark that transmits the pseudoagouti phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078691-Blewitt1">[10]</xref>. A paramutation-like phenomenon was described in progeny of heterozygotes <italic>Kit<sup>tm1Alf/+</sup></italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078691-Rassoulzadegan1">[11]</xref>. The <italic>tm1Alf</italic> mutation abrogates the synthesis of Kit tyrosine kinase receptor and wild type progeny from heterozygous <italic>Kit<sup>tm1Alf/+</sup></italic> parents showed the mutant phenotype of a white tail dip and white feet. Furthermore, these wild type mice transmitted the white tail dip and white feet mutant phenotype to subsequent generations in the absence of a <italic>tm1Alf</italic> allele. A similar demonstration of paramutation in mice was achieved by microinjecting microRNA miR-1 in fertilized oocytes to target the Cdk9 cardiac growth regulator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078691-Wagner1">[12]</xref>. Mice born after miR-1 injection showed an increased heart size compared to controls and this phenotype was transmitted to next generations. These results suggest that RNA molecules play a role in non-mendelian inheritance. Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance attracted much attention because it is challenging the paradigm that solely DNA transmits all the information for subsequent living organisms. Irrespective of a small number of particular examples the relevance of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance characterized by epigenetic marks that are persisting over generations is widely unknown.</p><p>Recently we presented data from a three generation pig feeding experiment by which we show a transgenerational response in F2 offspring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078691-Braunschweig1">[13]</xref>. F0 boars were fed a diet enriched in methylating micronutrients or a control diet. In the F2 descendants from these boars we found significant gene expression, carcass and DNA methylation differences. It is hypothesized that if non-mendelian inheritance took place in this three generation pig pedigree then the information could only be transmitted via the F0 boars' semen because exclusively the F0 boars were differentially fed in this pedigree. We suggested studying testes sample because potential differences in gene expression could also point towards other epigenetic marks than RNA molecules. From the analysis of RNA in sperm cells we expected to find differences of gene expression that are directly carried to the egg via fertilization and would eventually be involved in early embryogenesis. These potential changes must then be maintained in the germ cells of the F1 generation to be effective in a F2 generation. In the present study we analyzed RNA microarray data from testes and RNA-Seq data from sperm cells of these differentially fed F0 boars in search of segregating epigenetic RNA marks.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Gene Expression Profiling in testes by microarray analysis</title><p>Gene expression was investigated by microarray gene expression profiling to compare gene expression levels in testes of 4 F0 boars that received from month one to month ten an experimental diet enriched in methylating micronutrients with those 4 boars that received a control diet.

Exclusively the experimental F0 boars received high doses of methylating micronutrients intending to unbalance the one-carbon metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078691-Gutzwiller1">[14]</xref>.</p><p>We hypothesized that differential gene expression in testes and sperm cells of differentially fed F0 boars is prerequisite to find epigenetic RNA marks. We found 482 differentially expressed genes (P&#x0003c;0.05) between the two groups of testes samples for which the FDR was considerably high for all transcripts (FDR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; 0.82) and thus includes a high portion of false positives. A two fold difference in expression was found for 8 transcripts (FDR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.82). We consider the gene expression differences between the two groups of 4 boars as moderate. The pathway maps and GO processes associated with gene expression differences do not indicate a simple relationship between nutritional influences and gene expression in testes which may reflect the high FDR of the involved differentially expressed genes. Nevertheless the Adenosine A2B receptor influences cell differentiation and proliferation and has thus far reaching consequences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://host.genego.com/map_482.php">http://host.genego.com/map_482.php</ext-link>). The positive regulation of nucleobase-containing compound metabolic process, the cellular response to hormone stimulus and the cellular process represent also complex networks making it difficult to interpret them in the light of epigenetic inheritance. The expression result is thus not conclusive of whether the diet affects processes related to transmittable epigenetic marks. The results, however, indicate that the extreme supplementation of methylating micronutrients from month one to month ten of age has a very moderate (if any) effect on gene expression in boar testes as measured by microarray analysis.</p><p>A more direct way in search of epigenetic marks was the RNASeq experiment of sperm RNA between groups of each of two differentially fed F0 boars. According to the adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value there was no difference in RNA expression of sizes larger than 100 nt. Consequently, it is concluded that RNA expression in sperm cells is not significantly affected by extensive supplementation of methylating micronutrients and thus RNA could not be established as epigenetic mark in this feeding experiment. Furthermore, it is emphasized that potential epigenetic marks or their epigenetic effects in the F0 generation must persists up to the sperm cells of the F1 generation to be considered causal for observed effects in the F2 generation. The sample size in this study was rather small and only pronounced differences in RNA expression would have been detected. There are following possibilities to interpret the data: (1) The diet does not induce gene expression differences that can be reliably measured in testes or sperm cells. (2) The diet induces epigenetic modifications but RNA molecules larger than 100 nt are not the epigenetic marks. (3) The diet induces epigenetic modifications and RNA molecules larger than 100 nt are differentially expressed but it could not be demonstrated in this study because of small sample size and/or small expression differences. In mammals, there is still no experimental evidence if transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in the narrow sense is contributing to the variation of multifactorial traits including diseases challenging its relevance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078691-Grossniklaus1">[15]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We did not find conclusive evidence that high dose of methylating micronutrients significantly affect the expression of RNA molecules longer than 100 nt in testes or sperm cells of boars.

RNA from testes tissue samples was extracted using the Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. The integrity of RNA was confirmed by a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany). The RNA was labeled and hybridized to the porcine gene expression microarray from Agilent Technologies according to standard protocol used at the Functional Genomic Center Z&#x000fc;rich. We used the Porcine (V2) Gene Expression Microarray, 4644K (G2519F).
