Recent studies in mammals suggest that cells arising in the yolk sac give rise to self-renewing macrophage populations that persist in adult tissues. Macrophage proliferation and differentiation is controlled by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1) and interleukin 34 (IL34), both agonists of the CSF1 receptor (CSF1R). In the current manuscript we describe the origin, function and regulation of macrophages, and the role of CSF1R signaling during embryonic development, using the chick as a model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Based upon RNA-sequencing comparison to bone marrow-derived macrophages grown in CSF1, we show that embryonic macrophages contribute around 2% of the total embryo RNA in day 7 chick embryos, and have similar gene expression profiles to bone marrow-derived macrophages. To explore the origins of embryonic and adult macrophages, we injected Hamburger-Hamilton stage 16 to 17 chick embryos with either yolk sac-derived blood cells, or bone marrow cells from EGFP<sup>+</sup> donors. In both cases, the transferred cells gave rise to large numbers of EGFP<sup>+</sup> tissue macrophages in the embryo. In the case of the yolk sac, these cells were not retained in hatched birds. Conversely, bone marrow EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells gave rise to tissue macrophages in all organs of adult birds, and regenerated CSF1-responsive marrow macrophage progenitors. Surprisingly, they did not contribute to any other hematopoietic lineage. To explore the role of CSF1 further, we injected embryonic or hatchling CSF1R-reporter transgenic birds with a novel chicken CSF1-Fc conjugate. In both cases, the treatment produced a large increase in macrophage numbers in all tissues examined. There were no apparent adverse effects of chicken CSF1-Fc on embryonic or post-hatch development, but there was an unexpected increase in bone density in the treated hatchlings.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The data indicate that the yolk sac is not the major source of macrophages in adult birds, and that there is a macrophage-restricted, self-renewing progenitor cell in bone marrow. CSF1R is demonstrated to be limiting for macrophage development during development <italic>in ovo</italic> and post-hatch. The chicken provides a novel and tractable model to study the development of the mononuclear phagocyte system and CSF1R signaling.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12915-015-0121-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd>CSF1</kwd><kwd>Hematopoiesis</kwd><kwd>Macrophage</kwd><kwd>Transgenic</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>The mononuclear phagocyte system is a family of cells consisting of committed progenitors, circulating monocytes and tissue macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The prevailing view that blood monocytes give rise to tissue macrophages in the steady state has been challenged by recent evidence in the mouse that phagocytic cells arising in the yolk sac can populate tissues during development and can be maintained through local proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The generation of phagocytes in the yolk sac and their infiltration of the embryo has been demonstrated in the chick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and in the mouse ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and references therein). Yolk sac-derived macrophages in the chick were shown to enter the developing central nervous system independently of vascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Their origin was confirmed through the use of chick-quail yolk sac chimeras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, the inter-specific chimera system used did not permit full development, so there was no evidence from the chick system as to whether the yolk sac-derived cells were retained post-hatch.</p><p>The hematopoietic growth factors macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1) and interleukin 34 (IL34) control the proliferation, differentiation and development of mammalian mononuclear phagocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], acting through a common receptor, CSF1R. All three molecules are conserved in birds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A critical control element in the first intron of the <italic>Csf1r</italic> locus, termed the fms intronic regulatory element (FIRE) in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] is also conserved in birds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. <italic>Csf1r</italic> mRNA is detected in the earliest phagocytes in the mouse yolk sac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The extreme macrophage deficiency and developmental abnormalities seen in a <italic>Csf1r</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mouse embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] suggest that CSF1 and IL34 control embryonic macrophage differentiation and, in turn, that these cells are required for normal development.</p><p>The contribution of cells that originate in the yolk sac to tissue macrophage populations has been assessed in mice through the use of inducible lineage tracers, and the impact of the knockout of the transcription factor, <italic>c-myb</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, such studies depend upon the assumption that knockouts and inducers such as tamoxifen do not themselves alter the contribution of the yolk sac by compromising definitive hematopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The chick has been used extensively in developmental biology because of the ease with which cells and tissues can be physically transplanted to allow fate-mapping, an approach made even more straightforward by our development of ubiquitous enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing chicken lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In the current study we examine the origins of tissue macrophages during embryonic development and the importance of CSF1 in the control of macrophage proliferation and differentiation in the chicken. The results confirm that CSF1 is a regulator of the chick mononuclear phagocyte system <italic>in vivo</italic>. They also suggest that yolk sac-derived macrophages in the chick are relatively short-lived and are substituted by bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) during development.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Comparative RNA-sequencing analysis of CSF1-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages and embryonic RNA</title><p>Macrophages are a major cell population in the developing mouse embryo, as evident from both <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization of <italic>Csf1r</italic> and other macrophage-related mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and the location of a macrophage-specific <italic>Csf1r-</italic>EGFP reporter transgene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The visualization of cells expressing <italic>CSF1R</italic> reporter genes ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and see below) in the chick suggests that embryonic macrophages are just as abundant in this species, but there is limited information on macrophage-restricted mRNAs to enable their characterization.</p><p>To reveal macrophage-enriched transcripts, we used RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) to compare the mRNA profiles of BMDM grown in CSF1 with a pool of E7 embryos. The fibroblast line DF1 was used as a negative control. We identified transcripts with unique annotations, and with an expression threshold of 1 tag/million (tpm) in the embryo, and created a Venn diagram of overlapping expression (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Around 75% of transcripts detected at 1 tpm were represented in all of the libraries. At this threshold, 30% to 40% of transcripts were detected in only one of the two BMDM libraries. We focused on two sets: 997 transcripts that were detected in both BMDM libraries and embryo but not in DF-1, and 99 that were detected only in the two BMDM libraries (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables S1, S2 and S3). The tables show the relative expression in DF1 cells and embryo compared with BMDM. <italic>CSF1R</italic> mRNA was detected in embryos at around 2% of the level found in pure BMDM. Assuming similar levels of expression of <italic>CSF1R</italic> mRNA in tissue macrophages and BMDM, this would suggest that macrophages contribute around 2% of the total mRNA, which is consistent with their apparent abundance. The macrophage-specific transcription factor PU.1 (<italic>SFPI1</italic>) had a similar relative enrichment to <italic>CSF1R</italic>, whilst several other myeloid transcription factors (<italic>MAFB</italic>, <italic>CEBPE</italic>, <italic>TFEC</italic>, <italic>RUNX1</italic>) were less enriched in the BMDM relative to the embryo, most probably because they are expressed in other hemopoietic cells (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). The macrophage-enriched list also includes many known macrophage-expressed surface proteins, including <italic>CSF2RB</italic>, <italic>CCR2</italic>, <italic>TREM2</italic>, <italic>CD36</italic>, <italic>MRC1</italic>, <italic>P2RY2</italic>, <italic>STAB1</italic> and <italic>TLR7</italic>, detected by network analysis of large mouse, pig and human datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The 99 macrophage-expressed genes that were below the 1 tpm in embryo are, in fact, detectable. As shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3, they were all highly enriched in BMDM relative to DF1 cells, and include many genes that are macrophage-enriched in mice (for example, <italic>LY86</italic>, <italic>CTSS</italic>, <italic>C1Q</italic>, <italic>CSF3R</italic>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of gene expression of chicken bone marrow-derived macrophages, DF1 fibroblasts and day 7 embryo based upon RNA sequencing.</bold> RNAseq of RNA from the four sources (including two independent biological replicates of BMDM) was carried out and results analyzed as described in <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>.

Recognizable blood islands containing Runx1<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic progenitors have been detected in HH5 embryos but the cells expressing a <italic>CSF1R</italic>-reporter gene appeared in the yolk sac at HH13. These cells were confined to the lumen of primitive blood vessels and their numbers rapidly escalated in the circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The pattern of emergence is consistent with previous reports of the earliest appearance of macrophages in the chicken embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. We tested the potential of circulating yolk sac-derived cells to differentiate into macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic> by culturing whole blood from HH16 to HH17 embryos. In the absence of growth factors, these circulating yolk sac-derived cells failed to survive in culture, whereas they rapidly differentiated into adherent cell monolayers in the presence of CSF1 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A,B). The resulting cells were identified as macrophages based on their phagocytic capacity and expression of CSF1R, MHCII and KUL01 (a chicken macrophage marker; Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C-G). Circulating yolk sac-derived cells were found to have a high proliferative capacity, with macrophages derived from 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of whole blood expanding to approximately 90% confluence in a T80 flask after 21&#x000a0;days in culture.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>

Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows representative images of a number of locations in embryos receiving transferred cells at different times of subsequent development.

As expected, and observed previously in the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells were particularly concentrated in regions of programmed cell death, such as the inter-digit region of the limb buds (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C,D).

All EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells were also labeled by immunohistochemistry with anti-CSF1R, and rounded EGFP<sup>+</sup> CSF1R<sup>+</sup> cells in the inter-digit region contained the condensed and fragmented nuclei of apoptotic cells.

As a positive control for effective transfer in these hatched birds, EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells were detected in the testes of recipient males (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>F), indicating the presence of cells derived from donor primordial germ cells that were co-transferred along with the yolk sac macrophages in blood derived from stage HH16 to HH17 embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>To test the differentiation potential of definitive hematopoietic cells under the same protocol, we injected unfractionated bone marrow from newly hatched EGFP<sup>-</sup>expressing chicks into the circulation of stage HH16 to HH17 non-transgenic chicken embryos, before the appearance of the intra-aortic hematopoietic stem cell clusters. The workflow for this experiment is shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1. In each of three experiments, 25 embryos were injected, and hatch rates varied between 36% and 60%. As with the embryonic cell adoptive transfers, the injected embryos were examined for the presence of EGFP-expressing cells of donor origin at various stages of embryonic development, and some were also taken to hatch. Tissues from these bone marrow chimeras were collected on hatch day, five 5 of age and 6&#x000a0;weeks of age for similar examination.</p><p>Donor bone marrow-derived EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells invaded the whole embryo as shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A. The distribution of EGFP-expressing cells in the host embryo was comparable to that observed in <italic>CSF1R</italic>-EGFP transgenic chick embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], including in the forming digits (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A; panels iii and iv). The aggregation of macrophages to form primordia, detected with the <italic>CSF1R</italic>-EGFP or <italic>CSF1R</italic>-mApple reporters, is the first sign of the future location of organized lymphoid organs in the chick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The bone marrow donor-derived EGFP-expressing cells also aggregated in lymphoid tissue primordia of the recipient embryo (for example, the spleen in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A, panel vi). The distribution of donor EGFP-expressing cells in tissues was examined in post-hatch chimeras by whole mount fluorescence imaging (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). In contrast with the loss of labeled cells in chicks injected with yolk sac-derived cells, EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells were so abundant throughout all the tissues examined (that is, brain, skin, liver, spleen, thymus, bursa, bone marrow and blood) that they were easily detected in whole mounts. Furthermore, these cells from the donor were still present in the tissues at 6&#x000a0;weeks of age, which was the latest time point examined. They were particularly concentrated in the spleen and bursa of Fabricius but less so in the liver, which is not a major site of hematopoiesis during avian development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The donor-derived cells were also detected in the brain and skin of all the chimeras generated. The presence of EGFP-expressing cells in the thymus of the chimeras implies that bone marrow donor-derived progenitors were still circulating at 6.5&#x000a0;days of incubation, which is the time of the first influx of hematopoietic cells into the chicken thymus. The thymus ontogeny involves a cyclic succession of receptive and non-receptive periods for stem cell entry into the embryonic and early postnatal thymus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. To confirm the identity of the bone marrow-derived donor cells that persisted in the brains of the chimeras, coronal sections of the right telencephalon were stained for expression of the leukocyte marker CD45 and for CSF1R. All of the EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells also expressed CD45 and CSF1R, and had the characteristic ramified morphology of microglial cells.

We therefore examined whether injected EGFP+ bone marrow cells isolated from newly hatched chicks could contribute to the progenitor pool in the marrow of recipients. The bone marrow of 6-week-old chimeras contained 10% to 20% of EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells were predominantly large and granular, and expressed high levels of CD45, consistent with their identity as macrophages (not shown).

To confirm the contribution of the donor EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells to macrophage progenitors, chimeric marrow was cultured in presence of chicken CSF1 for 7&#x000a0;days. A substantial proportion of the resulting BMDM expressed EGFP.

There was an apparent increase in background fluorescence in the chimeric birds. On flow cytometry, the entire fluorescence curve of large granular cells within the spleen was shifted somewhat to the right, perhaps due to the uptake of EGFP from dying cells (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S3A). Frozen sections of paraformaldehyde (PFA)-fixed chimeric spleens were stained using an antibody against the cell surface antigen Bu-1, which is expressed on B cells and a subset of macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. None of the EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells were positive for Bu-1. The level of chimerism in the large granular cell fraction was as high as 45% in two of the birds examined in detail. Sustained chimerism was confirmed in the bursa, where the background EGFP shift was not observed (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S3B). In this organ, around 13% of the large granular cells were unequivocally EGFP<sup>+</sup>, whereas amongst small lymphocyte-like fractions the proportion was only 1% to 2%. As in the spleen, the EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells in tissue sections did not stain for Bu-1; indeed, the positive cells were excluded from the B cell follicles. Conversely, all of the EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells in both spleen and bursa were stained with our recently described antibody against CSF1R, and were not morphologically distinct from the large pool of stellate interstitial CSF1R<sup>+</sup> macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>The responsiveness of embryonic macrophages to CSF1</title><p>The ability of donor bone marrow cells to proliferate and differentiate when transplanted into the chick embryo indicates that there is a macrophage-trophic environment.

To determine whether the availability of CSF1R ligands is limiting for macrophage development, we examined the effect of supplementing their availability by direct microinjection. For this purpose, we developed a chimeric chicken CSF1-Fc fusion protein (see <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). A similar construct for pig CSF1 was found to increase the circulating half-life, because it increases the size of the protein above the renal clearance threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. We assayed the chicken CSF1-Fc using a chicken CSF1R-expressing Ba/F3 line described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and found that the addition of the Fc component did not alter the relative activity (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S5).

Definitive hematopoietic stem cells appear in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region at HH19 so the exogenous CSF1 injected at this stage might act on both yolk sac and definitive monocyte macrophages. There was no consistent difference in the gross appearance or size of whole embryos injected with chicken CSF1-Fc and PBS within the time frame examined. However, when whole embryos were viewed as whole mounts, there was a very obvious increase in EGFP fluorescence to the extent that the injected embryos were bright green (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S6A). The apparent increase in EGFP fluorescence was not focused at the site of injection, but was manifest throughout the chicken CSF1-injected embryos.

By contrast, there was no effect on any chicken organ weights in response to chicken CSF1-Fc.

In the present study, we have extended the previous evidence that the developing chicken contains an abundant macrophage population that can be detected by localization of <italic>CSF1R</italic> mRNA or novel <italic>CSF1R</italic> reporter genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The patterns of development, migration and localization detected using a <italic>CSF1R</italic> reporter were entirely consistent with previous descriptions of macrophage development in the mouse. Our previous generation of recombinant chicken CSF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] permitted the production of large numbers of pure BMDM from chicken bone marrow. We compared their gene expression to the total gene expression in the embryo. The number of macrophages in the embryo was so high that it was possible with deep-RNAseq analysis to identify macrophage-expressed transcripts against the background of the mRNA from numerous other cell types. The chicken genome is still poorly assembled and annotated, and large parts of the sequence (especially some of the micro-chromosomes) are not even sequenced. Consequently, even after the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of the tags that did not originally map to the genome, 10% of the new contigs were still not present in the current assembly. These contigs could form the basis of capture sequences to enable further refinement of the genome sequence. The primary sequence data have been provided to a consortium of avian researchers, and used to refine annotation of the chicken genome (Smith J, Burt D, <italic>et al</italic>., manuscript in preparation). As a first approximation, the data demonstrates that tissue macrophages in a developing chick have a similar transcriptome to CSF1-stimulated BMDM and, by inference, <italic>CSF1R</italic> mRNA and the <italic>CSF1R</italic> reporter expression accurately locates macrophage-like cells. A transcript annotated as the chemokine receptor <italic>CCR2</italic> is amongst the highly expressed genes shared by BMDM and embryonic macrophages in the chick. This gene is probably not a strict ortholog of mammalian <italic>Ccr2</italic> ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], but the expression suggests a conserved function with the mammalian receptor.</p><p>The transplantation experiments described in this study demonstrate that bone marrow progenitors transplanted into a chick embryo before the onset of definitive hematopoiesis can produce long-lived and substantial chimerism restricted to the macrophage compartment. This observation will be technically useful for studies of the role of macrophages in innate immunity and the nature of immunological tolerance in birds. For example, one might anticipate transplanting marrow from birds that are resistance to a pathogen, such as <italic>Salmonella</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] or Marek&#x02019;s disease virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], to determine whether resistance is macrophage-autonomous. The effectiveness of chimera generation, even without optimization, is especially surprising because we injected unfractionated bone marrow. There is clearly the potential to fractionate the marrow to identify <italic>CSF1R</italic><sup>+</sup>&#x02009;cells, and to modify the recipient genetically to reduce the contribution of endogenous hematopoietic progenitors to optimize this technology. The finding indicates that the early embryonic environment provides a niche that permits survival of clonogenic macrophage progenitors that can return to the marrow and repopulate the macrophage progenitor population, to produce a new generation of macrophages in response to CSF1. The same finding also indicates that the bone marrow contains a population of committed progenitor cells for the macrophage lineage that appear to be distinct from the pluripotent stem cells. Pluripotent stem cells did not apparently survive the embryonic environment available at the time of transfer, given that only macrophages were of donor origin in the chimeras. The macrophage progenitors that survive in the early embryonic environment may be the equivalent of the cells described recently in the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] or the high proliferative-potential macrophage colony-stimulating unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p>Yolk sac-derived blood cells that presented prior to the onset of definitive hematopoiesis were capable of extensive proliferation in response to chicken CSF1 <italic>ex vivo</italic>. When transplanted, they were apparently able to populate the same macrophage populations in the embryo as those derived from the bone marrow. But, unlike bone marrow-derived cells, macrophages derived from yolk sac donors were not retained into the adult bird (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Because neither the yolk sac cells, nor the bone marrow cells, were pure populations, we cannot eliminate the possibility that there was a quantitative difference in the number of transferred precursor cells. The recent literature from mouse systems, based on the study of lineage trace and myb-knockout mice, has accepted that many yolk sac-derived macrophages persist as a substantial distinct population in the adult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. By contrast, a recent study by Epelman <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] concluded that liver, heart and brain were the only mouse organs in which yolk sac-derived macrophages persist into adulthood in significant numbers, and even then they were a minor subpopulation. As discussed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], our interpretation of the data in mouse and the current data for the chick is that yolk sac-derived and definitive macrophages can occupy the same specific niches and in normal development the cells derived from the yolk sac are replaced by fetal liver or bone marrow monocyte-derived cells.</p><p>We have shown that CSF1 and IL34 are expressed during chicken embryonic development. By injecting a novel form of recombinant CSF1, chicken CSF1-Fc, into both the developing embryo and the hatchling bird, we have shown that CSF1R signaling is limiting for the proliferation and differentiation of tissue macrophages in birds as it is in mammals. <italic>Inter alia</italic>, these observations further highlight the utility of the MacGreen and MacRed reporter genes in the chick to monitor alterations in mononuclear phagocyte number, location and behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. One unexpected effect of chicken CSF1-Fc in hatchlings was the increase in lymphocytes as well as monocytes, since these cells do not express CSF1R. This could arise because of the remarkable concentration of CSF1R-expressing cells in white pulp of spleen, and in the bursa. This is not the case in mammals, where macrophages are largely confined to red pulp and marginal zones. It may be that the CSF1-stimulated macrophages produce factors that promote lymphocyte proliferation or migration. Alternatively, in the mouse, pigCSF1-Fc treatment greatly increased tissue macrophage numbers, through both local proliferation and monocyte extravasation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. So, in the treated chicks, the chicken CSF1-Fc could act in at least two ways, by promoting proliferation of precursors and tissue macrophages, and by driving the monocytes selectively to leave the circulation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Data we have presented here support the use of the chick model in the study of monocytopoiesis, and demonstrate that CSF1R transgenic reporters will enable the visualization of key events in monocyte-macrophage development.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Antibodies and dilutions used were as follows: chicken CD3 (clone CT3, Southern Biotech, Birmingham, Alabama, USA), 1:100 for FACS; Bu-1 (clone AV20, Southern Biotech), 1:1,000 for FACS, 1:300 for immunofluorescence; CD45 (clone AV53), 1:1,000 for FACS and immunofluorescence; chicken CSF1R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], 1:100 for immunofluorescence; GFP Rabbit IgG Antibody Fraction, Alexa Fluor 488 Conjugate (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 1:500 for immunofluorescence; Goat-anti-mouse-IgG1-alexa 647 (Invitrogen), 1:5,000 for FACS; Alexa Fluor 546&#x000a0;F(ab')2 Fragment of Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (Invitrogen), 1:500 for immunofluorescence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Cells and animals</title><p>DF-1 cells were originally obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, UK), and grown in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml penicillin and 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin (P/S), 10% FBS (PAA/GE Healthcare Life Sciences, UK) and 2% chick serum (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) by volume at 39&#x000b0;C.</p><p>CHO cells were originally obtained from ATCC, and grown in Hams-F12 media (Life Technologies, UK) supplemented with 10% FBS, non-essential amino acids and sodium pyruvate at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2.</sub></p><p>Ba/F3 cells expressing the chicken CSF1R were described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and were used in the generation and characterization of monoclonal antibodies against the chicken CSF1R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], also used herein.
