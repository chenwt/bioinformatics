They contain &#x0201c;sensor&#x0201d; proteins that are responsible for detecting various microbial and environmental danger signals and function by activating caspase-1, an enzyme that mediates cleavage and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18. <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is a highly successful protozoan parasite capable of infecting a wide range of host species that have variable levels of resistance. Rat strains have been previously shown to vary in their susceptibility to this parasite. We report here that rat macrophages from different inbred strains also vary in sensitivity to <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> induced lysis. We find that NLRP1, an inflammasome sensor whose only known agonist is anthrax LT, is also activated by <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection. In rats there is a perfect correlation between NLRP1 sequence and macrophage sensitivity to <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>-induced rapid cell death, inhibition of parasite proliferation, and IL-1&#x003b2;/IL-18 processing. <italic>Nlrp1</italic> genes from sensitive rat macrophages can confer sensitivity to this rapid cell death when expressed in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> resistant rat macrophages.

Different <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains also differ in virulence within the same host, suggesting variation in effectors among parasite strains and/or their impact in various hosts. Host innate immunity is known to play a critical role in susceptibility to infection. In mice, for example, resistance to <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection is critically dependent on the induction of IL-12, which subsequently induces IFN-&#x003b3;, the main mediator of toxoplasmicidal activities (for review, see <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Melo1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>).</p><p>Rats, like humans, are quite resistant to <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection when compared to mice. However varying levels of resistance also exist among rat strains. The resistance of the Lewis (LEW) strain is characterized by total clearance of the parasite, failure to develop cysts and the absence of a strong antibody response. Fischer (CDF) and Brown Norway (BN) rats, however, are susceptible to chronic infection and develop transmissible cysts in their brain and muscle tissue <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Cavailles1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Sergent1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.

We noted that this locus overlaps with the locus that controls rat and macrophage sensitivity to the anthrax lethal toxin (LT) protease. Inbred rat strains and their macrophages exhibit a perfectly dichotomous phenotype in response to LT: animals either die rapidly (&#x0003c;1 h) or exhibit complete resistance to the toxin <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Newman1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Only macrophages from LT-sensitive rat strains undergo rapid caspase-1 dependent death (pyroptosis).

SNP analyses and sequence correlation to phenotype implicated the inflammasome sensor <italic>Nlrp1</italic> (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat protein 1) as the likely susceptibility locus. NLRP1 is a member of the NLR cytosolic family of pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecule (PAMP) sensors, the activation of which leads to recruitment and autoproteolytic activation of caspase-1, followed by cleavage and release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18. NLR-mediated activation of caspase-1 is typically accompanied by rapid death of macrophages through a process known as pyroptosis (for review see <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Lamkanfi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>).

Nucleotide positions correspond to the RGSC3.4 assembly. Further fine mapping analyses were performed by whole transcriptome sequencing and novel SNP identification. RNA (Qiagen RNeasy Plus kit) was isolated from unprimed and LPS-primed (100 ng/ml) LEW and SD BMDMs or LPS-primed BN BMDMs. mRNA purified by polyA-tail enrichment (Dynabeads mRNA Purification Kit, Invitrogen) was fragmented into 200&#x02013;400 bp, and reverse transcribed into cDNA before Illumina sequencing adapters (Illumina, San Diego, CA) were added to each end. Libraries were barcoded, multiplexed into 5 samples per sequencing lane in the Illumina HiSeq 2000, and sequenced from both ends (60 bp reads after discarding the barcodes). Sequences were mapped to the Rat genome (rn4) using Bowtie (2.0.2) <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Langmead1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and Tophat (v2.0.4) <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Trapnell1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. To identify SNPs from the RNAseq data in the interval fine mapped above, Bam files were processed with samtools (0.1.16, r963:234) mpileup function, with rn4 as reference sequence. Read pileups were processed across all five samples using VarScan.v2.2.11 and the mpileup2snp function (parameters: &#x02013;min-coverage 2 &#x02013;min-reads2 1 &#x02013;min-var-freq 0.01 &#x02013;p-value 0.05 &#x02013;variants). Resulting variant positions were annotated using UCSC Genome Browser's &#x0201c;Variant Annotation Integrator&#x0201d;. SNPs identified between 5 samples (2 SD, 2 LEW, 1 BN) were filtered for concordance and homozygosity between the two independent LEW samples and BN having the same nucleotide as the reference genome (which is from BN), and subsequently filtered for non-synonymous SNPs where LEW differed from BN and SD. It should be noted that not all known LEW SNPs in <italic>Nlrp1</italic> are discovered using this procedure as the N-terminal NLRP1 region contains a stretch of eight amino acids that differ between LEW and BN and our procedure for mapping reads to the genome does not allow for that many mismatches.

NLRP1 was previously shown to control rat macrophage sensitivity to pyroptosis by the anthrax protease LT. Sequencing of twelve inbred rat strains revealed five highly homologous variants, two encoding NLRP1 protein sensitive to LT-mediated cleavage activation (NLRP1<sup>variant 1,2</sup>), and three which encode LT-resistant proteins (NLRP1<sup>variant 3,4,5</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003927-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

Therefore we investigated whether macrophages from rats expressing different NLRP1 variants also differed in inflammasome activation and pyroptosis upon parasite infection. Inflammasome activation was assessed by monitoring cell death and cleavage of pro-IL-1&#x003b2; (37 kD) with subsequent secretion of mature active IL-1&#x003b2; (17 kD). We infected BMDMs from LT-sensitive CDF, BN or SD (NLRP1<sup>variant 1,2</sup>) rat strains and LT-resistant LEW and SHR (NLRP1<sup>variant 5</sup>) rat strains with luciferase-expressing Type I (RH) and Type II (76K, or PRU) <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains at various MOIs.

Sixty-five of the 133 genes in the fine-mapped region were expressed (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads &#x0003e;2) but only five of these contained non-synonymous SNPs that distinguished LEW from SD/BN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003927.s009">Dataset S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003927.s004">Figure S4</xref>).

Because cell death was consistently dependent on MOI, we tested whether parasite invasion was required for cell death, as <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> can secrete effectors from its rhoptry organelle directly into the host cytoplasm. Parasites treated with Mycalolide B, a drug that blocks invasion but allows for secretion of microneme and rhoptry contents, attached but were unable to kill BMDMs, indicating that macrophage sensitivity to cell death was invasion-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003927-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Mycalolide B did not affect the viability of parasites or their ability to secrete rhoptry contents as verified by the observation that every cell with an attached mycalolide-B-treated parasite also had protein kinase ROP16 activation of STAT6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003927.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Because <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> needs host cells for replication and the parasite replicates equally well in fibroblasts from different rat strains <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Cavailles1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, we hypothesized that rapid macrophage cell death prevents <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> replication. We therefore investigated parasite proliferation in BMDMs from the different rat strains. <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> burden, as measured by bioluminescence, was significantly higher in infected NLRP1<sup>variant 1,2</sup> -expressing BMDMs than NLRP1<sup>variant 5</sup> -expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003927-g004">Figure 4B, 4C</xref>).

Similarly, GFP signal indicative of parasite load was higher in resistant cells from these rat strains (data not shown).

We found that there was a significant protection against LEW macrophage death in cells transfected with <italic>Nlrp1</italic> siRNA, compared to control siRNA, under conditions where 100% of BMDMs succumbed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003927-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>). The 20&#x02013;30% difference in viability was correlated with the number of successfully transfected cells, as reflected by the all-or-none nature of the protection in individual cells assessed by microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003927-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, inset).

Nonsurviving cells were completely detached from monolayers. A second method of knockdown by lentiviral delivery of a homologous mouse <italic>Nlrp1b</italic> shRNA was used to achieve a 2.2-fold reduction in <italic>Nlrp1</italic> expression compared to controls infected with a scrambled shRNA.

All tested mouse macrophages from any inbred strain, to date, have been resistant to <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>-induced pyroptosis (data not shown and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003927.s008">Figure S8</xref>, panel C). The competition of endogenous murine NLRP1a and NLRP1b proteins for co-factors required for pyroptosis in the mouse macrophage may explain this resistance.</p><p>Together, the results presented in this work indicate that <italic>Nlrp1</italic> expression contributes to the ability of BMDMs from rats resistant to <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection to control parasite replication, most likely because of its role in mediating <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>-induced macrophage pyroptosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The <italic>Toxo1</italic> locus that controls rat susceptibility to toxoplasmosis <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Cavailles1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> was previously mapped to a region of rat chromosome 10 containing the inflammasome sensor <italic>Nlrp1</italic>. In this work we identify <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> as a novel pathogen activator of the NLRP1 inflammasome. Until this work, anthrax LT was the only known activator of this inflammasome sensor <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Newman1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Levinsohn1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Hellmich1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. We now demonstrate that like LT, rapid <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>-induced rat macrophage cell death is a pyroptotic event for which sensitivity correlates to NLRP1 sequence. Type I, Type II and a variety of genetically diverse <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains induce rapid pyroptosis in macrophages derived from inbred rats expressing NLRP1<sup>variant 5</sup>, while macrophages from BMDMs expressing NLRP1<sup>variant 1,2</sup> are resistant to the parasite. This is the inverse of what is known for LT, where NLRP1<sup>variant 1,2</sup> confers sensitivity <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Newman1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In rats, macrophage sensitivity to <italic>Toxoplasma-</italic>induced cell death inversely correlates with whole animal resistance to infection. Rat strains historically susceptible to chronic <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection (e.g., CDF, BN, SD; NLRP1<sup>variant 1,2</sup>) have pyroptosis-resistant macrophages whereas resistant rats that cure infection (e.g., LEW, SHR; NLRP1<sup>variant 5</sup>) harbor macrophages that undergo parasite-induced pyroptosis. This suggests that the ability of the macrophage to allow parasite proliferation and possibly dissemination is linked to resistance to parasite-induced macrophage pyroptosis. Similar findings were previously described for mouse <italic>Nlrp1b</italic>-mediated control of anthrax infection. Mice resistant to <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> have macrophages expressing <italic>Nlrp1b</italic> variants which confer macrophage sensitivity to anthrax LT, and resistance is linked to the IL-1&#x003b2; response induced by toxin <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Moayeri1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Terra1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The idea of control of parasite proliferation at the macrophage level is supported by findings that macrophages are among the first cell types to be infected when an animal ingests <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> cysts or oocysts <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Mordue1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Suzuki1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and innate immune cells are used to traffic from the site of infection to distant sites such as the brain <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Lambert1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>In parallel to the consequences for parasite proliferation after NLRP1 activation, the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18, which are substrates of caspase-1, are cleaved and released following inflammasome activation. We demonstrate that these events only take place after infection of pyroptosis-sensitive macrophages in a manner correlating with NLRP1 sequence. It is possible that the release of these cytokines of the innate immune system could also play a role in controlling toxoplasmosis. IL-18 was at one time known as &#x0201c;IFN-inducing factor&#x0201d; and the role of IFN-&#x003b3; in resistance to <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> is extensively documented (for review see <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Melo1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Hunter1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>). Treatment of resistant LEW rats with anti-IFN-&#x003b3; antibodies does not reverse resistance but results in a much stronger antibody response, while anti-IFN-&#x003b3; antibody treatment in susceptible rats causes an increase in parasite burden <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Sergent1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Altogether these findings suggest that IL-18, (through actions by IFN-&#x003b3;) could be important for inhibition of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> replication in rats, but that the cytokine's actions do not necessarily prevent parasite dissemination. On the other hand, it is important to note that as <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> can replicate and form cysts in many cell types that do not undergo pyroptosis, macrophage death may play a role strictly in dissemination. Thus, we suggest the combined consequences of inflammasome activation, macrophage cell death and IL-1/IL-18 secretion, on both dissemination and parasite proliferation, may ultimately result in resistance to <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>.</p><p>The only difference between the NLRP1 proteins from <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>-resistant and <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>-sensitive inbred strains is an 8 aa polymorphic region in the N-terminus of the protein, in a region of unknown function <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Newman1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. LT cleaves NLRP1<sup>variant 1, 2</sup> proteins to activate this sensor and induce pyroptosis, while NLRP1<sup>variant 5</sup> is resistant to cleavage <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Levinsohn1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. How <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> activation of NLRP1 varies between rat strains based on an 8 aa sequence difference is unclear. The similar induction of pyroptosis we observed with numerous <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains suggests that the factor activating NLRP1 is unlikely to be parasite strain specific, or at least is conserved among multiple strains. One logical hypothesis is that the parasite-encoded effector molecule responsible for activation of NLRP1 is, like LT, a protease, but one which targets the LT-cleavage resistant sequence found in NLRP1<sup>variant 5</sup>. <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> secretes a large number of proteases <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Binder1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1003927-Shea1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. It is unlikely that such a secreted protease could be derived from the rhoptries, because rhoptry secretion into the host cell was not sufficient to induce cell death. To date, we have been unable to observe any cleavage of NLRP1 in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infected fibroblasts which overexpress an HA-tagged variant of the protein (data not shown). It has also been recently shown that <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> can secrete effectors post invasion beyond the parasitophorous vacuole membrane <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Bougdour1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and these could be candidate effectors for NLRP1 activation. An alternative hypothesis to the parasite causing direct cleavage of NLRP1 is that the N-terminal polymorphic region of rat NLRP1 affects this protein's interaction with a different host &#x02018;sensor&#x02019; acting as adaptor for the inflammasome, much in the manner described for the NLRC4/NAIP5/NAIP6 inflammasome recognition of flagellin <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Kofoed1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. This unknown adaptor would interact with <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> or its effectors in all macrophages but may be limited by its ability to interact with the N-terminus of NLRP1<sup>variant 1,2</sup> in rat BMDMs, or alternatively it could act as a direct inhibitor with specificity for these variants. The likelihood of a proteolytic activation of NLRP1 is also reduced when considering the finding that mouse ortholog NLRP1b proteins harbor an LT-cleavage site similar to rat proteins <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Hellmich1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> but are highly resistant to <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>-induced pyroptosis in a manner independent of NLRP1b sequence or LT sensitivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003927.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Furthermore, mouse macrophages could not be sensitized by rat NLRP1 overexpression. This finding was in contrast to the sensitization of the same cells to LT-mediated cell death <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Levinsohn1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, suggesting resistance of mouse macrophages to <italic>Toxoplasma-</italic>induced pyroptosis was dominant to any NLRP1-mediated effect, or (less likely) that co-factors required for parasite-mediated activation were only present in rat cells. Alternatively, the endogenous <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> non-responsive NLRP1a and NLRP1b proteins in mouse macrophages could compete in a dominant manner with expressed rat NLRP1 for co-factors required for pyroptosis. Interestingly, human NLRP1 does not contain an LT cleavage site in its N-terminus (for review see <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Moayeri2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>). Instead human NLRP1 contains a pyrin domain required for association with the adaptor protein ASC <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Faustin1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, which does not appear to play a role in NLRP1-mediated rodent cell death <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Nour1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Broz1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. SNPs prevalent in this N-terminal region of human NLRP1 have been correlated with the severity of human congenital toxoplasmosis <xref rid="ppat.1003927-Witola1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In those studies, knockdown of NLRP1 in human monocytic lines led to reduced cell viability after <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection, perhaps by allowing uncontrolled division of the parasite. Unlike our findings in rat cells, a protective role for human NLRP1 against macrophage death was suggested. It seems likely that the cell death observed in these human cell studies, which occurred over a period of days, differs from NLRP1-mediated rapid pyroptosis of rat cells, which occurs over a period of hours. Future studies are required to determine the mechanism of NLRP1 action in human cells.</p><p>In summary, we have established that <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is a new activator for the NLRP1 inflammasome. The identification of <italic>T. gondii</italic> as the second pathogen to activate the NLRP1 inflammasome raises the question whether this parasite activates the sensor via a novel mechanism, or whether proteolytic cleavage is required, in a manner similar to anthrax LT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1003927.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>Parasite-derived MTT signal and LDH levels.</bold> (A) CDF BMDMs were infected PRU (MOI 1 or 3) and MTT assessed at 6 h post-infection relative to uninfected controls (B) RH parasites at shown MOI were lysed in the absence of cells using the same volume to lyse uninfected BMDM monolayer used in typical experiments and LDH levels measured (C, D) Primed or unprimed (LPS 100 ng/ml, 2 h) LEW BMDMs were infected with RH (MOI 0.5 or 1.0, as indicated) or treated with LEW macrophages or HFFs that had been syringe-lysed and prepared in parallel to parasites.
