These technologies are also being used in novel ways for mRNA expression profiling, genome-wide discovery of transcription-factor binding sites, small RNA discovery, etc. The multitude of sequencing platforms, each with their unique characteristics, pose a number of design challenges, regarding the technology to be used and the depth of sequencing required for a particular sequencing application.

Specifically, we prove that optimal detection and resolution of breakpoints is achieved using a mix of exactly two insert library lengths. Furthermore, we derive explicit formulae to determine these insert length combinations, enabling a 15% improvement in breakpoint detection at the same experimental cost. On empirical short read data, these predictions show good concordance with Illumina 200 bp and 2 Kbp insert length libraries. For transcriptome sequencing, we determine the sequencing depth needed to detect rare transcripts from a small pilot study. With only 1 Million reads, we derive corrections that enable almost perfect prediction of the underlying expression probability distribution, and use this to predict the sequencing depth required to detect low expressed genes with greater than 95% probability.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Together, our results form a generic framework for many design considerations related to high-throughput sequencing.

In genetic variation, whole genome sequencing uncovers a complete catalog of all types of variants including SNPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and structural variations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Transcript sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], small RNA sequencing and CHip-Seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] allow a measurement of dynamic cellular processes. These technologies provide unprecedented opportunities for genomics research but also pose significant new challenges in terms of making the optimal use of the sequencing throughput. The individual laboratory might not be equipped to provide correct, and cost-effective designs for the new experiments. By 'design', we refer to questions such as "How much sequencing needs to be done in order to reliably detect all structural variations in the sample to a resolution of 400 bp?" Confounding this further is the proliferation of a large number of sequencing technologies, including three widely used platforms, Roche/454 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], Illumina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and ABI SOLiD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and others such as Pacific BioSciences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and Helicos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These technologies offer the end-user a bewildering array of design-parameters, including cost per base, read-length, sequencing error rates, clone/insert lengths, etc. It is not straightforward to make a reasoned choice of technology and design-parameters in conducting a particular experiment. Likewise, the technology developers are faced with difficult choices on which parameters to improve in future development.</p><p>For any particular application, the goal of the researcher is to achieve the desired objective in a cost-effective manner. For example, in genome resequencing, the primary objective is the sensitive and accurate identification of various forms of sequence variants. Accurate SNP detection can be achieved even using short 36 bp Illumina reads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, for other applications such as de novo assembly of genomes, longer reads are significantly better than short reads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. RNA-seq is a novel application of sequencing to determine the expression levels of different mRNA transcripts in the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, the exponential variability in transcript expression levels poses new design questions regarding the required depth of sequencing to sample low abundance transcripts. Resolving such design questions can allow one to expand the scope of next-generation sequencing in novel directions. In this paper, we address and resolve some of the common design questions relating to structural variation and transcript profiling.</p><sec><title>Structural variation</title><p>Structural variations (SVs) refer to events that rearrange a genome (<italic>query</italic>) relative to a reference genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and include deletions, insertions, inversions and translocations of genomic regions. Paired-end Sequence Mapping (PEM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] represents a powerful approach to detect such events. In PEM, the ends of a large number of randomly selected inserts (clones) from the genome of an individual (query) are sequenced, and mapped to a reference genome. Inserts which map aberrantly to the reference genome in distance or orientation form an "invalid pair" and suggest an SV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The general approach underlying PEM is illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a-d</xref>. A number of recent informatics tools have been developed for the systematic detection of structural variation using the PEM framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Applications of next-generation sequencing</bold>.

Consider the <italic>deletion </italic>event in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>. A reference segment of length <italic>l </italic>= <italic>b </italic>- <italic>a </italic>+ 1 is absent in the query, relative to the reference. For the breakpoint (<italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>) to be detected a paired-end insert must span <italic>&#x003b6;</italic>. Note that the insert-size is not fixed, but distributed tightly around a mean (<italic>L </italic>&#x000b1; <italic>&#x003c3;</italic>). Deletion is confirmed if the breakpoint is spanned and <italic>l </italic>&#x0003e;&#x0003e;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>. Typically, <italic>&#x003c3; </italic>&#x0003c;&#x0003c;<italic>L </italic>so we simply require that <italic>l </italic>&#x0003e;<italic>L</italic>, which is sufficient but not strictly necessary.</p><p>This approximation illustrates an important difference between 'algorithm design' for SV detection, and experiment design. Using a clever algorithm based on higher coverage, and variation in insert length (<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>), it may be possible to detect smaller deletions (<italic>&#x003c3; </italic>&#x0003c;<italic>l </italic>&#x0003c;<italic>L</italic>) as well. however, in deciding how much sequencing is done, we simply focus only on <italic>l </italic>&#x0003e;<italic>L</italic>. This simplification allows us to handle many different types of SV using identical design criteria. The similarity to other cases is described below.</p><p>The case of <italic>inversion </italic>is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>. Here, two breakpoints, (<italic>a</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>b</italic><sub>1</sub>), and (<italic>a</italic><sub>2</sub>, <italic>b</italic><sub>2</sub>) are fused together in the query. Denote the length of the inversion SV as <italic>l </italic>= <italic>b</italic><sub>1 </sub>- <italic>a</italic><sub>1 </sub>= <italic>b</italic><sub>2 </sub>- <italic>a</italic><sub>2</sub>. The inversion is detected when both breakpoints are detected. As in the case of deletions, either breakpoint is detected when a shotgun insert of the query spans the corresponding fusion point, and has exactly one end-point inside the inversion. We enforce this by requiring that <italic>L </italic>&#x0003c;<italic>l</italic>, even though the condition is sufficient but not strictly necessary.</p><p>The case of <italic>insertion </italic>into a query sequence, relative to the reference, is slightly more complex, and can be broken into two sub-cases. In the first case (mediated by transpositions, or chromosomal translocations), a distal region <italic>b</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>b</italic><sub>2 </sub>of the reference genome is inserted at coordinate <italic>a</italic><sub>1</sub>, creating at least 2 breakpoints ((<italic>a</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>b</italic><sub>1</sub>), and (<italic>b</italic><sub>2</sub>, <italic>a</italic><sub>2</sub>) in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). Let <italic>l </italic>= <italic>b</italic><sub>2 </sub>- <italic>b</italic><sub>1 </sub>denote the length of the insertion SV. Again, SV detection depends upon the detection of 2 or more breakpoints. If on the other hand, the inserted sequence is not in the reference genome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>), then detection is challenging, often involving a <italic>de novo </italic>assembly of the inserted region (see Bentley, 2009, Figure S21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). We do not consider this case further. The case analysis above reveals the following common thread. An SV is characterized by its length <italic>l</italic>, and a collection of breakpoints. For an SV to be detected,</p><p>1. One or more of the SV breakpoints must be detected.</p><p>2. For each breakpoint:</p><p>(a) A shotgun insert must span the corresponding fusion point.</p><p>(b) The reads at the ends of the insert must map unambiguously to the ends.</p><p>(c) The insert-size must be dominated by the SV length (<italic>l </italic>&#x0003e;<italic>L</italic>).</p><p>This abstraction clarifies the design questions considerably. While the algorithmic questions must still deal with each SV separately, the design questions focus on breakpoint detection. We consider 2(b, c) first. For any choice of technology, and insert length, the distribution can be empirically computed by looking at concordantly mapped reads. Using this distribution, we can compute the probability of a randomly picked insert having a specific size.</p><p>Consider a typical experiment for SV detection. The researcher would like to detect a large fraction of all SVs of length &#x02265; <italic>l</italic>, with high confidence (&#x02265; 1 - <italic>&#x003b5;</italic>). They must choose (a) a specific instrument technology; (b) insert-size(s) from the ones available; (c) read-length, and (d) the amount of sequencing. First, the researcher must choose a technology and insert-size constraint, where<disp-formula id="bmcM1"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-11-385-i1.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p>The choice of a specific read-length is somewhat less important, but the reads must be long and accurate enough to map unambiguously. We model both points by introducing a parameter <italic>f</italic>, referring to the fraction of reads that map unambiguously. Therefore if <italic>N </italic>inserts must map unambiguously to satisfy design constraints, then <italic>N/f </italic>inserts need to be sequenced, on the average. In the remainder, we limit the discussion to detecting breakpoints, considering only the technologies and insert sizes that satisfy the size-constraint (1); and, we assume a mapping parameter <italic>f </italic>to scale the answers. The issue now is to choose from available insert-sizes, and second, to determine the amount of sequencing. In this paper, we formulate, and resolve design issue 2(a) as:</p><p>&#x02022; <italic>Given a choice of insert-sizes, and parameter <roman>&#x003b5;</roman>, compute the amount of sequencing needed to detect </italic>1 - <italic>&#x003b5; of all breakpoints in the query genome</italic>.</p><p>We address the questions of breakpoint detection conjunction with the related notion of breakpoint <italic>resolution</italic>. With most technologies, a breakpoint detected as a pair of regions ([<italic>a</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>a</italic><sub>2</sub>], [<italic>b</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>b</italic><sub>2</sub>]), such that <italic>a </italic>&#x02208; [<italic>a</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>a</italic><sub>2</sub>], and <italic>b </italic>&#x02208; [<italic>b</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>b</italic><sub>2</sub>]. The resolution, defined by |<italic>a</italic><sub>2 </sub>- <italic>a</italic><sub>1</sub>| + |<italic>b</italic><sub>2 </sub>- <italic>b</italic><sub>1</sub>| refers to the uncertainty in determining (<italic>a, b</italic>). Good resolution is critical elucidating the phenotypic impact of the variation In an earlier work, we described the use of tightly re solved breakpoints in detecting gene fusion events cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This framework was extended to form general geometric approach for detecting structural variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We reformulate and resolve the question</p><p>&#x02022; <italic>Given a choice of insert-sizes, and parameters &#x003b5;, s, compute the amount of sequencing needed to detect </italic>1 - <italic>&#x003b5; of all breakpoints in the query genome to a resolution of &#x02264; s bp</italic>.</p><p>Intuitively, the likelihood of detection would be maximized by choosing the largest available insert-size. However, the longer insert-sizes increase the uncertainty in resolving the breakpoint. One result of our paper is an explicit trade-off between detection and resolution. We also derive a formula that computes the probability of resolving a breakpoint to within '<italic>s</italic>' base-pairs, given a fixed number of shotgun reads from a specific paired-end sequencing technology. Another result of our paper is that it is advantageous to use a mix of insert-sizes. For example, we can show that only 1.5&#x000d7; mapped sequence coverage of the human genome using Illumina (Solexa) can help resolve almost 90% of the breakpoints to within 200 bp using a mix of inserts. All other parameters being equal, we show that the best resolution of a structural variant comes from using exactly two possible insert-lengths: one that is as close as possible to the desired resolution, and one that is as long as technologically possible (with reasonable quality).</p><p>In summary, the researcher can use our formulae in designing his experiment to (a) select appropriate insert-sizes; (b), the optimum amount of sequencing for each insert library. A web-based tool based on the above is available.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Transcript sequencing</title><p>Transcript sequencing is a direct approach for measuring abundance, and variations involving splicing, and SV mediated gene disruptions, and fusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In most transcript sequencing methods, RNA is fragmented, and converted into cDNA, which is subsequently sequenced and mapped back to a reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This protocol has shown great promise in detecting aberrant splice forms and SVs that lead to gene disruptions, and fusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Often, transcript sequencing is used for gene expression profiling. See Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1e</xref>. The significant difference in sampled reads (5 to 1) between Samples 1 and 2 suggests that gene A's expression level has changed between the two samples. In measuring relative abundance, RNAseq mimics older technologies like microarrays. However, sequencing stands alone in being able to compute relative abundance between two distinct transcripts. In sample 1, the difference in read coverage between genes A and B suggest that A is more than twice as abundant as B (assuming A and B are approximately the same length).</p><p>Let <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>t </italic></sub>denote the <italic>true-expression </italic>of transcript <italic>t</italic>, defined as the number of copies of <italic>t </italic>in the sample. Additionally, the transcript is broken into a number of pieces, roughly proportional to its length, <italic>l</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>. Therefore, we assume that transcript <italic>t </italic>yields &#x0221d; <italic>l</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub><italic>x</italic><sub><italic>t </italic></sub>copies in the sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This contrasts with earlier technologies like EST sequencing, which were biased towards the 3' (or 5') end. Let <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>t </italic></sub>denote the number of sequences sampled from <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>. We denote the <italic>normalized-expression </italic>for <italic>t </italic>(likelihood of a randomly sampled read coming from <italic>t</italic>) by<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-11-385-i2.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p>A typical design question for transcript sequencing is to determine the amount of sequencing required to sample a given fraction (Say, 90%) of the expressed transcripts. The question is particularly difficult to answer because different transcripts have vastly different normalized-expression values. Using empirical and analytical observations, we show that the p.d.f of the normalized-expression can be computed using a small sample. Therefore, a researcher can start with an initial sequencing run (&#x0003c; 500 K reads), and use the mapping data to compute the additional amount of sequencing needed. Formally, we resolve the following:</p><p>&#x02022; <italic>Given transcript mappings from a small sample of sequences, and parameter &#x003b5;, compute the amount of additional sequencing needed to detect </italic>1 - <italic>&#x003b5; of all expressed transcripts</italic>.</p><p>Our results are based on novel extrapolation for the low abundance genes that are not accurately represented in the sample. They allow the researchers to efficiently allocate resources for large RNA sequencing studies. This is particularly relevant when many related samples are being sequenced and one needs to assess the trade-offs between sequencing depth and sample coverage.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Structural Variation</title><p>As discussed in the introduction, we can limit the question of SV detection to detection of SV breakpoints.

For a fixed amount of sequencing, we confirmed the theoretically predicted boost in probability of detecting a breakpoint to within a resolution-ambiguity of 200 bp. The results are in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. The probability is doubled from 0.15 to over 0.29 using a mix of insert libraries. Similar results are obtained for other sequencing studies, such as an ABI SOLiD sequencing with 600 and 2700 length libraries (data not shown). In a further extension of the analysis, we show that to maximize the likelihood of resolving breakpoints to <italic>s</italic>bp, we need only two libraries-one with insert-length <italic>s</italic>, and the other as large as possible (see METHODS). A restatement of these results can be found in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. We note that only 1.5&#x000d7; mapped sequence coverage of the human genome using Illumina (Solexa) can help resolve almost 90% of the breakpoints to within 200 bp using a mix of inserts. Similar results were obtained when applied to runs from the ABI SOLiD system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>While our analytical results treat the insert sizes as fixed, empirical data very closely approximates the theoretical curve (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, dotted lines). Though the theoretical model performs better (mostly due to mapping variation resulting from repeat-like genomic regions), the magnitude of the 'boost' at 200 bp is maintained. The concordance between theoretical and experimental results shows the limited effect of insert-length variation.</p><p>It is useful to revisit the case of SVs with very small lengths. Mechanisms such as non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), often gives rise to small insertions and deletions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], that are valuable as genetic markers. If the event size is smaller than the variance in available insert-size, the event will not be detected by paired end mapping (in the case of deletions and insertions). In these situations, detection is improved by longer reads (such as those available in Roche-454). If single reads are used to detect the fusion point, then there is no ambiguity in resolution. In that case, the design question becomes simple, and the desired number of reads can be computed using the Clark-Carbon formula, and scaled using the mapping parameter <italic>f</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Transcript sequencing</title><p>As transcripts have variable expression, the amount of sequencing needed to detect a transcript is variable. A key design issue is to determine if sufficient sequencing has been performed to sample all transcripts at a certain expression level. For example, in large patient surveys one needs to identify the number of samples that can be sequenced at minimal cost, while ensuring detection of genes at a desired expression level. Similarly, when evaluating a given sample it is important to know whether the required sequencing depth has been reached, or if more sequencing is necessary to detect a given transcript, isoform, or fusion gene. We show here that a relatively low level of transcriptomic sequencing has sufficient information regarding the variability of expression that it can be used to compute the likelihood of a specific transcript being sampled.</p><p>While deep sequencing is required to accurately estimate the normalized expression, <italic>&#x003bd;</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>, for each transcript, <italic>t</italic>, a more modest level of sequencing allows us to estimate the distribution of <italic>&#x003bd; </italic>values among all transcripts.

Our study provides a systematic explanation for empirical observations relating to the amount of sequencing, and the choice of technologies. The theoretical analysis is not without caveats, which are discussed below. Nevertheless, the concordance with empirical data illustrates the applicability of our methods. Some of the results, while not counter-intuitive, provide additional insight. For example, we show that the best design for detecting SV to within 's' bp demands the choice of exactly two insert-lengths, one close to <italic>s</italic>, and the other as large as possible. We explicate the trade-offs between detection and resolution, and provide a method for computing the probability of SV detection as well as the expected resolution-ambiguity for a variety of technology and parameter choices.</p><p>Many additional confounding design issues that can be modeled in the context of structural variation. Different technologies have different error rates. This is corrected by introducing a mapping-rate parameter <italic>f</italic>, defined as the fraction of reads that are mapped unambiguously to the reference. Replacing the number of reads <italic>N </italic>by <italic>fN </italic>helps correct somewhat for sequencing errors. New methods have been suggested for dealing with complex scenarios in which it is difficult or impossible to map reads uniquely, such as within recent segmental duplications, using hill climbing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] or parsimony [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] based approaches which try to minimize the number of observed structural variants. Chimerisms in insert-lengths can be controlled by demanding the use of multiple overlapping inserts. We have extended most analyses to requiring two or more inserts (see METHODS).</p><p>An important simplification in our analysis is to treat insert-length as constant. However, choosing a distribution on the insert-length does not influence the expected resolution-ambiguity, only its variance. The variance is important for measuring smaller structural variations. Therefore, experiments that aim to detect small structural variations are constrained to using technologies in which the insert-length variation is significantly smaller than the size of the SV itself. The available technologies are constantly reducing the variance in insert-lengths through better library preparation strategies, which might allow the use of larger insert-lengths in the future.</p><p>For transcript sequencing, we address the important question of depth of sequencing, given the large variation in transcript abundance. Our results suggest that estimating the distribution of normalized expression values with modest amounts of sequencing can help address design questions for transcript sequencing, even when the transcript abundance varies over many orders of magnitude. This approach has a number of caveats, for example, it assumes unbiased sampling of transcripts. Current library preparations have been shown to have biases (such as 3' and 5' depletion) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] as well as biases towards specific RNAs (specifically small RNAs) within a platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Additionally, though our results indicate a very good empirical fit on human samples, the assumption of a power-law, or other distribution, may not fit all samples. A number of outstanding questions remain, such as the detection of splicing events, and the resolution of breakpoints. While transcript sequencing is a quick way to detect breakpoints, the location of the breakpoint is confounded by trans-splicing. The issues relating to design can be better resolved only after methods are discovered to resolve breakpoints and predict splicing events based on transcriptome sequencing.</p><p>We do not address some important applications of next generation sequencing technologies: the detection of rare (and common) sequence variants in re-sequencing studies. Given the relatively high error rates for some of these technologies, reliable and accurate detection of sequence variants (SNPs) is a challenging problem, and general design principles that would be applicable to all technologies will be addressed in future study. The design of sequencing for 'dark-region' identification (i.e. DNA inserts on the sampled genome that are not in the reference) is not addressed. Lastly, there are practical sample preparation issues which demand consideration. Longer insert-lengths consume more sample for equivalent amount of sequencing. Therefore, if the sample is limited (as in tumors), the best design should also seek to optimize a 'sample-cost' versus detection trade-off.</p><p>Technological developments all point to the rapid deployment of personalized genomic sequencing. As large populations of individuals are sequenced, and the sequence is analyzed for a variety of applications, design issues relating to the amount of sequencing, the choice of technology, and the choice of technological parameters become paramount. Our paper helps resolve some of these questions. As current technologies mature and new technologies arise it will be critical to further develop a framework to maximize study efficacy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Breakpoint Resolution</title><p>The insert coverage is given by <italic>c </italic>= <italic>N L/G </italic>where <italic>N </italic>is the number of inserts.

The corrected p.d.f. utilizes the empirically generated p.d.f after this reliable point, and the theoretical p.d.f before then. It is important to note that the empirical p.d.f. derived using all reads implies that there is a drop off in abundance for very low abundance genes, which the fitting procedure would over-predict. However, this could be an artifact of incomplete sampling and a regression of the full data may provide a better estimate.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>A.B., V.Bansal, and V.
