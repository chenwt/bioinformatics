We posited that robust biomarkers could be obtained by identifying deregulated biological processes shared among tumor types having a common etiology. We performed a gene set enrichment analysis in 20 publicly available gene expression datasets comprising 1968 patients having one of the three most common tobacco-related cancers (lung, bladder, head and neck) and identified cell cycle related genes as the most consistently prognostic class of biomarkers in bladder (BL) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We also found the prognostic value of 13 of 14 published BL and LUAD signatures were dependent on cell cycle related genes, supporting the importance of cell cycle related biomarkers for prognosis. Interestingly, no prognostic gene classes were identified in squamous cell lung carcinoma or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Next, a specific 31 gene cell cycle proliferation (CCP) signature, previously derived in prostate tumors was evaluated and found predictive of outcome in BL and LUAD cohorts in univariate and multivariate analyses. Specifically, CCP score significantly enhanced the predictive ability of multivariate models based on standard clinical variables for progression in BL patients and survival in LUAD patients in multiple cohorts. We then generated random CCP signatures of various sizes and found sets of 10&#x02013;15 genes had robust performance in these BL and LUAD cohorts, a finding that was confirmed in an independent cohort. Our work characterizes the importance of cell cycle related genes in prognostic signatures for BL and LUAD patients and identifies a specific signature likely to survive additional validation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work is supported in part by National Institutes of Health grants CA075115 and CA104106.

However, few multi-gene biomarkers have been approved for clinical use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085249-Diamandis1">[4]</xref> in part because they lack robustness across multiple datasets. This is especially striking for bladder cancer where Lauss and associates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085249-Lauss1">[5]</xref> evaluated 28 published gene signatures designed for diagnostic and prognostic purposes for bladder cancer and found that none of the 6 survival signatures performed better than chance when applied to independent datasets.</p><p>Here we address this lack of robust prognostic biomarkers by postulating the existence of common cellular processes (modules) across multiple tumor types of common etiology, whose abnormal activity could be captured by a transcriptional signature. As our goal was to develop robust bladder cancer biomarkers, we selected additional cancer types with smoking as a well-defined major etiological factor. The identification of such a process would presumably allow for development of robust biomarkers that are prognostic across multiple patient cohorts and tumor types.</p><p>An overview of our analysis is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085249-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>. First, a gene set enrichment analysis of gene expression profiles from 1968 patients with tobacco-related cancers (bladder urothelial cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma) was performed and identified cycle related modules as consistently prognostic in bladder and lung adenocarcinoma. We found that a specific cell cycle gene signature was predictive of outcome in bladder and lung adenocarcinoma and that the performance of published bladder and lung adenocarcinoma signatures depended on cell cycle-correlated genes. Next we developed and evaluated a 12 gene panel of cell cycle related genes and found them effective in stratifying clinical outcome in an independent cohort. Our results characterize the core importance of cell cycle related biomarkers in prognostic gene signatures in patients with common cancer types and implicate cell proliferation as the primary driver of disease outcome. More broadly, this approach defines functionally dominant biological modules driving human cancer prognosis and identifies robust prognostic biomarkers.</p><fig id="pone-0085249-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0085249.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Study overview and summary of major findings.</title><p><bold>A,</bold> Biological processes associated with survival in tobacco-related tumors were identified through a gene set enrichment analysis.

Three BL cohorts had progression information, which was defined by the original authors as increase from NMI to MI disease (Lindgren and Dyrskjot cohorts, Ref # <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085249-Dyrskjot1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085249-Lindgren1">[8]</xref>), or any increase in stage (CNUH, Ref # <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085249-Lee1">[9]</xref>). For two cohorts (Lindgren and CNUH) time to progression was not available and the ability of a gene or signature score to predict progression (progressor vs. non-progressor) was evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). In Dyrskjot, clinical follow-up time was available allowing for progression-free survival (PFS) analysis.</p><p>The survival endpoint was selected as follows. Disease-specific survival (DSS) was always used if available (three BL cohorts). Overall survival (OS) was used if DSS was unavailable (two BL, seven LUAD, and two LUSC cohorts). Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was used if neither DSS nor OS were available (one LUAD and two HNSCC cohorts). The events for these endpoints are death from disease, death from any cause, and disease recurrence, for DSS, OS, and RFS, respectively. In one additional HNSCC cohort (Colo, Ref # <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085249-Colo1">[10]</xref>) recurrence status was provided but clinical follow-up times were not, and the ability of a gene to predict recurrence was evaluated by AUC. In addition, nodal involvement strongly correlates with outcome in HNSCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085249-Mamelle1">[11]</xref> and was used as a surrogate for survival in two cohorts allowing for a more comprehensive analysis.

We performed a multivariate analysis and included clinically relevant variables such as age, gender, and grade in the BL and LUAD cohorts where CCP score was prognostic in the univariate analyses. For each cohort we also developed a best multivariate model (i.e., <italic>final model</italic>) through forward stepwise selection of informative variables (P&#x0003c;0.05). Such a model selects a concise, &#x02018;optimal&#x02019; set of variables and may select CCP score over standard clinical variables. Because clinical variables are readily available this <italic>final model</italic> may not be cost-effective currently but may be so in settings where cancers are staged and graded according to their molecular pathology. Finally, we evaluated if CCP score increased the prognostic value of a <italic>best available</italic> model that included clinical variables that are readily available in current settings. Such an increase suggests that CCP score has clinical utility.

When survival was the endpoint, CCP score was the most consistently significant variable in the multivariate analysis (P&#x0003c;0.05), along with stage, which were each significant in three cohorts. CCP score was selected for the <italic>final model</italic> in two of these cohorts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0085249-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>, <bold>Table S7 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0085249.s004">File S4</xref></bold>).

Surprisingly, cell cycle associated genes were not prognostic in tobacco-related tumors with squamous histology. However, we note these cohorts had relatively few patients (&#x0003c;85) which may have precluded the identification of functional processes associated with outcome in these tumor types</p><p>Our data provides important insights beyond the identification of a specific prognostic signature (CCP-12). First, it suggests that in BL and LUAD cancers, prognostic biomarkers will not validate across multiple cohorts unless they are (directly or indirectly) associated with cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085249-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>). Second, our finding that gene expression signatures could predict survival in multiple bladder cancer cohorts was unexpected because a recent validation study found that multiple signatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085249-Blaveri1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085249-SanchezCarbayo1">[26]</xref> derived from datasets examined here (Blaveri, MSKCC) had poor predictive ability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085249-Lauss2">[18]</xref>. Third, our data demonstrates for the first time that robust survival gene expression signatures exist in bladder cancer but only when defined based on functional gene modules. If used on other tumor types, this concept may lead to the development of robust signatures that are more likely to reach clinical practice.</p><p>Our work also tackles an important but seldom addressed issue in biomarker development, the impact of signature size on predictive ability. Cost effectiveness and feasibility of assessing multiple genes in a small quantity of biopsy tissue weigh against the need for large enough signatures that overcome technical variability from the assay and biological variability from tumor sample heterogeneity. Our results indicate the prognostic performance of cell cycle genes plateaus at 10&#x02013;15. In contrast, Haibe-Kains <italic>et. al</italic>. found that in breast cancer the prognostic value of AURKA expression was comparable to multi-gene models. AURKA is one of the cell cycle genes we examined but was not as robust as CCP score, being predictive (P&#x0003c;0.05) in only 5/13 BL and LUAD cohorts (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0085249.s014">Figure S5</xref></bold>). In general, redundancy obtained from multiple genes may overcome the variable quality of RNA derived from fixed tissue, which can cause individual gene assays to fail, thus ensuring robust analytical results. While we found that CCP-12 predicted outcome in an independent cohort additional steps such as defining thresholds that would separate patients into high and low risk groups and prospective evaluation in independent cohorts using predefined endpoints are required before this panel is ready for clinical use.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0085249.s001"><label>File S1</label><caption><p><bold>Supporting Materials, Results and Discussion.</bold></p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0085249.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0085249.s002"><label>File S2</label><caption><p><bold>Summary of bladder cancer (Table S1), lung adenocarcinoma (Table S2), lung squamous cell carcinoma (Table S3), and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (Table S4) patient cohorts.</bold></p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0085249.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0085249.s003"><label>File S3</label><caption><p><bold>Sweave document containing sample </bold><bold><italic>R</italic></bold><bold> code and output.</bold></p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0085249.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0085249.s004"><label>File S4</label><caption><p><bold>Multivariate analyses of progression in bladder cancer (Table S6), survival in bladder cancer (Table S7), and survival in lung adenocarcinoma (Table S8).</bold></p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0085249.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0085249.s005"><label>File S5</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of prognostic power of CCP score and best available clinical variables in bladder (Table S9) and lung adenocarcinoma (Table S10).</bold></p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0085249.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0085249.s006"><label>File S6</label><caption><p><bold>Prognostic modules associated with outcome in tobacco-related cancers (Table S5) (Excel XLSX file).</bold> In each cohort, over-represented Gene Ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathways were identified from lists of genes significantly predictive of disease outcome (progression in BL patients and survival in BL, LUAD, LUSC, and HNSCC patients, P&#x0003c;0.01) using the DAVID gene annotation enrichment analysis toolkit.
