Some species are invasive and have successfully colonized non-native grounds after anthropogenic dispersal and have become pests (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0094098-Costa1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>). Most earwigs are cosmopolitan foragers feeding on plant material including pollen, fruits, and detritus, but they also represent important predators of other invertebrates and their eggs. As a consequence, numerous earwig species are studied for their role in agricultural food webs to improve their efficacy as a biocontrol for pests such as aphids and the fall armyworm, <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic><xref rid="pone.0094098-Moerkens1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094098-Sueldo1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Earwigs form part of the Polyneoptera, an insect lineage still rather poorly resolved phylogenetically <xref rid="pone.0094098-Trautwein1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, and are a phylogenetically ancient insect order (the Dermaptera). The earliest earwig fossils date back to the Jurassic and lowermost Cretaceous (<italic>i.e.</italic> more than 200 Mya, <xref rid="pone.0094098-Engel1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>). The order is characterized by the conspicuous sexually dimorphic un-segmented cerci (&#x0201c;forceps&#x0201d;, <xref rid="pone.0094098-Eberhard1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>), a typically ground-living, often gregarious and nocturnal life-habit, and the ubiquitous occurrence of forms of maternal care <xref rid="pone.0094098-Costa1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The order comprises approximately 1,800 species that are consistently organized in 11 families <xref rid="pone.0094098-Jarvis1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. While the major phylogenetic position and structure of the order are now roughly established <xref rid="pone.0094098-Jarvis1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094098-Simon1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, the details of the phylogenetic relationships among earwig species have not been fully resolved, partly due to lack of genomic data.</p><p>The European earwig (<italic>Forficula auricularia</italic>) is probably the most common and widely distributed earwig species in Europe. Native to the western Euroasian region, it was introduced by human activity in Northern America, Australia and New Zealand where it quickly established and is sometimes regarded as an invasive species and a pest in gardens and agricultural settings <xref rid="pone.0094098-Costa1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The European earwig is also the scientifically best-studied earwig species and has been used as experimental system in various evolutionary contexts, including sexual selection and the evolution of reproductive tactics, maternal care and family interactions <xref rid="pone.0094098-Tomkins1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094098-Lamb1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Females show pronounced maternal care; they protect and clean the eggs, and they provide food and protection to hatched nymphs. While maternal care for the eggs is mandatory, it is facultative for later life stages since the nymphs are mobile and can survive without maternal care by self-foraging (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0094098-Costa1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>). These conditions are thought to approximate ancestral conditions under which parental care originally evolved. Therefore, the European earwig (and other earwig species like <italic>Anisolabis maritima</italic> and <italic>Euborellia annulipes</italic>) is increasingly used as an experimental system to study the evolutionary origin and genetics of parental care and social behavior.</p><p>Yet, despite the scientific interest in earwigs, only little knowledge and data are available at the genomic or proteomic level. The first transcriptomic data of the European earwig was recently published in an attempt to improve the polyneopteran phylogeny <xref rid="pone.0094098-Simon1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Even though this transcriptome is a first step in the establishment of genomic/transcriptomic resources to study earwig biology in molecular terms, it was based on RNA extracted from only adult stage and yielded fragmented and incomplete sequence data. Thus, towards the improvement of the genomic resources needed to study for example gene or genome evolution, gene expression, or insect systematics, we aimed to establish a more comprehensive transcriptome of the European earwig. Here, we present and validate the draft transcriptome based on a hybrid assembly of Roche 454 and Illumina HiSeq data. In order to obtain a more exhaustive representation of transcripts, we combined different tissues (heads, thoraxes, abdomens, brain, and antenna) and developmental stages (eggs, nymphs and adults) from both males and females. As our analysis showed that the published transcriptome is fragmented, incomplete and lacking quality information, we deliberately did not use these published data for our hybrid assembly. After the assembly, we screened our transcriptome for putative microbial contamination. We also annotated transposable elements and removed redundancy, keeping alternative-splice variants. We then estimated the completeness and the fragmentation of our dataset by applying the core Eukaryotic gene mapping approach (CEGMA, <xref rid="pone.0094098-Parra1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>). Our transcriptome was also compared against other insect protein databases to determined protein-coding genes shared with eu-social and non-social insects. This sub-sample was annotated using Gene-Ontology (GO). We eventually established and validated qPCR by studying expression differences in males and females for 5 genes reported as being sex-biased in the honey bee <xref rid="pone.0094098-Zayed1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. We could confirm that some of these genes show expression differences between males and females but also between brain and antenna tissue in earwig. This method will allow us to study the expression of candidate genes putatively involved in maternal care and social behavior in the future.

The not assembled reads from the Roche 454 run, called singletons, were adapter trimmed, quality, and size selected but not included for further analysis. In a first step, the contigs were screened for possible contaminants and transposable elements. The remaining contigs were combined in a hybrid assembly resulting in 89,028 unique contigs.</p><fig id="pone-0094098-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0094098.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Flow chart of the hybrid assembly process.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0094098.g001"/></fig><sec id="s2a"><title>Characterization of non-earwig and transposable element sequences in the pre-assemblies</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Microbiota screening</title><p>Earwigs, as many other organisms, live in close contact to microbial communities. Thus, we carefully prepared the samples in order to reduce level of possible contaminants (see Materials and Methods). In addition, the library preparation discriminated against non-polyadenylated molecules (poly-A enrichment, see Materials and Methods) and further reduced potential bacterial contaminants. Both steps reduced but did not entirely remove microbial contamination. To assess the level of potential remaining contaminants, we applied Pauda <xref rid="pone.0094098-Huson1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> to align the two pre-assemblies against a database of 56 million known proteins from Alveolata, Amoebozoa, Archaea, Bacteria, Fungi, Nematoda, Platyhelminthes and Viruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094098.s004">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>In total, 468 sequences (<italic>i.e.</italic> about 0.5% of all contigs) were putative homologs of microbial proteins. In addition, we identified 152 contigs corresponding to the small (SSU: 16S or 18S rRNA) or large ribosomal subunit (LSU: 23S or 28S rRNA), including 21 contigs specific to arthropods and therefore putatively of earwig origin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094098.s004">Table S1</xref>). Overall, we could assign about 23% of those contigs to a bacterial origin and 60% to a fungal origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094098-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094098.s001">Fig. S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094098.s004">Table S1</xref>). Out of the 50 top genera identified, 39 corresponded to fungi, 4 to bacteria and 1 amoeba all commonly found in soil samples. Interestingly, one of the identified fungi species is an already known parasite isolated from the habitat of the European earwig <xref rid="pone.0094098-Boos1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. With this screening, it is likely that we identified part of the native microbiota of the earwig.

Our approach does not discriminate against all TEs especially the retrotransposons which are polyadenylated <xref rid="pone.0094098-Sabot1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Therefore, active TEs could inflate the number of contigs found in our assemblies and need to be identified and excluded from the final transcriptome. Therefore, we screened our preliminary assemblies for TE specific proteins using RepeatMasker <xref rid="pone.0094098-Smit1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. We identified 2,076 and 694 contigs with significant similarity to known TE protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094098-g003">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094098.s005">Table S2</xref>). The fraction of retrotransposons (class I) and DNA transposons (class II) identified is similar to other transcripome studies in insects (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0094098-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>). In particular, Mariner and Gypsy elements seem to be common in the earwig transcripome.

To estimate the completeness of the hybrid assembly (hereafter designated as the earwig transcriptome), we compared the 89,028 contigs to a set of highly conserved and reliable annotated core proteins (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;458) of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0094098-Parra1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach (CEGMA) showed that the 458 proteins of the core dataset could be unambiguously identified in our transcriptome, with a median value of completeness of 97%. Among those, 252 proteins were fully present (completeness &#x0003e;95%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094098.s006">Table S3</xref>). In order to put this into prospective, the previously published earwig transcriptome used for phylogenetic analysis (Simon et al. 2012) harbors a median value of completeness of 30%, with 20 full proteins only (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094098.s006">Table S3</xref>). This comparison shows that our dataset contains a larger and/or less fragmented fraction of the earwig transcriptome. For this reason, the published transcriptome was not included in our hybrid assembly. This interpretation is also supported when comparing the CEGMA analysis of our transcriptome with the one from other published <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assemblies <xref rid="pone.0094098-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094098-Cornman1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Identification and annotation of the earwig protein core set</title><p>Based on comparison with other insect species and the observation that gene number and average gene length are highly conserved among eukaryotes <xref rid="pone.0094098-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, we assume that approximately 200 Mb of the <italic>F. auricularia</italic> genome is organized in exons. Although we carefully removed potential microbial contamination, diminished TEs sequences, and even reduced redundant transcripts (see Materials and Methods), we believe that our dataset overestimates the number of protein coding genes, a common problem of RNAseq based transcriptome studies. The high number of contigs might also indicate the presence of non-coding transcripts (nc-RNA <xref rid="pone.0094098-Latos1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>), pseudogenes <xref rid="pone.0094098-Wenger1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> or sequences errors (e.g. chimeras, <xref rid="pone.0094098-Mundry1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>). It is also likely that a less stringent clustering could have reduced the number of contigs but also removed potential splice variants. In fact, we found evidence of putative variable transcripts. For example, we found two possible isoforms of the <italic>RhoGAP-like</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094098.s010">Text S1</xref>). The mapping of the Illumina short reads using both isoforms as a reference supports this idea. Even though these preliminary results would need to be confirmed by qPCR, it indicates that one of the variants is more abundant than the other in the brain sample (data not shown).</p><p>A BLAST search using our contigs as query against 2 social and 3 non-social insect databases <italic>i.e Apis mellifera</italic> (honey bee), <italic>Acromyrmex echinatior</italic> (leaf-cutting ant), <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (fruit fly), <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> (red flour beetle) and <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic> (jewel wasp) revealed 8,811 contigs shared between our transcriptome and a least one of the five reference insect genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094098-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).

The completeness analysis was performed again using the 8,811 identified contigs. The same results as with the whole transcriptome were obtained (458 proteins identified, completeness of 97%), suggesting that these contigs, even though not representative of the whole transcriptome, constitute the earwig core protein dataset.</p><fig id="pone-0094098-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0094098.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Venn-diagram of protein sequences shared by <italic>F. auricularia</italic> and 5 insect species.</title><p>Numbers represent the number of proteins specifically shared by the particular combination of species.

Most of the contigs associated with the cellular component were assigned to the cell and the organelle part while those associated with a biological process were mainly involved in the cellular and metabolic process.

These females were among a group of six females and six males caught on two adjacent olive trees. The females probably had already mated upon capture, but to ensure mating, the six females were set-up jointly with six males in the laboratory for continued mating until oviposition. The offspring of the selected females were used to establish a laboratory breeding line (line FaDo-08i). For mating, the offspring were set-up in containers of about 120 individuals each (approximately 60 males and 60 females). For each subsequent generation offspring of 5&#x02013;10 females were chosen to continue the line. At the time when the individuals were sampled for the current study on May 5&#x02013;6<sup>th</sup>, 2011, the line had been kept for four (adult tissues) and five (eggs/juveniles tissues) generations, respectively.

Prior to dissection, the animals were exposed to petroleum ether (Sigma-Aldrich #77379) vapor. The digestive tract was carefully removed from adult animals to minimize possible contamination from gut content and microbes. We collected whole heads, antenna, thoraxes, abdomens, and dissected brains of five adult females and five adult males. We further sampled about 15 oocytes from one female, collected 10 nymphs from the L1 and L2 developmental stages, and five nymphs from the L3 and L4 stages. All samples were stored in RNAlater (Qiagen), a RNA stabilizing reagent, after dissection. A TRIzol (Invitrogen) protocol was used to isolate total RNA. The Roche 454 run was split into two half plates and two libraries from pooled samples were prepared. Equal amounts of RNA from the whole heads and thoraxes of female and males were pooled for the first library. For the second library the abdomens of female and males, the oocytes, and the nymphs were combined in equivalent amounts. Approximately 2 &#x003bc;g of total RNA from the pooled samples was used for the cDNA library construction and subsequent sequencing. The library preparation and run was performed at the Functional Genomic Center in Zurich (For more details see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094098.s011">Text S2</xref>).
