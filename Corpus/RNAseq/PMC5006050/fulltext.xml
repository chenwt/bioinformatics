Because most studies concentrated on the urinary signals, we aimed to determine the saliva proteome in wild <italic>Mus musculus musculus</italic>, to extend the knowledge on potential roles of saliva in chemical communication. We performed the gel-free quantitative LC-MS/MS analyses of saliva and identified 633 proteins with 134 (21%) of them being sexually dimorphic. They include proteins that protect and transport volatile organic compounds in their beta barrel including LCN lipocalins, major urinary proteins (MUPs), and odorant binding proteins (OBPs). To our surprise, the saliva proteome contains one MUP that is female biased (MUP8) and the two protein pheromones MUP20 (or &#x02018;Darcin&#x02019;) and ESP1 in individuals of both sex. Thus, contrary to previous assumptions, our findings reveal that these proteins cannot function as male-unique signals. Our study also demonstrates that many olfactory proteins (e.g. LCNs, and OBPs) are not expressed by submandibular glands but are produced elsewhere&#x02013;in nasal and lacrimal tissues, and potentially also in other oro-facial glands. We have also detected abundant proteins that are involved in wound healing, immune and non-immune responses to pathogens, thus corroborating that saliva has important protective roles.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The sequence of the mouse genome provided a tool to study blueprints for all RNAs and proteins in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Progenitors of modern laboratory mice were hybrids among <italic>Mus musculus domesticus</italic>, <italic>Mus musculus musculus</italic> and other subspecies. Though, laboratory mice have been widely and successfully used as experimental organisms in studies of biomarkers of physiological states<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> and of human pathological conditions, they may be less suitable to study chemical communication, a process which is driven by sexual selection. This is due to the differential contribution of blocks of genes from the two house-mouse subspecies <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> and <italic>M. m. musculus</italic> to current laboratory strains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> that may mask typical intra- and inter-specific differences. One of our aims, therefore, was to define the saliva proteome in <italic>M. m. musculus</italic> to provide the array of proteins and their quantity characteristic for saliva in a wild living mouse species. This study also represents a baseline for future comparative studies focusing on chemical communication and immunity.</p><p>In mice, the most published studies in chemical communication focused on the major urinary proteins (MUPs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, which are expressed by the liver and transport volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in their beta barrel structure to the urine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. VOCs are slowly released from different urinary MUPs, and have been proposed to function in a variety of social signals, including identity, territorial marking, mate choice etc.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Thus, lipocalins and their specific ligands together form a signal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Differential ligand binding may have a potential influence on sub-species recognition between <italic>M. m. musculus</italic> and <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. These two sub-species have been previously shown to vary in the abundance of male VOCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> and in MUP expression between the two subspecies and individuals of the opposite sex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Moreover, scent signals have been shown to be an integral part of subspecies recognition and could play important roles in preventing interspecific mating between the two house mouse subspecies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p><p>Increasing number of papers, however, show that MUP expression is linked to reproduction and sociality, and not just to competitive ability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. The expression of urinary MUPs is socially regulated in that males excrete higher quantities of MUPs in contacts with females in the laboratory mouse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> as well as in wild <italic>M. m. musculus</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, and in <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Furthermore, MUPs have a predictive value for the onset of aggressive behaviour and dispersal tendency in male wild house mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> and it is evident that scent marking signals have strong effects on the reproductive success of the signaller<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Furthermore, amongst MUPs, MUP20 (or &#x02018;Darcin&#x02019;) has been reported to predict the outcome of male-male territorial competition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.</p><p>MUPs are products of a gene cluster that contains 21 coding genes (and a similar number of pseudogenes), and can be divided into two groups, the group-A (ancestral), containing <italic>Mup3, Mup4, Mup5, Mup6, Mup20</italic> and <italic>Mup21</italic>, and the group-B, consisting of 15 other <italic>Mup</italic>s (i.e. <italic>Mup1, Mup2, Mup7-Mup19</italic>) sharing almost 99% sequence identity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, reviewed in refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Different MUPs were originally supposed to present an individual &#x02018;barcode&#x02019; signal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> by which different individuals recognize each other. However, a recent study with a sufficient sample size shows that the urinary profiles of wild male house mice <italic>M. m. musculus</italic> are not individually unique but are dynamic over time with significant changes after puberty and during adulthood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Moreover, the variation in pheromone affinities of the urinary MUP isoforms provides low support for the proposal that heterogeneity in MUPs plays a role in regulating profiles of available pheromones<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. However, MUPs have also been reported in several tissues other than the liver including salivary glands, olfactory/vomeronasal epithelia, and nasal-associated lymphoid tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, but their functions are not yet fully understood.</p><p>Another interesting group of lipocalins involved in chemical communication are products of the odorant binding protein genes (<italic>Obp</italic>). The X-linked <italic>Obp</italic> genes were thought to involve just two nasal members&#x02013;<italic>Obp1a</italic>, and <italic>Obp1b</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. However, <italic>Obp</italic> genes have undergone a series of duplications in mice, and they occur in a cluster of seven genes (i.e. including <italic>Prb</italic>, Probasin) and two pseudogenes on the X chromosome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. All OBPs including Probasin have a specific disulfide bond (Cys38&#x02013;Cys42), which represents a strong OBP-diagnostic motif CXXXC - Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Cys<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. To date, <italic>Obp</italic>s/OBPs were detected in various mammalian taxa, e.g., house mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, bank voles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, porcupines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, elephants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, cows<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, and boar<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Interestingly, pigs have OBPs and SAL. SAL is the major salivary protein in pigs with affinity to steroids and to 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine, it is phylogenetically close to MUPs and is expressed by the male submaxillary glands<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Furthermore, aphrodisin is an OBP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> described as the major pheromone transporter in vaginal flushes of hamsters (<italic>Cricetus cricetus</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>.</p><p>In our latest study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, we described particular mRNA expression sites for the newly described odorant binding proteins in wild mice (<italic>M. m. musculus, M. m. domesticus</italic>). They are highly expressed with other lipocalins (LCNs, MUPs) in the mouse lacrimal, nasal, and vomeronasal tissues with the normalized expression levels being as high or higher as those described for the urinary group-B <italic>Mup</italic> genes in the liver. Lacrimal glands expressed the mRNA coding OBP5, OBP6 and OBP7 whilst the mRNAs coding OBP1/OBP2, OBP5, and OBP7 were highly abundant in the olfactory epithelia (OE), vomeronasal organ (VNO), and nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) in the both house mouse subspecies. No <italic>Obp</italic> mRNA was detected in submandibular glands but at least one OBP protein (i.e. OBP5) was detected in the saliva. We have also provided evidence that <italic>Obp</italic> transcripts are co-expressed in combination with other lipocalin transcripts (e.g. nasal and lacrimal <italic>Obp5</italic> and <italic>Obp7</italic> with <italic>Mup4</italic> and <italic>Lcn11</italic>), presumably to widen the spectrum of ligands that OBP, MUP, and LCN proteins may sequester and transport<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Thus, this study also aims to detect particular OBPs in the mouse saliva to test whether OBPs are involved in the transport of VOCs and various degradation products from the nasal and lacrimal tissues to the oral cavity where digestion starts.</p><p>This study was conducted to detect the level of sexual dimorphisms with a particular interest in lipocalins that have potential roles in chemical communication as transporters of salivary VOCs. We used sensitive proteomic techniques to identify proteins and partially also RNAseq on GS Junior to detect a potential expression site for some of the lipocalins of particular interest (i.e. MUP20, OBPs). Because eyes, nose and mouth are primary gates for various pathogens to enter the body and at the same time a route of receiving or transmitting pheromones, it is believed that an organismal detoxification, immunity and chemical communication might have been driven by similar evolutionary forces<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>.

We also show that many nasal and lacrimal proteins are abundant in the saliva proteome, presumably as a consequence of their final transport to the oral cavity from tissues where they are expressed and where they function as VOC transporters. These include a group of odorant binding proteins (OBP) that we previously identified as predicted transcripts in the mouse genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, detected their expression sites in various oro-facial tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, and finally detected them as proteins in the saliva proteome in this study. Because OBPs, MUPs and LCNs have similar tertiary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>) with the capacity to transport VOCs, it is likely that together, nasal lipocalins, could be important for signal transduction but even more for a consequent neuronal desensitisation by transporting partially degraded VOCs to the oral cavity and then further to the digestive tract. However, it is in question why OBP1 and OBP2 are sexually dimorphic. It is possible that different levels of expression may reflect potential differences in the olfactory abilities between sexes. To further support the claim that these proteins originate only in the nasal and lacrimal tissues, it would help to analyse other independent oro-facial glands (i.e. parotid, sublingual, or von Ebner glands) and lymphoid tissues that are present in the oral cavity.</p><p>Because mice begin social interactions by investigating facial areas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref> it is also likely that salivary proteins expressed by salivary glands along with those that were transported from the nose serve chemical communication together. It is however in question how would an individual benefit from having lipocalins with ligands that were inhaled from another individual. We suggest that a mixture of the self and of the other individual&#x02019;s smell, that is spread on the receiver&#x02019;s body during selfgrooming, could mediate peaceful social contacts between individuals within a deme&#x02013;a structure typical for the house mouse social groups<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>.</p><p>Among MUPs, MUP20 or &#x02018;Darcin&#x02019; was previously described as a protein pheromone that stimulates female attraction for particular <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> males, improves spatial learning<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>, has been shown to function as an indicator of current health status of males<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>, and to predict the outcome of male-male territorial competition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. MUP20 expression levels are higher in dominant males during and prior to competition, making it predictive of dominance status<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. However, we detected MUP20 being significantly male-biased (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.017) but abundant in the saliva proteomes in individuals of both sex in <italic>M. m. musculus</italic>, and our RNAseq data revealed that MUP20 is coded by <italic>Mup20</italic> gene in the mouse submandibular gland. Thus, it is hard to imagine that this protein functions as a male-only pheromone (i.e. at least in this subspecies) if females produce such signal too. There is at least one study demonstrating that MUP20 is also present in the submandibular gland transcriptome of the laboratory mouse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Therefore, previous studies describing MUP20 as a male-specific signalling protein that is present only in the urine of <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref> need to be further supported with more sensitive techniques. To add, we are also showing that MUP8 is among all MUPs the only one that is significant female biased. However, it remains to be determined where it is transcribed and translated.</p><p>Another protein that has been described as a male-specific signalling protein in the laboratory mouse is a 7&#x02009;kDa protein, named as the exocrine gland-secreted peptide-1 or ESP1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>. ESP1 is produced by the mouse lacrimal glands, secreted with tears and when experimentally transferred to the female vomeronasal organ, it stimulates V2R-expressing vomeronasal chemosensory neurons, and thus elicits an electrical response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>. In <italic>M. m. musculus</italic> under this study, however, ESP1 and ESP6 were sex biased with the female levels being lower than those detected in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). If ESPs cannot function as pheromones due to their occurrence in individuals of both sex, it is in question what are their other potential roles. One obvious role stems out of visualizing the electrostatics properties of ESP1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>. ESP1 has three &#x003b1;-helices with two helices being negatively charged and one (middle) being positively charged. This structural amphypathy fits the description of antimicrobial peptides (i.e. similar to CRAMP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>). Thus it is possible that ESP1 and also other ESPs are involved in the host-defence against bacteria.</p><p>Secretoglobins (SCGBs or ABPs) were also suggested to play roles in chemical communication<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>. However, when experimentally tested, wild mice of the two subspecies did not show any difference in time spent sniffing urine to sniffing the urine with added ABPs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. In our data, some SCGBs/ABPs were male-biased but no member of this family was sex unique in the mouse saliva. Secretoglobins were previously detected in most body fluids and mucosa including lungs, uterus, nasal and oral cavities, and tears in many mammals including rabbits, mice, and humans. They are presumably involved in various processes including tissue repair, eye protection, and anti-inflammatory responses due to their capacity to transport various steroids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>. Moreover, the PANTHER Overrepresentation test in this study did not identify any involvement in any known biological process of the mouse, which makes this family functionally understudied though an interesting system for future studies.</p><p>The saliva proteome also contains proteins that are involved in the regulation of harmonious symbiosis with bacteria and of potential risk of exogenous bacterial infection. A strategy called &#x0201c;nutritional immunity&#x0201d; prevents pathogens from acquiring the host iron<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>, which is an essential nutrient, but only small amounts of free iron are accessible. Therefore, bacteria acquire iron by a secretion of high-affinity iron sequestrating siderophores. The mammalian host, however, limits this process by the production of Lipocalin 2 (LCN2)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref> which efficiently scavenges for catecholate-type siderophores (i.e. such as enterochelin, mycobactin)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>. In our data the production of LCN2 (and also LCN11) was equal between sexes, thus suggesting that males and females similarly regulate such symbiosis with pathogens and/or the defence against them. Interestingly, when the lipocalin-acquired iron is transported to the oral cavity, which is the beginning of the digestive tract, the complex is in fact running towards the enzymatic digestion and thus iron is freed, and can presumably be used by symbiotic bacteria in the lower digestive tract. However, mammalian hosts evolved almost an array of other mechanisms of defence.</p><p>Other mechanisms of defence involve bactericidal proteins defending the mucosal layers of the body against pathogenic microbiota. In our data, we have detected seven members of the PLUNC (palate, lung, and nasal epithelium clone) protein family. These included bactericidal/permeability-increasing proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. All detected BPI proteins in the saliva proteome were male biased and at least three members were characteristic of being within the top ten of the most abundant salivary proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). It is possible that various antimicrobial proteins are male biased simply to compensate for the testosterone dependent immunosuppression of reproducing males<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>. Moreover the sex-dependent resistance against bacteria (<italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>) has also been demonstrated in the house mouse where males were more resistant than females<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>. We have also detected high levels of the prolactin-inducible protein (PIP) which is a submandibular gland protein with the ability to bind immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgG-Fc, CD4-T cell receptor, and different species of bacteria (mainly streptococci), thus playing an important role in non-immune defense<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>. A natural antibiotics CRAMP was detected in individuals of both sex. CRAMP forms an amphipathic alpha-helix similar to other antimicrobial peptides, whilst functional studies showed that CRAMP is a potent antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria by inhibiting the growth of a variety of bacterial strains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>.</p><p>Kallikrein 1-related peptidases were female-biased in our data&#x02013;a trend, described for the first time in wild mice. In the laboratory mouse, kallikreins seem to be male-biased and only the kallikrein 1-related peptidase b5 was female&#x02013;biased<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref>. These serine proteases are involved in the wound healing processes and have a strong antimicrobial activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. Thus it is possible that the higher abundance of kallikrein 1-related peptidases in female saliva is adaptive as it may, for example, help females to maintain healthy skin development of their juveniles via kallikrein administration during a frequent allogrooming care. Moreover, we have also detected four chitinases (i.e. CH3L1, CHIA, CHIL3, CHIL4) in the saliva of males and females, which may aid removing the chitinous mouthparts of ectoprazites via administration of chitinases during the selfgrooming and allogrooming behaviour.</p><p>From the above list of proteins it is evident that saliva is a complex biological system that compromises between various functions including chemical communication, immunity and tissues repair. Because many lipocalins that we detected in the mouse saliva are known to be expressed by other tissues (e.g. nasal, lacrimal) it is likely that these proteins also act as scavengers that bind and excrete toxic compounds. We have already suggested that evolution of chemical communication and of the system of detoxification might have been driven by similar selective forces because both systems use the same pool of lipocalin transporters<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. This hypothesis or as we call it the &#x02018;toxic waste hypothesis&#x02019;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> has later been suggested by another laboratory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">72</xref> with the first experimental evidence provided in a recent paper<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. They demonstrated that mice loaded with an industrial chemical, 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol (DTBP) use MUPs for a consequent detoxification<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Here we suggest that the nasal and olfactory lipocalins (including MUPs) transport potential toxic waste and various degradation products from chemical signals to the oral cavity, and further to the digestive tract where they are decomposed.</p><p>To conclude, we have provided the saliva proteome from wild-living individuals of the house mouse <italic>Mus musculus musculus</italic>. We aimed to identify the level of sexual dimorphism in the abundance of proteins that are involved in chemical communication because most studies focused on the western house mouse subspecies (<italic>M. m. domesticus</italic>) and on various inbred lines. Novelty of our findings includes the detection of sexually dimorphic proteins that were previously detected only in males with MUP20 and ESP1 being a good example. For the first time, we have also shown that the saliva proteome includes proteins that are produced mainly (but not exclusively) by olfactory tissues and which are presumably transported to the oral cavity.
