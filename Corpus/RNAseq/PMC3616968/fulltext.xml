In Kinetoplastid protists, however, virtually all control of gene expression is post-transcriptional. Correspondingly, <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) synthesis after heat shock depends on regulation of <italic>HSP70</italic> mRNA turnover. We here show that the <italic>T. brucei</italic> CCCH zinc finger protein ZC3H11 is a post-transcriptional regulator of trypanosome chaperone mRNAs. ZC3H11 is essential in bloodstream-form trypanosomes and for recovery of insect-form trypanosomes from heat shock. ZC3H11 binds to mRNAs encoding heat-shock protein homologues, with clear specificity for the subset of trypanosome chaperones that is required for protein refolding. In procyclic forms, ZC3H11 was required for stabilisation of target chaperone-encoding mRNAs after heat shock, and the <italic>HSP70</italic> mRNA was also decreased upon ZC3H11 depletion in bloodstream forms. Many mRNAs bound to ZC3H11 have a consensus AUU repeat motif in the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region. ZC3H11 bound preferentially to AUU repeats <italic>in vitro</italic>, and ZC3H11 regulation of <italic>HSP70</italic> mRNA in bloodstream forms depended on its AUU repeat region. Tethering of ZC3H11 to a reporter mRNA increased reporter expression, showing that it is capable of actively stabilizing an mRNA. These results show that expression of trypanosome heat-shock genes is controlled by a specific RNA-protein interaction. They also show that heat-shock-induced chaperone expression in procyclic trypanosome enhances parasite survival at elevated temperatures.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>When organisms are placed at a temperature that is higher than normal, their proteins start to unfold. The organisms protect themselves by increasing the synthesis of &#x0201c;heat-shock&#x0201d; proteins which can re-fold other proteins when the temperature returns to normal. In trypanosomes, the degradation of mRNAs that encode heat-shock proteins is slowed down at elevated temperatures. <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> multiplies as &#x0201c;bloodstream forms&#x0201d; in the blood of mammals, at temperatures between 37&#x02013;39&#x000b0;C; and as &#x0201c;procyclic forms&#x0201d; in Tsetse flies, which are usually at 20&#x02013;37&#x000b0;C but can survive at 41&#x000b0;C. In this paper we show that in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, a protein called ZC3H11 can bind to many heat-shock-protein mRNAs. ZC3H11 is essential in bloodstream-form trypanosomes and for recovery of procyclic-form trypanosomes after heat shock. ZC3H11 binds to an AUU repeat motif which is found in parts of the target mRNAs that do not encode protein. Several heat-shock-protein RNAs were decreased when we decreased the amount of ZC3H11 in bloodstream-form trypanosomes. These and other results show that expression of the specific subset of trypanosome heat-shock proteins is controlled by the interaction of ZC3H11 with the relevant mRNAs. They also show that the heat-shock response could enhance survival of trypanosomes in over-heated Tsetse flies.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported mainly by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, project B13 of SFB544 (DD).

So far, however, none has been shown to have a destabilising function. In search of possible destabilising proteins, we looked for predicted trypanosome proteins with the Tis11 consensus. We here show that the protein with the best match, ZC3H11, indeed binds to mRNAs containing an AUU sequence element but that - in contrast to the situation in mammalian cells - the consequence is an increase in mRNA abundance. Most interestingly, ZC3H11 appears to be a master regulator of stress response mRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>ZC3H11 has a zinc finger similar to those of TTP and BRF2</title><p>To find CCCH proteins that might be involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, we scanned all of them for the Tis11 consensus.

From a crystal structure of BRF2 (Tis11-d) with UUAUUUAUU <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003286-Hudson1">[31]</xref>, it was found that each zinc finger of BRF2 specifically binds the sequence UAUU. Using the residue numbering in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003286-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, and numbering the 4-nt bound RNA as U(1)-A(2)-U(3)-U(4), Tyr18 intercalates between the Us in the 3rd and 4th positions (U3 and U4), and Phe26 intercalates between U1 and A2. These residues are conserved in ZC3H11. Specificity for U1 was conferred by backbone hydrogen bonds with (Asn/His)25 and Glu5; these residues are not conserved in ZC3H11, which has a basic residue at position 5, like <italic>C. elegans</italic> MEX5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003286-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, A2 is hydrogen-bonded by Leu6 and Arg8, which are conserved. A notable difference between ZC3H11 and other Tis11-family zinc fingers is the presence of a novel Asp residue at position 21 in place of the conserved glycine.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Expression of ZC3H11 is increased by heat-shock</title><p>Attempts to generate a polyclonal antibody that could detect ZC3H11 in parasite lysates failed. In order to detect ZC3H11 in trypanosomes, we therefore integrated a sequence encoding an N-terminal V5-epitope tag <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003286-Shen1">[40]</xref> in frame with one of the <italic>ZC3H11</italic> open reading frames (ORFs). Since the 3&#x02032;-UTR is conserved by this procedure, expression levels are expected to be approximately normal unless the tag affects protein stability. In both procyclic forms, which we normally grow at 27&#x000b0;C, and the bloodstream stage, grown at 37&#x000b0;C, the V5-ZC3H11 fusion protein was detected as an extremely faint band that migrated at about 60 kDa instead of the expected 40 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003286-g001">Figure 1B &#x00026; C</xref>, lane 2). The abundance of V5-ZC3H11 was, however, dramatically increased upon heat shock. In procyclic forms, induction of ZC3H11 was transient at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003286-g001">Figure 1B</xref> lanes 3&#x02013;6), but stronger and more extended at 41&#x000b0;C; at later time points, some smaller products appeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003286-g001">Figure 1B</xref> lanes 7&#x02013;10). Since the longer incubations resulted in a decline in cell viability, the faster-migrating bands could indicate either proteolytic degradation or the removal of posttranslational modifications. For bloodstream forms, incubation at 43&#x000b0;C led to a rapid induction of V5-ZC3H11 although the cells started to die within an hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003286-g001">Figure 1C</xref> lanes 3,4). Further experiments showed that in addition to elevated temperatures, mild translational stress from low concentrations of puromycin also increased V5-ZC3H11 expression in both developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003286-g001">Figure 1B</xref> lane 11&#x02013;13 and 1C lanes 5,6). In a preliminary attempt to determine the mechanism of this expression regulation, we incubated cells with lactacystin (not shown) or MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003286-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) to inhibit the proteasome. Indeed, the amount of ZC3H11 increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003286-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). This might mean that the protein is normally rapidly degraded by the proteasome, but is stabilised upon heat shock or puromycin stress. Alternatively, proteasome inhibition could be acting as another sort of stress, with ZC3H11 protein increasing by another mechanism.</p><p>We also expressed ZC3H11-myc in cells with V5-ZC3H11.

Interestingly, the extra band seen after heat shock at 41&#x000b0;C had a similar migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003286-g001">Figure 1B</xref> lanes 8&#x02013;10, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003286-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, lane 3), suggesting that it too might have been dephosphorylated. For an N-terminal fragment containing the first 128 residues of ZC3H11, extending 39 residues beyond the zinc finger, a similar pattern was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003286-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, lower panel), except that a portion appeared unmodified. The N-terminal fragment ran as several bands between 23 kDa and 17 kDa, which all collapsed to the lowest band upon phosphatase treatment. This indicates that residues in the N-terminal region can be phosphorylated.</p><p>The low abundance of the V5-<italic>in situ</italic> tagged protein precluded localisation by microscopy or cell fractionation. We therefore instead looked at the location of ZC3H11 bearing a tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag, inducibly expressed from a strong RNA polymerase I promoter in procyclic forms. ZC3H11-TAP was clearly excluded from the nucleus and found in the cytoplasm in somewhat granular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003286-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). The presence of an IgG-binding domain in the tag prevented us from looking for colocalisation with stress granule markers. Inducibly expressed ZC3H11 with a C -terminal myc tag gave similar results but with a much fainter signal: a rather granular cytoplasmic immunofluorescence which became marginally brighter after a one-hour heat shock (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003286.s001">Figure S1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>RNA-binding specificity of ZC3H11 <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>To find out which mRNAs were bound by ZC3H11, we inducibly expressed myc-tagged ZC3H11 in procyclic trypanosomes, precipitated the protein using anti-myc antibody, and compared bound and unbound RNAs by RNASeq.

Strikingly, more than half of the strongly bound mRNAs were implicated in the stress response. Thirteen of them encoded a full set of chaperones required for protein refolding. All classes of cytosolic HSPs were represented - HSP70, HSP83 (HSP90 family), HSP100, HSP110 and HSP20. Also, mRNAs encoding putative homologues of co-chaperones were present: DnaJ (HSP40) proteins, a FKBP/TPR domain protein, stress induced protein 1 (STI1) and cyclophilin-40. Three additional bound mRNAs encoded the mitochondrial chaperone HSP60, a copper chaperone for cytochrome c, and the glutaredoxin GRX2, which protects against oxidative stress. Notably, mRNAs encoding chaperones for co-translational folding (TRiC complex) or organellar import (mitochondrial HSP70 and ER-resident BiP were not enriched. Among bound transcripts that do not encode annotated chaperones, the most notable encoded GPEET procyclin.

To investigate the RNA-binding specificity of ZC3H11 in more detail, we expressed a variety of different fusion proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified them. The only proteins that could be obtained in reasonable quantity and purity were two N-terminal fragments of 104 and 119 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003286-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 1 &#x00026; 2). Both contain the zinc finger but the 119mer also includes additional conserved residues (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003286.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Although the proteins formed single bands on denaturing gels (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003286.s002">Figure S2A</xref>), on native gels, the pattern was very smeared and some protein remained in the well (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003286.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). This suggested that despite initial solubility, the proteins were not fully folded and some aggregation was occurring. As controls, we expressed the same protein fragments with a C70S mutation in the zinc finger. These were very poorly expressed and as a consequence, the purified samples were heavily contaminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003286-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 3 and 4).</p><p>To test for RNA binding, we incubated the proteins with various radioactively-labelled oligo-ribonucleotides and examined migration in non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The 104 residue protein (ZC3H11-104), interacted with both (UAUU)<sub>5</sub>UAU (classical ARE) and U(UAU)<sub>7</sub>U to give a clear band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003286-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, lanes 4 &#x00026; 5, arrow s1). U(UCU)<sub>7</sub>U gave a very faint band of slower mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003286-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, lane 6, arrow n) which was also detected for both U(UAU)<sub>7</sub>U and U(UCU)<sub>7</sub>U using the zinc finger mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003286-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, lanes 11, 12, 14,15). This band most likely represents binding of the probe by an <italic>E. coli</italic> contaminant, although zinc-finger-independent binding by ZC3H11 is also possible. Using the 119-residue protein, ZC3H11-119, a slower-mobility band was obtained using (UAUU)<sub>5</sub>UAU and U(UAU)<sub>7</sub>U (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003286-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, lanes 7 &#x00026; 8, band s2), suggesting binding of additional copies of the protein: perhaps the extra 15 amino acids mediate protein-protein interactions. In addition, there was strong accumulation of radioactivity in the well (w). This could be explained if the zinc finger were properly folded, but the remainder of the polypeptide were unfolded and formed aggregates. Reducing the probe length to 14 residues did not affect the apparent aggregation (not shown).</p><p>To investigate the binding in more detail, we used more probes.

A large number of mRNAs was affected (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003286.s006">Table S1</xref>, sheet 4 and Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003286.s003">Figure S3D</xref>). In theory, the 41&#x000b0;C RNASeq data should be normalised to allow for the fact that the total amount of mRNA is four-fold diminished by heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003286-g005">Figure 5E</xref>), which means that the read count ratio (heat shock/no heat shock) should be divided by four. In practice, however, the un-normalised RNASeq results agreed better with those from Northern blots (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003286-t001">Table 1</xref>). We do not understand why this is the case. Of the 178 loci that showed at least 2-fold more expression in the published heat shock microarray, 88 were confirmed as at least 2-fold increased in the RNASeq analysis; examples are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003286-t002">Table 2</xref>. Intriguingly, the increased transcripts were significantly enriched for the class encoding RNA-binding proteins (P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.007). Several chaperones were actually decreased after heat shock, but these were preferentially those involved in vesicular transport (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003286.s006">Table S1</xref>, sheet 4). Some of the mRNAs that increase after heat shock are also normally preferentially expressed in bloodstream forms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003286-t002">Table 2</xref>). Overall, there was no correlation between mRNA changes after heat shock and binding to ZC3H11 (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003286.s006">Table S1</xref>, sheet 4),

Although there was no transcriptome-wide correlation between ZC3H11 binding and the RNAi effect (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003286.s006">Table S1</xref>, sheet 5), every single one of the ZC3H11-bound heat-shock chaperone mRNAs was decreased in the RNAi cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003286-t001">Table 1</xref>): the enrichment of chaperones in the subset that was both ZC3H11-bound and reduced in heat-shock was highly significant (P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.6&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;13</sup>) (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003286.s006">Table S1</xref>, sheet 7). The RNASeq results therefore showed that ZC3H11 is required for the retention of mRNAs encoding refolding chaperones after heat shock. The decreases in other mRNAs in the RNAi cells may be secondary to the loss of chaperones or other proteins encoded by ZC3H11-bound mRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>ZC3H11 can actively stabilise a bound mRNA</title><p>There are two basic ways in which an RNA-binding protein can stabilise an mRNA. One possibility is that it has a direct stabilising function, for example by binding to other proteins such as translation factors or poly(A)-binding protein. The other option is that it prevents binding of other, degradation-promoting, proteins to the recognition sequence. To distinguish between these possibilities, we artificially forced ZC3H11 to bind to a <italic>CAT</italic> reporter RNA that would not normally bind ZC3H11. To do this we took advantage of the very strong and specific binding of the phage lambdaN protein to an RNA sequence called boxB. Briefly, we expressed a ZC3H11 protein fused to the peptide with binding activity (&#x003bb;N-ZC3H11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003286-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) together with a reporter RNA. The <italic>CAT</italic> reporter RNA was followed by five copies of the boxB sequence, then the actin 3&#x02032;-UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003286-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), and the same reporter mRNA without boxB served as a control. The effect of induction of the &#x003bb;N-ZC3H11 fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003286-g006">Figure 6A, B</xref>) on the <italic>CAT</italic> reporter mRNA and the protein level were examined. &#x003bb;N-ZC3H11 expression resulted in a 4-fold increase in reporter RNA, and a 2-fold increase in CAT protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003286-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). This effect required ZC3H11 binding, since the reporter lacking the boxB element did not react to ZC3H11 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003286-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). We do not understand the difference between the protein and RNA effects; one possibility is that the tethered ZC3H11 has a negative influence on translation. We concluded that ZC3H11 is able to stabilise transcripts actively, rather than by inhibiting the action of a destabilising protein. Tethering the C-terminal part of ZC3H11 alone, without the zinc finger domain, also increased the reporter RNA and protein, while the N-terminal zinc-finger fragment did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003286-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Together with our previous results, this suggests that the N-terminal zinc finger is required for RNA binding, while the effector domain for stabilisation lies towards the C-terminus.</p><fig id="ppat-1003286-g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1003286.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Tethering of ZC3H11 increases the abundance of a reporter mRNA.</title><p><bold>A.</bold> Constructs used for the tethering experiments.

Monomeric ZC3H11, in contrast, could recognise only UAUU so would have almost no ability to discriminate between mRNAs. The fact that the RNA pull-down yielded a highly specific motif of AUU repeats indicates that ZC3H11 must, in fact, bind at least as a dimer. The rather closer spacing of the A residues would, in that case, be determined by the geometry of the dimerization.

It is quite possible that in procyclics, ZC3H11 is indeed essential, but the residual ZC3H11 after RNAi was sufficient for survival. Notably, we were unable to delete both <italic>ZC3H11</italic> genes although knockout constructs were able to integrate correctly into the genome (not shown). The most likely explanation for the difference in RNAi behaviour is that procyclics are routinely grown at a lower temperature (27&#x000b0;C), with a lower chaperone requirement: <italic>ZC3H11</italic> RNAi made procyclics hypersensitive to a temperature of 37&#x000b0;C.</p><p>The top 120 different mRNAs enriched in the ZC3H11 bound fraction represent, in total, only 300 RNA molecules per bloodstream-form trypanosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003286-Manful1">[14]</xref> so a role for the rather low amounts of ZC3H11 in regulating target RNA abundance or translation is quite possible. However, the overall role of ZC3H11 in bloodstream forms is unclear, especially as results from RNASeq and Northern blots were not always concordant. Many bound mRNAs were not affected by the RNAi, but this is not really surprising. All trypanosome 3&#x02032;-UTRs are long enough to interact with multiple RNA-binding proteins, which are expected to influence the behaviour of the bound mRNAs in a combinatorial fashion. Many RNAs that either increased or decreased after <italic>ZC3H11</italic> RNAi were also not found bound to ZC3H11; perhaps the transcriptome after RNAi, at least in part, simply reflected the onset of growth inhibition. Further investigation - perhaps with transcriptomes taken at different times after <italic>ZC3H11</italic> RNAi induction, and also comparing various other growth-inhibitory conditions - will be required to ascertain which effects of ZC3H11 depletion are direct.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>The chaperone cycle and ZC3H11 specificity</title><p>Chaperones assist in the folding of the nascent polypeptide chains, refold denatured proteins, and regulate the function of bound proteins.

We have now found that in procyclic forms, depletion of ZC3H11 not only prevented the continued synthesis of HSP70 and HSP83, and the stabilisation of several other chaperone mRNAs, after a 41&#x000b0;C heat shock, but also severely impaired the ability of the trypanosomes to recover when returned to 27&#x000b0;C. This shows, for the first time, that a Kinetoplastid heat-shock response <italic>per se</italic> protects the parasite from short periods at an elevated temperature.</p><p>At first sight, the temperatures that are required for the trypanosome heat shock response seem un-physiologically high.
