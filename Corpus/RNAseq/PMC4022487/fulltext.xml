In stalk-eyed flies (<italic>Teleopsis dalmanni</italic>), driving X chromosomes are commonly found at frequencies approaching 30% in the wild, but the genetic basis of drive has remained elusive due to reduced recombination between driving and non-driving X chromosomes. Here, we used RNAseq to identify transcripts that are differentially expressed between males carrying either a driving X (X<sup>SR</sup>) or a standard X chromosome (X<sup>ST</sup>), and found hundreds of these, the majority of which are X-linked. Drive-associated transcripts show increased levels of sequence divergence (dN/dS) compared to a control set, and are predominantly expressed either in testes or in the gonads of both sexes. Finally, we confirmed that X<sup>SR</sup> and X<sup>ST</sup> are highly divergent by estimating sequence differentiation between the RNAseq pools. We found that X-linked transcripts were often strongly differentiated (whereas most autosomal transcripts were not), supporting the presence of a relatively large region of recombination suppression on X<sup>SR</sup> presumably caused by one or more inversions. We have identified a group of genes that are good candidates for further study into the causes and consequences of sex-chromosome drive, and demonstrated that meiotic drive has had a profound effect on sequence evolution and gene expression of X-linked genes in this species.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Sex chromosome meiotic drive causes changes in the sex-ratios of natural populations, and may even lead to extinction if the driving element reaches high frequency.

Several species of stalk-eyed flies in southeast Asia &#x02013; genus <italic>Teleopsis</italic> &#x02013; express X chromosome drive, but the genes underlying drive have been difficult to locate due to reduced recombination between drive and standard X chromosomes presumably caused by the presence of a large inversion.

This seemingly cooperative outcome masks an inherent genetic conflict. Alleles on any one chromosome would increase in frequency more rapidly if that chromosome passed to all, instead of half, of the gametes produced. Such selfish alleles cause meiotic drive and would be expected to sweep quickly to high frequency or even fix. Detecting autosomal drive is difficult because distorted segregation patterns of chromosomal markers must be observed. However, when a drive allele is on a sex chromosome, the sex ratio of offspring is distorted. As a driving sex chromosome increases in frequency, the sex ratio in the population will become increasingly biased. If a drive allele nears fixation, population extinction due to absence of the rare sex is expected <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Hamilton1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Alternatively, because the rare sex will have a fitness advantage <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Fisher1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, alleles which act to restore the sex ratio to equality will be favored. Potential mechanisms to counter fixation of drive alleles include sexual selection in which standard males outcompete drive males in mating or sperm competition <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Jaenike1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004362-Price1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, selection acting on female X<sup>SR</sup> carriers <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Curtsinger1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and the evolution of loci on the other sex chromosome or autosomes that suppress drive <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Hamilton1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Genomic conflicts in general, and meiotic drive in particular, can create dynamic evolutionary systems that influence patterns of molecular evolution and the evolution of gene expression. Drive loci have a strong local fitness advantage, but decrease fitness of the population because selection cannot act efficiently to remove low-fitness drive carriers <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Hiraizumi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In addition, many examples of suppressed or &#x0201c;cryptic&#x0201d; drive systems have been uncovered in Drosophila in which either autosomal or Y-linked suppressors mask the phenotypic expression of the drive allele in extant populations <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Mercot1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004362-Carvalho1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Like the drive locus, at the time they arose, these loci would have been strongly selected, whether or not they provided any benefit to the organism <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Jaenike3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Furthermore, the inherent fitness advantage of drive and suppressor alleles is expected to lead to strong effects on linked neutral polymorphism as these alleles increase in frequency - as has been documented for both autosomal <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Palopoli1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Chevin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and sex-ratio drive <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Derome1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> in Drosophila species. In fact, the theoretical effects of meiotic drive on the genome are so extreme that it has been invoked as a possible cause for fundamental phenomena <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Meiklejohn1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, such as homologous recombination <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Haig1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and Haldane's Rule <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Hurst1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004362-McDermott1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, with some experimental evidence of the latter <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Phadnis1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Mcdermott1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>Although meiotic drive has been observed in many different species, particularly dipterans (reviewed in <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Jaenike3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>), the genetic basis of drive is known in only a few cases, and of these, none distort sex ratios appreciably in natural populations. Partly, this is due to the tendency of actively driving loci to be found on sex-ratio X chromosomes that do not recombine with standard X chromosomes due to the presence of one or more inversions. This has prevented fine mapping of the drive loci in most cases <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Dyer1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Johns1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Intriguingly, both cases of X-chromosome drive that have been mapped to the gene level are associated with copy number variants and occur in <italic>Drosophila simulans</italic>. The &#x0201c;Paris&#x0201d; sex-ratio drive system (also known as X<sup>SR6</sup>) recombines freely and populations polymorphic for both the suppressor and the driver exist <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Mercot1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, allowing genetic dissection using interpopulation crosses. The element that causes drive has been mapped to a segmental duplication of six genes on the X chromosome, with associated changes in gene expression for some of the duplicated genes <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Fouvry1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The &#x0201c;Winters&#x0201d; drive system is caused by an X chromosome drive gene, <italic>Dox</italic>, which is an imperfect duplication of a previously existing gene, <italic>MDox</italic>, and is suppressed by an autosomal retroduplicated gene, <italic>Nmy</italic>, which functions to silence <italic>Dox</italic> through an RNAi-like mechanism <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Tao1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Tao2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>In the stalk-eyed fly, <italic>Teleopsis dalmanni</italic>, males carrying a meiotic drive X chromosome (X<sup>SR-1</sup> or X<sup>SR-2</sup>) <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Wilkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> parent mostly daughters <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Presgraves1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Drive chromosomes are present in natural populations but appear not to recombine with standard X chromosomes in laboratory crosses <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Johns1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The X chromosome gene content in <italic>T. dalmanni</italic> is mostly orthologous to Muller element B, i.e. chromosome arm 2L in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1004362-Baker1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Thus, the genetic context for X chromosome drive in Teleopsis is distinct from that found in the Drosophila systems described above. Furthermore, meiotic drive associates with a number of characters that influence male reproductive success, including eye-stalk length <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Johns1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Wilkinson2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, sperm precedence <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Fry1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and sperm morphology <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Johns2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The fate of the drive allele may be influenced by sexual selection acting against the drive X chromosome <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Lande1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, which also causes males to have shorter than average relative eye-stalk length <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Johns1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Cotton1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Conversely, females carrying a drive X chromosome may have elevated fecundity, providing a possible explanation for why drive X chromosomes are not lost or suppressed <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Wilkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. However, the genetic basis for most of these traits - and meiotic drive itself - is unknown apart from the association with X<sup>SR</sup>. Like many chromosomes carrying meiotic drive loci, X<sup>SR</sup> &#x02013; or at least the portion of X<sup>SR</sup> that causes both meiotic drive and associated phenotypic differences &#x02013; does not recombine with standard X chromosomes <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Johns1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, making identification of causal loci difficult.</p><p>To identify genes that are involved in sex-ratio drive and associated phenotypes in <italic>T. dalmanni</italic>, we performed RNAseq on replicate pools of testes carrying meiotic drive (X<sup>SR</sup>) and standard (X<sup>ST</sup>) X chromosomes. We aligned these reads to a transcriptome assembled <italic>de novo</italic>, identified hundreds of transcripts differentially expressed between X<sup>SR</sup> and X<sup>ST</sup> testes, identified their expression patterns, determined whether they were X-linked, Y-linked or autosomal, and identified fixed differences between the two samples. We found that drive-associated transcripts were more likely to be X-linked and to have elevated expression in testes (as expected) as well as in both testes and ovaries. These transcripts were also more rapidly evolving than a control set and included a number of interesting candidate genes with Drosophila orthologs involved in potentially relevant molecular and biological processes. Finally, we found that hundreds of X-linked transcripts carry fixed differences between X<sup>SR</sup> and X<sup>ST</sup> samples while only a handful of such differences were found in autosomal transcripts. Our data support previous studies <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Wright1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Christianson1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> suggesting that the X<sup>SR</sup> haplotype is evolving independently from X<sup>ST</sup>, and reveal a group of candidate genes that will be useful targets for future studies of meiotic drive in this species.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Differential Expression between X<sup>SR</sup> and X<sup>ST</sup> Testes</title><p>We sequenced RNA collected from replicate pools of testes dissected from <italic>T. dalmanni</italic> &#x02013; Gombak males that carried the sex-ratio meiotic drive X (X<sup>SR</sup>) or the standard X (X<sup>ST</sup>) chromosome (X<sup>SR</sup> and X<sup>ST</sup> status was determined by microsatellite haplotype following Wright 2004 <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Wright1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and Wilkinson 2006 <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Wilkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>). Reads were aligned to the <italic>T. dalmanni</italic> transcriptome (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">methods</xref>) with bwa <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and raw read counts were corrected using RSEM <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> to account for hits to multiple isoforms (contigs) making up the same transcript. We then used DESeq <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Anders1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> with the corrected read counts to find transcripts that were differentially expressed between X<sup>ST</sup> and X<sup>SR</sup> testes using a FDR&#x0003c;0.001 cutoff and after removing transcripts which had no expression in any of the four samples. We found a total of 513 transcripts to be significantly differentially expressed between transcriptomes from X<sup>SR</sup> and X<sup>ST</sup> testes. As a group, we refer to these as &#x0201c;drive-associated transcripts&#x0201d;. Among them, 233 were expressed at a higher level in X<sup>SR</sup> males and 280 were expressed at a lower level in X<sup>SR</sup> males (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004362-t001">Table 1</xref>). A total of 113 transcripts exhibited more than 10-fold differential expression between X<sup>SR</sup> and X<sup>ST</sup>. For technical reasons, transcripts that are significantly differentially expressed are more likely than other genes to be expressed at a high level. In order to prevent weakly expressed transcripts from biasing our results, we defined a control gene set from among the remaining transcripts by removing the most weakly expressed genes from consideration (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). We next aligned predicted proteins to the Drosophila proteome to identify putative Drosophila orthologs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004362-t001">Table 1</xref>). Among the drive-associated transcripts, 28.2% had putative Drosophila orthologs (18.4% among control genes). Of the remaining transcripts, 239 contain a long open reading frame, and may be <italic>Teleopsis</italic>-specific proteins, whereas 129 had short (&#x0003c;50 AA) open reading frames and may be noncoding RNA genes. Compared to drive-associated transcripts, a larger proportion of the control transcripts had short (&#x0003c;50 AA) open reading frames (52.3% vs. 25.1%, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;56.88, P&#x0003c;4.625 e-14, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004362-t001">Table 1</xref>). Given that noncoding RNA genes are thought to be more narrowly and weakly expressed compared to protein-coding genes <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Mercer1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Djebali1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, we speculate that an excess of presumptive noncoding RNA genes in the control gene set may be caused by the observation that drive-associated transcripts tend to be expressed more strongly than the average transcripts. Alternatively, protein-coding genes may be more likely to become drive-associated than noncoding RNA genes. Finally, we used quantitative RT-PCR to confirm differential expression of drive-associated transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004362.s003">Table S1</xref>). After excluding weakly expressed samples, 11 of 11 transcripts replicated the qualitative pattern observed in the RNA-seq data (i.e. differentially expressed in the same direction).</p><table-wrap

trinity website (trinityrnaseq.sourceforge.net <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Haas1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>). We clustered differentially expressed transcripts to identify the eight most common patterns of gene expression and compared the number of transcripts assigned to each cluster for drive-associated and control transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004362-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004362.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Control transcripts were more likely than drive-associated transcripts to have no significant pattern of differential expression (&#x0201c;Not differentially expressed&#x0201d;), possibly because many of them could be housekeeping genes. Testes-associated clusters were enriched among drive-associated transcripts compared to controls (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;737.3, P&#x0003c;2.2 e-16). We also assessed testes-specificity in drive and control transcripts by calculating the Tau metric <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Reiner1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> and found more drive-associated than control transcripts were testes-specific (57.5% vs 16.9%, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;622.7, P&#x0003c;2.2 e-16). This is not surprising considering the comparison was between testes from X<sup>SR</sup> and X<sup>ST</sup> males. However, we also expect that a subset of drive-associated transcripts are likely to be involved directly in various aspects of spermatogenesis, given that meiotic drive affects sperm development in <italic>T. dalmanni</italic>

Given that gonad expressed genes are often tissue specific, it has been thought unlikely that a single gene would do both, but given that an excess of drive associated genes show elevated expression in both ovary and testis, perhaps some of these genes are involved in both increased female fecundity (see <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Wilkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>) and meiotic drive.</p><fig id="pgen-1004362-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1004362.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Drive-associated transcripts are enriched in the gonads.</title><p>(A) K-means clustering was used to establish qualitatively distinct expression patterns of transcripts across the six sequenced tissues; clusters enriched for transcripts expressed predominantly in testes or in ovary plus testes are shown.

We determined whether this strong X effect extended to the level of gene expression by comparing the chromosomal linkage of drive-associated transcripts and a control set using data from a comparative genomic hybridization experiment. We found that drive-associated transcripts were strongly enriched on the X chromosome compared to the control set (78% vs 18%, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;256, P&#x0003c;2.2 e-16), suggesting that the majority of downstream effects of X<sup>SR</sup> on gene expression are in <italic>cis</italic> rather than in <italic>trans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004362-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, male-specific genes have a tendency to move off of the X <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Betran1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Vibranovski1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, though young male-biased genes may be enriched on the X <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. As the X chromosome in <italic>T. dalmanni</italic> is distinct from the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> X, it is unclear whether the same pattern would be expected. While the number of moving drive-associated transcripts appears to be in large excess, drive-associated transcripts are more likely to be on the X chromosome than are controls, and much of the movement can be explained by the effect of linkage in that more genes are moving onto the X chromosome &#x02013; relative to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> - in <italic>T. dalmanni</italic> than are moving onto the autosomes (19.2% of controls and 29.7% of drive-associated transcripts have moved onto the X in <italic>T. dalmanni</italic>, relative to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>). In addition, we recently found that in <italic>T. dalmanni</italic>, an excess of testes-specific transcripts have moved onto the X chromosome (unpublished data), and an excess of drive-associated transcripts are testes-specific. Indeed, among testes-specific transcripts, 21.1% of controls and 56.8% of drive-associated transcripts have moved onto the X chromosome from Muller elements other than B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004362-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Given these factors may be confounding, we fit nominal logistic models to predict gene movement by chromosome linkage (A or X), drive association (drive-associated/control), tissue source (testes or other) and interactions among these three factors for 7,150 transcripts. We compared three models with different interaction terms and chose the model with the lowest AICc score (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004362.s004">Table S2</xref>, 4-parameter model). The best-fitting model explained 20.7% of the variation in gene movement (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;916, d.f.&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4, P&#x0003c;0.0001) with strong effects of X-linkage, tissue, and the interaction between X-linkage and tissue (all P&#x0003c;0.0001, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004362.s004">Table S2</xref>) but no significant effect of drive-association (P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.1745). Therefore, while the large proportion of drive-associated transcripts moving onto the X is striking, this is most likely not due to the effect of drive <italic>per se</italic>. Instead, we conclude that most of the effect of X<sup>SR</sup> on expression is due to genes on the X chromosome, regardless of whether they moved there recently or have persisted on Muller element B since the divergence of genus Drosophila and Teleopsis. In addition, a group of five drive-associated transcripts was found to be Y-linked (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004362-t002">Table 2</xref>). While the number of Y-linked genes does not exceed expectation, they are of interest as potential targets of sex-chromosome drive. During spermatogenesis in drive-carrying <italic>T. dalmanni</italic>, the Y-bearing sperm do not complete elongation. While the genetic cause of this is unknown, in other cases of X chromosome drive the Y chromosome is the direct target of drive. For example, in the <italic>Slx/Sly</italic> system in mice, expression of an array of Y-linked genes is modified by the presence of a driving X chromosome <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Cocquet1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>.

Because a larger proportion of drive-associated than control transcripts are expressed in testes and have moved between the X and autosomes (see above), we used a generalized linear model with an exponential distribution and reciprocal link function to determine if drive association, expression (testis-specific or not), transcript movement, or chromosome location influence protein evolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004362.s005">Table S3</xref>).

It is possible that a lack of constraint rather than positive selection is causing the increase in dN/dS among drive-associated transcripts, i.e. weakly deleterious alleles are expected to fix more rapidly when recombination is suppressed, as appears to be the case for large portions of X<sup>SR</sup> in <italic>T. dalmanni</italic>

However, X-linkage did not affect dN/dS in any model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004362.s005">Table S3</xref>).

</title><p>Recombination is suppressed between X<sup>SR</sup> and X<sup>ST</sup> in <italic>T. dalmanni</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1004362-Johns1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. This is a common feature in several extant drive systems (see <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Dyer1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>) and may have evolved as a way to prevent recombination breaking up suites of genes that are beneficial to individuals carrying drive loci <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Jaenike3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Recombination suppression leads to accumulation of genetic differences between the suppressed regions and is thought to be the primary mechanism leading to the degeneration of the Y chromosome <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Muller1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Charlesworth1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. We hypothesized that it should therefore be possible to identify fixed genetic differences between the suppressed regions on X<sup>SR</sup> and X<sup>ST</sup> using RNAseq data. Conversely, in a freely breeding population there should be very few fixed differences between autosomal genes in X<sup>SR</sup> and X<sup>ST</sup> males. Indeed, we found 955 fixed differences in X-linked transcripts but only 11 fixed differences between X<sup>SR</sup> and X<sup>ST</sup> males in autosomal transcripts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004362-t002">Table 2</xref>). Even more remarkably, roughly one-fourth of X-linked transcripts contain at least one fixed difference. Given the large number of individuals sampled (&#x0223c;60 for each drive and standard individuals, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">methods</xref>), this excess of X-linked fixed differences cannot be explained by the fact that the X chromosome was sampled at half the depth of the autosomes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004362.s002">Figure S2</xref>). If the entire X chromosome were nonrecombining, a simple null expectation would be that fixed differences should be randomly distributed across the transcripts based only on their length. We performed a simulation to test this hypothesis. Based on the observed per-basepair frequency of fixed differences in X-linked (6.35 e-04) and autosomal transcripts (2.06 e-06) and the known lengths of all transcripts used in this study, we performed 10,000 draws from the binomial distribution to determine the expected number of genes carrying one or more fixed differences on each type of chromosome. We found more genes with no fixed differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004362-g004">Figure 4</xref>), and more genes with six or more fixed differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004362-g004">Figure 4</xref>, inset) than the X expectation. These data could be interpreted in one of two ways. First, this increased &#x0201c;clustering&#x0201d; of X-linked fixed differences could be due to repeated selection on multiple sites in certain transcripts. Indeed, theory predicts that genes modifying drive would be under positive selection after drive arose <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Alternatively, the excess of genes with no fixed differences could be due to free recombination on a relatively large portion of the X chromosome, either currently or historically. For example, if the drive X chromosome slowly accumulated multiple inversions in order to become fully non-recombining, then that could explain the presence of fewer fixed differences if some of the inversions are more recent than others.</p><fig id="pgen-1004362-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1004362.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Fixed differences in X-linked genes are not uniformly distributed across the X.</title><p>There are 955 fixed differences on the X chromosome between the X<sup>SR</sup> and X<sup>ST</sup> transcriptomes across 27% of the X-linked transcripts.

Compared to the X expectation there was an excess of X-linked transcripts with zero fixed differences (A). There was also an excess of transcripts with six or more fixed differences (B).

While most of these genes are testes specific (Tau is &#x0003e;0.95), six of 24 fall into the ovary and testis expression category, implying they could function in both male and female reproduction. A gene called <italic>klarsicht</italic> also contains two nonsynonymous fixed differences and reduced expression in X<sup>SR</sup> testes. This gene &#x02013; a transport regulator - has been linked to a variety of functions including eye development <xref rid="pgen.1004362-FischerVize1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. Interestingly, it was recently discovered that <italic>klar</italic> mutants affect nonrandom segregation of sister chromatids in germline stem cells of the testis <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Yadlapalli1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>.

Sex chromosome meiotic drive is notoriously recalcitrant to traditional genetic dissection due to its tendency to associate with chromosomal inversions, presumably as a result of meiotic drive involving the combined action of multiple loci <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Jaenike2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Sturtevant1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Thomson1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>. In addition, X-chromosome drive is predicted to have consequences for processes ranging from sexual selection to the evolution of the genome. As populations become biased towards one sex or the other, inter- and intra- sexual selective pressures diverge. As females become increasingly common and if male reproduction is at all costly, males may become choosy <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Randerson1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>. Meanwhile, females employing strategies that increase their chances of mating with a standard male would benefit, as more of their offspring would be the rare (male) sex <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Fisher1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. This might occur through female preference for a linked trait <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Lande1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> or multiple mating <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Haig2" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. Meanwhile, sex-ratio meiotic drive is expected to favor Y-linked and autosomal alleles that suppress drive, subjecting the genome to strong local selection pressures. Fixation of alleles causing or modifying drive may be nonadaptive or even maladaptive.</p><p>To gain insight into the genetic differences between nonrecombining drive and standard X chromosomes, we used RNAseq to measure differences in expression between drive and standard testes from a species, <italic>T. dalmanni</italic>, with high frequencies of unsuppressed X chromosome meiotic drive and a wealth of biological data associated with the drive system. We sequenced testes from males carrying X<sup>SR</sup> and standard X chromosomes and identified a group of genes that are significantly differentially expressed, including a number of candidate genes whose <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> orthologs have been associated with male sterility and chromosomal nondisjunction during mitotic and meiotic divisions, and some of which carried fixed differences. While some of these genes may have diverged in expression due to neutral processes associated with sequence divergence of X<sup>SR</sup> from standard X chromosomes, others may either impact, or be impacted by meiotic drive directly. Interestingly, some of the genes whose expression changed in X<sup>SR</sup> males are also strongly expressed in other tissues and may be involved in other observed phenotypic differences between drive and non-drive males, including genes that may be involved in differences between drive and standard males in the sexually selected exaggerated eye stalk phenotype <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Wilkinson4" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. X<sup>SR</sup> males are generally at a reproductive disadvantage as they are less able to directly compete with other males for matings due to reduced ornament size <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Wilkinson4" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref> and for fertilizations after copulation due to weaker sperm competitive ability <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Fry1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Conversely, heterozygous female carriers of X<sup>SR</sup> have higher fecundity than their X<sup>ST</sup> sisters <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Wilkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. It has been suggested that the overdominant effect of X<sup>SR</sup> on female fecundity may be one reason why drive is still expressed in the population, rather than being suppressed as in many <italic>Drosophila spp</italic>. We found that drive-associated transcripts were enriched for genes showing elevated expression in both the testis and ovary. If loci impact both drive in males and fecundity in females, natural selection may select against suppression of the activity of these genes. In fact, models of drive demonstrate that in the absence of frequency dependent selection, a stable drive polymorphism may still be maintained when female fecundity and drive are impacted by the same locus, or tightly linked loci <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Curtsinger1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Edwards1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Due to the relative scarcity of genes that impact both male and female reproduction <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Lindsley1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>, it has been thought unlikely that the same locus would impact both traits <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Jaenike3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The excess of drive-associated genes expressed in both tissues provides a counter example that warrants further investigation.</p><p>In addition to identifying specific candidate genes that may be involved in meiotic drive in <italic>T. dalmanni</italic>, we identified a number of patterns associated with genes that are differentially expressed between X<sup>SR</sup> and X<sup>ST</sup> testes. First, we found that the X chromosome carried a majority (&#x0223c;80%) of the genes whose expression differed between X<sup>SR</sup> and X<sup>ST</sup> testes. In addition, we found that there was a large excess of gene movement from the autosomes to the X chromosome relative to Drosophila, especially among testes-specific genes, though this type of movement was enriched in control genes as well as drive-associated transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004362-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Inheritance of X<sup>SR</sup> is generally sufficient to induce drive regardless of the genetic background, implying that segregating suppressors of X<sup>SR</sup> are absent or rare in nature. However, although the X<sup>SR</sup> chromosome has a strong genetic effect to induce meiotic drive, it is not necessarily obvious that changes in expression should be limited to the X chromosome. Meiotic drive genes on X<sup>SR</sup> could in principle act as &#x0201c;triggers&#x0201d; that alter expression of genes in <italic>trans</italic> across the genome. Alternatively, <italic>cis</italic> regulatory mutations, copy number changes, and the accumulation of null alleles <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Muller1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> could affect the expression of genes on X<sup>SR</sup> directly. Our finding of a large X effect on drive-associated expression, along with the accumulation of many fixed genetic differences between X<sup>SR</sup> and X<sup>ST</sup> genes, suggests that <italic>cis</italic> effects dominate <italic>trans</italic> effects in the case of sex chromosome meiotic drive. This is consistent with the hypothesis that stable persistence of a sex chromosome drive polymorphism requires that a suite of co-adapted genes be inherited together, often in the form of a large inversion or series of inversions <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Jaenike3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Another possibility is that a meiotic drive trigger gene could impact expression preferentially on the X chromosome (chromosome-specific gene regulation). This is seen in the <italic>Slx/Sly</italic> system in mice, although in that case sex-linked genes are either up- or down-regulated by SLX or SLY respectively rather than causing a variety of expression changes (Coquet et al 2012).</p><p>We also found that these genes are evolving more rapidly at the protein level (dN/dS), and this increased evolutionary rate could not be entirely explained by a tendency of these genes to be testes-specific or linked to the X chromosome. By virtue of violating Mendelian inheritance, drive alleles produce a strong local fitness advantage, and if not suppressed, are expected to increase in frequency in the population, both removing polymorphism and bringing hitchhiking variants with them <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Hamilton1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. It is possible that much of the acceleration in the rate of protein evolution we observe is due to relaxed purifying selection during such a sweep (see <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Kingan1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Bastide1" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>). Alternatively, as X<sup>SR</sup> reaches higher frequency in the population, other genes in the genome may begin to evolve to adapt to the new genetic context. Theory predicts, for example, rapid evolution of modifier and suppressor loci should occur <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Hartl1" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>. Although we have not previously identified these loci, it is plausible that some differentially expressed loci may be modifiers of drive.</p><p>Because the testes we collected were from an outbred population, we were able to use natural variants in the X<sup>SR</sup> and X<sup>ST</sup> individuals to confirm that X<sup>SR</sup> almost certainly contains at least one inversion that prevents genetic exchange between the X<sup>SR</sup> and X<sup>ST</sup> chromosomes. Nearly 1,000 variants have become fixed between X<sup>SR</sup> and X<sup>ST</sup>, whereas only 11 such differences exist between autosomes carried by X<sup>SR</sup> and X<sup>ST</sup> males. It would be difficult to explain this discrepancy in any way other than a lack of genetic exchange between X<sup>SR</sup> and X<sup>ST</sup> &#x02013; it is highly unlikely that freely recombining chromosomes would pick up any fixed differences, whether X-linked or autosomal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004362.s002">Figure S2</xref>). A simple simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004362-g004">Figure 4</xref>) demonstrates that there are more genes carrying zero fixed differences than expected if recombination was suppressed uniformly across the X chromosome and affected all genes equally. The apparent clustering of fixed differences could be due to some proportion of the drive X chromosome continuing to recombine normally with standard X chromosomes. Alternatively, the fixed differences may cluster due to selection acting on certain genes differently between drive and standard individuals, even when the entire drive X is failing to recombine with standard X chromosomes. Further genetic analysis will be needed to discover which regions of the X<sup>SR</sup> chromosome recombine and which do not. A number of these fixed differences caused nonsynonymous changes in proteins, some of which were drive-associated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004362-t003">Table 3</xref>). These genes may be good initial targets for future analysis.</p><p>Finally, a large number of genetically isolated populations of <italic>T. dalmanni</italic> &#x02013; as well as the closely related species <italic>T. whitei</italic> - can be found in southeast Asia and the valleys neighboring the Gombak valley from which the flies used for this study were collected. Many of these populations express sex chromosome drive (<xref rid="pgen.1004362-Wilkinson5" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref> and unpublished data). Although reverse genetic dissection is difficult in this species, these flies represent a potential natural laboratory for the study of gene expression and meiotic drive. Sex chromosome drive has persisted as a stable polymorphism in <italic>T. dalmanni</italic> for many generations &#x02013; possibly for millions of years, given that it exists in the sexually dimorphic sister species in the same genus. Within such a long timescale, drive X chromosomes may have arisen once, or they might be evolving constantly through arms races between suppressors and drivers. In either case, further study of teleopsid populations and species will advance our understanding of how meiotic drive can impact gene structure and function when it is a constant evolutionary companion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Sample Collection and Determination of X<sup>SR</sup> and X<sup>ST</sup> Genotype</title><p>Testes for RNAseq were dissected from mature <italic>T. dalmanni</italic> males derived from an outbred lab population established in 1999 (cf. <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Wilkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>).

The <italic>T. dalmanni</italic> transcriptome assembly contains many genes that are represented by multiple transcripts - often, these are multiple isoforms of the same gene. After alignment with bwa, expression was quantified using RSEM to correct for hits to multiple isoforms of the same gene. Genes were defined as those transcripts derived from the same Trinity component (see trinityrnaseq.sourceforge.net), and read counts were corrected at the gene/component and isoform/seq level based on the share of reads derived from each isoform.

With the exception of the heads, each of these tissues included two biological replicates. For the heads, one sample was from females and the other was from males. These were treated as biological replicates for the analysis of expression across tissues as we were more interested in differences between tissues than between the sexes <italic>per se</italic>. Corrected read counts for each sample were obtained as described for the X<sup>SR</sup>

Normalized gene-level expression values (FPKM) were determined and expression profiles were assessed using tools provided with the trinity RNAseq package <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Grabherr1" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref> as described on trinityrnaseq.sourceforge.net, &#x0201c;Identifying Differentially Expressed Transcripts&#x0201d; (see also, <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Haas1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>). A 0.001 FDR cutoff was used to identify genes that were significantly differentially expressed between samples. The significantly differentially expressed genes were then grouped by similarity of their expression patterns using Euclidean complete clustering. Next, we used k-means clustering to define distinct expression pattern groupings from among the differentially expressed genes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004362.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We tried a range of K values (6 to 12) and assessed the number of genes and the expression profile for each cluster. We chose K&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8 for further analysis, as this number of clusters provided the maximal number of qualitatively different expression patterns. Increasing the cluster number to 9 added a cluster with different expression levels but the same expression pattern as already represented by previous clusters. In addition to the gene expression pattern analysis presented above, we also calculated a measure of tissue specificity &#x02013; Tau <xref rid="pgen.1004362-Reiner1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> &#x02013; for each gene using the average of the two FPKM values for each tissue. Genes with Tau &#x0003e;0.95 were considered to be expressed specifically in the highest expressed tissue. For all subsequent analyses using the sequence of a gene (gene prediction, orthology prediction, linkage, etc.), the highest expressed isoform (Trinity variant) of each gene was used as the representative sequence.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>RT-PCR Confirmation of Gene Expression Variation</title><p>Testes were dissected from a newly collected (August, 2012) population of <italic>T. dalmanni</italic> Gombak.

To obtain testes from drive males, we genotyped second-generation <italic>T. dalmanni</italic> males from the 2012 Gombak population using the three markers described above. A male was defined as carrying a drive haplotype if he carried an ms125 allele &#x0003c;152, an ms244 allele &#x0003e;238, and an ms395 allele &#x0003e;230. Breeding studies using the 2012 population confirm that males with these haplotypes produce drive and reveal that other drive haplotypes exist (unpublished data). To confirm standard status we phenotyped individuals for unbiased progeny sex ratios (between 0.4 and 0.6 proportion sons, 50 + progeny). RNA was extracted from pools of 3 testes pairs using the mirVana kit (Invitrogen AM1560) and first strand cDNA was synthesized using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega M1705). From the list of candidate genes, 18 (11 that were up in X<sup>ST</sup> testes and 7 that were up in X<sup>SR</sup> testes) were selected for confirmation by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). qRT-PCR was conducted on a Bio-RAD CFX real-time PCR machine using SYBR 2&#x000d7; RT-PCR mix (Invitrogen 4472942), 1 uL of cDNA template and gene specific primers. In order for a primer pair to be used, it had to have a Ct value below 32 in both replicates in at least of one of the two conditions, otherwise we discarded it from the analysis. Six genes were excluded using this criterion. A failure to detect expression in RT-PCR could be for a variety of reasons: 1) the number of testes in the pool was much smaller so if there was an expression polymorphism in the original pools it might have been missed, 2) the population sampled for qRT-PCR was 12 years separated from the lab population so differences in expression may be present, and 3) the total amount of RNA was much less. Primers were also tested on genomic DNA to ensure that failure to amplify was not due to primer failure. Expression was quantified relative to a control gene (GAPDH-2), and when all four samples showed robust expression, a t-test was performed on resulting delta Ct values between the two conditions.

Therefore, we defined an expression floor using the drive-associated genes. We identified the tissue for each drive-associated gene that had the highest expression level (the maximum expression level for that gene) and ranked genes by this value from lowest to highest. We used the lowest maximum expression level among the drive-associated transcripts (FPKM&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.86) as the expression cutoff for the control gene set.

The CGH data are accessible using accession number GSE55601 from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). First, the log<sub>2</sub> ratio of female to male expression was calculated for each probe on each of four duplicate oligonucleotide Agilent arrays containing 180K probes representing 12,000 unique genes. These values were normalized so that the maximum number of probes had a log<sub>2</sub>(f/m) ratio of 0, the expected value given the nature of the array (divergence from 0 is caused by small differences in the quality or quantity of genomic DNA from the two sexes applied to the array). The sequences for the probes (see GSE55601) were then aligned with BLAT (multiple matching allowed, perfect hit required) to the Trinity assembly, giving a set of probes matching each transcript. The median of the probe values for a given transcript was calculated for each array, and then a median and a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated across the four arrays. Calls for the linkage of each contig were as follows: 1) if the upper bound of the CI was less than &#x02212;2, the transcript was called Y-linked; 2) if the lower bound of the CI was greater than 0.5, the transcript was called X-linked; 3) if the CI was entirely between &#x02212;2 and 0.5, the transcript was called autosomal; 4) if the CI overlapped any of these bounds, or if a transcript had only a single probe or a single array informing on it, it was called U.
