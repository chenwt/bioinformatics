In the Th1-oriented memory response to influenza, we have tested the contributions of two potential mechanisms for this diversity: variable expression of cytokines by a uniform population during activation, or different stable subsets that consistently expressed subsets of the Th1 cytokine pattern. To test for short-term variability, <italic>in vitro</italic>-stimulated influenza-specific human memory CD4+ T cells were sorted according to IL-2 and IFN&#x003b3; expression, cultured briefly <italic>in vitro</italic>, and cytokine patterns measured after restimulation. Cells that were initially IFN&#x003b3;+ and either IL-2+ or IL-2- converged rapidly, containing similar proportions of IL-2-IFN&#x003b3;+ and IL-2+IFN&#x003b3;+ cells after culture and restimulation. Both phenotypes expressed Tbet, and similar patterns of mRNA. Thus variability of IL-2 expression in IFN&#x003b3;+ cells appeared to be regulated more by short-term variability than by stable differentiated subsets. In contrast, heterogeneous expression of IFN&#x003b3; in IL-2+ influenza-specific T cells appeared to be due partly to stable T cell subsets. After sorting, culture and restimulation, influenza-specific IL-2+IFN&#x003b3;- and IL-2+IFN&#x003b3;+ cells maintained significantly biased ratios of IFN&#x003b3;+ and IFN&#x003b3;- cells. IL-2+IFN&#x003b3;- cells included both Tbet<sup>lo</sup> and Tbet<sup>hi</sup> cells, and showed more mRNA expression differences with either of the IFN&#x003b3;+ populations. To test whether IL-2+IFN&#x003b3;-Tbet<sup>lo</sup> cells were Thpp cells (primed but uncommitted memory cells, predominant in responses to protein vaccines), influenza-specific IL-2+IFN&#x003b3;- and IL-2+IFN&#x003b3;+ T cells were sorted and cultured in Th1- or Th2-generating conditions. Both cell types yielded IFN&#x003b3;-secreting cells in Th1 conditions, but only IL-2+IFN&#x003b3;- cells were able to differentiate into IL-4-producing cells. Thus expression of IL-2 in the anti-influenza response may be regulated mainly by short term variability, whereas different T cell subsets, Th1 and Thpp, may contribute to variability in IFN&#x003b3; expression.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Rochester Human Immunology Center (R24AI054953) from the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases and New York Influenza Center of Excellence (HHSN266200700008C) from the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Influenza-specific human CD4 T cell memory responses are biased strongly towards Th1 cells, producing TNF&#x003b1;, IFN&#x003b3; and IL-2 on activation. IFN&#x003b3; contributes indirectly and directly to protection, inhibits the Th17 response and can cause immunopathogenesis <xref rid="pone.0095986-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, not all influenza-specific CD4 T cells express both IL-2 and IFN&#x003b3;.</p><p>Within an overall Th1 response, individual cells may express subsets of the Th1 cytokine pattern <xref rid="pone.0095986-Bucy1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. &#x0201c;Multifunctional&#x0201d; T cells produce a greater number of cytokines, and an increased proportion of multifunctional cells correlates with better protection against Leishmania major in mice <xref rid="pone.0095986-Darrah1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, slower progression of HIV infection to AIDS <xref rid="pone.0095986-Betts1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and protection by vaccines against yellow fever <xref rid="pone.0095986-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0095986-Akondy1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and vaccinia virus <xref rid="pone.0095986-Precopio1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. However, in tuberculosis <xref rid="pone.0095986-Derrick1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, multifunctional T cells correlate with increased disease.</p><p>Diverse cytokine patterns can be explained by either variable expression of Th1 cytokines by <italic>bona fide</italic> Th1 cells, or multiple T cell differentiation phenotypes, or a combination of these two possibilities. Expression of some cytokine genes appears to be regulated by a stochastic or probabilistic mechanism, for example IL-4 in a pure Th2 population <xref rid="pone.0095986-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, or IL-2 and IFN&#x003b3; in a Th1 population <xref rid="pone.0095986-Bucy1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Stochastic expression of IL-4 and IL-2 could be due to the same mechanism that causes mono-allelic expression of IL-4 <xref rid="pone.0095986-Kelly1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095986-Paixao1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and IL-2 <xref rid="pone.0095986-Hollander1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In humans, the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 are often expressed by different cells if memory cells are stimulated directly <italic>ex vivo</italic>, but are expressed simultaneously by many cells after <italic>in vitro</italic> culture <xref rid="pone.0095986-Jung1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>,(Y. Huang, and T.R. Mosmann, unpublished). Less is known about variable IL-2 and IFN&#x003b3; expression in human memory cells. The stochastic model could explain preferential multi-producer or single-producer responses, if it is assumed that different immune responses alter the <underline>probability</underline> of stochastic expression.</p><p>Variability of cytokine expression could also be explained by a combination of two or more different T cell phenotypes, in which the different cytokine patterns are expressed by cells in stable states of differentiation, such as primed T helper cell precursors (Thpp), which express IL-2 but not effector cytokines such as IL-4, IFN&#x003b3; or IL-17 <xref rid="pone.0095986-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095986-Divekar1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. These Thpp cells are uncommitted with respect to further effector cell differentiation, as single Thpp cells can differentiate into either Th1 or Th2 T cells <xref rid="pone.0095986-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0095986-Sad1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. This cell population overlaps partially with the CD4 central memory population (Tcm) although the two types are not synonymous <xref rid="pone.0095986-Weaver1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095986-Mosmann1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Human responses to protein vaccines, such as tetanus, diphtheria and HBV, are Thpp dominated. In contrast, the response to infections by influenza (and other viruses) is strongly Th1-biased <xref rid="pone.0095986-Divekar1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. This IFN&#x003b3;+ bias is particularly clear in the response to long-circulating influenza strains, whereas a new pandemic influenza strain induced a mixed influenza-specific response <xref rid="pone.0095986-Weaver1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> including both IL-2+IFN&#x003b3;- and IL-2+IFN&#x003b3;+ cells (abbreviated 2+&#x003b3;- and 2+&#x003b3;+, respectively). Similarly, the 2-&#x003b3;+ cytokine expression pattern may be due to a population of exhausted Th1 cells <xref rid="pone.0095986-Han1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0095986-Caserta1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> such as those expressing PD-1 and Tim3 <xref rid="pone.0095986-Rangachari1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095986-Nakayama1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>To distinguish the relative contributions of short-term versus pre-determined variability of Th1 cytokine expression in influenza responses, we used a combination of sorting, restimulation, evaluation of Tbet expression, RNAseq and <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation to show that both mechanisms appeared to operate in influenza-specific or polyclonally-activated human memory CD4 T cells. The 2-&#x003b3;+ and 2+&#x003b3;+ phenotypes appeared to be in short-term equilibrium, whereas 2+&#x003b3;- cells included uncommitted Thpp-like cells that were stable in the short term, but could subsequently differentiate into either IFN&#x003b3;-producing or IL-4-producing phenotypes under appropriate conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All procedures were approved by the Research Subjects Review Board at the University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York.

Tcm have better proliferation and survival ability <xref rid="pone.0095986-Sallusto2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and express the homing marker CCR7, although CCR7 is not a completely reliable marker <xref rid="pone.0095986-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095986-Unsoeld1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Alternative definitions of Tcm have focused on CD62L expression, but these Tcm populations can include cells producing IFN&#x003b3; <xref rid="pone.0095986-Zaph1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095986-Stephens1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Thus Tcm populations (defined by homing markers) probably overlap substantially but not completely with Thpp populations (defined by cytokine expression and differentiation potential). Increased proliferation potential, considered a property of Tcm cells, might provide a further link between the Tcm and Thpp phenotypes, but this was not tested (e.g. by CFSE dilution) on the Thpp cells in our studies because of the low numbers of antigen-specific cells available.</p><p>The uncommitted Thpp cells are likely not equivalent to two other precursor populations that have been described: A CXCR5+ subset of Tcm could differentiate to Th1 or Th2 cells depending on the culture conditions <xref rid="pone.0095986-Rivino1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, however, most of the 2+&#x003b3;- cells in human PBMC responses to influenza or tetanus are CXCR5- <xref rid="pone.0095986-Weaver1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Recently-described populations of CD95+ T memory stem cells (Tscm) have strong self-renewal potential and may be precursors of both Tcm and Tem <xref rid="pone.0095986-Gattinoni1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>-<xref rid="pone.0095986-Gattinoni2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. However, Tscm express high levels of CD45RA <xref rid="pone.0095986-Lugli1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, whereas Thpp cells express the same low levels of CD45RA as IFN&#x003b3;-expressing Tem cells (J. Weaver, Y. Qi and T.R. Mosmann, data not shown).</p><p>Although 2-&#x003b3;+ CD4 T cells could be terminally-differentiated, exhausted Th1 cells <xref rid="pone.0095986-Han1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0095986-Caserta1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, sorted anti-influenza 2-&#x003b3;+ cells, after restimulation, were able to express similar levels of IL-2 mRNA to the cells that were initially 2+&#x003b3;+, suggesting that the 2-&#x003b3;+ phenotype was more likely due to random expression patterns than exhausted Th1 cells.</p><p>In agreement with previous studies, our results are consistent with stochastic expression of the IL-2 and IFN&#x003b3; genes in Th1 cells. The mechanism of cytokine stochastic expression may be related to monoallelic expression, which has been reported for several cytokines including IL-1&#x003b1;, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL10, and IL-13 <xref rid="pone.0095986-Kelly1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0095986-Hollander1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095986-Bayley1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Each allele of these genes can be expressed independently in individual cells, even though the two alleles share the same levels of the components of signaling pathways and transcription factors. Allelic expression could be regulated by differential accessibility of the two alleles <xref rid="pone.0095986-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0095986-Paixao1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095986-Bayley1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095986-Mariani1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, and it may also be possible that competitive binding of positive and negative regulators provides short-term stability of active or inactive states of each allele. In either case, accessibility or competitive binding could be changed during a subsequent unstimulated period, resulting in randomized allele expression on restimulation. Future studies could test whether the variable cytokine expression in the human anti-influenza response was related to allelic expression, by analyzing influenza-specific cells for the expression of individual SNP-marked alleles of IL-2 <xref rid="pone.0095986-Matesanz1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> in subjects pre-screened for SNP heterozygosity. For example, if the probability of each IL-2 allele being expressed in a single stimulation is 0.3, then the frequency of non-producers would be 0.7&#x000d7;0.7&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.49, and the frequency of single-allele expression would be 2&#x000d7;0.3&#x000d7;0.7&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.42, assuming that monoallelic expression was responsible for partial expression of IL-2.</p><p>Variable expression may contribute to the regulation of the quantity of cytokines produced by a T cell population, which is important because cytokines induce immune activation and pathogen destruction, yet excess amounts can severely damage host tissues. In addition to regulation of cytokine production by signal strength in individual cells <xref rid="pone.0095986-Darrah1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095986-Itoh1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, the amount of cytokine could also be regulated at the population level, by controlling the number of cells that are activated to produce the cytokine. If the probability of cytokine gene expression is variable, then different proportions of the total population will activate 0, 1 or 2 alleles, contributing to a graded response of the population. This heterogeneity may provide a more graded response of cytokine quantities in different conditions <xref rid="pone.0095986-Hawkins1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, leading to more stable regulation of responses.</p><p>If communication between CD4 T cells and other cells, including DC, B cells, CD8 T cells and macrophages, operates preferentially at relatively short range <xref rid="pone.0095986-deGoerdeHerve1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0095986-Bakocevic1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref> then variable expression of cytokines by individual T cells may also increase the variability of the phenotypes of these other effector cells. For example, IL-2 drives CD8 cells toward a memory cell phenotype, whereas IFN&#x003b3; induces the CD8 cells to become effector cells <xref rid="pone.0095986-Thaventhiran1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Effector and memory cells are both essential, to provide current protection and future recall responses. CD4 T cells producing different IL-2 and IFN&#x003b3; combinations will support the differentiation of both of these two cell types. Thus variability of CD4 T cell responses may contribute to the complexity of other effector populations.</p><p>Both tetanus and influenza vaccines also induce strong antibody responses, which probably depend mainly on Tfh cells <xref rid="pone.0095986-Breitfeld1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095986-Schaerli1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref> rather than either Th1 or Thpp cells. Tfh cells are found mainly in lymphoid tissue but are rare in the circulation. Although Th1 cells can re-differentiate to Tfh-like cells <xref rid="pone.0095986-Oestreich1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, Tbet-deficient CD4 T cells have an increased ability to generate Tfh cells, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic><xref rid="pone.0095986-Nakayamada1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Thus Tbet may suppress the differentiation of Tfh cells, and the Thpp cells (lacking Tbet- expression) might have an increased ability to differentiate into the Tfh cells that drive the antibody response that is important for protection against influenza. Such Thpp-derived Tfh might express fewer effector cytokines such as IFN&#x003b3; or IL-17. The ratio between Th1, Thpp and Tfh differentiation may be regulated by the inflammatory environment during infection, but may also be affected by the individual properties of different na&#x000ef;ve CD4 T cells <xref rid="pone.0095986-Tubo1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, such as TCR affinity. In contrast to the potential of Thpp cells to contribute to Tfh populations, Th1 cells are more likely to contribute to cytotoxicity during influenza infection <xref rid="pone.0095986-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, as higher expression levels of Granzyme B were detected in IFN&#x003b3;+ cells than IFN&#x003b3;- cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095986-g002">Fig 2B</xref>) and Tbet is required for expression of cytotoxic functions <xref rid="pone.0095986-Hua1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>.</p><p>After proliferation and differentiation during an immune response, antigen-specific Thpp and Th1 cells will both be present at much higher frequencies than in the na&#x000ef;ve CD4 T cell population. Thpp cells do not express high levels of effector cytokines, but have more proliferation potential <xref rid="pone.0095986-Sallusto2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Thpp may thus be equivalent to a stem cell-like model in which uncommitted central memory cells are more useful for future expansion and subsequent responses <xref rid="pone.0095986-Fearon1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. Thpp cells also provide increased flexibility of differentiation for future responses. In contrast, Th1 effector memory cells can produce effector cytokines immediately after infection and may be more useful for acute protection. Thus optimal and long-lasting protection against influenza infection may require memory responses that have an appropriate balance of the two cell types.</p><p>Thus the cytokine patterns expressed by CD4 T cells, even in the Th1-dominated response to influenza, can be determined by a combined effect of two mechanisms, short-term variability in cytokine expression, and semi-stable subset differentiation. Although the 2+&#x003b3;- cytokine phenotype can be expressed by either Th1 or Thpp cells, the underlying differentiation state of the cell types is different, as revealed by selective expression of Tbet and other genes as well as future differentiation potential. Thus when measuring the T cell response to vaccines and infections, partial cytokine patterns have to be interpreted with caution. These results therefore have implications both for identification of the type of T cell response, and for the design of vaccines inducing the full depth of phenotypes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0095986.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>Gating strategy for human T cell sorting.</bold> Sequential manual gating was performed to identify live lymphocytes (FSC-A/SSC-A); single cells (FSC-W/FSC-H and SSC-W/SSC-H); T cells (CD14/CD56/CD19); CD4 T cells (CD4/CD8); memory cells (CD45RA lo); and activated cells (CD154/TNF&#x003b1;).
