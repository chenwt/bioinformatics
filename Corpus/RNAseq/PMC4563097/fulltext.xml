By using a system vaccinology approach based on RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis, we describe a relevant gene modulation in dendritic cells pulsed with anti-DEC-205 bacteriophages fd. RNA-Seq data analysis indicates that the bacteriophage fd virions are sensed as a pathogen by dendritic cells; they activate the danger receptors that trigger an innate immune response and thus confer a strong adjuvanticity that is needed to obtain a long-lasting adaptive immune response.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Vaccines are one of the most successful outcomes of modern medicine in improving the global health. Nevertheless, many diseases are still a challenge for vaccine development and the attempt to make new vaccines using more recent technologies has required the use of adjuvants, which enhance the magnitude and modulate the quality of the immune response.</p><p>In this context, recent failure in producing functional vaccines against emerging diseases has shown that formulating a vaccine able to induce a protective immunity should involve the innate immunity. To this purpose, adjuvants should be natural ligands or synthetic agonists for pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that are the molecules responsible of sensing microbes. Among the PRRs, toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin-like receptors, and the cytosolic NOD-like receptors sense a broad range of microbial<italic> stimuli</italic>, and the cytosolic RIG-I-like receptors sense viral nucleic acids [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>PRR activation stimulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines and type I Interferons (IFNs) that increase the host's ability to eliminate the pathogen. Thus, the incorporation of pathogen associated with molecular patterns (PAMPs) in vaccine formulations can improve and accelerate the induction of vaccine-specific responses.</p><p>The adjuvants currently licensed for human use are alum, an aluminum salt-based adjuvant, AS04, an adjuvant composed of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) adsorbed to alum, the oil-in-water emulsions, such as MF59 and AS03, and virosomes, composed of lipids and hemagglutinin [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Each of these approved adjuvant components has drawbacks: aluminium-based adjuvants determine macrophagic myofasciitis and delayed-type hypersensitivity [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], while both AS04 and MF59 have cost limitations due to the expensive process of MPL purification and the use of nonrenewable resource as shark oil (for MF59). These considerations highlight the need to develop new types of adjuvants able to interact with the innate immune system.</p><p>Here we propose the filamentous bacteriophage antigen display system as a candidate vaccine able to induce both the innate and the adaptive response. This system is based on a nonpathogenic procaryotic virus, well characterized at both structural and genetic level [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The use of bacteriophage as antigen delivery system is based on modification of the phage display technology. In particular, it is designed to express multiple copies of exogenous peptides (or polypeptides) as fusions to viral capsid proteins. Recombinant virions that carry multiple copies of exogenous sequences can be easily generated cloning a double strand DNA fragment in the phage genome. The protein used to display short antigenic peptides on the phage surface is the pVIII [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Such protein, with 2,700 copies per wild type virion, allows the display of a large number of foreign antigenic sequences. Its major limitation relies on the number of amino acids that can be displayed without disrupting the phage assembly [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The best strategy to display long exogenous polypeptides is to use the pIII protein, which allows accommodating even a whole protein on the viral surface, although in a maximum of five copies per virion [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Thus, the ability of filamentous bacteriophages to tolerate recombinant coat proteins showing short peptides (on pVIII) or bigger polypeptides (on pIII) makes this virus appealing as antigenic carrier. Indeed, it has been already demonstrated to be a powerful delivery system in numerous vaccine development studies [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>We have previously described that the filamentous bacteriophage, when engineered to express antigenic epitopes, elicits T cell help [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and triggers cytotoxic T cell-mediated response [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. More recently, we have further improved this delivery system by targeting fd particles to dendritic cells (DCs)<italic> via</italic> DEC-205, an endocytic receptor expressed mainly by dendritic cells [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. DEC-205 is a C type I lectin-like receptor with ten CRD-like domains and a cytoplasmic tail containing a membrane proximal tyrosine-based region for internalization in clathrin-coated vesicles and a distal region with an EDE amino acid triad for the targeting to late endosome and lysosome and for the recycling to cell surface. DEC-205 is able to internalise and deliver antigens to late endolysosomal compartments allowing the degradation and enhancing efficiency of antigen presentation by dendritic cells [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, it represents a promising receptor for antigen delivery in dendritic cell-targeted vaccines.</p><p>As a proof of principle, we have produced a double hybrid bacteriophage expressing the antigenic determinant OVA<sub>(257&#x02013;264)</sub> cytotoxic peptide at N-terminus of the pVIII protein and the single chain variable fragment of the NLDC145 antibody directed against the mouse DEC-205 receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We have demonstrated that this double-displaying bacteriophage induces stronger antigenic response if compared to nontargeted bacteriophage, enhancing uptake by dendritic cells and inducing DC maturation [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The double recombinant bacteriophage represents a powerful delivery system able to target specifically DCs, to promote DC maturation, and to induce specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response even if administered in the absence of adjuvants or maturation<italic> stimuli</italic>. The ability of fd bacteriophage targeted to DEC-205 (fdsc-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>DEC) to induce this strong immune response in the absence of exogenous adjuvants is due to DEC-205-mediated delivering of fd particles into endolysosomal LAMP-1+ compartments and their subsequent colocalization with the innate immune Toll like receptor TLR9 [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. TLR9, which detects CpG-rich viral DNA, is thus activated by the single-strand DNA genome rich in CpG motifs, and this activation leads to an enhanced immunogenicity of the antigenic determinants displayed on the bacteriophage coat [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Using a system vaccinology approach based on RNA-Sequencing analysis of bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) pulsed with fdsc-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>DEC, here we report new insights about the molecular mechanisms by which filamentous bacteriophage induces protective immunity. Our data reveal the ability of this valuable antigen delivery system to induce wide changes in the gene expression pattern of dendritic cells. Such modifications mostly overlap with those induced by different pathogens (bacteria, fungi, and protozoan) in the same cells. Many of the differentially expressed genes are under the control of proinflammatory cytokines and in particular of the interferon molecules. Finally, some of the upregulated genes have been recently described and proposed as biomarkers of vaccine efficacy, strengthening the relevance of our findings.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

The gene expression pattern of these cells was compared to the one of control untreated BMDCs (i.e., cells treated only with PBS). Two technical replicates for each condition were performed. Approximately 55 million reads (95% of them uniquely mapped on the reference genome) per replicate were produced. Expression values for both control and fdsc-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>DEC-treated DCs were measured as FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads). Technical replicates revealed a very highly correlation. Using RNA-Sequencing we could simultaneously measure gene expression levels of (virtually) all genes expressed in mouse DCs. Setting an arbitrary threshold (FPKM = 1) for gene expression, we found about ten thousand genes expressed at significant levels in both conditions. Then, we compared gene expression levels between the two conditions.

Our RNAseq data show that in agreement with data obtained with the live pathogens, our procaryotic virus is able to activate specific classes of genes such as the CXCL1 (growth-related oncogene 1 (GRO1)), CXCL2 (GRO2), CCL2, CCL7, and genes encoding the proinflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> (TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>) and interleukin (IL-1 <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, we also found the significant upregulation (more than 19-fold) of CXCL10 (IFN-inducible protein 10); importantly, this chemokine is essential for the generation of protective CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses and it is produced by dendritic cells following CpG-ODN stimulation [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Measuring the expression levels of the antiviral genes Oas3, Oas2, and Eif2ak2 we found that they were 18-, 16-, and 13-fold change increased, respectively, in bacteriophage-treated DCs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>).

Interferon Signature on Differentially Expressed Genes</title><p>The genes whose expression was significantly modulated after fdsc&#x02013;<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>DEC treatment in dendritic cells were analyzed using the INTERFEROME 2.0 database. The analysis revealed the presence of a clear transcriptional interferon signature. Notably, 183 genes out of 361 significantly (FDR &#x0003c; 0.0005) DEG (about 50%) are modulated by Interferon Regulated Factors (IRFs) or by the NF-kB transcription factors and possess Interferon-Stimulated Response Elements (ISREs). The Venn diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(a)</xref> illustrates how many DE genes are regulated<italic> per</italic> interferon type. In detail, 73 out of 183 genes are IFN Type-I dependent, 26 are type-II dependent, and 84 are regulated by both interferons.

In addition, we decided to assess whether genes that are affected by fdsc-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>DEC treatment in DCs have a specific transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) signature within their promoters. To this aim, using Pscan we found that most of upregulated genes have ISREs and binding sites for IRF1, IRF2, and IRF7 molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(c)</xref>). Interestingly, among them are included genes coding for cytokines and chemokines, transcriptional regulators, DNA binding proteins, proteins involved in ISGylation and ubiquitination, and proteins with a known activity in the innate anti-viral response and immune activation (details in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>It is a current opinion that vaccines should activate the innate immune system in order to start a rapid response to pathogens and sustain at the same time the development of the adaptive immune response. Thus, in order to choose the best vaccine formulations able to stimulate both innate and adaptive immune response, one of the more recent approaches is to take advantage from the analysis of gene expression using the efficient high throughput whole-genome screening. Moreover, using this approach, it is possible to have an overview of how the immune system attacks invading microorganisms, maintains tolerance, and creates a memory of past infections. Up to a decade ago this analysis was based on microarrays, but the development of RNA-Seq methodologies has opened a new era of investigations to identify genes that are differently expressed when samples are treated with different compounds. Moreover, this discovery-based research provides the opportunity to characterize both new genes with unknown functions and genes not previously known to be involved in a particular biological process [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>In this paper we take advantage from the RNA-Seq with its massive data output in order to elucidate the mechanism by which filamentous bacteriophage antigen delivery system targeting dendritic cells<italic> via</italic> the DEC-205 receptor is able to induce a strong and sustained antigen specific immune response as previously described and represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The importance of dendritic cells in initiating immune responses was the key reason for us to select this cell type as target and to investigate at a genetic level how DCs sense this procaryotic virus. DCs reside in an immature state in most tissues, where they recognize and phagocytose pathogens and other antigens. Direct contact with many pathogens leads to the maturation of DCs, which is characterized by an increase in antigen presentation, expression of costimulatory molecules, and subsequent stimulation of naive T cells in lymphoid organs [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>As a very powerful research tool, the RNA-Seq method shows as a drawback the production of impressive amount of data, and it is up to the researchers to select among them only the more reliable. To be more confident in our study, we analysed only genes with a FDR &#x0003c; 0.0005 and with a fold change in expression level &#x0003e;2; using these genes we started to dissect the gene expression changes in dendritic cells exposed to our vaccine candidate.</p><p>Following analysis using DAVID bioinformatics resources, we were able to classify DE genes in pathway categories and we found that the more transcribed genes, after DC challenge, were the ones involved in pathogen recognition for innate immunity activation: genes from the NOD-like receptor and toll-like receptor signaling pathway were upregulated, and the evocated innate immune response started the production of cytokines and chemokines and the up regulation of their receptors. In particular, we found that NOD1 and NLRP3 are upregulated more than 7-fold in DC treated with anti-DEC-205 bacteriophage fd. NOD1 is one of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs), a family of intracellular receptors that detects PAMPs and endogenous molecules; at the same family belongs NLRP3 that is involved in the formation of multiprotein complexes termed inflammasomes that mediates the caspase-1-dependent conversion of pro-IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> and pro-IL-18 to IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> and IL-18 [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Toll-like receptors belong to the family of pathogen recognition receptors that are triggered by PAMPs expressed by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa and their stimulation contributes to the induction and maintenance of innate and adaptive immune pathways as well as memory function. In our analysis we registered the upregulation of genes encoding the endosomal toll-like receptors TRL3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9.</p><p>We previously described that DCs pulsed with bacteriophage fd<italic> via</italic> anti-DEC-205 are able to produce type I IFN [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; now we found by RNA-Seq analysis that 50% of the reported DE genes are regulated by Interferon Regulated Factors (IRF) and possess Interferon-Stimulated Response Element (ISRE) as reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(c)</xref>. However, we were not able to detect the upregulation of interferon genes by RNA-Seq analysis, due to the gene organization (only one exon) and high conservation among sequences of the different genes encoding Interferon type I. Since the RNA-Seq method is unable to match the reads on the reference genome, in order to better identify the genes induced by interferon molecules, we used the INTERFEROME bioinformatics tool. From this analysis the interferon signature is evident (see the heatmap in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(c)</xref>), and it is also clear that either type I or type II is involved (see Venn diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(a)</xref>). The type I interferons signal through the interaction with the interferon alpha receptor (IFNAR). Interaction between IFN-I and IFNAR triggers signaling cascades which culminate in the transcriptional regulation of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG). One of the first pathways activated<italic> via</italic> IFN-I is the JAK-STAT pathway. STAT1 and STAT2 form dimers and enter into the nucleus to form ISGF3 transcription factor complex, which binds to IFN-stimulated response elements, driving the expression of Isg genes. In our RNA-Seq analysis in BMDC treated with anti-DEC-205 phage particles, we found upregulation of both<italic> Stat1</italic> and<italic> Stat2</italic> (10- and 13-fold, resp., by fd exposure) as well as other genes like<italic> Irf7, Isg15</italic> (confirmed also by real-time PCR, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and<italic> Rig-1</italic> genes, all of which contribute to the positive feedback regulation of the IFN pathway. Moreover, we found upregulation of transcripts of many interferon inducible and anti-viral genes like<italic> Oas, Eif2ak2, Mx1, and Mx2</italic>.</p><p>By comparing our results with the already published data on the same subject, in particular in paper describing how host cells undergo marked reprogramming of their transcriptome during infection with live pathogens, we observed a common core of the host DCs-transcriptional program.</p><p>In agreement with these data [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], we also observed the upregulated expression (more than 20-fold) of the<italic> Igs15</italic> gene. The function of Isg15 has been recently elucidated: it is ubiquitin-like protein and its activity, named ISGylation, is a modification of target protein and after modification these proteins are conjugated to Isg15. The conjugation of ISG15 to target proteins is reversible and is mediated by conjugating/deconjugating enzymes. ISG15 is conjugated to lysines on numerous target proteins through the action of specific IFN-inducible E1/E2/E3 enzymes. We show here that bacteriophage fd particle uptaken by dendritic cells induced gene expression of<italic> Isg15</italic> and both its conjugating and deconjugating enzymes. In fact, beyond the upregulation of<italic> Isg15</italic>, we found increased levels of transcripts of other factors that regulate ISG15-mediated ISGylation like HECT domain and RCC1-like domain containing protein 6 (HerC6) that represents the main ISG15 E3 ligase, essential for global ISG15 conjugation in mice [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Currently, the number of identified ISGylated proteins is increasing, and although the functional role of protein ISGylation is not yet completely understood, there are increasing bodies of evidence to suggest a role in mediating an innate antiviral response. It has been recently demonstrated [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] that the key regulators of signal transduction, such as phospholipase C<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>1, Jak1, and ERK1, are modified by ISG15, as the transcription factor STAT1, an immediate substrate of Jak1 kinase.</p><p>In summary, all our findings indicate the ability of bacteriophage fd to upregulate<italic> via</italic> DEC-205 in the targeted DCs several genes involved in triggering an innate immune response. These findings are in agreement with the already published data on the same subject, in particular in papers describing how dendritic cells undergo marked reprogramming of their transcriptome during infection with live pathogens [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5.
