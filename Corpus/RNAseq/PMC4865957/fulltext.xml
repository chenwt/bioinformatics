We used microarray probing of a closely related model species (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) to assess correlations in leaf temperature (T<sub>leaf</sub>) and leaf water potential (LWP) and abundance changes of ~10,000 transcripts in leaf tissue collected from individuals of both species. A greater number of transcripts were found to significantly change in abundance levels with T<sub>leaf</sub> and LWP in <italic>S. nutans</italic> than in <italic>A. gerardii</italic>. <italic>S. nutans</italic> also was more responsive to short-term drought recovery than <italic>A. gerardii</italic>.

The differential transcriptomic responses of the co-dominant C<sub>4</sub> grasses suggest that these species may cope with and respond to temperature and water stress at the molecular level in distinct ways, with implications for tallgrass prairie ecosystem function.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Predicted climate change includes increased average temperatures and more variable precipitation regimes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, which should result in increased water and temperature stress for many plant communities. Such chronic alterations in environmental conditions are expected to lead to phenotypic adaptations at the individual level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. For example, increased interannual variability in rainfall has been shown to select for greater morphological and physiological plasticity, which may result in evolutionary change<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Plant phenotypic responses to changing environmental conditions are achieved through the regulation of gene expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, which results in changes in metabolism and physiology. Thus, linking phenotype and gene expression could provide a more sensitive indicator of response to altered environmental conditions and stress. Furthermore, evaluating functional responses of plants at the genetic and biochemical level will increase our understanding of underlying genetic bases of responses that limit growth and survivorship, which can be related to fitness variation, selection and adaptation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.

However, genomic tools can elucidate molecular mechanisms and assess their importance in a real-world context<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Microarray profiling provides an analytical tool by which expression of thousands of genes can be studied simultaneously and has been used to monitor global gene expression in response to abiotic stresses in a number of higher plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. However, most of these studies have focused on model species for which cDNA microarrays are readily available (e.g., Arabidopsis, maize, <italic>Populus</italic>, rice, and soybean) and have imposed relatively extreme conditions over short time frames and under controlled conditions (e.g., plants grown in pots exposed to drought or seedlings experiencing short-term stress). These studies provide insights into transcriptional profile changes involved in responses to various stresses and contribute to our understanding of the function of related genes. However, it is unclear how findings from these studies apply to non-model plants in natural systems. Environmental changes in natural systems may be more subtle with stress accumulating over time (allowing for acclimation). Plants in these systems are also exposed to greater variation in environmental conditions, as well as many other factors (e.g., competition, herbivory). All of these differences may alter the magnitude of variation in gene expression observed in more controlled settings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Thus, if we are to improve our mechanistic understanding of plant responses to altered environmental conditions associated with climate change, a key step forward is to conduct genomic studies of non-model plant species under ecologically relevant field conditions.</p><p>Incorporating transcript profiling in field studies has been hampered by the lack of genomic resources available for non-model species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, although new resources are being generated at a rapid pace<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Most of the microarrays currently available for higher plants are for model and commercially important species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. While recent high-throughput genotyping tools, such as RAD-seq, negate having to sequence whole genomes, these techniques still require considerable time and/or resources (such as sequencing depth) to develop for non-model species. An alternative approach is to utilize microarrays designed for model species and apply them to closely related non-model species (i.e., heterologous or cross-species hybridization). Although shortcomings, such as loss of species-specific sequences and hybridization artifacts, do exist<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, heterologous hybridizations have been successfully used to examine the transcriptomes of non-model plant species in response to a range of environmental stresses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, including competition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. However, studies of non-model plants in natural field settings are still uncommon (but see<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>).</p><p>Here, we present results from a field study designed to comparatively assess genomic responses of two native C<sub>4</sub> grass species, <italic>Andropogon gerardii</italic> Vitman (big bluestem) and <italic>Sorghastrum nutans</italic> (L.) Nash (Indian grass), to two aspects of forecast climate change<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>: increased temperatures and increased variability in precipitation regimes. Previous studies reported that <italic>A. gerardii</italic> responded to experimentally altered precipitation regimes by down-regulating expression of genes related to photosynthesis, suggesting a productivity cost of drought stress adaptation or reduced performance due to drought stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. When plants were exposed to both increased temperatures and altered precipitation regimes, <italic>A. gerardii</italic> shifted expression levels of genes in response to thermal stress rather than to water stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. In the tallgrass prairie ecosystem, <italic>A. gerardii</italic> co-dominates with <italic>S. nutans</italic> and the two species interact to influence community and ecosystem structure and function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and responses to climate change<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Both species are found throughout central and eastern North America, although historically <italic>S. nutans</italic> tended to dominate more mesic (southern) regions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Despite close phylogenetic relatedness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, these two species fluctuate in abundance and differ in their ecophysiological responses to changes in temperature and water availability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. For example, net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance of <italic>A. gerardii</italic> was affected by increases in temperature, whereas these ecophysiological responses were more closely linked with alterations in water availability in <italic>S. nutans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Ecophysiology of <italic>S. nutans</italic> also was more sensitive to extreme climate manipulations (heat waves) in the field<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. In other words, under the same conditions, <italic>S. nutans</italic> exhibited a greater decline in ecophysiology compared to <italic>A. gerardii</italic>. Thus, these studies suggest that the two focal species presumed to be functionally similar ecologically may actually differ in important ways in their sensitivity to climate change.</p><p>As an initial step in understanding the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the differences in sensitivity observed at the ecophysiological level, we analyzed the transcriptional profiles of individuals of these co-dominant grass species exposed to both increased temperatures and altered precipitation regimes within natural field plots. Over a growing season (including a mid-July drought-recovery event), we used heterologous hybridizations with cDNA microarrays designed for a closely related model species, <italic>Zea mays</italic>, to characterize transcriptional profiles of each species in response to experimentally-induced temperature and water stress in the field. We expected that <italic>Zea mays</italic> would provide a suitable template due to conservation of stress response genes among plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. We hypothesized that transcriptional responses would be differentially up- and down-regulated for different groups of genes, such as those involved in stress response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> and photosynthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, for <italic>A. gerardii</italic> and <italic>S. nutans</italic>. We expected that absolute differences in transcripts (sensitivity) would differ in response to temperature and water stress over the course of the growing season, with <italic>A. gerardii</italic> being more sensitive to increased temperatures and <italic>S. nutans</italic> being more sensitive to increasing water stress. These findings will help reveal mechanisms by which these two co-dominant species, and ultimately tallgrass prairie communities, respond to climate stress in a natural setting.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Variation in T<sub>leaf</sub> and LWP over the growing season for <italic>A. gerardii</italic> and <italic>S. nutans</italic></title><p><italic>A. gerardii</italic> and <italic>S. nutans</italic> did not differ significantly in the response of leaf surface temperature (T<sub>leaf</sub>; F<sub>1,25</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.62, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.439) or leaf water potential (LWP; F<sub>1,26</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.74, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.198) to the warming or altered precipitation treatments over the duration of the study, although <italic>S. nutans</italic> tended to exhibit lower (more negative) LWP than <italic>A. gerardii</italic> during mid-July. In general, T<sub>leaf</sub> was lowest at the beginning of the growing season, peaked at the height of the drought (July 18), and then remained intermediate for the remainder of the growing season (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>,B). In contrast, LWP became more negative as the growing season progressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>,D), with LWP lowest in mid-July (July 18). For both species, T<sub>leaf</sub> of individual plants in warmed plots was generally 1 or 2&#x02009;&#x000b0;C higher than plants in unwarmed plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, F<sub>1,6</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8.02, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.030 for <italic>A. gerardii</italic>; F<sub>1,17</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.23, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.635 for <italic>S. nutans</italic>). But this difference in T<sub>leaf</sub> diminished as the growing season progressed and air temperatures increased later in the growing season. Compared with plants exposed to the ambient precipitation treatment (rainfall immediately applied), plants experiencing the altered precipitation treatment (50% increase in time between ambient rainfall events) tended towards lower although not significantly different LWP and higher T<sub>leaf</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>,D, F<sub>1,13</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.64, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.439 for <italic>A. gerardii</italic>; F<sub>1,40</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.49, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.486 for <italic>S. nutans</italic>). The warming treatment decreased LWP of plants consistently compared to unwarmed plants under the altered precipitation treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>,D). As a consequence, the effects of altered precipitation vs. warming treatment were likely confounded, particularly as water became limiting (e.g., July and Aug dates). During the mid-July drought, plants had lower LWP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>,D) and exhibited drought and heat stress related phenotypes (e.g. dry leaf edges, leaf rolling/folding). Application of rain on July 19 to both the ambient and altered treatments resulted in recovery of LWP on July 24 (drought-recovery), but not to levels observed in June (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>,D).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Transcript expression patterns in response to T<sub>leaf</sub>, LWP, and their interaction over the growing season</title><p>High-throughput regression analysis showed that the abundance of a subset of transcripts in leaf tissue of <italic>A. gerardii</italic> and <italic>S. nutans</italic> varied significantly with variation in T<sub>leaf</sub> and LWP and the interaction of T<sub>leaf</sub> and LWP across the sampling dates. To detect those transcripts responding separately to variation in T<sub>leaf</sub> and LWP, we first identified transcripts correlated with the interaction of T<sub>leaf</sub> and LWP and how many of these also responded to sampling date. Abundance of a small number of transcripts was significantly correlated with the interaction of T<sub>leaf</sub> and LWP, with significantly more for <italic>A. gerardii</italic> (311) than <italic>S. nutans</italic> (54; &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;185.46, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>,B).

Conversely, more than two-thirds (383 of 486) of the transcripts in <italic>S. nutans</italic> were positively correlated to variation in T<sub>leaf</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>).

By contrast, <italic>A. gerardii</italic> showed similar numbers of transcripts changing abundance (both positive and negative) with variation in T<sub>leaf</sub> and the combined variation in T<sub>leaf</sub> and LWP, with few responsive to LWP. Interestingly, sampling date had the largest effect on both <italic>A. gerardii</italic> and <italic>S. nutans</italic> transcripts. This indicates that both species modify their gene expression according to changing abiotic and biotic conditions throughout the growing season regardless of the climate change treatments. Although this is difficult to distinguish from leaf maturation and ontogeny in these plants, we tried to control for this by selecting morphologically and developmentally similar individuals (vegetative, each with 3&#x02013;5 leaves) at each sample date within each treatment. Among transcripts correlated with T<sub>leaf</sub> and LWP interaction, most of these were reduced in abundance for <italic>S. nutans</italic>, while more were increased in abundance for <italic>A. gerardii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). During the mid-season drought-recovery period, <italic>A. gerardii</italic> and <italic>S. nutans</italic> again exhibited differential responses, during which the levels of thousands of transcripts varied in <italic>S. nutans</italic>, compared to less than 50 transcripts with significantly altered levels for <italic>A. gerardii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Appendix S9</xref>), which suggests that <italic>S. nutans</italic> was more sensitive to drought conditions and responded more to alleviation from drought than <italic>A. gerardii</italic>. The finding of differential correlations of transcript responses with T<sub>leaf</sub> and LWP, both season-long and during a mid-season drought-recovery period, is consistent with previous research showing evidence for differential sensitivity of transcript responses to temperature and water availability in <italic>A. gerardii</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> and ecophysiological responses for the same individuals of <italic>A. gerardii</italic> and <italic>S. nutans</italic> sampled concurrently<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> and in other experiments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.</p><p>We also observed different patterns of up- and down-regulation, and different functional groups of transcripts were found changed in abundance in <italic>A. gerardii</italic> vs. <italic>S. nutans</italic>. Moreover, rarely was there overlap between the two species in the identity of transcripts that responded significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Appendix S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S4</xref>). Differential regulation of multiple functional groups was observed between these two species in response to the combination of higher T<sub>leaf</sub> and lower LWP (most transcripts in <italic>A. gerardii</italic> had increased transcript abundance levels vs. reduced abundance levels in <italic>S. nutans</italic>), LWP (lower LWP associated with increased transcripts abundance only in <italic>S. nutans</italic>), T<sub>leaf</sub> (higher T<sub>leaf</sub> associated with increased transcripts abundance only in <italic>S. nutans</italic>) and the drought-recovery period (increased transcript abundance associated with increased soil moisture in <italic>A. gerardii</italic>). These large differences were observed primarily in transcripts involved in different categories of processes, such as cell, glycolysis, protein, redox, RNA, signaling, stress, transport. In contrast, contrary to our expectations, we observed few responses of transcripts related to photosynthesis, and when there were significant responses, these were mostly related to variation in T<sub>leaf</sub> rather than LWP. Other studies have shown that photosynthesis-related genes can be over-represented in response to drought recovery in several plant systems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Previous research with <italic>A. gerardii</italic> found down-regulation of a number of photosynthesis-related genes to season-long drought<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. The lack of response of photosynthesis-related genes in our study may be related to the relatively subtle nature of the experimental treatments and the lack of extreme water or temperature stress during the study period.</p><p>The differential patterns of regulation, particularly with respect to those genes involved in stress responses, suggest that the two species may use different strategies when coping with and/or responding to the increasing temperatures and water stress and their combined effects in the field. Even though no differential regulation of transcripts involved in stress recognition, such as genes in ABA synthesis pathway or transcription factor cascades, were found for the two species, we detected differential regulation of genes involved in stress avoidance and those associated with damage prevention and repair. For example, transcripts encoding sucrose synthase, which is related to osmotic adjustment for stress avoidance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, were only found in increased abundance in connection to LWP in <italic>A. gerardii</italic>. Antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase, and HSPs play an important role in stress response, with antioxidant enzymes generally involved in the prevention of damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> and HSP involved in damage repair by assisting with protein folding and stabilization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. In our study, transcripts encoding antioxidant enzymes and HSPs showed a consistent increase in response to increasing T<sub>leaf</sub> in <italic>S. nutans</italic>, but not <italic>A. gerardii</italic>. The increased levels of these two groups of transcripts in response to increasing T<sub>leaf</sub> in <italic>S. nutans</italic> suggests that this grass may be experiencing damage associated with temperature stress, whereas <italic>A. gerardii</italic> may not be experiencing stress or may responding to stress in different ways, such as through acclimation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> and osmotic adjustment.</p><p>Transcript abundance levels of aquaporins also changed significantly in <italic>S. nutans</italic> but not in <italic>A. gerardii</italic> in response to the variation of T<sub>leaf</sub>, where generally there was increased abundance with the increase of T<sub>leaf</sub>. Plant aquaporins, which serve as membrane water channels to increase water permeability, is a group of proteins generally thought to be involved in stress avoidance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Aquaporins, mostly studied in Arabidopsis, have been associated with diverse abiotic stress responses, including water, nutrient, cold stress and other biotic stresses. However, the regulation of aquaporins in stress responses is inconsistent in the literature. ABA and water stress were found to increase aquaporin transcript abundance in some studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>, but decrease transcript levels in others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. As far as we know, studies of the regulation of aquaporins and their subgroups and isoforms in response to warming in plants are lacking. Regardless, the regulation of aquaporins in <italic>S. nutans</italic> but not in <italic>A. gerardii</italic> again suggests that one of the strategies for <italic>S. nutans</italic> to avoid temperature stress may be to increase expression level of aquaporins, while this was not the case for <italic>A. gerardii</italic>.</p><p>Overall, the patterns of transcript abundance levels associated with T<sub>leaf</sub> and LWP, taken together with the ecophysiological performance of both species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, suggests that <italic>S. nutans</italic> is more sensitive and responsive to increasing temperatures with the increased transcripts abundance of HSPs, aquaporins, superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase. In contrast, <italic>A. gerardii</italic> appears less sensitive to the variation in temperature and water availability experienced in this experiment. A similar pattern in transcript abundance changes was observed for the short-term drought-recovery response for both species. In <italic>S. nutans</italic>, a large number of transcripts from multiple functional groups changed in abundance, with similar numbers of transcripts increased or decreased transcript abundance, while many fewer transcripts changed in abundance for <italic>A. gerardii</italic>. We cannot conclude which species is more responsive to short-term recovery from drought because it is not clear if both species responded at the same rate. This should be verified with more detailed time-course responses of both species to recovery from drought.</p><p>Plant stress response is a temporal process in which the stress is first recognized and then different strategies are adopted to either avoid the stress or respond to the stress by preventing and/or repairing the damage. Comparison of changes in levels of specific transcripts during season-long water stress and a short-term, mid-season drought-recovery period showed that, among the 1,639 transcripts changed in abundance during the drought-recovery period and the 101 transcripts that were related to the variation of LWP for <italic>S. nutans</italic>, only 11 were common between the two. Similarly, only 10% of the genes were in common when rapidly dehydrated (~6 h) barley roots were compared to gradually dehydrated (~7 d) barley roots<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. This is partially due to different gene expression responses to acute versus chronic stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. In our study, the stress gradually increased over time and encompassed a large portion of the growing season. This may have allowed for plant acclimation, which could explain the small number of transcripts regulated over the entire growing season when compared to the large number of transcripts regulated during a short-term drought-recovery period. For <italic>S. nutans</italic>, even though thousands of transcripts changed significantly in abundance with recovery from drought, many fewer responded during the season-long variation in water availability associated with the altered precipitation and warming treatments, and very few transcripts were common to the two types of stress.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the transcriptional profiles of the co-dominant tallgrass prairie C<sub>4</sub> grass species, <italic>A. gerardii</italic> and <italic>S. nutans</italic>, exposed to variable rainfall regimes and increased temperatures under field conditions. Although our use of heterologous hybridization with maize cDNA microarrays (which was the most accessible technique available at the time of the experiment) has limitations resulting from the sequence divergence between the focal species and the model species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, we used stringent criteria to minimize these. First, during the quality control process, spots with signal to noise ratios of less than 10 were excluded from further analysis to decrease the inclusion of cross-hybridization artifacts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. As a result of these screening, approximately 70% of the transcripts with above-background detection remained for statistical analysis for both species (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Appendix S1</xref>), which suggests heterologous hybridization is feasible for analysis of transcript regulation for these two species without losing generality. Second, the microarray results of nine transcripts from each species were generally consistent with species-specific qRT-PCR results (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Appendix S10</xref>), confirming the expression changes observed with the heterologous hybridizations. Moreover, a number of significantly up- or down-regulated genes common to stress response or damage repair according to MapMan ontology were discovered in the two species responding to our imposed environmental stresses. The detection of these specific transcript changes provides confidence in the results from heterologous hybridizations. Finally, the cDNA sequences of the maize microarray SAM1.2 (18862 sequences) we used in this experiment were searched against a non-redundant transcripts data set of <italic>A. gerardii</italic> and <italic>S. nutans</italic> (unpublished data). With an E-value cutoff of &#x0003c;1E-10, ~75% and 73% of the probes had one or more hit to <italic>A. gerardii</italic> and <italic>S. nutans</italic> transcripts data set, respectively. This roughly corresponds to the percentage of the hybridized features to maize, with 75.14% and 78.60% for <italic>A. gerardii</italic> and <italic>S. nutans</italic>, respectively. The hybridization data suggests that there is likely conservation of stress response genes across these three species. RNA-seq techniques may provide further insight to gene expression changes, including transcripts conserved across species, as well as species specific transcripts. Although species-specific transcripts may provide insight into unique adaptations in these native grasses, it less likely that the annotated function of such transcripts is known.</p><p>In summary, the two focal species in this study, <italic>A. gerardii</italic> and <italic>S. nutans</italic>, co-dominate tallgrass prairie plant communities. They are close phylogenetic relatives<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> who are generally considered ecologically and functionally equivalent and similarly adapted to high heat and drought conditions. However, our study found that these grasses differ substantially in their transcriptional responses to changing environmental conditions; these differences included the number, pattern and the identity of functional groups of transcripts with significant changes in abundance in response to variation in leaf temperature and leaf water potential. In particular, transcripts related to stress response, as well as other important function groups (cell function, signaling, transport), were consistently increased in abundance in <italic>S. nutans</italic> leaf tissue in response to both decreasing water availability (e.g., LWP in the season-long stress) and increasing temperatures. Little overlap was shown between the two species in the types of genes being regulated in correlation with variation in leaf-level temperature and water content. The different sensitivities of <italic>A. gerardii</italic> and <italic>S. nutans</italic> to individual stressors, which is in line with differential sensitivities observed at the ecophysiological, whole plant and community levels (e.g.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>), imply that these two closely related species may utilize different strategies for coping with and/or responding to environmental stressors. The differential transcriptomic responses of these co-dominant species could influence individual performance (physiological and growth) and ultimately have consequences for the structure and function of the tallgrass prairie ecosystem, as the two species contribute disproportionately to ecosystem function and structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. Because this study was conducted in the field, it provides valuable insight to the mechanisms these co-dominant species use in a natural setting. We suspect that increased sensitivity by <italic>S. nutans</italic> may contribute to maladaptive plasticity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>, which could lead to greater dominance in the community by <italic>A. gerardii</italic>. It is unknown whether selection for drought-resistant genotypes had already occurred in this field experiment when individuals were sampled, though is evidence for selection of genotypes over the long term<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Regardless of whether selection occurred, we posit that both plasticity within genotypes and different responses by selected genotypes will be important for understanding these species&#x02019; responses to gradual climate change.</p><p>Given that the precipitation and warming treatments represent relatively subtle changes in temperature and water availability and that it is often difficult to distinguish effects of temperature vs. water stress, the next steps to understanding how these two grass species differ in their sensitivity to climate change are to impose more severe temperature and water stress at a range of treatment levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref> and integrate proteomic and metabolomic analyses, together with the application of next generation sequencing techniques (e.g., RNAseq). This will allow us to improve our mechanistic understanding of the effects of increasing temperature vs. water stress on responses of the co-dominant grasses, and to determine whether there are thresholds in their responses.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Site description</title><p>The study was conducted at the Rainfall Manipulation Plots (RaMPs), a long-term climate change field experiment established maintained since 1998 and located at the Konza Prairie Biological Station in northeastern Kansas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>.

The RaMPs shelters allow for the manipulation of growing season precipitation in either an ambient (rainfall immediately applied) or altered pattern (50% increase in time between ambient rainfall events).

Because the RaMPs experiment is located in an annually burned area, tillers typically emerge in early-mid April (after burning) and grow vegetatively until mid-July/August when some (but not all) individuals initiate flowering<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>. Individuals typically increase in size vegetatively from mid-Apr to mid- to late-June (unpubl. data). We did not control for plant genotype due to an interest in average species-level response, although this approach can create additional noise in transcriptional response.</p><p>We sampled a single tiller of each species within the control (unwarmed) and a randomly selected warmed subplot in paired (based on adjacency) ambient and altered RaMPs. Sampling occurred five times during the growing season in 2006: June 1, June 7, July 18, July 24 and August 22. June 1 was chosen to capture early growing season conditions when water and temperature stress are typically minimal. However, due to less than ideal conditions (lower PAR (photosynthetically active radiation)), June 7 also was chosen to capture early growing season conditions with higher light availability. The two dates in July were chosen specifically to capture a drought and recovery period; the first (July 18) when soil moisture was low and the second (July 24) five days after rainfall events were applied to both the altered and ambient precipitation treatments. Finally, August 22 was chosen to capture late growing season conditions. For each sampling date, morphologically similar vegetative (non-flowering) tillers (3&#x02013;5 fully expanded leaves) of each species were identified in each of the subplots. At each sampling date, one individual of each species was selected from each replicate plot subjected to the precipitation (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2, ambient, altered) and warming (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2, control, warmed) treatments, for n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2 species &#x000d7; 4 treatment combinations &#x000d7; 3 replicates per treatment combination&#x02009;=&#x02009;24 individuals per five sample periods, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;120 total. Because timing discrepancies may affect gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, leaf tissue was collected from individuals located in paired ambient and altered RaMPs within five minutes of each other. The first or second fully expanded leaf was randomly selected for genomic analysis from each individual to ensure leaves had finished developing but were not old enough to be senescing or have reduced cellular activity. The entire leaf was clipped and immediately flash-frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until brought to the laboratory. Immediately after collection of the first leaf, we measured leaf surface temperature (T<sub>leaf</sub>) on the remaining leaf, as part of intensive physiological measurements reported elsewhere (see Nippert <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). The whole leaf was then collected for determination of leaf water potential (LWP) using a Scholander-type pressure chamber (PMS Instruments, Inc., Corvallis, OR, USA). LWP reflects the xylem pressure required to continue the flow of water from roots to leaves, where more negative water potentials generally represent plant water stress. We focused on T<sub>leaf</sub> as an indicator of the warming treatment and temperature stress, as it is highly correlated with canopy temperature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> and was significantly elevated in response to the warming treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>,B).

The verification of RNA quality, preparation of cDNA, and subsequent steps leading to hybridization and array scanning were performed by the Keck Biotechnology Resource Facility at Yale University (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://keck.med.yale.edu/">http://keck.med.yale.edu/</ext-link>). We used maize spotted cDNA arrays (SAM 1.2, GEO platform GPL4521) produced by the Center for Plant Genomics at Iowa State University for hybridization. The arrays included 15,680 maize cDNA clones (14,118 informative) isolated from maize ear tissue. The sample pairing for microarray hybridization followed Design C of Milliken <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>, in which pairs were assigned within a level (ambient vs. altered precipitation) of the whole plot treatment and across levels (unwarmed vs. warmed) of the subplot treatment.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Quality control of heterologous hybridizations</title><p>In total, there were hybridizations for 47 leaf samples of <italic>A. gerardii</italic> and 49 leaf samples of <italic>S. nutans</italic>. Some samples had to be discarded due to low RNA quality. Array image data were collected using GenePix software (Version 6, Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and normalized using the ratio of medians. Prior to the normalization, features with obvious abnormality and saturated signal were flagged as uninformative and excluded from statistical analysis. Because the signal intensity of some spots was low as a consequence of the heterologous hybridization, stringent criteria concerning signal to noise ratios were applied during quality control of the images. Features with signal to noise ratios (for both channels, 635&#x02009;nm and 532&#x02009;nm) less than 10 were excluded from further normalization. After quality control (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Appendix S1</xref> in Supporting Information), there were 10,607 features in total for further analysis for <italic>A. gerardii</italic>, while 11,095 features were included for <italic>S. nutans</italic>, among which 10,329 were common for both species. Considering the different hybridization efficiencies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Appendix S1</xref>), we focused the following statistical analysis on only the common features of <italic>A. gerardii</italic> and <italic>S. nutans</italic>, discarding 278 unique transcripts from <italic>A. gerardii</italic> and 766 from <italic>S. nutans</italic>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Statistical analysis of microarray data</title><p>The microarray data were analyzed for each species separately using high-throughput regression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> to assess how gene expression varied among individual plants as a consequence of altered precipitation and temperatures over the entire growing season. Specifically, multiple regression analysis was used to capture the linear relationship between gene expression levels, as the dependent variable, and T<sub>leaf</sub>, LWP, together with their interaction, and date (representing the five sampling dates) as the independent variables. The inclusion of date was used to distinguish responses of the transcriptome that are due to changes in temperature or water availability from those due to sampling time. Prior to regression analysis, the microarray data were normalized following Travers <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p><p>Regression analysis was conducted for each species separately with the residuals from the normalization analysis. Data was subset so only the common hybridized features (10,329) represented by all five sampling dates were included in the regression analyses: 10,309 (99.8% of the common hybridized features) features in total for both species. Statistical significance of either positive (increased transcript abundance associated with higher T<sub>leaf</sub> or decreased transcript abundance associated with lower LWP) or negative (decreased transcript abundance associated with higher T<sub>leaf</sub> or increased transcript abundance associated with lower LWP) slopes was tested against the null hypothesis that the slope was zero. Significant differences in the number of transcripts with abundance change in response to T<sub>leaf</sub>, LWP, their interaction, and sampling date between the two species were tested by Pearson &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test.</p><p>To assess genes responding to drought vs. recovery, we subsetted the data focusing on the two sampling dates in July. Specifically, mixed-model ANOVA was used to assess alteration of transcript levels under drought conditions (July 18) vs. drought recovery (July 24). There were 8,662 and 10,776 (82% and 97% of hybridized features) transcripts analyzed for <italic>A. gerardii</italic> and <italic>S. nutans</italic> respectively, among which 7869 features were common for both species. Similarly, we focused on these common features in the drought-recovery analysis. The normalized expression data (residuals from the normalization analyses above) were used as the dependent variable, with precipitation and warming treatments, sampling date and their interactions as independent variables (fixed effects), and RaMP as random effect.</p><p>The normalization analyses, high-throughput regression analyses, mix-model ANOVA for drought recovery evaluation, and Pearson &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test were implemented in SAS (version 9.1.3). For regression analyses and mix-model ANOVA, statistical significance was further evaluated using the q-statistic to control the experiment-wise false discovery rate (FDR)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>. A q-value of less than 0.05 was chosen to identify significant changes in transcript levels. The transcripts with significant abundance changes were grouped into major functional groups using an extension of MapMan gene ontology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref> to maize using protein sequence identity to Arabidopsis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Quantitative Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR)</title><p>We used qRT-PCR to validate the microarray results for the same RNA samples used in the heterologous hybridization (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Appendix S2</xref>). Because leaf tissue of <italic>A. gerardii</italic> and <italic>S. nutans</italic> was often limited and a relatively large amount of RNA was utilized for the microarray hybridizations, RNA samples were not available for qRT-PCR analysis for all individuals or for all sampling dates. Therefore, we focused on only those sampling dates in which there were adequate samples available for a subset of individuals (June 7 and July 18 for <italic>A. gerardii</italic>, June 7 and August 22 for <italic>S. nutans</italic>). Nine annotated transcripts with significant response to variation in LWP or T<sub>leaf</sub> according to microarray analysis and which have been shown to be involved in stress response (e.g., superoxide dismutase, HSP 90) were selected and cloned (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Appendix S2</xref>). Expression levels of these transcripts were analyzed for each species with qRT-PCR, with &#x003b2;-tubulin and Elongation factor (EF) 1&#x003b1; as the internal standard for <italic>A. gerardii</italic> and <italic>S. nutans</italic>, respectively. The range of the primer amplification efficiency was between 90% and 98%, and correlation coefficiency was between 99.1% and 100.0% as determined by serial dilution of cDNA templates.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Smith, M.
